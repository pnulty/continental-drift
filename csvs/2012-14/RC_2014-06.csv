 [**Gaul**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul): [](#sfw)

&gt;__Gaul__ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin): *Gallia*) was a region of [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe) during the [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age_Europe) and [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_civilization) era, encompassing present day [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), most of [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), parts of [Northern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy), as well as the parts of the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) on the west bank of the [Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine). According to the testimony of [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar), Gaul was divided into three parts: [Gallia Celtica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Celtica), [Belgica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Belgica) and [Aquitania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquitania). Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the [La TÃ¨ne culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture), which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to [Rhaetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaetia), [Noricum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noricum), [Pannonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonia) and southwestern [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania) during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: [Gallia Cisalpina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Cisalpina) was conquered in 203 BC and [Gallia Narbonensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Narbonensis) in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded by the [Cimbri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbri) and the [Teutons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutons) after 120 BC, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his [campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars) of 58 to 51 BC.

I wouldnt be surprised if i saw some teenager who thought he was 'street' or 'ghetto' wearing shit like this to his high school prom. 

Anyways, Op. Never wear high top sneakers with a suit, im of the belief that you should never wear anything but shoes with a suit, loafers are acceptable if you can pull them off. I know some people will disagree and say you can wear certain sneakers but i think it looks childish. 

As for the check that suit has, urrrgh. Its just so garish.

The cut of the suit is a slightly older style, the big lapels are traditionally from the 40's/50's.

3.) These classes are absolutely necessary to fill in gaps in history and analysis of underrepresented cultures. Why are you bunking classes you've clearly never taken? They're informative, unbiased, and uncensored depictions of the roles and struggles of people of color in U.S. history. These are things that I *know* aren't in regular history classes.

&gt;

&gt;__Spruce beer__ is a [beverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage) flavored with the [buds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud), needles, or essence of [spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce) [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree). *Spruce beer* can refer to either [alcoholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage) or non-alcoholic beverages.

&gt;A number of flavors are associated with spruce-flavored beverages, ranging from [floral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower), [citrusy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus), and [fruity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit) to [cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola)-like flavors to [resinous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin) and [piney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine). This diversity in flavor likely comes from the choice of spruce species, the season in which the needles are harvested, and the manner of preparation.

&gt;Using evergreen needles to create beverages originated with the [Indigenous peoples of North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_North_America) who used the drink as a cure for [scurvy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy) during the winter months when fresh fruits were not available. It may also have been brewed in Scandinavia prior to European contact with the Americas, but French and British explorers were ignorant of its use as an anti-scurvy treatment when they arrived in North America. The fresh shoots of many spruces and [pines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine) are a natural source of [vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C).  European sailors adopted the practice and spread it across the world.

I'm interventionist, but only in an absolute humanitarian way, in which military force would be used exclusively to protect unarmed civilians and to protect infrastructure used to provide aide directly to the people in need. If an intervention does not go beyond this point, then I view it favourably. However, achieving this balance is often extremely difficult, and can often be undermined by events that occur during the intervention, which is why interventionism often goes wrong. 

The problem with interventionism is that it is a subversion of self-determination. The people did not ask the US to invade Iraq. They did not ask the US to invade Afghanistan. Rarely is the US asked to do anything anywhere. It will take it upon itself to do these things, often without even a United Nations mandate. This is Imperialism and this is wrong. 

Though it is not without precedent. For example, Trotsky called for continuous revolution, which would on some level involve external intervention. Cuba, the USSR and states aligned with the USSR continuously intervened in other countries. So, if we're to argue that interventionism is inherently anti-Socialist, we have to ask ourselves if states traditionally seen as Socialist or ""getting there"" were ever Socialist to start with.

So, really, it depends on where you draw the line and how feasible what you're saying actually is in the context of the situation. Let's take a current situation; Central African Republic. European Union forces are getting deployed there on an Imperialist mission, that mission being to protect French interests in the country while the violence sorts itself out. While their presence may, and often does, benefit the people on the ground suffering from militias, let's make no mistake that if there were no interests there to be protected, there would be nobody even trying to protect the people, and with that we need to keep in mind the priority; They're there to protect their interests, so logically they come first. This can involve anything between holding some assets and infrastructure to supplanting the current government with one favourable to them.

So, it is that distinction that needs to be made when we're discussing Imperialist intervention. 

Then we get to another conversation altogether, which would be when is it acceptable to intervene to protect your interests, the intensity of such an intervention, and whether or not that is always morally objectionable and always an Imperialist action.",t3_26z7zo,t3_26z7zo,socialism,t5_2qjii,

Check sauce of wikipedia, but it as follows: The book begins whereÂ Gone with the Windleft off, with Scarlett attending the funeral of her former sister-in-law and rival forÂ Ashley Wilkes' affection,Â Melanie Wilkes, at which her estranged husband,Â Rhett Butler, is not present. Scarlett, heartbroken and aggravated that Rhett left her, sets out for Tara and is saddened when she learns thatÂ Mammy, her mainstay since birth, is dying. She sends a telegram to notify Rhett about Mammy under the name of Will Benteen (her sister, Suellen's, husband), because she knows that Rhett won't come if he suspects Scarlett is there. Before Mammy dies, she makes Rhett swear to look after Scarlett. Rhett agrees, although he has no intention of honoring the request. After Mammy's death, Rhett and Scarlett fight, which culminates in Rhett leaving and Scarlett returning to the Atlanta house, determined to win Rhett back.Scarlett travels to Charleston to visit Rhett's family and tries to corner him by winning his mother's affection. She convinces Rhett to take her for a sail on the harbour, where their boat capsizes during a terrible storm. Scarlett and Rhett swim to an island, where they make love in a cave. Rhett initially denies, then admits, that he loves Scarlett, but he does not want to ""lose himself"" over her again. Back in Charleston, Rhett leaves Scarlett near death at his mother's house, telling her, in a letter, that while he admires her bravery, he will never see her again.After Scarlett regains her strength, she leaves Charleston with her two aunts, Pauline and Eulalie, to attend her maternal grandfather's birthday celebration in Savannah. She leaves a note to Rhett's mother with Rhett's sister, Rosemary, who burns the note.Scarlett connects with the Savannah O'Haras against her maternal family's wishes. Scarlett's grandfather offers Scarlett his inheritance if she remains with him in Savannah until his death and avoids contact with her father's side of the family. Scarlett refuses and storms out of the house. She goes to stay with her cousin Jamie and his family. Soon another cousin named Colum, a priest from Ireland, joins them. Scarlett agrees to travel to Ireland with him. By this time Scarlett has realized that she is pregnant with Rhett's child but she keeps her pregnancy hidden.In Ireland, Scarlett is heartily welcomed by her Irish kin. Exploring with Colum, they pass an old house called 'Ballyhara'; it was O'Hara land long ago before the English seized it. Scarlett soon receives a notification of divorce from Rhett. She makes plans to leave for America but learns that Rhett is now married to Anne Hampton, who is said to resemble Melanie Wilkes. Heartbroken, Scarlett decides to remain in Ireland. She works with lawyers and leaves her two-third share of her father's plantation, Tara, to her son Wade Hamilton (fathered by her first husband, Charles Hamilton, brother of Melanie Wilkes), buys Ballyhara and settles down in Ireland, to her Irish family's delight. She and Colum tell everyone that her husband died rather than tell the truth that she was divorced.As Ballyhara is restored, Scarlett eagerly awaits the birth of her child, praying for it to be a girl and vowing to be a good mother. She is well respected by the townspeople and her family, earning her a reputation as a hard worker. She becomes known as The O'Hara, a title reserved for the undisputed leader of a family clan.On Halloween night, her water breaks. Her housekeeper, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and the midwife whom Colum summons are unable to handle the situation, and it appears that Scarlett will die. Instead, she is saved by a wise old woman who lives near the haunted tower. The Caesarian birth is successful, but internal damage is done to Scarlett, who can no longer have children. The baby, a girl, is born with dark skin like Rhett's, but with blue eyes that slowly turn green. Scarlett names her Katie Colum O'Hara, and calls her ""Cat"" because of her green eyes.After Scarlett has settled down in Ballyhara, she runs into Rhett a number of timesâin America while she is on the boat to Boston, at a fair where she admits she still loves him, and at a hunt a week later. He still does not know he has a child. He then seeks her out at a society ball and Scarlett realizes he still loves her.Lord Fenton, one of the wealthiest men in Europe, pursues Scarlett, wanting to marry her. He wants Scarlett to bear his children after seeing Cat's fiery spirit and fearlessness. He also plans to unite their estates; he owns Adamstown, the land adjacent to Scarlett's. Angered by his arrogance, Scarlett refuses and orders him out of her house. Scarlett leaves for Dublin for her yearly visit for parties and hunts. She later decides to accept Lord Fenton when she hears that Anne is pregnant with Rhettâs second child (the first child was lost to a miscarriage).The news leaks out about her engagement and a drunken Rhett insults her when she runs into him at a horse race. A friend tells Scarlett that Anne and the baby both died, and she rushes back to Ballyhara hopeful that Rhett will come looking for her. She finds English there with a warrant to arrest Colum, who is the head of a group of Irish terrorists. Colum is murdered and Rosaleen Fitzpatrick sets fire to the English arsenal to avenge him. The villagers, thinking Scarlett is in league with the English, burn her house down. Rhett comes to her rescue and tries to convince her to escape with him, but Scarlett runs around her house yelling for her daughter. When she tells Rhett that he is Cat's father, he helps her search. After finding Cat, the three climb into a high tower on Ballyhara and stay there for the night. Rhett and Scarlett both say ""I love you"".

&gt;

&gt;Guinness stout is available in a number of variants and strengths, which include:

&gt;


&gt;* *Guinness [Draught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draught_beer)*, sold in kegs, [widget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(beer\)) cans, and bottles: 4.1 to 4.3% [alcohol by volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume) (ABV); the Extra Cold is served through a super cooler at 3.5Â°C (38.3Â°F). 

&gt;* *Guinness Original/Extra Stout*: 4.2 or 4.3% ABV in Ireland and the rest of Europe, 4.1% in Germany, 4.8% in Namibia and South Africa, 5% in the United States and Canada, and 6% in Australia and Japan. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;* *[Guinness Foreign Extra Stout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Foreign_Extra_Stout)*: 7.5% ABV version sold in Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, and the United States. The basis is an unfermented but hopped Guinness wort extract shipped from Dublin, which is added to local ingredients and fermented locally. The strength can vary, for example, it is sold at 5% ABV in China, 6.5% ABV in Jamaica and East Africa, 6.8% in Malaysia, 7.5% in the United States, and 8% ABV in Singapore.   In [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Nigeria) a proportion of [sorghum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum) is used. Foreign Extra Stout is blended with a small amount of intentionally soured beer. (Formerly it was blended with beer that soured naturally as a result of fermenting in ancient oak [tuns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel) with a *[Brettanomyces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces)* population. It is now made with pasteurized beer that has been soured bacterially. ) It was previously known as *West Indies Porter*, then *Extra Stout* and finally *Foreign Extra Stout*.  It was first made available in the UK in 1990. 

&gt;* *Guinness Special Export Stout*, Commissioned by John Martin of [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) in 1912.  The first variety of Guinness to be pasteurised, in 1930.  8% ABV.

&gt;* *Guinness Bitter*, an English-style bitter beer: 4.4% ABV.

&gt;* *Guinness Extra Smooth*, a smoother stout sold in Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria: 5.5% ABV.

&gt;* *Malta Guinness*, a non-alcoholic sweet drink, produced in Nigeria and exported to the UK, East Africa, and Malaysia.

&gt;* *Guinness Mid-Strength*, a low-alcohol stout test-marketed in [Limerick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) in March 2006  and [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin) from May 2007:  2.8% ABV.

&gt;* *Guinness Red*, brewed in exactly the same way as Guinness except that the barley is only lightly roasted so that it produces a lighter, slightly fruitier red ale; test-marketed in Britain in February 2007: 4.1% ABV. 

&gt;* *250 Anniversary Stout*, released in the U.S., Australia and Singapore on 24 April 2009;  5% ABV.

&gt;In October 2005, Guinness announced the Brewhouse Series, a limited-edition collection of draught stouts available for roughly six months each. There were three beers in the series.

&gt;


&gt;* *Brew 39* was sold in Dublin from late 2005 until early 2006. It had the same alcohol content (ABV) as Guinness Draught, used the same gas mix and settled in the same way, but had a slightly different taste. Many found it to be lighter in taste,  somewhat closer to [Beamish stout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamish_stout)  than standard Irish Guinness. 

&gt;* *Toucan Brew* was introduced in May 2006. It was named after the cartoon [toucan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan) used in many Guinness advertisements. This beer had a crisper taste with a slightly sweet aftertaste due to its triple-hopped brewing process.

&gt;* *North Star* was introduced in October 2006 and sold until into late 2007. Three million pints of North Star were sold in the latter half of 2007. 

&gt;Despite an announcement in June 2007 that the fourth Brewhouse stout would be launched in October that year,  no new beer appeared and, at the end of 2007, the Brewhouse series appeared to have been quietly cancelled.

&gt;In March 2006, Guinness introduced the ""surger"" in Britain. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] The surger is a plate-like electrical device meant for the home. It sends ultrasonic waves through a Guinness-filled pint glass to recreate the beer's ""surge and settle"" effect. The device works in conjunction with special cans of surger-ready Guinness. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Guinness tried out a primitive version of this system in 1977 in New York. The idea was abandoned until 2003, when it began testing the surger in Japanese bars, most of which are too small to accommodate traditional keg-and-tap systems. Since then, the surger has been introduced to bars in Paris. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Surgers are also in use in Australia,Singapore and Greece. The surger for the US market was announced on 14 November 2007; plans were to make the unit available to bars only.  [*dead link*]

&gt;Withdrawn Guinness variants include Guinness's Brite Lager, Guinness's Brite Ale, Guinness Light, Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout, Guinness Cream Stout, Guinness Gold, Guinness Pilsner, Guinness BreÃ³ (a slightly citrusy wheat beer), Guinness Shandy, and Guinness Special Light. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;BreÃ³ (meaning 'glow' in ancient Irish) [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] was a wheat beer; it cost around IRÂ£5 million to develop. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;For a short time in the late 1990s, Guinness produced the ""St James's Gate"" range of craft-style beers, available in a small number of Dublin pubs. The beers were: Pilsner Gold, Wicked Red Ale, Wildcat Wheat Beer and Dark Angel Lager. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;A brewing byproduct of Guinness, [Guinness Yeast Extract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Yeast_Extract) (GYE), was produced until the 1950s. In the UK, an HP Guinness Sauce has recently been made available, manufactured by [Heinz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._J._Heinz_Company).  [Kraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods) also licenses the name for its Barbecue sauce product, [Bull's-Eye Barbecue Sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull%27s-Eye_Barbecue_Sauce).

&gt;In March 2010, Guinness began test marketing [Guinness Black Lager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Black_Lager), a new black [lager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager), in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) and [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia).  As of September 2010, Guinness Black Lager is no longer readily available in Malaysia. In October 2010, Guinness began selling Foreign Extra Stout in 4 packs of bottles in the United States. 

&gt;*Guinness Red Harvest Stout* was introduced in September 2013. sold in 14.9oz [widget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(beer\)) cans: 4.1% [alcohol by volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume) (ABV); Inspired by the ancient Celtic festival of [samhain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain), the seasonal Guinness Red Harvest Stout has a mildly sweet velvety taste and deep red hue. Crafted with a blend of lightly roasted barley and sweet Irish malt.

Let's not get away from the main point. Soccer is way more competitive in America than baseball or football is anywhere in Europe.

However, I think you might find some game companies don't want to become adnetworks and deal with the overhead of that!)

From January, I coded like a slave and got a substantial prototype knocked up. But I started attending more and more conferences to build up contacts (thus I am bringing a CTO onboard to look after the 'baby').

I setup a blog and got a press pass and attended Advertising Week Europe for free. I also put an ad out to find a cofounder. A few people offered to make some introductions to some brands. Some were made because people just wanted to help because they believed we had a great idea (always flattering when that happens!)

Cambridge is also great for knowing people who know people. But to be honest, after a point, everyone knows someone. I get offers all the time of ""we know people in places"". Big deal. I'm now connected to some of the world's biggest CMOs and EMEA directors (eg. Spotify), that doesn't mean they're going to make a purchasing decision overnight.

Being in Cambridge helps though, and it's a really friendly entrepreneurial community here generally. I wouldn't have got to meet the former Jagex VP of Biz Dev if it wasn't for my accelerator, Accelerate Cambridge. However, they can only show you the door - you have to walk through.

So though it helps to know the right people, you still have to put the effort in, do your background research on people you meet, furiously take notes, ask if they can help in other ways. But really, network, network, network. Hope that answers your questions!

EDIT: What does help though, is having a pool of key contacts. I find that it is better to befriend (genuinely) people who aren't quite high up. Not only do they think the world of you for taking them seriously, and taking the time to engage with them, they might even pitch your service for you as I found in a few cases. Get some cheerleaders... And to answer your question, no we don't have any paying customers yet (but we're so damn close) - it's a two-sided market deal - it's hard to pull-off, but luckily got one side sorted, we just need the brand to agree to the pricing and we're good to go!",t3_26z0bs,t1_chw2n6c,Entrepreneur,t5_2qldo,

From wikipedia:

&gt;~~One unique prediction of string theory is the existence of string harmonics. At sufficiently high energies, the string-like nature of particles would become obvious. There should be heavier copies of all particles, corresponding to higher vibrational harmonics of the string. It is not clear how high these energies are. In most conventional string models, they would be close to the Planck energy, which is 10^14 times higher than the energies accessible in the newest particle accelerator, the LHC, making this prediction impossible to test with any particle accelerator in the near future~~

IGNORE THAT SHIT

From http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/Projects/moderncosmo/John's%20string%20theory.html

&gt;In principle, an extremely powerful particle accelerator could test string theory, but such a machine would have to be a million billion times more powerful than the Superconducting Super Collider that was to be built in Texas before Congress killed its funding.  A new accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, being built in Europe, may offer some means of testing string theory, but not for several years.  String theory predicts that the electroweak force, the strong force, and gravity have the same strength at 10^19 GeV, so the accelerator would have to be very powerful, to say the least.  Even so, a direct testing of string theory seems impossible and this has led many scientists to claim that string theory is mere speculation and does not deserve the lofty term theory.  For all the conceptual revolutions in string theory, many physicists maintain that there is little to show but a lot of beautiful mathematics.

Did shitty math I probably messed up. According to my math, you'd need 769230769000000 times more energy than the amount that the LHC uses to confirm/deny string theory. I'm sure I *royally* fucked up somewhere, though. Go do the math for yourself if you think mine was too shitty.

As to scenarios where bitcoin goes to zero, there are a couple possibilities I can think of offhand, which are very disturbing to me as someone who has invested in it.

1. A simply better product comes along.  The bitcoin development team could probably be bested by some other group who don't want to cooperate (they'd rather get ridiculously wealthy), works harder, and offers a better technology free to the world.  There are always smarter, harder working people out there who are able to innovate.  If Bitcoin 2.0 comes along and the current bitcoin developers can't keep up, they will eventually lose.  I know we're not dealing with companies' products but open technologies, but Bitcoin could be Lotus 123 and Microsoft Excel could come along and make BTC irrelevant.  This scenario is common in the the computer technology world and very realistic. 

2. A government or organization on the scale of the US or the EU with enough resources could criminalize it and then 51% attack it until it's dead/unusable.  It would be very expensive, but possible, and there is nothing anyone could do without huge changes to the underlying protocol.  They could pretty easily set bitcoin back many years or simply force customers into a different coin technology.  Either way our current BTC is useless.  This scenario may happen as government realizes the scale of tax evasion possible with bitcoin.

Like I said, it's very uncomfortable for me to make these comparisons at all. However, you're completely misinterpreting what I said. I am not saying the ACW was Waterloo. I'm saying that what we call Napoleonic Era Warfare does not have a distinct and dated end. It is much more muddied than ""this battle happened and this style of warfare ended."" It would continue on in many forms with many advancements in technology for over a hundred years after Waterloo.

My point wasn't that the ACW was Waterloo but rather in regards to when battles ""like"" Waterloo, with tens of thousands of men with matchlock and flintlock muzzle loaded rifles using shock based line infantry tactics and heavy emphasis on infantry supporting, maneuverable artillery with a strong cavalry presence as a legitimate wing of the army, the ACW is the latest ""pure"" example of this.

Don't get it twisted though. What was done at Waterloo and what was done in the ACW were two separate things -- especially because of the differences of American and European warfare. However if we're talking trends and when ""Napoleonic Warfare"" ended it can be said that, to an extent, the ACW was the last best ""pure"" example of that era of warfare existing on a battlefield with most of the elements we would be familiar with in Waterloo existing in some similar form technologically.

Now that's again problematic and I hope I made a good job reinforcing that. This entire period of warfare is honestly problematic because it's so vague and so muddy to get a pin down on. Like men would lay down prone with their rifles and take cover and fire from windows at Sedan and act as independent, smaller groups but there were aspects to that battle -- particularly in the cavalry -- that were thoroughly Napoleonic-like and those trends would remain as such for decades to come.",t3_26yvl4,t1_chw475e,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,

Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde was arrested in Southern Sweden on Saturday, Reuters reported. Sunde was convicted of aiding copyright infringement in 2009 and was sentenced to a year in prison, plus a fine. That year of jail time was reduced to eight months, but in 2012 Sunde failed to appear at the Swedish prison where he was to be incarcerated, and he has been wanted by Interpol ever since.

Sunde, who was arrested in the Swedish county of Skane, had been living in Berlin when Ars caught up with him a month ago. He had recently launched a campaign to represent Finland as a member of the European Parliament, and he seemed fairly confident that he would not be taken into custody. As Ars reported in May:

------

âIn a Skype text chat with Ars, Sunde said that his standing conviction in Sweden isnât a barrier to his running for office, nor has it been a barrier for his ability to live and travel throughout Europe.

âWell, I have multiple appeals in and few people looking for me,â he said. âAs in, there's no need for me to be in Sweden, and basically no one wants me to go to prison. So no one looks for me outside of Sweden.

âIt's quite easy to cross borders in Europe without any controls. And the Nordic Union, don't forgetâthe Nordic countries has been passport-free since ages before Schengen,â Sunde added. He was referring to the Schengen Agreement, which has effectively eliminated internal passport control within Europe.

Sunde said that he wasnât sure if there was a warrant out for his arrest in Sweden.

âNo idea,â he said. âProbably? Well, besides not being a hard criminal, nor being in Sweden, I also have no â¬10 million ($13.8 million) to give anyone.â

------


It is unclear why Sunde was in Sweden at the time of his arrest, and Swedish officials have not provided further details.

Sunde and three other Pirate Bay principles who were also found guilty of violating copyright law had put in multiple appeals over the last several years to try to overturn the convictions, largely without success (one of the earlier convictions reduced the Pirate Bay co-founders' prison sentences, but increased the fines they'd have to pay). The Swedish Supreme Court declined to hear Sunde's appeal in February 2012, so the Pirate Bay leaders took their case to the European Court of Human Rights, which then dismissed their case unanimously as âinadmissable.â

One of the other Pirate Bay co-founders, Gottfrid âanakataâ Svartholm Warg, was apprehended in Cambodia in late 2012 and remains in Swedish custody. In June 2013 he was also charged with hacking and fraud and sentenced to two years in prison. Fredrik âtiamoâ Neij, another co-founder, has not yet served time and appears to still live in Laos with his wife.",t3_2700jx,t3_2700jx,Bitcoin,t5_2s3qj,

The emergency transport back to earth is a Russian Soyuz or two. All ISS guests have to learn Russian because Russia is in charge of getting people to and from the ISS.

It won't happen, but Russia could just shut off the non-Russian sections and everyone would be fucked, except the Russians. 

So what I'm getting at is that Roscosmos (Russian equivalent of NASA) would be likely equally or more involved. Everything becomes a *lot* less fun and games when you realize that the Russians might bring you back to Moscow for... things. Even if you are a US citizen, the whole teleporting to the ISS and ending up in the Russian section might not be as fun. They have guns in the Soyuz (for when they land and have to fight off bears/people). 

Again, maybe it would be all fun and you'd end up next to an American and stuff, but maybe you'd end up next to Maxim and get in trouble. Russia would be in charge of bringing you back. Maybe NASA would pay ($60 million?) to have you returned to the US, but if you're a citizen of a country which that isn't a realistic option... yeah, might not have too much fun up there.",t3_26zhip,t1_chvykfn,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,

The ACW is considered the first true ""modern war"" with sustained operations on a continental scale rather than individual armies marching, to one or a couple of pitched battles ending the campaign. Nothing in the Napoleonic era, comes close to the brutal sustained attrition of weeks and weeks on the Overland Campaign, with more reinforcements and resupply being constantly fed in by railroads, leading directly to operations around Richmond and Petersburg. Battles were sustained by rail and water transport  that was non-existent in the Napoleonic era. Nothing really approached that scale in European warfare until 1914.

Historically, Jews had evolved mostly from the [Tribe of Judah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_of_Judah) and [Simeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_of_Simeon), and partially from the Israelite tribes of [Binyamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_of_Benjamin) and [Levi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_of_Levi), who had all together formed the ancient [Kingdom of Judah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah) (alongside the remnants of the [Northern Kingdom of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Kingdom_of_Israel) who migrated to their Southern counterpart and assimilated there).  A closely related group is the [Samaritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans), who claim descent from the Israelite tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, while according to the Bible their origin is in the people brought to Israel by the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire) and some Cohanim (Jewish priests) who taught them how to worship the ""native God"".  The [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions) [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group), [nationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality) and [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) are strongly interrelated, as [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism) is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation.    [Converts to Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_to_Judaism) have a status within the Jewish ethnos equal to those born into it.  Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and is considered a tough task, mainly applicable for cases of mixed marriages. 

&gt;The modern [State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) was established as a Jewish nation-state and defines itself as such in its [Basic Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel). Its [Law of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return) grants the right of citizenship to any Jew who requests it.  Israel is the only country where Jews are a majority of the population. Jews had also enjoyed political independence twice before in [ancient history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history). The first of these periods lasted from 1350  to 586 BCE, and encompassed the periods of the [Judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judges), the [United Monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy\)), and the Divided Monarchy of the Kingdoms of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria\)) and [Judah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah), ending with the destruction of [the First Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple). The second was the period of the [Hasmonean Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty) spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under Herodians from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora).  As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced [persecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews) throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.

&gt;The world [Jewish population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population) reached a peak of 16.7 million prior to [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II),  but 6 million Jews were killed in [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust). Since then the population has risen again, and as of 2010 [update] was estimated at 13.4 million by the North American Jewish Data Bank,  or less than 0.2% of the total world population (roughly one in every 514 people).  According to this report, about 43% of all Jews reside in [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) (6 million), and 39% in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) (5.3â6.8 million), with most of the remainder living in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) (1.5 million) and [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) (0.4 million).  These numbers include all those who self-identified as Jews in a socio-demographic study or were identified so by a respondent in the same household.  The exact world Jewish population, however, is difficult to measure. In addition to issues with census methodology, there are *[halakhic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha)* disputes regarding [who is a Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F) and secular, political, and ancestral identification factors that may affect the figure considerably.

It's been a while since I read up on it, but generally the Romans would pretty much just Romanise the names they were generally known as. For the tribes in Europe and closer to Rome, there would obviously be Latin-speaking Celts who could translate and give an idea of what they were called, but in Britain and Ireland, there would have been less contact and fewer Latin-speakers, so it's likely the Roman historians would have gone more on their own descriptions and what more familiar tribes referred to them as. 

The Picts, for example, we don't know they called themselves. It's generally accepted it's a Greek denonym for 'pictus' or, 'painted' people, as they decorated their bodies, and this backed up by the names they were called by other Celtic tribes (Picti/Fichti in P-Celtic languages, Chrithni in Q-Celtic languages, as Celtic tongues evolved different pronunciations as they moved away from Romantic influences).

In other cases, like the Britons, it was more straightforward. There is evidence that the various Britonic tribes self-identified using that root and the Romans probably took their cue from that, rather than vice versa. ",t3_27032t,t1_chw4g9v,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,

Once you put the Federal system on the hook it's much more dangerous as they actually can print their own money.

Ahh okay, I'm sorry, tbh I wasn't sure what you meant at first but that makes it clear. I agree that going into a federal exchange is a foolish move. I cannot fathom why so many Republican states went into the federal exchange instead of creating one for their state like Kentucky did. 

&gt;States doing what is necessary for the needs of that particular state is a much better way to go. Compartmentalization insulates the nation from bad ideas and policies.

Agreed. 

&gt;Personally, I don't feel that we are anywhere near the point that we need to socialize our medical system. Not when there is SO much more we can do to streamline and cut off the fat from the system.

I don't think we're at the point where we could sustain a truly socialized healthcare system. We may never be. Smaller states like Sweden and the other European nations have smaller populations. It's logistically easier. It's a dangerous experiment - it could have fantastic payoffs IF it took here, but I don't know if it could. Probably not, to be honest.

&gt;The problem is that we've made healthcare this sacred cow in politics. And you can't trim the fat off, or exercise the cow...........the only thing you can do is give it more food. Which is what the politicians believe is the only option. And it's wrong. And we're going to be the ones that pay. Not them.

You may call all that stuff you list: ""game knowledge"", but i call it ""bias"". You seem to ignore basic gaps in your ""logic"", so i'll point them out.

* No mata gating. Despite this, everything feels very balanced.

Can't tell whether than means ""mana"" or ""meta"". I'm gonna assume ""mana"", because you mention meta elsewhere. Mana gating isn't a bad thing inherently. It's a limiter, so the lane doesn't become a mindless spamfest where casting spells doesn't have any drawbacks besides wasting the cooldown. Listing that the abilities have no cost attached to them as a positive, makes for a very bad start for your case.

* Itemization is very very different, there's go almost no similarities.

Mostly passive auras, no active items whatsoever(admittedly, League has a few), direct ports of sunfire cape/aegis/hexdrinker etc. that got removed, to your credit and mostly stat acquisition. I'm sorry, but the above describes both games equally. Few, if any dawngate items feel ""unique"", instead of rejected LoL ideas.

* The community is so sweet, they all listen, and genuinely want to help the game grow.

Really? Besides the fact that this is anecdotal evidence etc. DG community is miniscule. LoL/Dota2 have ""toxic"" communities because they're larger in scale and size brings assholes. If DG ever becomes big, you'll notice this as well.

* There are different objectives, like Spirit Wells, Parasite and Cores. I can't really compare them to much. Spirit Wells in a way function like Twisted Treeline's ""altars"", but not really.

Uh, might wanna check my previous post. 

&gt; spirit wells are the equivalent of TT altars and Parasite is Vilemaw

Just because they have different names, doesn't mean that they're unique. Spirit wells offer increased income. Altars offer increased income. Where's the ""not really"" part, again?

* There's no set meta, they don't shape in any way.

&gt;There's no set meta, because the game isn't developed enough

Once(and again *if*) DG grows, a meta will grow. 

* Supports are done amazingly, a lot of them transition well into tanks or carries, better than S4 LoL's.

So, you're trying to prove that DG is unique by mentioning **once again** that ""They do it like LoL, only better!"". That sounds more like a shitty ad and not like an argument.

* End game rewards are based on points, and you can even get ""champs"" (aka Shapers) from a divine roll. I got two, two days in a row. It's nice to not have to grind for 'em.

You forgot to mention that divine rolls are the luckiest ones you can get. In reality, for the average joe, the grinding is the same as LoL, with a smaller champ pool. The business model is exactly the same as well.

* Free weeks are handled with more champs, they're in two week rotations, two weeks per 6. (so the 12 doesnt reset on the same day)

That's because the shaper selection is extremely limited, it would be stupid to have LoL's model when they started doing it, because most of the pool would be available and that kinda beats the purpose of a ""free rotation"".

* Servers will be handled like Dota 2, you queue into regions.

So, it's appropriate that the EU server is handled like LoL. Aka, not at all.

* The community, the community, the community. It's much nicer, much more lax, I just can't stress this enough.

And i can't stress enough that this is only because DG isn't a big game. Plus, it has its own share of assholes.

* Snowballing exists in a balanced state.

Nobody discussed whether or not the game is balanced. That's an entirely different topic. This is about whether or not it is unique enough. 

* All the shapers feel so fun, so creative. They all reward you so well.

Copy-paste, replace ""shapers"" with ""champions"". You have LoL. Try again. Can't see how the Lee Sin, Lulu, Malzahar copies can feel ""creative"".

* They actively reward you.

That doesn't really make any sense, you're repeating yourself at this point.

* They have different ""announcers"".

So does Dota2 or HoN. It's not really a unique achievement, they just made a better client than LoL and had the foresight to include that kind of cosmetic line. Also, their announcers aren't really exceptional, to be honest.

* There are different roles you pick, Hunter, Predator, etc, that go based on what your goals are per game.

So does LoL, without the formal selection screen, what's your point? If it is that ""the game is basically LoL"", you're doing great. Your argument is that DG is different because they took the concept and solidified it? That's going anything against the whole ""meta"" shit you were saying before and the ""uniqueness"" you're propagating. Get it together.

* You get free ""runes"" for winning (and losing) games, good ones too.

RNG. Still a lot of grind to get a good set of mixing and matching runes.

* The actives are so creative and well done. I LOVE IT SO MUCH AHHHH xD

Which actives? Item actives? There are none. ~~Summoner~~ spells? LoL did it, **again**. It even has the same ones, like flash, exhaust, ghost, smite, barrier, cleanse, surge and a zhonya's knockoff(because, as said, active items don't exist). You're practically fanboying it, at this point, if you don't see the facts i'm presenting.

* The devs actively talk to us. More than Riot does. They don't tell us ""Soon"" and hold things away from us.

So do Riot devs. That's not really a good thing by itself, since their ""dev talk"" is mostly a showcase of what they'll introduce. It gives the illusion of ""communication"", but it's really nothing significant.

1) (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Learmonth)

Learmonth is designated an emergency alternative airport in the case of fog or bad weather affecting Perth Airport.

2) (from)
http://www.defence.gov.au/oscdf/adf-posture-review/submissions/Exmouth%20Shire%20Submission%20ADF%20Posture%20Review.pdf

The geo-strategic advantages of Exmouthâs position were primary drivers of its use for military purposes in the past. During the Second World War, Exmouth was used, under Operation Potshot, as a forward base for United States submarines. Exmouth was also the mainland jumping-off point for military and Qantas flights across the Indian Ocean to Sri Lanka and thence to the Middle East and Europe. Exmouth was, in addition, a major RAAF fighter and long-range surveillance aircraft base and also a radar and communications site.

RAAF Base Learmonth is a joint military/civil facility located 34km south of the town. This airfield has an asphalt/concrete main runway 3,047 metres long together with associated taxiways and aircraft hardstands.

Another important Defence installation at Exmouth is the Harold E Holt very low frequency and high frequency communications station. The primary role of this facility is to relay signals to Australian and allied submarines and other Naval vessels that are operating in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific regions.

Adjacent to the Harold E Holt facility in Exmouth Gulf is a large deep water Navy fuel wharf. This wharf is designed to handle fuel transfers from large ships and also to handle modest quantities of general purpose cargo.

http://nautilus.org/publications/books/australian-forces-abroad/defence-facilities/naval-communication-station-harold-e-holt-north-west-cape/#ixzz33GbTpAsX

In 1997 Australia took over responsibility for the facility, although US involvement and funding continued. After December 2002, operation of the station passed to the Defence Materiel organisationâs Electronic and Weapons System Division together with contractors from Boeing Australia Ltd.

I moved to Europe the summer after 9th grade. The following summer my parents offered to pay for me to fly back to the US and go to EFY with my boyfriend. Yes... we were not 16 yet, but my parents were converts and his parents were cool with it. So I flew all the way from Germany to go to Europe, went to EFY with this guy (who I'd spent my entire allowance calling with phone cards all year). Some how we end up in the same group, despite being different years. The one mixed age group, go figure. Then he spends the whole time avoiding me, and I'm all ""this is weird, but it's okay, I know you have friends here"". Then the first dance comes around, we're dancing and he says ""I don't think I like you any more.""

Because saying that before a flew across the ocean would've been too hard.

Then he spent the entire time with the girl he'd met at the previous year's EFY, that he'd apparently been dating while I was away. 

To say I was heart broken is an understatement. So I spent the entire time bawling my eyes out and wishing I'd never gone.

To round it out, for the curious, I didn't date again until I got to college, only RMs, and when that failed me (because none of them were interesting or kind people), I applied to move to BYU, got accepted, went home to the northeast part of the country to pack my stuff and move to Utah... then I got engaged to my best friend from high school, we got married, left the church, and I've never been happier. Celebrating five years this summer and I can't help but think that being brokenhearted helped me to build a better relationship with my current husband, instead of dating around in HS.

I don't have time to write a response to the video game one this moment, but I can probably do that tomorrow afternoon after I get home from work.

&gt; Does it? We've had social reform several times throughout history. Thinking the way society is organized is wrong is what lead to the abolition of slavery. It's what lead to women being able to own property, being able to vote, being able to file for divorce, being able to open a bank account without their husband's permission etc.

Hmm, I'm not sure I agree that these are examples of thinking society is inherently flawed and rebuilding it. All of this was post-Enlightenment, and was essentially an extension of Enlightenment ideals. One of the major focuses of the Enlightenment was equality - among white men mostly, of course - so it was only a matter of time before this philosophy became the transcendent ""equality of people"".

And I agree that this is what most feminists are trying to achieve, and it's a wholly admirable and honorable cause that everybody regardless of gender should support. But what the more extreme among you want is hardly an extension of equality - considering the entire system flawed and insisting that it needs to be rebuilt is closer to ""revolutionary"".

Now, the only positive revolution in history I can think of was the French Revolution because it was the incident that allowed ideas of the Enlightenment such as liberal democracy and of course equality to prosper. Every non-liberal democratic revolution (and I'm using ""revolution"" to refer to any abolishment of the active government system in whatever state it affected) to occur after that had profoundly negative results - for example, the Bolshevik Red Revolution of Russia, the rise of Fascism in Italy, and Hitler's power grab in Germany caused almost innumerable deaths. As for the French Revolution, well it might have led to the death of absolutist monarchies, but it still caused widespread death, especially when the Napoleonic Wars are taken into account.

Am I implying that the extreme feminists who wish to abolish society and rebuild it without gender issues threaten anything even remotely similar to this? Of course not. But it's a dangerous mindset with dangerous results. I'm very interested in the study of history, especially Russian history and 20th century Europe, and one thing I've learned is that revolutionaries are frightening people. The sort of mindset that says that society is flawed and needs to be rebuilt according to a specific ideology is quite often all-consuming and damaging. Although I'd like to believe that the most radical and extreme feminists are after the same goal and are therefore furthering the cause, I find it hard to accept their revolutionary and the mindset which I've observed to historically come with it. Also, I don't only feel this way about extreme feminism, but any ideological notion that current society is broken and unfixable is off-putting in an identical manner.

(sorry for the rant, I tend to go a bit overboard when discussing European history)

&gt; But the sentiment is one I definitely understand. Sexism is encoded and ingrained in our society.

I agree with you, but personally I think that this problem does not render society utterly corrupt, and that it can be dealt with from within the confines of society. I'm not saying that there aren't major issues, but issues so bad that society must crumble for them to be fixed? Not so much.

&gt; The only problem it creates is people using it as ammo to decry feminism itself as an unreasonable, extremist idea. In a way they wouldn't do with other groups.

I agree to an extent. Yes, people do tend to use the ignorant or hateful feminists against feminism as a whole, and yes that seems to be more prevalent than in other groups. But at the same time, it's arguably socially acceptable in most situations to identify as a feminist, while other ideologies don't share that same freedom, especially in the US. For example, if you tell people you're a communist in America, from what I understand you'll get incredibly hateful responses almost universally (although I should mention it doesn't get that reaction in Canada) because of the remnants of a Cold-War mentality. I mean, even ""socialist"" is used in politics to paint opponents negatively because of the knee-jerk reaction it causes. Similarly, being an atheist in the southern states is met with hostility. With feminism, you might have some men responding with disdain, but it's a minority, and women will almost always support it even if they aren't themselves identifying as feminists. So sure, those against feminism will use it as ammo, but as a whole the movement is much more accepted and less opposed than many other ideologies.

&gt; That's what they say, but many of them just don't like feminism. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of legit issues they bring up, but it's mired in the ""response"" tactic of being extremist toward extremism that isn't even as prevalent as they like to think it is.

Agreed. There's not much more I can add.

&gt; That doesn't now mean feminism itself isn't open to criticism just because one group of people who identify as feminists have taken this action.

No I get that, they were just an example from the top of my head. But again, I'm under the impression that Feminism is an ideology that generally frowns upon self-criticism. Although I admit that I could be wrong because I myself am not associated with the movement. In your personal experiences, would you say that feminism is as open to self-criticism as any other ideology? I'm genuinely curious, and this part isn't really for the sake of argument, I just want to hear what you have to say on the matter.

&gt; As uncomfortable as it is to say... that's not unusual with men. They don't see alot of what women face. And the female perspective is often dismissed and written off as ""crazy feminism"" if it's too loud.

I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I personally think my... ah, ignorance to women's issues was more the product of where I was raised. When I talk to women about feminism, most of them tell me that they don't see much sexism in our society, except in the media. Now, this is important because, since we're so close to the border, we import like 90% of our television and movies and advertisements from the US. I've noticed that Canadian shows and movies generally don't have sexist undertones even when they're painfully apparent in US movies. I contend that my previous distaste for feminism and disagreement with feminist arguments stem from my upbringing more than my gender, as it seems that women in Canada notice sexism just as rarely as I did, because Canada isn't a very sexist place.

&gt; patriarchy means the claim is there is some secret cabal of mustache-twirling evil men dreaming up ways to oppress women.

I laughed. I just imagined a room full of older English gentlemen sipping Scotch, and one asks, ""What are we going to do today, chairman?"" And the chairman turns and says, ""Same thing we do everyday, Peterson. Try to oppress the whole world!"" For the purpose of clarity obviously I know what the actual patriarchy refers to.

&gt; Since we're both atheists consider it this way: ""You're an atheist huh? So what caused the big bang!? Something can't just come from nothing! How do you explain that!?"" Sure you've heard it before.

At that point I'd send them a video of NDT arguing about the ""God of the Gaps"", but I suppose the question was meant to illustrate a point about the nature of my earlier tactic.

Well, I'd like to clarify a bit more about that one. The problem with internet debating is that you have to wait in between responses, and you lose track of your thoughts and arguments. So what ends up happening is you've got a hodgepodge of ideas that are essentially unfinished because you were waiting for a response, and you can't remember exactly where you were going with it but you argue the point regardless, perhaps going in an entirely different direction than you originally meant to, and things get blurrier and blurrier until you're doing something ridiculous like arguing about the definition of ""first"" or trying to imply that feminists think that men can't be raped... In a personal debate, things couldn't get that far because you'd collect your thoughts and notice when things are going off track, but unless you've got an incredible memory or are obsessive enough to write down notes between replies to guide you, things go a little out of whack when internet arguing. I mean, look at our conversation - we went from arguing about the concept of feminist gamers to a debate about your personal feminism and then feminism as a whole and radical feminism along with a whole separate discussion of video games starting with feminist game developers before moving on to Nintendo and Bioware and Mario and Metroid and sexism and then back to feminist gaming again. Internet debating is fraught with this kind of unfocused trajectory and it makes me simultaneously hate it for what it does to the argument and love it for the unique conversations that it creates.",t3_26c4e4,t1_chutheg,TumblrInAction,t5_2vizz,

The flagship stand has been in continuous operation since 1937 and sits across from the Harpa Concert Hall. There are also three additional locations in the city. 

&gt;It is believed that a majority of Icelanders have eaten at BÃ¦jarins beztu. Foreign visitors are often brought to the original stand by locals eager to have them try the hot dogs, which are often called ""The Icelandic National Food."" Among all the famous people who have dined at BÃ¦jarins beztu include: [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton),  former president of the United States, [James Hetfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hetfield), vocalist for the heavy metal band [Metallica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica), and actor [Charlie Sheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen).

&gt;The original stand also appeared in the first season of [Anthony Bourdain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain)'s travel program *[No Reservations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain:_No_Reservations)*. In August of 2006, the British newspaper *[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian)* also selected BÃ¦jarins beztu as the best hot dog stand in Europe.

Still, I saw it as a kid before The Motion Picture was released, and I saw TMP in the theater when it came out. 

I remember the first season of TNG as having been disappointing. I saw the premiere and sporadically watched episodes across the season. But I didn't take time to schedule my life around it. It wasn't until the fourth or fifth season that the show became a popular phenomena with widespread cultural adoption. I'd watched it on and off and saw it get better. By then I was watching it regularly. At the show close, I remember the show having national public penetration. Just about everyone I knew watched the season 7 finale, most of whom weren't SF or former Trek fans. 

I give Abrams credit for knowing his audience. He's got a couple hundred million dollars to blow with each film and they have to make ROI. A pure fan service film simply wouldn't meet that goal. He knows it, and so do producers at Paramount. The films don't have a multiyear 24 to 26 episode per season opportunity to slowburn their way into cultural acceptance. They must make a big splash. Abrams does this. Effectively.

I think what's more interesting is that he's successfully shown that fast pacing beats plot coherence. A film that relies on heavy marketing to sell to the single viewing public _doesn't_ need to make sense. No one will remember it anyway. It's only those who want repeat viewings and treat the work as serious film who might complain. And those people don't buy enough tickets, in contrast to the general public, to change this dynamic.

That's why we keep seeing more _Transformers_ like spectacle films, fewer small character driven stories like _You Can Count On Me_ (a wonderful film) and almost no American art films in the Truffeaut / Goddard / Tarkovsky / Bergman / Bertolucci / Fellini / Fassbinder / Wenders / Kurasawa blah blah blah European Art House tradition. It's not that there's no money in it, the resurgence of serious television shows that there is. It's just that the movie house screenings business model prevents this stuff from getting distributed for public showings.

I have no idea what's going on with Stargate. But I do know that whoever owns that property will shoot for biggest ROI possible, which means expect more work like Abrams delivers and less like what Meyers did. Because the distribution business model has changed. And it wasn't like those TOS Trek movies weren't financed to make money either.

Fascism and capitalism are not mutually exclusive. Capitalism is defined as:

""an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.""

Nazi Germany's trade and industry were, by all accounts, controlled by private owners for profit. 

Additionally, yes, many people died under communist regimes. In response to this, I'd like to quote my favourite Marxist Theorist, Slavioj Zizek:

&gt;Our blindness to the results of systemic violence is perhaps most clearly perceptible in debates about communist crimes. Responsibility for communist crimes is easy to allocate: we are dealing with subjective evil, with agents who did wrong. We can even identify the ideological sources of the crimes - The Communist Manifesto, Rosseau, even Plato. But when one draws attention to the millions who died as a result of capitalist globalization, from the tragedy of Mexico in the sixteenth century through to the Belgian Congo holocaust a century ago, responsibility is largely denied. All this seems to have just happened as the result of an âobjectiveâ process, which nobody planned or executed and for which there was no âCapitalist Manifestoâ (The one who came closest to writing it was Ayn Rand)â

People die from capitalism all the time, but since capitalism is generally accepted as the ""default"", ""status-quo"",  or some kind of objective reality, the blame is never rightfully allocated. 

The atlantic slave trade of blacks was capitalism at its worst. Private property and trade used to justify the mass enslavement, murder,  and torture of a whole race.

Colonialism, was another horrendous capitalist practice, where the resources of countries were sucked dry for the private profit of imperialist nations. [The Bengali Famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943P) is one of the largest famines in human history, where death toll estimates go as high as 4 million. This happened while India was a colony of Britain, and was a direct result of gross mismanagement and negligence of the colonial government. People were starving to death even though food was plentiful; instead of feeding the indians, who were considered filthy animals, in Churchhill own words, they exported grain for profit. In another Indian famine, the british even outlawed [charitable donations for the hungry, because it would cause grain prices to fluctuate](https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/davis-victorian.html).

This is just the tip of the iceberg. The whole deplorable state of [contemporary Africa is a direct result of European colonialism](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/111vj8/what_caused_africa_to_be_so_poor_and_corrupt/c6ilsnp).

There is also the great depression, which I am sure you know all about.

I don't really view Stalin's regime as communism, as he entirely perverted the ideology to fit his own authoritarian agenda. There is little in common between between Stalin's regime and Marx's original writings. Although you'll find a variety of differing opinions on Stalin/Mao in this subreddit. I consider myself a Marxist (and an anarchist), and there is nothing in marx's works which encourage totalitarian regimes or killing inoccent people; quite the opposite, actually. 

[Anarchist Catalonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia) would be an example of true classeless, communal society, which represents the kind of society I would like to see exist in the future. George Orwell, of Animal Farm fame, actually wrote a [glowing endorsement of  Catanolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_Catalonia). The [Paris Commune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune) is another example of a successful communist entity. 

Capitalism is inherently destructive and morally bankrupt. Piketty's new book [Capital in the 21st century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century), which recently topped best-sellers list and received universal acclaim in mainstream economics, empirically demonstrates how capitalism is a broken system, which will, over time, invariably increase a widening gap between the rich and poor, resulting in gross inequality.

The values for a lot of the continents just don't make them worth trying to hold most of the time, and they don't even really agree with each other.  For instance, both Australia and South America are worth 2 armies.  They both have 4 territories each, so this would seem to make sense, except South America has 2 points of entry, while Australia only has 1.  Meaning that your 2 extra armies from Australia can both be plopped in Indonesia, while the controller of South America must split his 2 between Brazil and Venezuela, allowing the Australian to effectively grow an army twice as fast.

So I propose a new system, that looks at the number of territories and the number of entry points, or borders with other continents.  For every 3 territories in the continent (rounded down) the continent is worth 1 extra army per turn.  And for each additional border with another continent after the first border, you get 1 more army per turn.  So for example, South America with 4 territories and 2 borders is worth 2 armies per turn (4 territories rounded down to 3 to give 1 army, then 2 borders - 1 to give +1 more army = 2).  So now the continent values look more like this.

* Australia - 1 (4 terr, 1 - 1 border)
* South America - 2 (4 terr, 2 - 1 borders)
* Africa - 3 (6 terr, 3 borders)
* North America - 5 (9 terr, 3 borders)
* Europe - 5 (7 terr, 4 borders)
* Asia - 8 (12 terr, 5 borders)

And if you notice, it really doesn't even change anything except Australia and Asia.

In nearly every competitive game of Classic Risk that I play, the one who ends up winning generally managed to hold one of the southern continents early (being much easier to defend, and getting more bang for your buck in army/border ratio), while people who struggle to control a northern continent end up getting wiped by someone who grabbed a southern continent earlier.

I feel like this update would make it tougher for someone who grabs Australia early, which is usually a very big problem for anyone going for anything else, since Australia is usually controlled after 1 turn, while other continents can take several turns before they are controlled.  Especially considering how remote Australia is, and the fact that no one ever tries to grab Asia, an early Australia controller left unchecked can easily become a dominant force on the board after only a few short turns, since they generally have the freedom to do what they want in Asia.

And with the extra army going to Asia, it should make this continent more worthwhile, altho I still doubt anyone would ever try to grab it early, but it might make it much more viable for a mid game grab, rather than being a non issue until the game is pretty much over like it generally is in most of the games I play.",t3_26zbzd,t3_26zbzd,boardgames,t5_2qmjp,

So i think market is waiting for good news
Before the end of 2014 The next ""big"" news, like paypal confirm working on bitcoin, will make a panic buy, bitcoin will be at all time high (1500$).

The difference with last time is now the huge media coverage. Bitcoin will take place on TV.

This will make wallstreet fear to enter too late in the game and will start to buy to be before mainstream. (5000$++) probably early 2015. The timing is perfect because it's seems like serious company to buy BTC for ""pro"" will come soon.

This will make politic to seriously look at Bitcoin, and the next USA campaign will have a bitcoin topic, so the world. Before this x2 less bitcoin will come in the market every 10 minute. Few months / Weeks before the halving people will realise it and the last big panic buy will happen (10k++)

This will make more coverage and speculation.

Overall i expect bitcoin to growth like crazy if silicon valley adopt it (will surely happen i feel), and the only thing who can stop it now is a REALLY bad news their is only two i think :

huge flaw discover in protocol (low probability)

If you want something smaller, Saskatoon is beautiful in the summer (along the river anyway) but you might encounter a lack of things to do.

Quebec City is amazing if you want something with a European feel, and knowing French isn't a *necessity*, but it's recommended. Montreal is more English-friendly, and is generally regarded as having the best nightlife in Canada if that's what you're into.

We want to focus on making big exciting game modes for a big awesome server. Nearly every other server focuses on small game modes for 8 to 24 players and we want to be different in that regard. This means however, that we are leaving behind people that don't have the computers to play on our server and we understand that. There isn't really much else to say on that matter though. While it might hurt us in the sense it means a smaller target audience, we want to make big awesome games for a big awesome community.

Do you consider a game like league of legends pay to win? It's pay for convenience at best. I mean if you really want to say starting with 16 more torchs for 5000 gold is pay to win, then there is nothing to argue about here because we can't win you over. We priced our game modes with the understanding that players can play completely free to play and not fall behind. All the essential upgrades in game modes are made to be cheap enough you get them after a dozen games or so. If you want to buy every item and all the vanity items, it's going to take you all summer, but your going to see people do it. If you want the honest answer it's because the server is losing money. It's been losing money since January. We been fighting the lost by cutting back servers and evening cutting EU. Nisovin, Guude, and I personally haven't made a penny from PlayMindcrack all year, yet have spent hundreds of hours working on it. I love to make games, but we were really hoping this could be something we could do full time. When me and Guude work on PMC, it's less time we spend on our youtube and if you look at our numbers from the last 6 months it shows. The choice was simple, change how we do business, or put this server into maintenance mode and let it die it's own slow death while slowly cutting costs as less and less people support it. I have a massive spread sheet. Each game mode is designed so that after 20 hours of game play you can have what a reasonable person would claim is ""required"" to play a game mode without feeling you are behind. The costs are even less if you play on a double gold weekend or after we implement daily quests this week. 

Lastly you are complaining about things as we are rolling them out. I have already told people MSG will be located in the Arcade and why. We even put it on the teleportation book unlike other arcade games like Power Juice or Classic KGM. We fixed a bunch of the dead spawns players reported. Did the balance changes the community asked, but at the end of the day we are phasing this game mode out. It's creates a toxic behavior, it doesn't fit our long term goals for the server and is the MOST costly of game modes to maintain costing us DOUBLE each month compared to everything else. We will support MSG while it still has players, but we are actively trying to move those players to newer game modes by not making it a main stage attraction to playmindcrack.


We knew posts like this would come up and I'm glad you were very respectable about it. The dead truth is this is make or break for us. The Mindcrackers are busy guys, some of them haven't even ever stepped foot on our server let alone support it even though the main purpose of this server is to create a group fund for Mindcrack to do awesome things in the future. I merged with Mindcrack thinking we could unite and make the biggest awesome minigame server around, but it hasn't happen yet and were slowly dieing off. So I'm pouring all of my time to carry this thing on the backs of me, nisovin, and guude in hopes that this can be a profitable server and not just something we throw hours and hours of time and money into to see it die. Hopefully you will have faith in knowing the goal here is not to rip off the player base and force you to pay to play, but can see we are just trying to survive.",t3_270hdp,t3_270hdp,playmindcrack,t5_2zb1l,

lemonzoidberg,( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°) Commander in Chief ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°),True,2,2,0,1401605185,,False,1434043162,t1_chw8ijs,0,False,0,chw8ijs,rainbow,"Adolf Hitler, said to be one of the most evil political leaders who ever lived, annihilated a total of six million people just because they were Jewish, and many millions more just because they were not German (Haffner, Osers). Even though Hitler was one of the most evil political leaders who ever lived, he was also one of the most impressive leaders who has ever lived. During his reign, Hitler helped Germanyâs economy reach prosperity along with helping to strengthen Germanyâs military. He helped expand the borders of Germany, giving the country much more property than it had owned before his dictatorship. Lastly, there was a lot of national unity during Hitlerâs reign. The whole nation came together and followed his stunning leadership. 
One reason that the whole nation of Germany came together under Hitler was because he was able to recover and increase Germanyâs economy during his reign. Before Hitler started to rule, Germany was facing high unemployment and poverty. When he came into power, there were over 6 million Germans having difficulties raising money (Hafner, Osers). One of Hitlerâs main goals was to end all the unemployment. Hitler developed huge public work systems, expanded credit, instituted many new job programs, brought in unemployment insurance, and did much more to help out the people of Germany improve with the German economy (Rockwell). Another one of Hitlerâs main goals coming into power was to repair the German military. For a very long time, their armed forces were not very secure. The German military would not have very much of a chance in any battle. At that time, they were under the Treaty of Versailles, which took away a lot of military power from Germany, as well as, the Great Depression was just ending, which deprived any possibilities for using a lot of money to help out the German armed forces (Appleby, 570). However, by 1938, under the power of Hitler, it had been completely turned around, and Germany became the strongest country in Europe (Haffner, Osers). Hitler was able to improve both the economy and military of Germany during his rule, which proves that Hitler was a good leader. He was able to organize, take charge, and get people to listen to him to reach his goal. 
Hitlerâs great skills of being a good national leader are also shown in the way that he expanded Germanyâs borders. Hitler believed that the best thing for the country of Germany would have been to add more land. One of his goals for the world was to have Germany have the most possible power. So, he took control and showed his aggressiveness and leadership skills in helping get more land for his country. Some of the countries that Hitler took over and made a part of his own country, for his 65 million Germans to have a little âstretching room,â included Austria, Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, and more (Ellis). He took these lands to unify all the German-speaking countries in an event called Anschluss (Appleby, 688). Hitler was not taking all of this extra land for himself; he was giving extra land to the people of Germany. A good leader would do things such as giving people what they needed. 
Further proof of Hitler being a good leader is by the national unity under his leadership. Before Hitlerâs reign, the people of Germany were not a very unified country. While Hitler was in power, the vast majority of his people came together and supported him as a national savior, known as âguter FÃ¼hrer,â meaning, âgood leader.â (Haffner, Osers). The fact that his people all supported him, and had a nickname for him as, âgood leader,â suggests that they all liked what he was doing very much. Also, Hitler would not have been able to get as far as he did without the people of his country. One example of Hitlerâs people following him is the people in his military. When Hitler invented his new type of warfare, blitzkrieg, meaning âlightning war,â all of his military agreed with him and used his new type of battle to help the country of Germany advance. The majority of his people had to be thinking that he was a good leader while using his new style of fighting to help out their nation. Although the government may not have been a democracy where the people get a vote, if enough absolutely refused to work for him because they disagreed with his ideas, he would not have gotten very far. 
While Hitler was in control of Germany, he affected the world, in many different ways, some evil, but also many good. This was because he was an exceptional leader. He helped to improve Germanyâs economy and military. He also added a lot of territory to the borders of Germany, and the majority of the people under his rule came together in national unity believing in Hitler. Many things that he did during his time of leadership were a great help for Germany and its citizens, and brought the country to a peak. All of this great work that Hitler did earned him his title of, âguter FÃ¼hrer.â",t3_270gyz,t3_270gyz,abcqwerty123,t5_2z4ce,

My layman understanding, though, is that there are two fundamental points to making it the search engine's responsibility. The first is deciding that (in this case) Google is a ""data processor"", basically because they take the web and use algorithms to decide what to show the user. In other words, they manipulate or process the data. 

The second point which actually makes it their (Google's) responsibility to remove the links is to say that Google (in this case) is a ""data controller"". Basically, because they are processing data, they can therefore control what data gets processed. And since they control it, they must remove things which don't comply with Europe's right to be forgotten laws.

So, AFAIU, it has nothing to do with where web servers are located; it has nothing to do with the idea that web sites ""only respond to HTTP requests"" etc (and whatever other theories I've read). It's simply logical steps from the courts opinion that Google is a ""data processor"". This of course ignores huge holes in the whole process, like the data is still viewable on the news website (in this case); that the information could easily be duplicated to a new website which would then be shown (until a separate removal request is made); that the ruling can only affect European operations, so users using a foreign search engine could still be shown the unwanted results etc etc.

In the most general sense, ""Radio Free [almost always a *Location*]"" is the voice of comparatively 'free' peoples within or just outside of some area that is under some kind of oppressive control. (Could be anything the broadcasters consider oppression. It's also been used by pirate radio stations in countries that most people consider 'free,' including the U.S., sometimes jokingly.) Regardless of specifics, it means to convey the sense that the broadcasters are the voice of the 'free' people who are being oppressed. More directly, it indicates that the broadcaster is *not* the voice whatever controlling authority is nominally in charge in that area.

During WW2, there were some examples of ""Radio Free *Place*"" from places behind Axis lines but not under Axis control.

During the Cold War -- which is the context of the expression most people today are familiar with -- this kind of radio went pro. NATO countries set up Radio Free Europe to broadcast high-power radio across the Iron Curtain into the populous western end of the USSR, providing a Western voice that Soviets could not silence, though they tried. RFE is still going, by the way.

""Radio Free *Place*"" has also been used other places and times, especially in Latin American and African countries during civil wars or other socially disruptive struggles, providing either rebel voices or just the voices of those not involved in the conflicts who were also not government voices.

This is the top comment of the submission:
&gt;It started with Ukraine's financial problems. Ukraine was trying to work out a deal with the IMF but Russia offered them a $15 billion bailout. The bailout included subsidies for oil. Ukraine does not have its own independent source for oil and actually depends on the Russia to provide it. [You may be familiar with Russia turning off Ukraine's supply of oil many times in the past.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_disputes) The majority of people in Ukraine wanted to work with the European Union however Russia's influence on Ukraine (because of the bail out, and the oil subsidies, as well as threats to cut off all access to oil) made the Ukrainian government side with Russia as opposed to working out the trade deal with the European Union.
&gt;
&gt;The people of Ukraine were extremely upset and protested. Eventually protests that were peaceful turned violent. Some of the protests where co-opted by Neo Nazi organizations, and other extremely right wing (and violent) individuals. 
&gt;
&gt;The government then made a series of [anti-protest laws](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-protest_laws_in_Ukraine) that were simply ridiculous. For example, simply protesting in front of a building and making it harder for people to enter that building can get you 6 years in prison. If you gather with a group and simply talk negatively about certain members of the government you can now get as much as 2 years in prison. The laws had the opposite effect and made the protestors even more violent. 
&gt;
&gt;Within a matter of days the laws were repealed and eventually the protesters successfully ousted the prime minister (who now has been seen in Moscow). The government started negotiating with the protestors. Progress and financial independence from Russia seemed inevitable. This made Putin very angry because this meant that Ukraine would switch their allegiance from Russia to the European Union and the IMF. 
&gt;
&gt;Putin wants to create a [post communist Eurasian union](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Union) which Kazakhstan and Belarus have already agreed to join. Many believe that this union is simply a disguise for combining all the post-communist countries into one huge organization resembling the USSR once again. This is the crux of the protesters argument. 
&gt;
&gt;Putin believes that even though he has gained support for this union in other post communist countries, the protests in Ukraine might remove some of the successes he has gained. Furthermore, this could potentially stop other post communist countries from joining the union, thus he is putting military pressure to ensure that the protests do not leak to other post communist Eastern European nations. 
&gt;
&gt;The WWIII aspect plays into this because Ukraine is requesting NATO support, which the US is part of, but this is not just limited to United States, Ukraine and Russia. NATO consists of 28 sovereign countries that have agreed to support each other militarily in case they are invaded. Many of those countries have other alliances which would increase the number of nations involved in any potential military intervention. The US has warned Russia as has have many other countries that their actions ""have consequences"".
&gt;
&gt;The question now is what will Russia do? If they don't leave will NATO take military action against Russia? If so, will China support Russia? Pretty soon this could escalate to into war with 35+ countries engaging in military action. 
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I don't think we'll get there - but it is a real risk, and one that needs serious thought on how it can be avoided without Putin having to go back with his tail between his legs. If he can't save face this can start another Cold War. 
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger.
&gt;
&gt;EDIT2: Since other people have been asking:
&gt;
&gt;1. [Why the Crimean warm water port is important, but not the biggest reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1zd1bo/what_is_the_situation_with_russia_ukraine_and/cfsu7d7)
&gt;
&gt;2. [Half of Ukraine is not pro-Russian. 14% are](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1zd1bo/what_is_the_situation_with_russia_ukraine_and/cfsquog), and even though Crimea is [58% Russian only 23% favor joining Russia](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1zd1bo/what_is_the_situation_with_russia_ukraine_and/cfsnacn).

&gt;3. [Russia exports both oil and gas](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2013/11/13/pipelines-of-empire/) both which flows through Ukraine and Belarus. 
&gt;
&gt;4. Yanukovych was the President, not the PM (my bad).
&gt;
&gt;5. Ukraine is not part of NATO, but Poland and Lithuania are, and they have both enacted NATO provisions requiring the members to organize and discuss the matter. Furthermore, Putin is in violation of the [1994 Budapest Memorandum](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1zd1bo/what_is_the_situation_with_russia_ukraine_and/cft0n68) which obligates the US, and UK request assistance from the UN Security Council. 
&gt;
&gt;Also, the Ukrainian revolts were not manufactured by the West. There is no evidence of that, just pure speculation. 
&gt;
&gt;**THIRD AND FINAL EDIT:**
&gt;
&gt;It appears people are still following this thread. I'm getting lots of questions about what I think will happen. I'll list my predictions, but note this is just my personal view.
&gt;
&gt;Here's my prediction how it will play out:
&gt;
&gt;1. Easy sanctions from the EU &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; US will begin. Nothing serious. A pull out from G-8, and a bunch of posturing on TV, and the media. 
&gt;
&gt;2. The UN Security Council will do nothing more than censure Russia. 
&gt;
&gt;3. NATO's leader right now is sympathetic to their cause. He will try to gain support. The US will make troop movements. 
&gt;
&gt;4. China will be courted to make concessions. They will not partake. 
&gt;
&gt;5. Sanctions get harder. Oil trade and assets for Russia are blocked. 
&gt;
&gt;6. Putin leaves Ukraine. 
&gt;
&gt;Why? The economy in Russia is dangerously close to a stagnation. Russia won't be able to survive without exporting their oil &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; gas. If assets are blocked they'll have even harder time as they'll be cash strapped. 
&gt;
&gt;7. Ukraine &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Russia extend the Crimea base  lease and update terms. Ukraine gets $15B+ from the IMF (in addition to the $3B they already received from Putin).

The answer is that there is no reason at all that the *entirety* of a certain group just up and went and turned into another group. Parts of the original group may have stayed the same or went in another direction. 

This is how evolution works, it's not Pokemon where you and everyone around you suddenly wakes up as something else. Change is gradual and happens to individuals. When the circumstances change for part of a group then the ones in that part with a mutation more suited for the new environment will have more chances of reproduction and so the mutation becomes dominant.

It will, most likely. On the other hand, lack of military action will cause anger as wel. When the government appeared to be impassive, protesters in Kiev took o the streets to demand military action.

You confuse your personal history with a friend with a community's needs, and/or hits of a Google search.  

&gt; Google doesn't report anything.

Yes it does.  It directly displays text which it selected from a vast sea of existing text, acting not too differently from the editor of a newspaper in that regard.  http://www.google.com/whateverquery returns text strings like ""thirdegree arrested on serial child molestation charges"".  And that is by design.  

Google was successfully taken to court numerous times in the past years because the first search result for a person was simply slander, and Google was held responsible since they **choose**  to present this as first hit, whether by algorithm or manual interception not being considered relevant (since law is about people and the results of people doing things, and algorithms are considered just a tool to do things).  That is now established practice in European law courts, and will not change.  

&gt; Saying that google can't serve the results is saying that, while it's fine and dandy for the information to be out there, it just can't be too easy to find. 

Yes, that's essentially correct.  We will have to live with new concepts like varying degrees of 'accessibility' of information.  Google's first return page is a reasonable threshold for 'everyone will see this immediately'.  

Also, a lot of pages are outside of the jurisdiction of any country which gives a damn about personal rights or the such (they're hosted in Manila, or the US or something like that), and hence out of reach for the rule of law.  Google, however, is not, so if you want to kill a chain leading to infringement of personal rights you attack the exposed link.  ",t3_26zte2,t1_chw7d1m,technology,t5_2qh16,

From lions and tigers, to bears and chimpanzees, to a famous horse named Tony the Wonder Horse , the Rosaires are renowned for their unique and respectful way of training and performing with wild animals. The Rosaire s roots are deeply embedded in circus tradition. Their forefathers were court jesters, acrobats and animal trainers who traveled through the villages of Europe captivating audiences with their family side shows and wild animal menageries. However, the circus life of their ancestors is a very different one today. Major declines in audience attendance and increasing, yet legitimate concerns for animal welfare have greatly impacted the Rosaire s traditional way of life. Jobs are scarce in circus and living the life of gypsy performers is taking its toll. The Rosaires are acutely aware that their traditional way of making a living is slowly dying. However, they continue struggling to keep it alive because it's in their blood and it's all they know. When tragedy befalls the family not once but twice, they decide to attempt what they've been unable to do for over 50 years - quit the road and create a family circus on their property in Sarasota, Florida.  

[NyTimes overview] (http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/452210/Circus-Rosaire/overview): the popularity of the traditional circus continues to fade, a family that has made their living in the striped tent for nine generations prepares to make the plunge by establishing their own family circus and ensure that the show goes on. Few animal trainers are as highly respected as the legendary Rosaire family. The proud descendents of court jesters and acrobats who once captivated audiences all across Europe, the Rosaire family has distinguished themselves from the pack with their unique and respectful approach to animal training. Still, the Rosaires are well aware that their unique way of life is quickly coming to an end, and in the wake of two unforeseen tragedies it quickly becomes apparent that the only means of maintaining their unique tradition may be to finally establish a circus of their own. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

Second, people don't actually ""ship jobs"" anywhere. The vast majority of goods manufactured in China for US brands are made on-contract in Chinese-owned factories. Apple, Nike and everyone else are technically importing product to sell under their label. Foxconn, a Taiwanese-owned manufacturer that makes products for Apple and many other electronics companies, has over a million employees. Not a single one of them could be counted as an Apple employee.

Also, all of these companies have staff, stores and offices in China to sell their product to the Chinese people. We need more of that. We don't want to penalize that. This is where the focus on ""jobs"" starts to get sticky.

What about a company with its headquarters in England that manufactures in China and sells in America? How would you determine the amount to tax them?

There are several factors behind all the manufacturing ""jobs"" going to China and East Asia in general, some of them that we can control from a policy side, some we can't. There's a critical mass of manufacturing and logistics capabilities in East Asia right now: chips in Japan and Taiwan, screens in Korea, assembly in China, etc., and we can't do a whole lot about that. Labor is cheap in China, and the RMB may be artificially low, but even if we somehow managed to force China to float its currency on the market, it wouldn't make much of a difference.

What else makes it cheaper to manufacture in China? Manufacturers aren't subject to the strict environmental laws you see in the US and Europe. Big savings there. Another one, which is huge, is that US corporations are not taxed on their overseas earnings as long as they ""reinvest"" them abroad. US corporations are sitting on billions and billions of dollars in foreign accounts because as soon as they bring that money home, it's taxed.

This ends up being a massive subsidy for international outsourcing, and fixing it could put a dent in the problem. But it's also sticky. How do you distinguish between companies selling US products abroad and companies just going after cheap manufacturing? ",t3_26zy88,t3_26zy88,politics,t5_2cneq,

I'm sick and tired of explaining the same stupid things over and over again. Here is a copy and paste. I bolded the bad argument you are guilty of.   

&gt;Europeans are white, and they have been reducing their emissions.

What has Europeans' skin color to do with anything? What the fuck?

And Europeans still are worse per capita polluters than China, regardless how much they reduced them. If population density in Europe was as high as in China, you would see worse levels of pollution. Simple as that.

____________________________________
""But China has more total pollution"": That's because China's population is bigger.     

""But China's cities are more polluted than western cities"": That's because China's population density is bigger than Western nations'.     

***""But China is a worse polluter than other nations"": That's because there are more people living in China than in those nations.***     

""But China's absolute pollution is higher than that of the US"": That's because there are more people living in China than in the US. The absolute pollution is a ridiculous comparison between countries for that very fact.

""But China's pollution is bad for the planet"": So is everyone's pollution and the average Australian/Canadian/American is polluting much more than the average Chinese person.       

""But China's cities are uninhabitable"": So were cities of western nations during that stage of their development. In fact, China's cities are much cleaner than western cities during that time.


&gt;Per capita. That's like saying I commit less crimes per kilo than a three year old.

No, it isn't. Per capita pollution is the only reasonable metric to refer to when comparing levels of pollution and what one nation is responsible for except you want to say that one person has less rights than another person.

I mean, you people are trying to make the same silly argument over and over and over again and it's not getting better.

Then we're in agreement. I'm not going to argue that it would have definitely aided them or made them win the war. My argument is the Eastern Front would have been different in *character* if it lacked the racial element. I don't see how that couldn't be true, especially given the link between the fighting on the Eastern Front and the Holocaust. I was responding to the OP who described the racial warfare on the Eastern Front as a *small thing*. 

I'm not giving those examples to say ""look at these amazing decisions the Germans made"". You're arguing against them as if I'm praising them as brilliant and powerful aspects of the German war effort. I'm using them to show that the Germans tenuously experimented with foreign troops and encouraging Eastern Europeans to collaborate. The fact they were mostly minor and had little impact is due to German disinterest in tying the Slavs to their war effort and a lack of understanding of how to harness anti-Soviet feeling across the continent. The point I'm making is to consider what **more** of an impact these could have had had they been given enough support and attention by the Nazi Party. If you remove the racial element these issues can be dealt with practically in a way they couldn't due to Nazi racial theory.

Had collaboration been one of the prime objectives of the Nazis rather then an afterthought then the Eastern Front would have been **different** in my view.

It might mean we don't have any control over interest rates, which is obviously not ideal. I don't really like this option, or even the Currency Union favoured by Alex Salmond. As I said elsewhere in this thread, what I would like to see is to continue using the pound (in a CU or not..)while we set up our own currency, and then peg that to the pound for a good few years (5? 10?) until the dust has settled, and then unpegging it when the time seems right.

2) No, we don't automatically get entrance. But I don't think anyone has any interest in keeping us out. Even Spain has said that the Scottish case is fundamentally different from the Catalan case, and that they won't interfere. They haven't said specifically that they won't veto us, but they've certainly implied it. Scotland is a rich, western European nation, populated by Europeans, enshrines most of the European treaties already. It's exactly the kind of country Europe *WANTS*. We will have to apply, but I think it will be a very easy, very quick entrance. 

3) Scotland's GDP WITH oil is Â£26500 (compared to the UK's Â£22300), and WITHOUT oil it's Â£20570 (compared with the UK's Â£20870). So yes, it's important, but at the end of oil BOTH countries would have to adjust. Anyway, There's still plenty of oil, and I would rather see that benefit Scotland than go to Wetsminster vanity projects like HS2. Yes, it's a finite resource. Yes it will eventually run out. But in the mean time I would like to see Scotland spend that oil wealth on developing renewables, investing in the things we will need in the future, instead of just giving tax breaks to the energy companies to boost their profits. 

4) Yes, I think it will change. Of course there is a lot of NIMBY, same as down south. The difference is that it's much less populated up here, so there's fewer back yards to disturb. You will always get people complain about wind farms, but  that's something *any* government will just have to deal with. Or, we could just sell all the land to Donald Trump. Last time that happened everyone was THRILLED to put up wind farms, just to piss him off.

Most fought bravely to safeguard Britain including in its ""finest hour"" when it was threatened with invasion. If you think about it that way, Britain's experience of WWII should bring it closer to the continent that it stood alongside.

In my opinion, coming from an island with a long history of interaction with the UK, I think part of the population in the UK feels much closer to the Commonwealth, despite the fact that it doesn't mean much anymore. British eurosceptics frequently argue the country should ""leave the EU and embrace the Commonwealth."" 

I suspect by Commonwealth they generally mean former British settler societies like Canada and Australia, not Nigeria or Pakistan. Sure, the British share a language and culture with Australians (for example) but those countries have now shifted economically and politically towards their own neighbourhoods, just as Britain has with its European partners. Geography has helped drive this change, Britain exports twice as much to my country as it does to China!

* Will many non-tourist-trap places close for the winter?

Not sure where you were planning on going but in general most of the museums/galleries are open in winter and might well be a little quieter due to the weather.

There will be Christmas markets around the time you are in the UK so you could check some of those out. I enjoy the Southbank market in London but then again choose when you go there to avoid the crowds. As far as I know the other markets around London (Borough, Spitalfields) stay open in the Winter, but will most likely be closed Christmas day ect.

* Are there things I must see in the above countries?

The V&amp;A Museum is always a good trip, you are also close to a number of other museums (Natural History museum is next door, Science museum is over the road), the buildings they are situated in are pretty stunning in themselves and you are close to Albert Hall and Hyde Park if you fancied a winter walk!

* Will carry-on-only be near impossible in winter?

I would say yes, you are coming to Europe for quite a long time and it will be pretty cold when you arrive, some countries might have snow (Norway, Poland and Austria) so you'll want a big coat, gloves, hat ect just to make sure you are warm enough.

* Clothing advice? (I'll be coming from 35C)

Same as above really, be ready for rain and cold winds. You'll be looking at roundabout 7C, maybe colder if we get some freak weather this year. Boots, coats, umbrella anything that will keep you warm and dry is a must.

* Other info I should know?

Try to avoid the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, it is a tourist trap and to be honest last time I went was a bit of a let down. 

If you aren't centered around London then most towns and cities will have some form of Christmas Markets and lights so you won't be disappointed! 

As someone else already said it will be busy during the Christmas time (London will be chock full of people, especially Oxford Street and the like) so just be aware that you might have to deal with some crowds.

For the other countries, maybe use your time to visit some of the fantastic winter events (Skiing in Austria, Aurora Borealis in Norway, Christmas Markets in Poland)

____

Where do you want to start?  

I could mention the waste, the currency issue which is dragging southern EU economies down and which invariably is dragging the bailing out countries down.  The inherent assault on competition within the EU's own single market.  The ECB,  or even go on the attack of individual politicians, how they are appointed/elected and why it favours mediocrity.  

I won't.

I'll address specific policy issues by cobbling together some of my own old posts and adding to them.


**AGRICULTURE:**

European economies are not the same.  When half the EU budget goes towards CAP, and yet when the UK has some of the largest, most efficient farms, but obviously fewer of them in total number, the CAP doesn't represent UK farms for the better, but allows continental farms to close the gap.  The Scottish forced information using the freedom of information act.  They found that corporations like Nestle and Tate&amp;Lyle had received billions over the last decade, whilst the average Scottish farmer had only received Â£9,000 per annum.   Why are we subsidising huge corporations that already turn massive profits?  From the UK perspective the UK wants to be able to take nothing from CAP and, if subsidies are necessary, to be able to tailor them for their own needs, to the most deserving, out of their *own* pocket.

http://farmsubsidy.org/GB/    


**FISHING:**

 People are all too fond of reminding the UK that they're an island on the corner of Europe.  That also means we have a massive amount of coastline for our size and we have a large sea on one side and a large ocean on the other.  When the Spanish joined the CFP the size of the European shipping fleet doubled in size.  For 30 years since the UK, and conservationists, have argued constantly for meaningful reform.  Every year 800,000 tonnes of fish are dumped back into British waters (British under international maritime law), dead, because of policy which has turned out to be impossible to reform.  Completely counter productive to economy and conservation.  Being an island this hits the UK disproportionately hard.  Dropping out of the CFP would provide the UK with an extra Â£2.5bn a year before counting the extra costs of bureaucracy attached to managing the CFP; preserving a dying industry, removing some of the most harmful practices in UK waters, stopping over fishing through the numbers of ships, and providing a huge boon to conservation.   That's not to say that the CFP couldn't continue on its own without the UK, but after 30 years, and a decade review last year which delivered nothing meaningful, the UK is being hardest hit, and continues to be so.

**TRADE:**

To address the UK's need for a trade commissioner.   The UK economy is unique to Europe.  Just as the economy differs greatly between North and South Europe, the UK in turn differs from the North with far more emphasis on finance and services.  This means that when an EU trade commissioner goes on an overseas delegation on behalf of the whole EU, the UK's needs are not indicative.  When the EU sent a delegation to India, India specifically had one thing on its bucket list: financial services.  The UK had one thing on its bucket list: financial services.  The Indians and UK were frustrated and manacled to negotiating around textiles and farming *for months*.  Are we expected to believe an EU commissioner best represents UK financial services when the UK, along with the Czech Republic, were the only two states which refused the EU fiscal compact?  

The UK doesn't *need* to be part of a large trading bloc, although it can still be part of that bloc and expect those trading through it with Europe to meet all the EU requirements, because of what its products are. We don't need to intimidate China to get a great deal any more than Germany needs to intimidate South America to get them to drive German cars.  They want high end machinery designed to make cheap low end products - they come to the UK.  If they want to extenuate a global footprint in finance, it's London.  They want high end innovation, financial services and banking, top grade pharmaceuticals and chemicals.  We don't need the EU to help sell these.  We also shouldn't need the EU to trade with countries whom we share a Head Of State with!  It's not an argument of empire.  The commonwealth is built on recognising full sovereignty of others.  It's just that through a fluke of history we find ourselves with a shared language, culture and history outside the EU, as well as having links to the EU, and going through the EU doesn't help the UK in these matters e.g.  Switzerland should not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with Canada faster than the UK.

**POLITICAL INTEGRATION/FEDERALISM:**

Then there's the matter of Federalism.

In 1975 Edward Heath said,
 
           ""Fears that we shall in some way lose sovereignty or
            independence are, I need hardly say, completely 
            unjustified.""

That is how the UK voted.  They never wanted political unity or judicial courts.  For almost 40 years now it's small wonder that the UK has grown increasingly concerned.  They've even been arguing for this debate since 1992 and Maastricht.  Every time they secure opt outs and vetoes, legally **and which others agree to**, and then are harassed when they choose to exercise them.

**THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE:**

The ECJ told employers that if their employee gets sick on paid vacation time it was not the private insurance or travel policy but the EMPLOYER's job to compensate them. Paid vacation is one thing. Paid vacation and then paying them again if they had a bad experience when on holiday: it's madness. It's widely open to corruption and being taken advantage of. A company has to work around to make sure they can provide them the relevant time off, pay them paid holiday leave, and rightly so, even sick leave, but then be hit for another bill or extra time off because they were sick when they weren't supposed to be in work, and now they want a second holiday?! It's economic disaster in the making, especially for the little guy.

The ECJ driving a stake into small and medium sized businesses and employment figures. A ruling made by a judge with no knowledge of existing UK sovereign law.  They even recently ruled that airlines had to cover expenses of people delayed even when through no fault of the airline, and that UK insurance companies couldn't evaluate risk and set policies around gender.   The ECJ ruling increased some young women driver's insurance costs by up to 25% overnight. The ECJ should not be involving itself in private pension risk assessment; especially when it's (a) punishing the consumer, and (b) negatively affecting those that should be the statistically cheaper to insure.

Whereas European leagues are usually more free market, in that players who are out of contract are not restricted to what clubs they may sign with, and the wages are negotiated between the player and the club (pre-[Bosman ruling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling), players were a lot less free to move between clubs).

It's not slow, but I do notice the lack of torque compared to other 'sporty' cars. 

He also has a 2.4 turbo diesel Ford Mondeo ST. It's much heavier but it pulls much better than the GT, obviously. So it's kind of disappointing when you get in the little sports car and you lack that feeling of being pushed into your seat at the push of the pedal. The GT does go, but not until around 6000rpm. A turbo option would shut people up but I'd like to see the standard N/A version remain. Having to work for the performance is the whole point, that's why He bought it. Fun at 40-80mph. Rather than silly speeds. 

That said, feeling overpowered by a Ford Fiesta ST can sometimes take the edge off... 

My main point here is that a supercharger would be really stupid. If they are going to add anything, a turbo would make much more sense. 
The GT is popular because it's a sports car people can afford to run everyday. If you strap a supercharger on, ruin the fuel economy, it loses a major selling point. 
A turbo could be fitted and likely keep the average 35/40mpg (UK)

After the Spanish-American war, Spain lost its last real major sources of income and, after centuries of relying on these colonies, hadn't really industrialised itself. What resulted was a backwards industrial nation trying to compete with the rest of Europe, so the government turned to heavy protectionism, which also didn't help the economy, and the underdeveloped industry meant the industrialists of Spain were rather weak compared to neighbouring France. As a result, the state tended to ally with the industrialists; using the Guardia Civil as strikebreakers and enforcers of work. From this, the Spanish working class formed a natural distrust of state power, which wasn't helped by the Second Republic more or less continuing old policies. With this, Marxism in Spain was seen as a more reformist ideology than a revolutionary one which, added to their distrust of the state, moved them towards anarchist lines rather than communist as in the rest of Europe. 

There was also the fact that Spain was still very agricultural, which meant that small, communal community life was still very well within the memory of newly industrialised Spaniards in the cities. This interaction between the old peasant ideas and new industrialisation made anarcho-syndicalism especially popular in Spain. Anarcho-syndicalist ideas stressed both coordination and cooperation between unions and collectives, as well as the desire to abolish the state, both of which appealed to much of the Spanish working class. Out of this popularity, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT (ConfederaciÃ³n Nacional del Trabajo, *National Confederation of Labour*) was founded in 1910 as the first anarcho-syndicalist union in Spain. The following years of its life were spent being repeatedly forced underground by the government for its calls for revolutionary general strikes, which also happened to push it into a more revolution focussed organisation, avoiding collaboration as the other major Spanish union, the UGT, had done. In the aftermath of the economic boom (in Spain) during WW1, the CNT got a major boost to its popularity, staging large strikes in 1919 and once again being suppressed under Rivera's dictatorship. 

As I mentioned earlier, the Second Republic also continued a lot of the economic policies of the previous regime, owing to the fragile position it held with a rather loose coalition of political parties, which continued the CNT's distrust of the state. The following period was met with a lot of strikes and attempts at revolution, notably with the 1933 Casas Viejas incident, where striking anarchist militants were massacred by the local Guardia Civil, polarising Spanish politics, and with the 1934 Asturian Revolt, in which many anarchists participated with the CNT, after the election victory of the legalist fascist CEDA. 

By July 1936, the CNT was definitely a force to be reckoned with, with around a million members and an arms cache hidden since the 1934 revolt. At the outbreak of the war, their power was mobilised, especially in Barcelona, and the famous Spanish Revolution began alongside the Civil War.

A newspaper, usually a tabloid, half makes up a story, usually something which has some truth, but is overembelished.

Someone reads this story, and they think 'this is a shitty law'.

They don't say 'the European government is rubbish, we want something else', they say 'why is it even the case that these laws are being made in another country'. 

They have that attitude for a number of reasons:

* Simple lack of knowledge of the principles of the EU, and the limits of its power - 'if they can make this law, what else can they do?' There is not much public knowledge about freedom of movement, the single market etc, and of course much of the issue is incredibly complicated. It's not clear to anyone barring constitutional lawyers where the formal limits of jurisdiction lie.

* A complete absense of a progressive concept of the European project - Britain is a country, and it has no belief that Europe is the inevitable future, or that nation states are 'on the wrong side of history'. Or, at least, this is a faintly scandalous opinion that is not even common among pro European groups. Europe must justify itself as enhancing the nation state, not on any other terms.

So there is no constitutional fallback, as there might be in Greece or Spain - where you might say 'we don't like how the EU is run, but it is our future, and we must fight to change it'.

Pro-Europeans (like myself) make their arguments on two fronts i) Europe is good for Britain in a completely pragmatic way ii) Europe has no ambitions to usurp national sovereignty. And both are subject to argument, the first because it's easy to get trapped defending everything from Brussels, and also, debating EU laws quickly becomes very complicated, and a matter of 'he said, she said', the second because there are a lot of people in Brussels that do actually advocate a United States of Europe, or something along those lines, which would clearly impede national sovereignty. i.e. that is a serious opinion in Brussels, and unfortunately can't just be portrayed as the feverish dream of a Daily Mail copyeditor.",t3_270o6i,t3_270o6i,europe,t5_2qh4j,

I don't think the book or the McElroy interview is available to download or view online anywhere so I'm gonna type up interesting sections when I can, there's a bit when he talks about his influences and shit that seems interesting particularly because this interview was conducted during the writing of *Women and Men* (he talks about Schopenhauer and I can already see the connections and some things going on there if you follow that line of thinking, this might help not so much make sense of *Women and Men* as I don't feel novels should be ""made sense of"" but the Schopenhauerian links might prove worthy of exploration).",t3_26vwik,t3_26vwik,JosephMcElroy,t5_31xi6,

Ideally this should be the case.  I mentioned public arrest records because they were the central theme in several threads where people were happy about the ruling.

Or, a simple request to allow the EU to list sites that Google should not return as results in the EU would work too.

If they are public, then while I disagree that they should be public, I disagree *more* that the individual in question has a say in whether the info is relevant to me.

This is heavily subjective and dependent on the culture and era being discussed. If you were a Roman, Greek, or Spaniard during the last two centuries BCE, your conception of a ""standard"" (if there was even such a thing) sword was perhaps 18-24 inches in length. If you were a Celt in that same period, it was a weapon perhaps 29-37 inches in length. As these cultures came into contact, doubtless comparisons would have been made, but they would have been *subjective*. To a Roman, a Celtic sword would be long; to a Celt, the Roman sword would be short. 

In the west, a fairly homogeneous cultural standard continues through to the High Middle Ages, with swords of a given time and place being of roughly similar dimensions. From perhaps 300 CE through to 1200 CE, most swords were (or, at least, those that survive, and are attested to in pictorial evidence) somewhere in the 30-38 inch range, with a relatively broad, straight blade, a relatively blunt point, and a short grip. These features reflect their usage. The grip is short, because it is meant to be held with one hand, while the other grasps a shield. The blade is broad and straight so that deep, shearing cuts may be delivered, generally to unarmored body parts (mail is a surprisingly good armor, but during this time period it rarely covered the lower arms, hands, legs, or feet). The point is not particularly acute, but it is enough to deliver limited thrusts. With a weapon of this nature in one's possession, it would make little sense to invest money and resources into acquiring a smaller sword; it will offer only marginal advantages in certain circumstances (close fighting), while adding additional weight and encumbrance.

This begins to really change around c. 1200. Throughout the 12th century, armor had been becoming more developed and comprehensive. The mail shirt, short-sleeved and thigh-length, and the open-faced helmet of c. 1000, had given way to a long, thigh length hauberk, long-sleeved and with integral mittens. The legs and feet were now mailed, and the head frequently protected by a helmet with a crude face guard.  Against a warrior so arrayed, a straight, single-handed cutting sword was of distinctly limited utility, and thus we begin to see real specialization - and divergence - in the sword making art.

Axes and clubs had always been used as anti-armor weapons, the former to cut through it, the latter to break the bones beneath it. Maces came to replace clubs during this period as a more specialized armor-defeating weapon, but as we are specifically discussing swords, we will not discuss it further. The falchion seems to have appeared around this time, but the falchion is so different in form from the typical European swords that it is best to treat it separately. Suffice to say, it more than anything resembles a vastly oversized knife or perhaps extra-long machete, with a long, broad, curved blade, sharpened on one edge, and optimized for hacking cuts. It may have been a foot soldier or peasant's weapon.

Most importantly, though, a sword known by curators and collectors as the Oakeshott Type XII appeared at some point in the 13th century. This is really the first medieval European sword that seems to have been optimized for the thrust as well as the cut. The blade, while not much longer than earlier swords, has a more pronounced taper, going from a wide base to a significantly more acute point. Yet even with this weapon, a shorter sword is not needed. It can do nearly everything that a weapon of eight or ten less inches can do, and many things that it cannot.

This brings us to the first of the two-handed swords, what is referred to as the Oakeshott Type XIIa. This is a fairly massive weapon, with a blade some 37 to 40 inches, and a hilt of 6.5 to 9 inches, but in design basically similar to the smaller XII. It is a cut-and-thrust sword, and because it is used with two hands, the wielder gains not only more force, but better leverage for stabbing into openings, or for shearing through weak points. This weapon was in use around the turn of the 14th century, and was one of the first swords meant for use specifically against plate armor, which was first coming into use during this period. The idea would be subsequently refined, leading to more and better two-handed swords. But this is the first.

The downside to using one of these new two-handed swords is the swordsman is himself more vulnerable to attack. It was useful to have the ability to switch, as it were, to a shield and a more manageable sword if the situation required it. As plate became more developed, the swordsman became correspondingly less so, until by the late 14th century shields were virtually abandoned. Even still, the one-handed sword persisted. In peacetime, it was handier, easier to carry on one's person by way of scabbard and belt (the two-handed swords would generally have been strapped to a horse or carried in the hands); in war, it was more useful at close range, or if the larger sword had been lost or wrestled away. It had, in effect, become a sidearm, as well as a badge of rank. The new word for this sword becomes the *arming* sword, in contrast to the *long* sword. So, you could very well say that, between 1300 and 1500, it was indeed common for a warrior (a wealthy one, anyway) to carry two swords, one *relatively* short, and one *relatively* long. His sword was no shorter than the swords carried by his forefathers in the 3rd through 12th centuries (in fact, it was frequently longer), but it was short compared to the 48-60 inch longswords in use in the age of plate.

&gt;

&gt;__CharlesÂ V__ [a] (24 February 1500 â 21 September 1558) was ruler of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) from 1519 and, as __Charles I__, of the [Spanish Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire) from 1516 until his voluntary [abdication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication) in favor of his younger brother [Ferdinand I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) as [Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor) and his son [Philip II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain) as King of Spain in 1556.

&gt;As the ruler of many greater and lesser European states, Charles had [a very complicated coat of arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor). He was the heir of three of Europe's leading dynasties, the [House of Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg) of the [Habsburg Monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy), the [House of Valois-Burgundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Valois-Burgundy) of the [Burgundian Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_Netherlands), and the [House of TrastÃ¡mara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Trast%C3%A1mara) of the Crowns of [Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Castile) and [Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon). He ruled over extensive domains in Central, Western, and Southern Europe, and the [Spanish colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas) in the Americas and Asia. As Charles was the first king to rule Castile, LeÃ³n, and Aragon simultaneously in his own right, he became the first [King of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Spain).  In 1519, Charles became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. From that point forward, his empire spanned nearly four million square kilometers across Europe, the Far East, and the Americas.  Much of Charles's reign was devoted to the [Italian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars) against France which, although enormously expensive, were militarily successful, and which led to the development of the first modern professional army in Europe, the [Tercios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tercios). Charles's forces re-captured both [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan) and [Franche-ComtÃ©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franche-Comt%C3%A9) from France after the decisive Habsburg victory at the [Battle of Pavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pavia) in 1525,  which pushed [Francis I of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France) to form the [Franco-Ottoman alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Ottoman_alliance). Charles's rival [Suleiman the Magnificent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent) conquered the central part of the [Hungarian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary_in_the_Middle_Ages) in 1526 after defeating the Christians at the [Battle of MohÃ¡cs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Moh%C3%A1cs). However, the [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) advance was halted after they failed to [capture Vienna in 1529](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Vienna).

&gt;Aside from his military endeavors, Charles is best known for his role in opposing the [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation).  Several German princes abandoned the Catholic Church and formed the [Schmalkaldic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_League) in order to challenge Charles's authority with military force. Unwilling to allow the [wars of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion) to come to his other domains, Charles pushed for the convocation of the [Council of Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent), which began the [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation). The [Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus) was established by [St. Ignatius of Loyola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola) during Charles's reign in order to peacefully and intellectually combat Protestantism, and continental Spain was spared from religious conflict largely by Charles's nonviolent measures according to some authors.  In the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World), Spain conquered [the Aztecs of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire) and [Incas of Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire), then extended its control across much of South and Central America. Charles oversaw the [Spanish colonization of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas). Charles provided five ships to [Ferdinand Magellan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan) whose voyage â the first circumnavigation of the Earth â laid the foundation for the Pacific oceanic empire of Spain and began [Spanish colonization of the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Philippines).

Anyways, [this Shomotooth single titled ""Body Bag""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81CakcFEH0U) that I released during the past week where I decided to put out one single per day (since /r/Metalcore subscribers have the attention span of a brick and obviously don't listen to full albums) **is about you Austin.** The song is written from your point of view, where the body bag is the dumpster that I left you in after kicking you out of Attack Attack! and threw you in. I'll talk lyrics for a moment.

&gt;""If I could set the clocks back, I wouldn't be heading for a body bag.""

You are thinking about going back in time and making sure that you didn't say that my wub wubs sucked at that one practice session. The body bag referenced here is the dumpster that I threw you inside of in a random city after I kicked you out of Attack Attack! to take over on lead screamo screams.

&gt;""One life and one decision, make sure that it ends with you still living!""

This lyric is again, written from your point of view. It talks about you being stuck in the dumpster and almost dying, because you weren't used to the streets of Detroit when you finally climbed out of the dumpster and were all alone. Once again, the lyric about the ""one life and one decision"" refers to your decision to call my wubwubs shitty at one of our Attack Attack! official practice sessions.

I want to say that I stay true to my Christian values and morals and just don't like it when people like you pretend to love God when you really, you do it just to gain fans from the oversaturated Christian Metalcore audience. This is something which is something that I would never do.

On another note, I'm excited for the Shomotooth &amp; live instrumental guys/Of Mice &amp; Men European tour this Fall after Warped Tour Austin! It should be fun touring with you just like the old days. Shomotooth is the first band to play the concerts which in the US is usually called an ""opener,"" but in Europe, they have the better band (with his instrumental guys) play first which sort of a fun fact.

Other nations have free trade agreements with the EU. The institutions you mention are required to internally manage a trade bloc, which I and UKIP don't wish to be part of.


&gt; when that institution was built over it changed as there were short falls restricting the free movement of goods, inefficiencies at border controls meant loss on traded goods, the EEC expanded by the decisions of states so that they could manage the trade agreement and solve the problems, when the single market was born and the free movement, they needed an institution that could manage it and help with all the problems, insurance, health, discrimination etc they also wanted people to have a democratic say thus the Institution became the EU.

Is this why the EU has banned flavoured tobacco? Regulates the quality of our beaches? Attempted to impose a tax on our financial institutions? None of those actions ease free trade.

The EU is a monolithic authoritarian state that wants to take more and more power away from the nation state.


&gt; You need institutions if you want that, the EU was not just created out of nothing it was built where there were short falls in the policies, your argument is to go back to an inefficient trading policy.

Being part of a trading bloc is not worth it if we have to surrender so much sovereignty to the EU. We can still trade with the EU but not be a member.


&gt; EU members may not get to make ""free trade"" agreements, but they still make trade agreements with other countries. We can still trade with China and india but still have the free trade of 500 million other people as well.

If we left the EU we would be able to make our own free trade agreements with all three.


&gt; We do have Guns but they are hard to get and heavily regulated and they do cost money. I am happy guns are so hard to get hold off as people should not have them.

Fortunately we have the Right to Bear Arms in this country.

 Again it is not particularly difficult to acquire a firearms/shotgun certificate and they're quite cheap. My position and that of Farage's isn't to make getting hold of guns easier or to make them cheaper, it is to merely expand the types of firearms available under the current licensing system.


&gt; ""increase in the types of guns available"" Crazy policy, people don't need any more types of guns, shotgun for hunting and that should be it. Why should people have any others, guns are made to kill they have no other purpose.

There are Olympic shooting disciplines that had to be temporary legal here because otherwise they're banned. There is absolutely no evidence that large numbers of legal gun ownership will increase gun crime.

If we expanded the types of firearms available it wouldn't mean that suddenly more people will rush out and buy guns. Hell there's nothing in theory stopping sports shooting becoming the new national pastime and over the next two years the numbers of people owning guns tripling under the current licensing model.

If you were actually aware of the facts you would see that there's no evidence behind being anti-gun.

Your virtual existence is of your concern, and it is not your fault that your private information is gathered under your name in a single website. The European Union acted, at least on this subject, according to its ideals. Criminality is to be handled by the judicial institutions, not by the masses. Some people might exploit the system and cover up their past, but that past should be handled by the proper institutions, and if those informations are of relevance, it should be pointed by the mass media who subscribes to a certain ethic that we, regular citizens, don't. If you allow the masses (whose ethics cannot be openly disclosed and discussed, as they are individuals and they don't provide a service, they are just expressing their opinions) to have access and have an input on your digital footprint, you'll open a Pandora Box going from HR Dept. using Google as a source to recruit new employees, open tribunes where a citizen can openly and freely slander another citizen (law is equal to every citizen) while: A- disclosing private information that was not allowed by the individual to be disclosed; B- Tarnishing his image without sources, putting his slander on the same level as the other information (like social media) you can find on the internet. Since you have the right to express yourself freely as long as it conforms to the law, you cannot prevent the construction of your digital footprint without the input of non-authorized third parties, you have to legislate about how the corporations(in this case, Google) deal with this subject. 

If you think this will allow public figures to hide corruption from the electorate, think again. Their public acts are undisclosed, if they are proved corrupt they can't keep their positions, corruption is reported by the mass media and Google won't take that from the main page, since it's of public interest (our political jurisdiction has the social contract in its backbone).

In this case, the E.U put privacy&gt;concentration of information AND the individual&gt;corporations, I find that very noble.

A page from my draft Introduction to Folklore might help frame your enquiry. These are not specifically related to your question, but they provide the sort of examples that are well known in European folklore:

Europeans were fascinated by the idea of condemned souls, either of individuals or groups of people, who could not find rest. They were, instead, forced to exist in a nether world, appearing occasionally before the living as evidence of their hideous or peculiar plight. Such motifs have been favorites with artists and writers. It is possible to identify five types of these beings.

1. The âWild Huntâ is probably the oldest, occurring in ancient Greek sources and Scandinavian mythology. This cluster of stories refers to ghostly riders who race across the landscape or the night sky, questing for some phantom quarry that they can never catch. Legends tell of people seeing this eerie phenomenon. There are occasional references to the leader as being the god of death.

2. The âSleeping Armyâ is a motif that appears in a variety of stories telling of a group of soldiers, killed in battle, who haunt the battlefield or wait inside a mound for some future conflict. People often believe that this is an army of last resort, a supernatural force that will rise if their country is ever threatened with destruction. King Arthurâs knights are often regarded as sleeping in this way, waiting for the return of their king, healed from his wounds after recuperating in the western island of Avalon.

3. The âFlying Dutchmanâ is one of the better known and often used motifs of this group of legendary characters. This motif describes a phantom ship of ghostly sailors who travel the seas but never find harbor or rest. Their only respite comes every one hundred years, when they are allowed to anchor at a legendary harbor. Their ship is seen in bad weather. The story seems to be of medieval origin.

4. The âWandering Jewâ is also a motif belonging to this class. Like the Flying Dutchman, this character appears to be of medieval origin. The legend tells of Ahasverus, a shoemaker of Jerusalem who refused to allow Jesus to sit while carrying his cross to Calvary. His fate is to wander the world, longing for rest.

5. There are also various legends of medieval origin about cities that sank underground or into the sea because of some collective sin committed by the inhabitants. These towns return to earth every hundred years for a few hours, only to sink back to their eternal existence in perpetual limbo.

This poor kid is posting in desperation, hoping to somehow secure a visa as he's facing the possibility of losing his *life* for real, not in some video game, and he's told America is a shithole country!? I see being realistic and not getting the lad's hopes up as getting to the States would, of course, be more than a challenge in his current state, but to literally tell him to stay in Ukraine because America is 'shittier'!? I realise when you have nothing to compare it to you may choose to focus solely on the shit politics, but erm...............WAR.

I just wish they would spend some time with Google and world politics. France's National Front. Actually, all of the far-right groups of Europe. Read up on Ukraine and Russia. The radical religious groups. How we treat our immigrants and migrant workers. 

Since living in the States I can see why the stereotype holds water as its nearly impossible to find out what's happening globally. In the UK, it's impossible to escape. If you're stateside, turn to the Internet or use the (slanted) BBC as a news source to educate yourself on these issues - *especially if you're seriously considering emigrating !!* Or before putting your hoof in your mouth by comparing the struggles of American life to the current Ukraine.

Hvis jeg ville fÃ¥ sÃ¥ meget som muligt ud af staten ville jeg nok blive her lidt lÃ¦ngere og sidde pÃ¥ dagpenge, men det har jeg ""sgu"" ikke i sinde.

&gt; DF er ikke ekstremister

Hahahaha! Det er nok det mest morsomme jeg har set i dag!  Tro mig, jeg har hÃ¸rt DF snakke. Mere end jeg vil og mere end jeg har lyst til at hÃ¸re. Foruden deres (efter min mening alt for meget) taletid i medierne har jeg flere gange vÃ¦ret pÃ¥ Christiansborg. Jeg kan komme med talrige eksempler, men vil nÃ¸jes med en enkelt anekdote. 
Denne sÃ¦rlige 1.g. samfundsfagsekskursion, hvor jeg var i DF's partilokale, stÃ¥r sÃ¦rlig klart i min erindring. Vi blev vist rundt af den gode Martin Henriksen (MH), der sÃ¥ fint fortalte os om DF's hyggelige ritualer. Vi fik ikke snakket meget politik, men MH var simpelhen nÃ¸dt til at kalde en 17 Ã¥rig sydeuropÃ¦isk dreng idiot, fordi de ikke havde ens politiske holdninger! HVOR LAVT KAN EN FULDVOKSEN MAND SYNKE? EfterfÃ¸lgende sendte MH en klage til gymnasiet, fordi han fÃ¸lte sig truet af de tre drenge med udenlandsk udseende, der var i klassen. Hvis det ifÃ¸lge dig ikke er ekstremisme, sÃ¥ synes jeg at du skal slÃ¥ ordet op i en ordbog, hvis du har sÃ¥dan en.

&gt;Sverige og Norge er begge to ekstremt nationalistiske i deres udenrigspolitik

Hvor fÃ¥r du dine nyheder fra? DF's medlemsblad? Danmark er nok det land, som har stÃ¸rst forbehold overfor EU; vi var en af de eneste lande som skulle stemme om patentdomstolen.
Norge er rigtig nok ikke med i EU, men det har du gode grunde til; deres lÃ¦kre naturressourcer. NÃ¥r det sÃ¥ er sagt er Norge langt bedre til at satse pÃ¥ hÃ¸jt specialiseret udenlandsk arbejdskraft end Danmark er. Norge tiltrÃ¦kker mange kloge hoveder fra hele verden, som aldrig ville fÃ¥ lov til at bruge deres viden i Danmark. Her tÃ¦nker jeg isÃ¦r pÃ¥ lÃ¦ger og ingeniÃ¸rer. 
Sverige derimod har pga. deres mange multinationale selskaber en langt stÃ¸rre international profil. Sverige tager imod 10-20 gange sÃ¥ mange flygtninge end Danmark gÃ¸r og Sverige Demokraterne (Sveriges DF) er stadig en joke for dem.

If you are limiting your questions to Austrian attorneys, my answers may not be relevant. Europe uses a civil law, IIRC, and therefore the practice may be different. 

1. I don't ever really work alone, per se. I have a support staff to handle administrative tasks, I collaborate with my managing partner on cases, and most of my work entails telephone or face-to-face correspondence with the government. Tax Attorney. That said, there is a lot of time where I'm alone in the office researching and responding to emails/letters. 

2. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my clients get a good deal and winning a case. The least enjoyable part is trying to compensate for a client's inability to comply with a deadline. It's stressful when the client doesn't give you what you need when you need it, requiring you to do everything in your limited power to prevent the IRS from seizing their assets.

3. Most decisions belong to the client. E.g. how much to offer as a settlement, how much to pay, what particular course of action to take (penalty abatement, settlement, payment plan, Offshore Voluntary Disclosure, etc.). My decisions are how to effectively accomplish the client's goal. E.g. Which facts to include in a penalty abatement request, whether to change venue in appeals, etc. 

4. In my area and at a firm my size, the starting salary is 55-85K for a 1-3 year practicing attorney.

5. Since I work at a smaller firm, the hours are not terrible (45-50 a week). I don't work weekends. I'm happily married.

6. In the US, you have to have an advance degree (Juris Doctor) and an undergrad degree. This takes approximately 7 years (4 at undergrad and 3 for the JD) of additional schooling beyond high school.  Additionally, you have to pass an exam (bar exam) to get a license to practice in your state. The typical bar exam is two days at 6 hours per day with about an hour break between each 3 hour period. Suffice it to say, it is not an easy exam.

7. In my opinion, an attorney must have good research and writing skills, effective communication skills, problem solving and analysis skills, time management skills, and strong interpersonal skills. 

8. Research and time management are the two most important traits I learned in school. Law school does a great job teaching you how to research and training your brain to analyze facts and problem solve. It does not do a good job teaching you how to practice law. I worked at a tax clinic at my school which helped bridge the gap between law school and practice. I felt more prepared to be an attorney than many of my colleagues. 

9. For the US, the best thing you can do in school is focus on your grades. Your GPA and how well you do on your LSAT are the two most crucial indicators of whether and where you will end up at law school. Also, make sure you spend the necessary time and energy studying for any entrance exams to get into law school.

Many Europeans are starting to share a lot of information due to the internet and other forms of media. Eventually (I am just speculating), this could lead to much more common interest with each other.

Slowly, yes, these changes are beginning. Information is being shared, cultures are, to a very small extent, being integrated, but this doesn't change the fundamental interests of these countries. Euro-skepticism is all about this, not being a good idea. People don't want their cultures to integrate. People don't want Europe to become one mixing pot of culture. It may saturate what exists, and it may lead to a loss of identity amongst people. 

Culture and nationalism are very strong driving forces, and I think the main thing needing to be recognized, is that trying to introduce change, or even creating a system where this change and cultural merger is highly regarded, will ruffle a few feathers. There will be a lot of people who disapprove, and will dislike any union which causes these cultural changes.

&gt; Why won't it change soon? Can these parties, now that they have won so many seats, actually implement changes to EU law instead of just leaving? What is the point of the government if you can't change it?

These parties have won a fair few seats, but are still not remotely the majority. Free immigration is a fundamental tenet of the EU, and every other party in the EU parliament is quite a bit opposed to removing it. It isn't even a question of simple immigration, the much larger issue is legislation in the EU, effecting legislation in sovereign nations. I can't speak for any other countries, but UKIP is particularly vocal about the issue of allowing policymakers from various other countries, to create legislation that effects the UK. Why should we be part of such a union, where its main purpose is to legislate for our, and other countries?

Yes, theoretically we could remove free immigration. Yes, we could theoretically stop this kind of legislation. Now what is the EU for? The Eurozone? Virtually every party in the EU parliament now believes that the Eurozone was a failure, and needs serious reform. Euro-skepticism is, ultimately, an anger towards the existing failures of the EU, and a lack of desire to continue being part of a union that adds less value than it takes from our country.

Very happy to try and shed a bit of light on why Euro-skepticism is so prevalent at the moment, it's quite a touchy issue now!",t3_26e04r,t1_chw0fdi,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,

I assume you mean in a timeline going backward from today. In that case, pedophilia was also frowned upon as far back as in ancient Greek/Roman times (not an immediately sourced claim: based on my understanding of reading the history of the times). Of course pederasty was practiced in those times, though there at least it was with pubescent boys. We do not, however, appear to have any sources that would directly suggest the concept of age of consent existed. Admittedly at some point this argument devolves into semantics of what is close enough the current form of ""age of consent"".

The first time ""age of consent"" surfaces as a concept similar to how it is used today is probably 1275 in Europe. Lifting from [Children and Youth in History](http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230) (*Age of Consent Laws* - STEPHEN ROBERTSON, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA) also effectively copied by [Wikipedia - Age of Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent#History_and_social_attitudes) (please don't ban me): 

&gt;An age of consent statute first appeared in secular law in 1275 in England as part of the rape law. The statute, Westminster 1, made it a misdemeanor to ""ravish"" a ""maiden within age,"" whether with or without her consent. The phrase ""within age"" was interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was 12 years of age.

The first actual age of consent laws followed a few hundred years later.

&gt;A 1576 law making it a felony to ""unlawfully and carnally know and abuse any woman child under the age of 10 years"" was generally interpreted as creating more severe punishments when girls were under 10 years old while retaining the lesser punishment for acts with 10- and 11-year-old girls. Jurist Sir Matthew Hale argued that the age of consent applied to 10- and 11-year-old girls, but most of England's North American colonies adopted the younger age. A small group of Italian and German states that introduced an age of consent in the 16th century also employed 12 years.

So as a concept, ""age of consent"" surfaced as early as the late 12th century, and flowered in the public consciousness into something worth making a law by the late 15th century (though still obviously far more relaxed than today, to be point of being disgusting by today's standards).

That said, don't think the US was somehow immediately better about the age of consent. As late as 1880, age of consent ranged from 7 in Delaware, 10 in most states, and 12 in 9 other states + DC.

And this is not a matter of principle but pragmatism because ALL THOSE TREATIES involved further loss of Sovereignty towards ""Ever Closer Union""; the 1975 referendum was a [Bait-and-Switch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch), on the public towards [Engrenage](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engrenage) tactics of Federal End-game Integration from ECSC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU -&gt; Federal USE.

To segue that point into why Junker is already deposed, his quotes about the EU Constitution:-

""Vote again until the right result"" and:-

[Attacks mount against 'master of lies' Juncker](http://euobserver.com/economic/32294)

Don't expect to see Junker winning. Come that don't expect any of the current [""spitzenkandidaten""](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Spitzenkandidat) to be elected.

What is reported is media Theatre concerning the Masquerade of democracy is a fascade to the back-room deals already done out of the public's eye.

Hence, there will only be sub-Treaty reform IN the EU. Via Article 50 Teu Lisbon Treaty it changes to:

2. Lose-Lose

OUT of the EU. Therefore it becomes in EVERYBODY's interests to renegotiate a win-win.

The CAP has undergone a lot of reform since then, the brunt of which happened in 2013. Remains to be seen if the new legislation prevents that much waste, but sadly that's a byproduct of all subsidized agriculture.             
                   
The thing is, UK farms also receive subsidies (most of which come from the EU), but since the agriculture sector in the UK is fairly small compared to the ones in countries like France or Spain, the amount of subsidies also isn't as large.              
I did some research and UK agriculture represents only 0.7% of UK's GDP, and only produces less than 60% of the food consumed in the UK. Cultivated land in the UK stands at around 56,604 sq km; while France for example has 227,155 sq km, so you can see why France receives more subsidies than the UK.                 
I don't see the issue with farm size, don't you think helping small and medium sized farms compete with big ones is a good thing though? Having an American style agriculture where almost everything is owned by big companies doesn't seem like such a good idea, at least in my opinion.          
            
Okay, so if the CAP ended, do you think France of Spain wouldn't subsidize their agriculture anyway? All developed countries in the world subsidize their agriculture and if the UK wouldn't, then those farms would be pushed out of the market by much cheaper produce coming from abroad.

If you only have a +min affix (instead of +xx-xx damage one), it only increases your min damage, and if therefore your min damage is larger than max (hard to happen in non-test environment because your range is much larger than that affix, in my case 38), it will override it and result in fixed damage.

* Example1: damage range: 2-3 +min 38 -&gt; 40-40
* Example2: damage range: 120-150 +min 38 -&gt; 158-158
* Example3: damage range: 120-180 +min 38 -&gt; 158-180

Starcraft II can often require faster reaction times, awareness and decision making (much more intensive decision making at that) than CS or League of Legends. There's a reason that the discrepancies of skill between Asian-EU-U.S. in LoL play are less significant than in Starcraft II; because, put bluntly, Starcraft II is that much more difficult.

Actually, what I said was also a little unfair; LoL *can* be more difficult in the sense of teamplay etc. But even though you have to coordinate and communicate, I think that Starcraft II still wins out because of how intense it is on each single player on each side. 

I don't think a real RTS like Starcraft (C&amp;C, AoE, etc) can be compared to a turn-based game in any extent, really.  Because you're managing *everything* with an RTS like so; economy, the positioning of all units, military production, military movement and combat, vision/knowledge, et al.

League of Legends is still a demanding game; the smallest miscalculation on how much damage you can do versus X champion can be a kill or a death for you -- and some times, those airtight niches are actually ripped out into the eSports scene and amazes caster and viewer alike. It's kickass to say the least (hence why I'm here). And whilst I can always drill on about the booming and threat of all of the micro players need to do in Starcraft II (sometimes to do some thing as simple as come out evenly), there's a *ton* of merit to those who can coordinate and play effectively together to achieve a singular goal *together*.

I think LoL requires more intuition than any thing; it still takes awareness to avoid ganks or untimely events and besides that, I think nearly all skills and champs by themselves are quite easy to play. A lot of people think Orianna is very skillful, compared to every other LoL champ. I can see how she is more difficult, but it didn't take absurd amounts of games with her for me to become adept with her; the ball is a straightforward addition and with the changes they've made to the UI to make it even easier/informative, Orianna has become an easier champion yet again.

The skill isn't in individual play; it's knowing what boundaries you can breach against another player. Those *tiny* calculations some times have chance involved; you may be looking at if they're not focused enough and you're able to do some thing before they can. If they *are* focused enough, you could very well and easily die. But you take an educated guess to strike against them for a definitive lead as best you can. And it can work. The same happens in Starcraft II as well, actually; it's a pretty good tactic to draw a player's attention to multiple places. One article is *exceptional* for [this kind of thing.](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/final-edits/226236-god-of-the-battlefield-part-1)

Worth noting that quite a few players are over the age of 22 in Starcraft II. *I'm not ripping into you and had no intent to appear like I was; just thought this was probably the best opportunity to yammer all of this.*

**TL;DR** League of Legends is certainly playable at a high level at ages 23 and over; though there could be issues with coordination/communication, which is one of the most difficult parts of LoL in itself. The individual skill level isn't so much an issue as shown by older players of FPS or Starcraft II.

- fuel supply and waste product problems are ignored (due to ""uncertainty"") in favor of a focus on specific incidents

- mortality factors are based on Europe, rather atypical in its population density and technological knowhow.

- their hypotheticals are questionable: a lack of nuclear power might as well have increased price, increased efficiency research, and put a brake on demand... ultimately saving more resources, lives, and putting less GHG in the atmosphere

- ... (there's probably more, but that's enough so far)

And even ignoring all that, we don't need to go further than the title to find a biased representation: ""nuclear saved 1,8 million lives"" is disingenuous: **avoiding coal** is what saved the lives, not using 
nuclear.

Unless the families of the deceased are known redditors, I fail to see why you would expect this. Maybe if this was the thread announcing the shooting, but given that it's about the apprehension of the shooter, I'd be surprised to see condolences.

&gt;**you** should be ashamed, **you** should know better, and as Europeans you should all think before you generalise an entire race based on the actions of individuals. [...] Instead, **you**'re using this as an excuse to hate on Muslims, immigrants, and for some reason Gypsies!


1. You might want to notice that the most upvoted comment here is one which discusses which particular strand of islam is the radical one (so I'd say it's the opposite of painting all Muslims with the same brush), as well as some differences between Muslim communities in the Netherlands (again, something which paints a nuanced picture)

2. The third most upvoted discussion thread is about the interplay of of discrimination and identity of second-generation immigrants. 

3. I find your generalization of this subreddit particularly troublesome, given the dislike you profess for generalisations.

I don't want to make it seem as if we don't have a problem with bigotry to some extent, but your assesment of this thread and subreddit seem to be a bit off.

Why? Wouldn't that be thought policing? Google can and now will be told to remove certain items that come up under certain searches. That sounds much easier than trying to read the minds of everyone in the world.

I suppose it would be similar to existing discrimination laws, but that sounds a lot harder than just asking Google to remove peoples' information when they want it removed. I'm not sure why we're working so hard to cut Google a break here. Even if the bank were legally banned from using the information, it's still there for everyone else in the world to gossip about and spread.

Righto.. so the UK is the only country that pushes its domestic agenda out of 28 members?

Why do you think the UK does not have the right to express an opinion, even though it is by far one of the biggest net contributors to the budget? 

We give far more money than we take in subsidies. 

We are one of the biggest economies in the EU (probably the second biggest, depending what source).

We were one of the founding nations that pushed to create the EU.

We import more than we export to the EU.

Why shouldn't we have a say where our money goes? If we believe in a strong European union, that allows individual states to keep their autonomy within an economic union, why shouldnt our voice be heard?

The UK is and always has been pro-European, despite what the tabloids say. However we are also a nation that believes in the right of self governance, we will not cede all our powers to Germany. 

We are not the only country that thinks this way, the recent election that gave 24 seats the the French FN and the other 70 or so seats given to many nationalistic parties (which I despise) reflects how the population of Europe resists such Germanic centralization of their democracy.

Who do you call when you want to speak to Europe? Merkal. 


You are obviously anti Britain, thats fine. Yet can you provide any arguments as to why we should not be an influential partner in the EU?

&gt;it just comes across as an excuse. Your state system is quite interesting but you're still very much a single country.

No, that's not an excuse in any way what so ever. That simply does not tell you the truth in any way.

I live in a region called Cascadia. It is in the pacific northwest. It spans from [Oregon, Washington, and BC Canada.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Cascadia_map_and_bioregion.png) The three large cities are Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver. This region has weather identical to England and it's in a [temperate rainforest](http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/photos/IMG_0470b.jpg). Cascadia has been trying to succeed from America and Canada for decades now. [Portland and Vancouver are always on top 10 greenest cities in the world lists](http://www.greenuptown.com/get-to-know-the-top-ten-greenest-cities-in-the-world-for-2014/) with Seattle slacking not too far behind. Once you leave the three cities, there is just absolutely no civilization. Hundreds and hundreds of miles of forest where the laws are very strict on nature. The next closest city out of cascadia is the bay area in california, which is 1021 kms away. It's a 12 hour drive. If you're leaving the northwest you're usually flying because of how secluded it is.

Cascadia is the first region in the country that allows both gay marriage and legalized weed. Not just allowed, but completely socially acceptable. There's no social expectations, no judging or racism, people only expect you to be yourself here. Religion is usually frowned upon. [Portland is regarded as one of the best beer cities in the world.](http://www.readersdigest.ca/travel/10-best-beer-cities-world) Portland's biggest sports are not american football or baseball. Instead our largest sports are Basketball (Portland trail blazers) and Soccer (Portland Timbers)

So no, it's not just one convenient excuse. Between regions, the laws are entirely different and the people are entirely different. You say it's because americans don't travel but the same exact thing applies to you. Until you travel america you will not understand how vastly different it is. Growing up in the northwest I did not understand all the american stereotypes or why people hated america until I did travel. It was a reality check.

I will just copy my comments in the discussion thread here.
I understand the importance of this film and greatly appreciate parts of it, but I have difficulties liking it.

I did love the inclusiveness of the entire village and the adressing of social issues within India itself, that's a bold move in a film primarily dealing with colonial problems. Although the explicit part of that is brief, it is visible implicitly throughout the film and the explicit part is effective.

I also liked most of the music and the dancing and choreography coming with it. Some of the most effective moments of the film and the ones breaking up the cricket match were most welcome.

The thing I liked most about the film is the opening, with the voiceover. This film is not afraid of telling a story that is perhaps not real, but important nonetheless. It's very different from films from Europe and the US that always try to make the viewer believe what they see really happens in the moment. 
The often misused ""based on a true story"" preceding nearly every drama film is an exponent of this too. Lagaan didn't try to hide the fact that its telling a story, in fact it embraces it in a beautiful manner.

The story itself is not that special in plot development, which is no problem because of ideas behind the story. This film is extremely critical of the British colonial power in India and probably rightfully so. Is it me or is Britain having a hard time coming to terms with this? They don't even seem to try, in fact they often try to pretend they are still the center of the empire that was based on exploitation. I'm waiting for a British 12 years a slave actually (if there is one, please point me to it).

I really didn't care for the love triangle. That's more a problem of film in general as every second film seems to have one to move the plot along and that's getting really tedious. It's not that prominent in this film but I was like ""whatever"" whenever the film went that way. It's a pity it were the songs in which this was featured quite a lot, despite me liking the songs I would've loved them more if they were dealing with the actual themes of the film even more.

What stops me from liking, loving, this film is the length. This film does not justify it's length at all. I have to admit I started doing other things during the cricket match. I don't care at all about cricket, but I think the way it was shot wasn't that interesting. I don't have problems with the predictable way in which the match develops, that's how it is, but it doesn't do much to draw me in a game I don't like or understand. That's probably just me as an outsider though, I understand that cricket is important for India and also for India-British relationships.

The cinematography was a bit hit or miss. There were some very nice shots, but I also thought some of the shots, especially ones which audiences in a landscape, that were badly composed.

I really like the themes this film is adressing and I understand it's a breakthrough for India that this film is saying what it is saying, but the way of saying it wasn't that interesting for me sadly.",t3_2716ad,t1_chwe9ls,TrueFilm,t5_2szp0,

There are a number of reasons for this, but the numbers don't lie. Yes, the UK is the most vocal, but burying your head in the sand and crying about the people that don't want your version of statehood is going to get the EU into trouble. Should they leave? Possibly, possibly not, but given the proportion of votes alloted to skeptic parties, you're looking at losing both France and the UK plus a handful of other countries.

&gt;

&gt;A __sun cross__ or __wheel cross__, a [cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross) inside a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle), is frequently found in the symbolism of prehistoric cultures, particularly during the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Europe) to [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age_Europe) periods. The actual significance of these symbols in the prehistoric period is not known, but from their ubiquity and apparent importance the symbols have been adopted in various schools of [Neopaganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopaganism), [esotericism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotericism) and [occultism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism).

&gt;Currently, the same symbol is recognized in astronomy as a representation of the Earth, but not the Sun, which is recognized by a ""point-in-circle"" symbol.

A cookbook published in Catalan in 1520, the Libre del Coch by Ruperto de Nola, mentions empanadas filled with seafood among its recipes of Catalan, Italian, French, and Arabian food.[4][5] In turn, empanadas and the similar calzones are both believed to be derived from the Indian meat-filled pies, samosas.[6] All these pastries have common origins in India and the Middle East.

What what?  
Edit: [An English translation of Ruperto de Nola's ""Libre del Coch"" by Lady Brighid ni Chiarain.](http://www.florilegium.org/?http%3A//www.florilegium.org/files/FOOD-MANUSCRIPTS/Guisados1-art.html)  
Edit II: [Despite the modern pasty's strong association with Cornwall, its exact origins are unclear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_Pasty)  
It is hilarious that someone wrote that a variation spread to Mexico, seeing as how It is very understandable that someone writing the page from Cornwall, would have little knowledge of anything Mexican. I would think that Spanish people bringing Empanadas to Mexico would be a given. Go figure. Good luck convincing someone Mexican of that one. They certainly don't have authentic Mexican restaurants in Europe.  
Pride is a history distorter. Meat filled dough is universal in world cuisine further back than anyone can trace, steamed, baked, and fried, and otherwise.

A knish consists of a filling covered with dough that is either baked, grilled, or deep fried. Knishes can be purchased from street vendors in urban areas with a large Jewish population,

Geez, how much evidence do I need to cut through the English pride?  
''Many cultures have variations of baked, grilled, or fried dough-covered snacks to which epicurean family the knish belongs including the Cornish pasty, the Scottish Bridie, the Jamaican patty, the Spanish and Latin American empanada, the Middle Eastern fatayer, the Portuguese rissol (rissole), the Italian calzone, the Indian samosa, the Texas klobasnek, the Czech kolache, the Polish pierogi, the Russian Pirozhki, and the Ukrainian Pyrizhky.''

There is a lot of garbage out there and I would classify what you linked as being in the same category probably. 

As cheap as you probably want to go is something like this (by no means high quality, but at least decent)

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__14634__Turnigy_TrackStar_1_10th_Scale_60A_Car_ESC_Version_2.html

And for motors really anything goes (motors have very few components, are easy to manufacture) but there are matching motors from turnigy

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__27867__Turnigy_Trackstar_1_10_17_0T_2400KV_Brushless.html

In general for cheap stuff the turnigy trackstar line is probably an okay bet, there are a few different kinds to choose from. But the ones linked are the cheapest I think. 

Also make sure to order from your local hobbyking warehouse if you ever order there. There are US, EU, AUS etc warehouses

I would be more than happy if UK farms went bankrupt because of cheap Spanish produce; if Spain can produce items cheaper they should be able to control the market. Farming, in my opinion, should be about progression and not about farming the same crop year in year out. 

Larger farms mean that farmers can get better prices for produce, as they have more to sell they can demand higher prices. They can also get better prices for seed, fuel and equipment because of the bulk they buy. I personally don't agree with having too large farms, but also would prefer to see arable farms of 150-250 acres which can provide work for a ""farmily"" and several workers. 

If CAP ended I would expect France to subsidise their farmers due to the amount of poverty/stuff being dumped in Paris. CAP is a lifeline for many small farms but on the other hand, a very large farm near me brings in over Â£50,000 a year in subsidies which is a pittance for them as they have a ridiculous amount of turnover. 

It would be better to provide grants for farmers to diversify, gain support and get loans at cost to provide them capital to buy more productive animals and more economical equipment.

Allies of the US aren't that hard to invade.

And this isn't WW2 anymore, such military actions can be done even quicker now.

If the US would cut it's military by 90%, it would have to pull away from almost all bases abroad, exposing a lot of countries to potential threats and reducing American political and economical influence over the world. I would be happy about that, at least if they pulled out of Europe, but the US itself wouldn't benefit from that in the slightest.

The EU institutions don't talk about this much as it's sort of taken for granted that the nations of the EU have already agreed to this goal in principle which they haven't really. If you put the concept of a federal European state up for a vote right now I don't think most Western countries would be up for it. 

It doesn't help that the UK constitution does not in principle allow federalism to happen. Parliament is sovereign and cannot be bound beyond one parliament and thus being subject to ultimate government from somewhere else is unconstitutional. That's not to say we couldn't change the constitution but naturally that would receive huge opposition from traditionalists and conservatives and others besides.

The US needs to raise the profile of the league, so they're trying to bring in high profile players (for plenty of teams). How do they get these players?

&gt;

&gt;The __Mongol military tactics and organization__ enabled the [Mongol Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire) to conquer nearly all of continental Asia, the Middle East and parts of eastern Europe.

&gt;The original foundation of that system was an extension of the nomadic lifestyle of the Mongols. Other elements were invented by Genghis Khan, his generals, and his successors. Technologies useful to attack fortifications were adapted from other cultures, and foreign technical experts integrated into the command structures.

&gt;For the larger part of the 13th century, the Mongols lost only a few battles using that system, and always returned to turn the result around in their favor. In many cases, they won against significantly larger opposing armies. Their first defeat in the West came in 1223 at the [Battle of Samara Bend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Samara_Bend) by the hands of the [Volga Bulgars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Bulgars). The second one was at the [Battle of Ain Jalut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ain_Jalut) in 1260, against the first army which had been specifically trained to use their own tactics against them.    But again they would return over 40 years later and defeat the Egyptian Mamluks at the [Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wadi_al-Khazandar) in 1299 and annex Syria, Palestine as well as Gaza. The Mongols suffered defeats in attempted [invasions of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Vietnam) and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Japan). But while the empire became divided around the same time, its combined size and influence remained largely intact for more than another hundred years

What we're doing is right. In case foreigners don't know, Asian MM is much more polluted than EU/US MM. There's less rage hackers but much more subtle/closet hackers.

If you really didn't cheat but got raped by our hackers, then it's most likely due to you or your teamates used to lobby with other cheaters. Again as cipher has mentioned we don't guarantee a draw to legit players.

Spend at least 2% of your gross income setting up a balance of insurances. The best mix of permanent life (ideally that grows over time), critical illness, health and disability. Most of that stuff is going to be completely irrelevant to you right now, especially life insurance, but you are going to want\need it some day. The idea is lock in your rates now while you're young and healthy, keep it dirt cheap for your entire life. You probably have some sort of group benefits package through work, but if you start your own company\get laid off\switch companies you will lose them or have them  changed. Policies in your name are under your control.

Life insurance right now is near useless to you other than covering some small debts and final expenses (legally in Canada your debts can't transfer to your parents, but that's not going to stop creditors from calling your grieving family demanding money) but you don't want to end up paying the bank $500 a month to cover your mortgage if you die because you're 40 and have a small health issue.

Insurance is the most hated aspect by most in the financial field, but arguably one of the most important. Plan for the worst, hope for the best.",t3_27152v,t3_27152v,personalfinance,t5_2qstm,

We can talk about lack of efficiency in the case we have two team with the same mechanical skill and knowledge. One optimize rotations, picks, etc, the other don't. Here we can talk about efficiency, we can see it from Efficiency definition, which is

&gt; Efficiency generally describes the extent to which time, effort or cost is well used for the intended task or purpose.

Both team know that stuff, but one of them doesn't take advantage of that, using not time, effort or money but skill and knowledge. LCS teaches with differences between NA-EU and korean playstile. 

In our case instead, one of the players not only doesn't know that stuff, but he doesn't know either most simple stuff. 
We can see this applied in placement games: challenger players win games almost not matter what, silver can be carried one game or two, but at the end they will turn up where they belong. 

Besides actually silver and challenger playstiles aren't very different: meta is the same, champions are the same, the only discerning thing is the skill level. A challenger can play at silver conditions, but he will still win in CS, harass, zoning, TF position, rotations, warding, bla, bla.

The single best predictor of violent crime in every US state and DC is the percentage of the population that is black or hispanic. It's a 0.81 correlation, compared to a 0.35 correlation for level of poverty, 0.36 for education &amp; unemployment figures.

Nearly one in three African American males aged 20â29 are under some form of criminal justice supervision whether imprisoned, jailed, on parole or probation.

According to 2013 Chicago PD crime statistics posted on their website, blacks committed 80% of homicides there last year.

In the US, a black male born in 1990 or later has a &gt;25% chance of spending time in prison or jail at some point in his life

About one out of nine African American men will be incarcerated between the ages of 20 and 34.

In Atlanta, blacks are about 50% of the population, but committed almost all the violent crime there in 2013 and 2012.

Because its a completely different topic and copyrightes material is already removed from google index sites.

For the readers who quickly skimmed through the article or only read the first paragraph or so for a summary (which I'm sure there are many), before it appeared to change subject to Nigel Farage's 'triumph in the European elections', it would seem that UKIP's only priority is to bring back grammar schools and cut taxes for the rich (not also caring about/helping the low earners).

It doesnt look sexy on paper but, like i said, it's solid. To be good in the World Cup you need a good defense, a goal or two in perfect moments and a bit of luck of course. I think our defense is one of the best in the tournament. You all know Pepe and CoentrÃ£o, Bruno Alves is a tough CB who gets the job very well done and id also say that it's one of the best in the tournament in offesive corners (Pepe also a great weapon in this aspect). JoÃ£o Pereira is another tough dude, despite being small. He's not afraid of anything and he's going to support the attack without any problems if needed. Rui PatrÃ­cio is like a mini Courtois except for all the hype. Too bad for the kid that he started his career before reddit was created :(

Midfield is another sector that doesnt seems sexy at all. Moutinho was, and still is i guess that's why he's playing for fucking Monaco, overlooked. I havent seen him play this season but he has been of the best midfielders in Europe until here so im going to guess that that it's going to continue. Meireles is getting old, he's a good player but probably the worst out of the three, still gets the job done. Veloso is good with set pieces, has great passing skills. Let's see how he helps the defense tho im assuming he starts ahead of William since he's more experienced and despite not being a all-time great you cant say he's bad either.

In the attack we obviously have the best player in the world and another guy who 2/3 years ago, if im not mistaken, was carrying Manchester United. It's funny how things change, now Nani is not only not viewed as World Class (inb4 he never was ""jokes"") anymore but he became the whipping boy for everybody. Im totally confident on Nani, he always delivered for Portugal, he has always been consistent and i remember, not so long ago, to call out Ronaldo to play for Portugal more like Nani does, i wasnt the only one to do it either. The strikers are all bad, they are the weakest sector by far. Postiga should start, sometimes he scores so lets all hope that happens again.

People have very short term memory. This is the same team that outplayed, and lost with a lucky goal against the almighy germans less than 2 years ago. People look at the scores see that we lost against Russia, that we lost against Ecuador, see a 0-0 against Greece, see that Ronaldo scored all 4 goals against Sweden... And think that this is a shitty team where Ronaldo is the only good player. Maybe we are not as good as i think but we for sure arent as bad as most of you dudes think either.

After all this talk, and have in mind that our substitutes are useless for this level outside of William, Vieirinha and maybe Neto, a injury to a key player can change everything.

everythingismagical,,True,16,16,0,1401640799,,False,1434046992,t1_chwgckj,0,False,0,chwgckj,,"I understand that you're trying to give kudos to The History Channel for focusing its broadcast lineup on an actual historical event, but I think that the series does more harm than good in terms of education. 

Each episode portrayed the Americans as the sole heroes of the 20th century. The inaccuracies were, for the most part, limited to the props and set decoration, rather than historical facts. But the factual elements that were kept out leave viewers with a gross misunderstanding of the war itself. 

Now, I know that the series attempted to take 30 years of events from multiple countries and smush it down into 3 episodes, so of course some elements will be left out. Perhaps if they had titled it ""America's Role in World War I and World War II"", I might be a bit more sympathetic. But it didn't. It decided to take on European history from 1914-1945, from the American outsider's perspective.

Take the portrayal of the Holocaust, for example. It was barely mentioned, as it didn't really factor into the American story of WWII. The World Wars only spared a moment to discuss the deportations to concentration camps, and that focused on the deportations of German Jews. In reality, only a small percentage of German Jews were deported (Germany only had a small population of Jews before the war - .75 percent of the population - and many left while they still could [Source](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005161) ). The majority of deportations occurred in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Italy. Once Germany had control over these countries, they implemented the mass deportation programs to death camps, not concentration camps. [Source](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005372) The World Wars failed to highlight this difference. They also did not mention that over one million of the Jews that they murdered were killed in mass shootings in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and the USSR. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen)

The World Wars heavily dramatized an element of this: Hitler did not have Europe's Jews executed in gas chambers despite the fact that 'he knew what breathing poison gas was like,' as The World Wars claimed. First, the gas used in WWI was entirely different from the gas used in WWII's gas chambers. Second, Hitler did not make this decision. The decision was made at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, and it was made by his subordinates. [Source](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477)

When the Americans liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp in April 1945, they saw horrific things. But that in no way compares to the horror that the Soviets witnessed when they liberated the Auschwitz death camp five months earlier in January 1945. [Source](http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/liberation-of-auschwitz) This went unmentioned by The World Wars. The Soviet advance into German territory took them past all six of the death camps, where the majority of the Nazis victims lost their lives. The Germans had seen the Soviet advance in many of these cases, however, and destroyed Majdanek, Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka before the Soviets could see what was occurring there. [Source](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005131) While the concentration camp system was incredibly deadly, due to a lack of food, water, shelter, and constant torture, it was not the execution system that the death camps were. 

Mentioning the exemptions that The World Wars made and only focusing on the Holocaust here might seem like nit-picking, but failing to mention these points allows The History Channel to portray Hitler as an even more grandiose figure, as a mastermind who remained full in charge of all of the actions of WWII. But he did not. His subordinates, in a large and uncoordinated bureaucracy, did this. They did it in a bureaucratic system that made few people brave enough to speak against their subordinates in protest of the mechanical killing that the Nazis perpetrated. It is important to continue educating people of this in order to ensure that it NEVER happens again. Merely focusing on Hitler in shows like this might just encourage people to assume that we all just shouldn't allow a racist to come into any kind of power. But one of the greater lessons to be learned from this is to stay away from dehumanization. People cannot be just numbers, groups of populations, pockets of ethnicities or religions. We cannot hold citizenship as the key to humanization, but we need to recognize that every single person deserves the equal opportunity for education, healthcare, employment, and civic responsibilities.

The story is so much more complex than what The World Wars portrayed, and it doesn't take graduate courses in history, or even college courses, to be able to understand that. The History Channel gives people far too little credit, and delving into these complex issues wouldn't lose the attentions of its viewers, I think it would only serve to increase its viewership. I'm sorry for the massive amount of text and I'm so glad that you were excited by and fascinated with history!

I like just being around and taking the backseat to the story (ex: playing a bard in the most literal way). I think shadowrun has a lot of interesting potential for parallel characters. If your player team has a critical weakness (no matrix or magic), you can have her fill that role very well in a narrative way. I suggest a low power phenomenon that you'd never let a normal player get away with (think kid's managa or disney secondary characters). Here are some suggestions;

&gt; What I suggest mechanically

* For most of the things the character does directly, see how she prefers to play. You might want to skip rolling dice entirely and just give her narrative strenght (maybe give her a pool of X amount of actions she can use **smackdown** on per game sessions. I suggest 3)

* Give her a critter/spirit/sprite template.

* Let her buy skills or improve stats with Karma like everyone. Over time she'll be able to help with teamwork tests (maybe give her leadership instead, from the get-go, if you like that skill)

&gt; What character archetype I would suggest...

* A force 2 Spirit or Sprite (A small free spirit or an emerging AI). Use the appropriate template for its type as-is. If a Sprite, you may want to let her have taken possession of a small flying drone. (If she like creepy things, have her play as a ghost [spirit of man] or one of those matrix ghosts [somone who died trapped in the 1.0 crash])

* An awakened critter/A transmogrified person. Ever seen/read a magical girl show/book? I have a feeling that's the kind of character she's suggesting.

* An Homunculus

* An european fairy/pixie.

&gt; What I suggest narratively

* Play it as a familiar ; Either a player's familiar, a dragon's familiar who sent her as a messenger/supervisor for the hired runners or the bad guy's familiar who ran away.

* Give her a subplot. A goal that she works toward but must use the players to achieve.",t3_270yy1,t3_270yy1,Shadowrun,t5_2s4v2,

OK, that's fine with me.

&gt;The one talked about primarily in the media, Armatix, uses RFID, and has a remote kill switch.

So...let's use something else? I'm not talking about something that exists on the market necessarily. If we only ever stuck with what we currently had instead of developing new technology to solve problems, we'd still be beating each other with pointy sticks.

&gt;That doesn't dismiss the argument. Tyranny always takes advantage of registration lists. Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.

There *is* no argument, though. For a couple of reasons:

1. Imagine the Nazis had not confiscated any guns...do you think WWII would *really* have played out all that differently? No. Jews might have shot a few more SS officers (which is nice), but by and large I'd bet a lot of money that most of Europe would still have sat and watched as their local Jews were taken away...they'd just have done it with a rifle over their fireplace, instead of not having a rifle over their fireplace.

2. The fact that the Nazis used something (in this case gun control) for evil (although actually Nazi gun control laws [are pretty misunderstood](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4029&amp;context=flr)) does not mean the thing itself is inherently flawed. The Nazis used gun control to keep the populace under control because the Nazis used everything to keep the populace under control. The police force, for example, was also co-opted...does that mean we should abolish the police force in the US? After all, the Nazis used police against their own citizens, would a tyrannical US government be any different? Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it...we should abolish the police force before the government becomes tyrannical and uses it against us!

&gt;That simply isn't true and your cherry picked examples don't prove anything. There was a stabbing in canada with 5 deaths, 100% fatality. There have been many knife attacks in china with numerous deaths, including a kindergarten attack using knife and gasoline with 12 dead.

My examples aren't cherry-picked; they come from the same wikipedia link you chose, in fact. And while the Shiguan killer did manage to break the halfway barrier, he still didn't kill nearly as many as were killed at Shady Hook. 

&gt;The deadliest mass murders in this country were committed using explosives or arson, still the deadliest means of mass murder.

Yes, but those are pretty much all acts of terrorism, not the lone-psycho cases we're talking about here. No one is suggesting that gun control would do anything to stop the next 9-11 or the next Oklahoma City bombing. It wouldn't. That doesn't mean, though, that it wouldn't stop other cases of mass murder.

&gt;You mean like the knife and car? Half of the dead were killed with a knife. Of the total number injured or killed, the vast majority were not impacted by the fact that he had a gun at all.
We've seen horrible mass murders in this country with just a car

Right, but again, the fact that it's possible to use other weapons to kill effectively does not prove that different gun control wouldn't be effective in terms of stopping some killings. No one is suggesting that if guns are banned, murder and tragedy would disappear.  ",t3_270shr,t1_chwg30s,PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,

Agricultural interventionism in the developing world is largely (outside of your regular political corruption) the result of western protectionism. West used subsidies introduced on a wide scale as national policies to counter economic crises in the 30s (because protectionism was invented much earlier on in the mercantilist era and beyond). That had the result of lowering the minimum acceptable price of final goods and worked as dumping. In tandem with trade tariffs it prevented the developing countries from exporting agricultural goods which turned out too expensive. So those countries started to subsidize the goods themselves to help out their big landowners make money.

If the US and EU dropped subsidies then there would be less incentive for subsidies abroad in poorer countries. But there obviously is also a political issue because now that they're getting it all the farmers like free money and guaranteed prices. It's like state-guaranteed pensions - an easy way to live at someone else's expense that really takes an educated mind to see through the failure.

But TBH there's really no way to eliminate trade subsidies as long as we have the current financial system. Any fiat currency has drawbacks that will require a giant repressive fiscal system so the best way to do it is return to non-fiat currencies determined by markets.  Those old ones backed by resources - gold, silver  - and new ones like digital cryptocurrencies - bitcoin etc.  That is the only way to eliminate the massive discrepancy between purchasing power and exchange rate which would result in GDP figures getting closer to what they are in PPP terms. 

But then the corruption involved in banking in finance is orders of magnitude bigger than any sort of subsidy for farmers. Nobody set up CAP to rule over European farmers the same way IMF, World Bank and Bretton Woods were set up to rule over the world of finance.

At the moment, I don't see a great deal of transparency about who is 'elected' to lead the EU in this role. It appears to be someone who is implemented after the fact.

Except you said 'Muricans can't find 'Murica on a map. What that has to do with a backwater country like Ukraine is beyond me.

&gt;The UK is America Jr? Right of course, because the country that was around an extremely long time before the US can be it's 'junior', did I forget to mention the US wouldn't even exist without the UK? So if anything mate, you're country is the Britain Jr.

That really has more to do with how you measure the age of a country. I'm sure if I was saying these things about Germany some guy would go on about the noble and ancient heritage of Germany and how old it is, while in reality modern Germany is only about 60 years old.

&gt;And Canada is hardly America Jr either, as they too would not exist without the British who fought off the French and later the US from invading it so many times, but yeh, just think what you want, I don't expect somebody who had to make up a USAF spacecraft just to make the US look 'big' to know alot.

All of Europe and Canada are America Jr. None of you can do anything without the US being involved or having the US's good graces. You're all just vassal states to the mighty Empire of the United States. 

In any case, your nationalism is showing, as well as your british arrogance and all around assholery; which is why, my haughty islander friend, this discussion has gone from something respectable about the existence of the USAF having a top secret spacecraft, to you doing the typical european redditor bash on america thing. 

Do you think I care about what you think of the gang of thugs that claim lordship over my geographic location? No, I don't. Do you think I care about what you think about me? No. Mostly because you weren't able to see trolling in plain sight. 

You want to wax poetic about Soyuz and think the US sucks because they don't want to depend on Russia? Fine, go for it, I won't even attempt to stop you. Actually, I even pretty much agreed. However, the Russians have really done nothing in space. Lots of big plans, sure, but without the US needing them to supply the ISS, I don't think Soyuz would be around anymore. 

The X-37C will be able to carry people, and the X-37 is already in operation.

Dragon has already docked with the ISS and is all set to provide crews within 2 years. 

The only reason these are taking so long is because of testing. Lots of testing as mandated by the government, and by the companies themselves. Apollo was pretty much done and ready in a few years. As was Gemini. They were expensive and not reusable, which is what Boeing and SpaceX are trying to overcome. 

We have the ability, we just expect more, and so more time is taken with modern craft. Use a Dragon capsule Apollo style and we'd be all set already.",t3_26vje2,t1_chwbc84,KerbalSpaceProgram,t5_2smr1,

&gt; Britain, is suffering from the half-century humiliating withdrawal from the empire, the catastrophic diminishing of its world status as well as the gradual realization that Britain no longer rules the waves - and that its former upstart colony now does. Britain must choose whether to commit itself to the European project and let its empire die a dignified death or be on the periphery of the Union, forever looking in.

If anyone is suffering from post imperial dreams is the upstart 'European' nations that have a dream of creating some sort, of as you put it, 'superstate'.  Countries where Euroscepticism is highest, the UK, Greece, Italy, and France, have all contributed to the basic idea and history of Europe.  On the other hand, countries where EU integration is the strongest are also the ones that came out as losers in the days of imperialism.  Since they don't have a very proud history, they try to co-opt other people's history as 'European' history or even more ridiculous as 'white history'.  They all ride on the coat tails of the accomplishments of the previous 4 countries.  Some, like Germany, are embarrassed of their past as being the barbarians that brought down the Roman empire or their Nazi heritage, and try to form a new identity as Europeans.  All in all a very strange group of people headed by out of touch bureaucrats, the sorts of people that grow up imagining themselves to be great military leaders like Julius Caesar, that are preparing us for some [new imagined race war.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SYwV9034kM)  I wouldn't be surprised if people are goose stepping down the streets of Berlin once again in the quest for this superstate in the coming years.
