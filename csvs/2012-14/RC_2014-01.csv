&gt;Poverty and starvation has killed many, many more people than sweatshops have.

Really? That's your argument for unbridled capitalism ""Sweatshops are better than poverty and starvation"". You know what's killed even fewer people than sweatshops? Human rights and a welfare state that ensures people eat and have a place to live. Some might consider that better than spending your life in a sweatshop. 

Where would you rather work, a sweatshop in Malaysia or a clothing factory in Norway? I'm actually asking you. If your answer is Norway, then maybe there are some advantages to being in a western democracy with protections for workers and a welfare state.  

&gt;There is still a near-universal demand for products and services with robust safety standards and excellent customer service, and there are plenty of companies that provide that today. 

No there isn't. Do you know how many people buy things made in sweatshops? What you mean to say is ""There is still a near-universal demand for products and services with robust safety standards unless the people don't know about the safety standards being violated or they decide they want the product so much they decide they don't care about them (cf. iPhones)."" Again, your ability to oversimplify boggles the mind. 

Also, there is still a near-universal demand for representation and services with robust safety standards and excellent customer service, and there are plenty of **countries** that provide that today. 

&gt;Similarly, there are plenty of companies that have shitty safety standards and shitty customer service, and those companies are not generally doing very well financially. 

Some of them aren't. Some of them are. 

How many people do you know of in America, where I'm assuming you live, know what oil companies are doing in Nigeria? They don't. So there is no dent in reputation, there is no boycott, there is no loss of profit. Your arguments seem to hinge on the completely false idea that people have perfect access to what companies do all the time, every day, everywhere. 

&gt;Right, and who wants to buy a product that has killed other people? 

I sure don't. Can you tell me exactly which ones those are? No? You mean the company didn't tell you it did something unsafe that might have killed someone? 

&gt;Does the absence of state prevent private regulatory agencies from forming? 

No, but it does provide a playing ripe for them to be bribed. You know that already exists right? Companies paying for fake ""certification"" from shell companies they form to provide certifications. Here's one example of something similar http://venturevillage.eu/safe-harbour-false-claims-europe That took me 10 seconds to look up. 
Funny thing, companies lie to make themselves look better in order to deceive their clients/customers. 

&gt;Governments rarely give a shit about their reputation, because they don't need to convince people to give them money. 

Yes, they do. Not money, but stuff. The world is pretty flat. Governments trade resources with each other and corporations and cooperate on any number of levels. If I have a shitty reputation no one will trade or cooperate with me. Read your game theory and international relations. 

&gt;Unlike companies, the can just take money from you.

No, they really can't. I mean the state can to a certain extent. But any government running the state knows that there is only certain things they can do, so much money they can take, while in power or else risk either a revolt or being voted out. 

Moreover, they can only take money from you if you have money. This means they have to have companies in their borders that will hire people. Whether or not these companies move here or there *is a function, in part, of the reputation of the country*. If you blow a lot of people up for no reason or spy on companies in your borders, then companies will leave and go someplace else, then your people will have fewer jobs and then you'll have less money. Consequences from reputation. Just like companies. Just like companies it is imperfect. Countries get away with things the same way companies get away with things. But this also means countries need to compete for better reputations in order to increase their tax base. This isn't voodoo economics, I'm not just making this up. This is all pretty straightforward international relations/economics stuff.  

&gt;Businesses are slaves to the demands of the consumer, while individuals and businesses are slaves to the demands of the state. 

So all of democracy is a lie? Seriously. I want you to tell me if you think every election since the beginning of democracy was a complete fabrication. Because if so I can go now because I'm talking to a crazy person and if not then it's pretty obvious who is in control of the state. 

&gt;It's also hard to assume that competitors won't try to point out the fact that their competitor's products are harming people more than theirs.

Oh, I'm sure they will. And then this company will lie and say the other company is doing the poisoning...etc. until no one knows what to think. Since no one knows what to think, they'll just shop wherever and nothing about their actions will regulate the market. 

&gt;Holy shit, and you assume that governments are these perfect institutions that magically prevent people from harming themselves with evil capitalist products.

Not perfect at all. Sometimes they do horrible things. I think, on the whole (not your incredibly biased analysis) they've done more good things than bad and are, generally, headed in the direction of more human welfare and rights. I also think roughly the same thing about companies. You, on the other hand have a completely skewed version of states in your head and an idealized, oversimplified picture of how markets work.

You don't seem to understand that there is a natural progression from subsistence farming to the lifestyle that the middle class enjoys in the developed world, and that progression involves these terrible sweatshops that mysteriously don't exist that much in the first world anymore (thanks to the labor movement and the income generated by the very sweatshops themselves). You seem to believe that sweatshops are bad. I would ask you to open your mind and recognize that people don't just magically build two story houses and buy Priuses after thousands of years of working on rice paddies. [Watch this video, for example.](http://www.ted.com/talks/leslie_t_chang_the_voices_of_china_s_workers.html)

Yes, the iPhone example. Well, I don't own one, I own an android phone. Of course, that isn't a counterargument. [This is a counterargument.](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/foremski/media-gets-its-facts-wrong-working-at-foxconn-significantly-cuts-suicide-risk/1356) The issue of the poor workers in Chinese sweatshops is vastly overstated.

&gt;No, they really can't. 

What the hell do you think taxes are. Justified or not, it is the government taking money from you.

&gt;No, but it does provide a playing ripe for them to be bribed. You know that already exists right?

Yeah, and government agencies can be bribed, too. [this took me 10 seconds to look up as well](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/business/exposing-the-fda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm).

&gt;Moreover, they can only take money from you if you have money. 

Correct, this is why it is better for countries to tax people instead of just killing them and taking their stuff. If there is more stuff being produced, there is more stuff to take.

&gt;So all of democracy is a lie? Seriously. I want you to tell me if you think every election since the beginning of democracy was a complete fabrication.

No, it isn't a 'lie'. In a democracy, the state is the government selected by the majority. In countries with several political parties, it is often only the plurality. Regardless of whether or not the government represents 1% or 51% of its subjects, it still has power over 100% of the people in its domain. That's my point. Not ""democracy is a lie lololol"".

&gt;Yes, they do. Not money, but stuff. The world is pretty flat. Governments trade resources with each other and corporations and cooperate on any number of levels. If I have a shitty reputation no one will trade or cooperate with me. Read your game theory and international relations.

Correct. North Korea isn't a bastion of commerce, for example. Unlike governments, however, businesses don't run around taking people's money. Businesses run out of money if they can't find people to do business with them, they can't send people into labor camps or force people to starve like the USSR did to Ukraine in the 1930s.

&gt;I think, on the whole (not your incredibly biased analysis) they've done more good things than bad and are, generally, headed in the direction of more human welfare and rights. 

I'd have to agree on some level on the second point. Thanks to mass media, society is more skeptical as ever about human rights violations. On your first point that they ""do more good than bad"" I'd have to disagree. They provide order, but since the dawn of time they've been more or less a bunch of mobs.

The great Roman philosopher, Cicero, said it best:
&gt;&gt;And so if justice is left out, what are kingdoms except great robber bands? For what are robber bands except little kingdoms? The band also is a group of men governed by the orders of a leader, bound by a social compact, and its booty is divided according to a law agreed upon. If by repeatedly adding desperate men this plague grows to the point where it holds territory and establishes a fixed seat, seizes cities and subdues people, then it more conspicuously assumes the name of kingdom, and this name is now openly granted to it, not for any subtraction of cupidity, but by addition of impunity. For it was an elegant and true reply that was made to Alexander the Great by a certain pirate whom he had captured. When the king asked him what he was thinking of, that he should molest the sea, he said with defiant independence: 'The same as you when you molest the world!

Most of the time slaves were traded for muskets and cannons so that they could fight foreign invaders trying to colonize them.   

Africa was a very wealthy land of many distinct nations and cultures. You really think all the central European powers would have invaded and claimed the continent if it wasn't? The only reason Europeans didn't invade sooner was because it was a pain in the ass to traverse the land and naval technology hadn't developed enough. If you study history you would know the continent was literally robbed naked of most of its resources with many Western powers with their hand in their pockets still to this day.  

Traditional slavery was also vastly different from chattel slavery that was the atlantic slave trade. Most slaves had rights, could eventually earn their freedom, were entitled to ownership of things, etc... same with many slave trades in the Mediterranean. Chattel took it to a completely different level of brutality and displacement where slaves were considered as ""cattle"" and considered nonhuman property with no restrictions on their treatment.

The condition Africa is in today is the aftermath of such colonization, along with most other 3rd world nations, and America's anti-revolutionist, anti-democratic military ventures in the name of capitalism. Many of these shit nations could be first world countries if America and other large military powers weren't pimping them.

This post is primarily sourced from lectures on the history of the U.S. Navy, and as such will primarily be focused on the legitimizing effect of the Spanish-American war on the USN.

**TL;DR: Yes, the Spanish-American War legitimized the US Navy and American foreign policy as worthy of foreign respect, if not necessarily outright concern.**

The Spanish-American War did legitimize American foreign policy in the eyes of the major world powers.  It did not at all threaten anyone who didn't speak Spanish, but European governments began to respect American diplomacy.  It wasn't until World War I that anyone (the British) became seriously frightened of America*.

First for some context: the USN's historical relationship with the American nation might charitably be called ""abusive"" prior to the 1880's  The sole exceptions to a tradition of Congressional neglect and dreadful unfamiliarity with naval matters were during times of war, when America would ask the USN to go toe-to-toe with the enemy *du jour*, and be sorely disappointed when the only response they got was one or two worm-riddled 30-year-old hulks limping their way out of harbor.

A prime example would be the naval thought of the American government prior to the War of 1812.  Defense of the American coast was to be accomplished through forts and ""gunboats"" while privateers raided enemy shipping.  The British found the forts.  They either bombarded them to pieces from a distance, or simply sailed around them.  The British found the gunboats.  A single British frigate could swat aside entire squadrons of what were essentially schooners that shook themselves to pieces when they fired their single gun.

This perpetual neglect, punctuated by wartime panic, primarily changed in the 1880's when Congress and then-President Garfield finally realized how utterly impotent America was to enforcing the much-touted Monroe Doctrine.  War erupted between Peru and Bolivia on one side, and Chile on the other, and the United States found itself watching impotently on the sidelines, suddenly realizing that these South American ""minors"" had more naval power individually than the nation claiming hegemony over two entire continents.  At the same time, the US was acquiring overseas possessions in the Pacific (attracting the attention of the British and Germans), and a French company was attempting to construct what would eventually become the Panama Canal square inside America's proclaimed sphere of influence.

All of these issues of foreign policy required seapower to resolve, so the US bought construction plans from the British, props and other highly specialized parts from other European sources, and began constructing the USN.  As the ""New Navy"" expanded, Congress began to attach ""US-made"" stipulations to the funding authorizations that jump-started the American ship-building industry.  Similarly, knowledge about naval affairs and the Mahanian school of thought began to take hold in Congress, with members of the House pushing for the construction of blue-water battleships, and members of the Senate arguing for a fleet-in-being doctrine as opposed to pursuing an outdated *guerre de course*.  Even Benjamin Tracey, the Secretary of the Navy, got in on the more aggressive talk, writing in his 1889 report of the necessity to beat off the enemy and threaten *his* coast.

By the time the Spanish-American war came about, the USN had in its TO&amp;E:

* 4 first-class battleships, Indiana, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Iowa

* 2 second-class battleships, Texas and Maine

* 2 armored cruisers

* 10 protected cruisers

With a handful of support craft, these ships were mostly organized into one single Atlantic Squadron and schooled for the first time in USN history in a single, coherent, Mahanian doctrine.  You'll note, however, that all these changes were internal - while close observers would have noticed that the USN had suddenly gotten its act together, not many people were really observing the US that closely.  Europe was far more concerned with Europe.

The Spanish-American War is what suddenly twigged the European popular opinion to stop dismissing the American Navy (and thus, American foreign policy) as toothless invective.  Spain, though on the decline, was still a European power, and similar to the Japanese victory over the Russians, it took the defeat of one European power for the rest of them to take a non-European country seriously.

*The Royal Navy built by a simple rule - British naval strength should equal the next two most powerful navies combined.  After World War I, with the entire European continent in economic ruin from The Great War, the comparatively unscathed United States was in prime position to begin spending oodles of money on a navy that would seriously threaten Great Britain's naval superiority.

My support for worker cooperatives comes from the workers are the ones who are mixing their labour with the raw materials (and machinery if you wish to extend the line to that) thus making the products theirs. And my support for credit unions comes from wanting the workers to have a bit more control over their wealth.

&gt;As well, market socialism requires theft. Worker coops and credit unions simply cannot create and finance the types of operations that take advantage of modern manufacturing. That isn't to say they don't have value, but they simply could not create the MASSIVE amount of wealth we have today in modern nations.

Firstly, only if one counts using taxes to fund programs (like the [Marcora Law](http://wikipreneurship.eu/index.php5?title=Marcora_Law)) in order to increase the number of cooperatives (so that they can gain the momentum to gain total market share) as theft.

Secondly, I consider capitalist enterprises to be at least extortion-adjacent (if not fully fledged theft), so the previously stated actions would be justified.

Thirdly, the workers are the ones making the products the profits (and thus, the wealth) are based on, so (unless you're referring to some unstated deficiency in coops and credit unions) once market socialism is implemented, that wouldn't be a reason it would fail.

The courts certainly didn't provide that when we went from Clinton to Bush in the international sphere.

I don't think you know what you're talking about with regards to the Moroccan monarch. The reason that he's moderately popular is because he's apolitical, without ties to any of the radicalism in his country - as one person put it, the Feminists and Lefties like him because he protects them from the Islamists, and the Islamists like him because he protects them from the Feminists and Lefties.

Moreover, I still don't think you have your definitions strait. **Authoritarian != Totalitarian != Monarch**.  Let me repeat that so you stop using them interchangeably. **Authoritarian != Totalitarian != Monarch**. I think your question is fairly specious, though. Everyone has to care about popular opinion, it's a fact of politics - popular opinion is too powerful a tool in any system of government to neglect. They may manipulate popular opinion to suit their own ends, or try to stymie the ability of the people to use it, but everyone cares about it. Claiming that authoritarians, or totalitarians, or the million forms of monarchists, don't need to care about popular opinion is absurd.


But claiming that any leader has represented the ""popular will"" or that there is a ""popular will"" is incredibly reductionist. Can a congress with one of the lowest approval ratings in history be said to represent the popular will?  Can they even be said to represent the bare majority that elected them? On top of that, **what is** the popular will? Can you define that for me? And don't say the will of the people. As I said,  the entire notion of a ""people's will"" is incredibly reductionist, as what people want varies wildly from region to region or even village to village, not to mention class variations and ethnic/cultural differences. What is the popular will of a multi-ethnic, multi-national empire? Is the popular will even something you want to endorse? In European history, the antisemitic impulse was an inherently populist one, and populist politicians would frequently wield it along with xenophobia for their own ends. 


Historically, different monarchies have been more or less in tune with the lower classes at different points. In Prussia, Monarchical institutions and civil services often used burghers, lower classes, and minorities to avoid ceding power to the regional nobility. In essence, the power of the Monarch was tied into the power of the populace. In Austria-Hungary, even as minorities clamored for more autonomy, few wanted actual independence because of the protection that the Hapsburg umbrella provided. In France and England, for a long time the centralization that took place after the 100 years war was accompanied by an informal alliance between the Monarch and the lower/developing middle classes, as the Monarch looked to create meritocratic institutions to fight the powers of decentralization represented by the regional nobility.",t3_1u40rb,False,t1_ceeg2i3,Politus,3,Constitutionalism (Con),DebateMonarchy

The biggest difference between the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation is the USSR's involvement in global geopolitics during the Cold War. Russian foreign policy has been, in contrast, heavily restricted to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc. Putin doesn't pretend Russia is the world police; he isn't sending troops to every humanitarian crisis or dictator or uprising. He is concerned with what's happening in his own backyard with only a few exceptions (Syria).

The US, in contrast, has backed itself into a corner with Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and almost Syria, as well as a bunch of UN peacekeeping initiatives in Africa, and stuff like humanitarian missions to Haiti, the Phillipines, etc. Whether intentionally or not, in the last 20 years after the end of the Cold War they've begun exporting the 'world police' image we see so often. This is not to say that that is entirely effective; as the inaction of the UN shows, the US has very little power against other major non-allied states (Russia, China) or allies of said states (North Korea, Syria). Nevertheless they have the reputation of leading NATO's charge into dictatorships, civil wars and genocides.

My point is thus: because the US, whether rightfully or not, has gained the reputation as a 'defender of freedom and enforcer of human rights worldwide,' their domestic anti-terror policies are criticised for going against this image. Putin, on the other hand, never pretended to give a fuck about despots in other countries or human rights (in either Russia or abroad to be perfectly honest) or genocides or anything. Even if the Obama Admistration's anti-terror policies were exactly equal to those of Vladimir Putin's, only one of those parties cultivated an image that purported to be staunchly against such violations of liberty, an image that brought down the very governments that enacted laws like they did.",t3_1u3y4x,False,t3_1u3y4x,[deleted],50,,worldnews

&gt; This is a MOVI knockoff using the Alexmos three axis gimbal stabilization system.   The hardware is actually the precursor, or a modified knockoff to the MOVI from Freefly Systems.  This is a Cinestar Radian 3 axis gimbal that originally designed for Freefly's Cinestar 8/6 multirotor system, i.e drone hellicopters.  The original gimbal was a belt driven RC hobby Servo driven system. 

&gt; Then the multirotor community were screaming for better performance that the servos will not provide under high demand.  At the time the only gimble of this typ availible with 4 phase brushless motors was the DJI Zimuse.  However the DJI gimbal would only support Micro 4/3's cameras such as the SONY NEX-7, actually it was specifically designed for the NEX 7 but other M 4/3's can be used. 

&gt; There were no gimbals on the market at the time that could be with larger systems like DSLR's or RED's other than some prototypes from Hoverfly and Photohigher.  Freefly managed to bring these to the market first and with the prolifaeation by the smart marketing by doing the film with Vinicint Lefloret.  In between the releasing of the MOVI and the use of the original gimbal system an Open source project from Europe came up wit a gimbal controller that could handle direct drive brushless motors.  The first person to modify the Cinestar gimbal was a guy from Canada named Bill who took heavy duty 4 phase high torque motors modified from their 3 phase RC counterparts, and modified his Servo driven cinstar gimbal to what is essentially the MOVI.

&gt; The concept was not new, there were already RC hobbyist and aerial drone cinematographers  thinking about handheld versions of these systems.

&gt; The only difference between this and the MOVI is that the MOVI has been better adapted for larger weight loads.  And the MOVI is plug and play where as the Alexmos controller requires some technical knowhow to upload HEX files to the syestem controller.

&gt;  The three prongs that you see in this video are the landing gear legs used for the multi-rotor Cinestar 8 air frames.

Hitler was using state power to exterminate the Jews. I don't see how that is an argument against anarcho-capitalism.

&gt;That something is necessary doesn't make it good. Notice you skipped the question about working in Malaysia or Norway. Assuming your answer was the latter, you'd agree that we should stop the sweatshop period and move on to the middle class one as rapidly as possible if we can, right? How do you think Nike or Walmart will feel about that? I'll tell you... ""race to the bottom"". Google it.

I thought you were asking a rhetorical question. Of course I'd like to work in the Norwegian factory. Of course, before Western Europe was a bastion of civil and economic liberties, it was filled to the brim with capitalist sweatshops that inspired many socialists to speak out against the injustices they saw about capitalism. Of course, now they don't have to deal with them anymore, because those very factories helped create vast wealth for the societies that had them. Sure, let's industrialize as fast as we can so we don't have to have sweatshops anymore. If it's 1st world vs. 2nd world, I'd prefer to live in a developed country. You seem to have a problem with the develop*ing* part, however.

How do you think these welfare states support themselves? Through their own merit? No, through taxation. Governments do not produce things on their own, they rely on producers to support them. Nigeria, for example, couldn't have a thriving welfare state even if they tried, there simply isn't enough money in the country to have one of the type that there is in Norway (which is greatly supported by their massive oil wealth).

&gt;Ummm... but you said people are slaves to states. If people get to pick, via democracy, the kind of state they live in then... according to the definition of ""slavery"" people aren't slaves.

Well giving the individual a sliver of a fraction of a role in 'picking their government' is certainly better than giving people absolutely no sovereignty whatsoever, but it doesn't go far enough as far as I'm concerned. Without government, the individual is sovereign. If 51% of the people in society vote to take wealth from 49% of society, is that fair? I wouldn't say it is.

&gt;Sure. I totally agree. The only difference is that in Capitalism you're talking about a profit based system in which capital is the driving force behind...everything. So it's more conducive to people paying people off, because everything is financially driven anyway.

Right, and government is largely immune to this phenomenon. Governments have rarely started vast struggles for empire, and our government is certainly immune to becoming a one-stop-shop for business owners to bribe the state to pass laws in their favor or allow special tax loopholes that allow them to financially benefit over their non-bribing competition. /s

&gt;Countries run out of money if enough people move away from them. This happens in Africa when there's a conflict or genocide and so many people pack up their stuff and move. This is also happening in America, where the super-wealthy are renouncing their citizenship so they don't have to pay taxes and, post NSA spying, certain tech companies are considering moving out of the US. I don't know why you can't think of these things on your own. Do you read the news at all?

Right, because, unlike switching retailers or what brand of phone you buy, it is exceedingly easy to just pack up and leave to another country when they do something you don't agree with. I do read the news, actually, and I don't see how your point has any merit. It is very hard to get citizenship or even a work visa for another country. You don't have to get a passport to change what antivirus software you use.

Your comparison is similar to bringing a person hostage on a boat into the middle of the ocean, and then telling them that they are free to leave at any time. People don't imply their consent to whatever their government wants to do to them just because they happen to live where that government has jurisdiction. Most don't have much of a choice.

&gt;So you didn't read any of the links I gave about slavery due to corporations then? People having their passports taken away and locked in fields or factories to do slave labour? Well good you're here for an argument, not just to pontificate. Classy.

Well if they didn't need a special passport to leave, they could just leave. I don't see how that's an argument against capitalism. The same thing happens in the UAE, where Dubai workers are lured in, and the government turns a blind eye when the companies take away their passports. Passports are government documents that help restrict people's freedom of movement and lets companies force people into debt peonage. Indentured servitude is certainly something that is a problem in the world, but compared to the very real chattel slavery that governments had enforced for many years prior, it is less of a problem in comparison.

In terms of physically obliterating Wolverine, he is capable of manipulating 'shatterpoints'.

Through a quirk in the way our politics developed there is a sizeable group of voters who SHOULD be in the wealth redistribution bloc based on their household incomes and their needs, but who ARE in the winners &amp; losers bloc.  This quirk has troubled political observers for 50 years.  It is primarily due to the fact that there are a lot of poor evangelical Christians in the United States that care more about abortion than their personal household checkbooks.  Strange, but true.

To keep the government from creating a European-style national health system the forces that don't want one have boxed single-payer healthcare into the idea of ""Socialism"", and have defined ""Socialism"" as Anti-American.  They have spent 100 years telling anyone who will listen that the outcome of a single-payer healthcare system will be a reduced quality of care, rationing of healthcare services, and a lack of choice about who your doctor will be or what treatments you can receive.  They are effective with this line of argument because it is all true - every national health service in Europe, Canada and Japan does these things.  There's no effective advocate for the other side of that argument, that helathcare costs have spiraled out of control because of the unique economics of healthcare (you'll pay anything to stay alive), and that universal care, even if rationed, is better for society than having 20% of the population live in fear of getting sick, and with healthcare costs triggering bankruptcies for many households where someone suffers a catastrophic illness like cancer or chronic heart disease.

In the last Presidential election, 52% of the voters picked the candidate that represents the wealth distribution bloc, and 47% picked the candidate that represents the winners &amp; losers bloc.  But it was just 8 years ago that the election went the other way, and there's good reason to think that it's a tossup now based on candidate personalities and campaign discipline who will become President.  Due to our strange Electoral College system who becomes President is now determined by a sliver of voters (less than 300,000 out of 330,000,000 residents) in 5 states:  Ohio, Florida, Virginia, New Mexico and Nevada.  With elections decided on these kinds of slim margins, there's an all out war to fight for a few voters who may change from Republican to Democrat in any given election.

The theory is that if enough new people are enrolled in some kind of new government mandated insurance plan, a batch of these ""swing voters"" will be captured by the value of the plan - once they have it, they'll never give it up (see: Social Security).  Those voters will forever after vote Democratic to protect that healthcare insurance, effectively locking in Democratic Presidents barring a personal meltdown or a major event like a war or another 9/11.

So the Republicans and their operatives are fighting with everything in their power to convince people to kill healthcare expansion before the lock-in occurs.  Worse, they're worried that once there's a lock-in, it will enable the Democrats to go for a full-scale single-payer national healthcare system: a system they cannot get with the current divisions in the electorate (which is why we didn't get one in 2008 even though there was a Democratic House, a Democratic Supermajority in the Senate and a Democrat in the White House).

For the GOP, this is literally a life or death struggle.  If they lose, there's a non-zero chance the Republican Party will become so marginalized that it will break apart (which is how the Republican Party was born in the first place; when the Whig party tore itself apart over the issue of slavery in the 1850s)",t3_1u48ku,1388544088,t3_1u48ku,rsdancey,22,,explainlikeimfive

My monk is level 89 at the moment, will probably get him to 90 tomorrow or the day after, then dump all the leather timeless tokens from my main onto him, farm timeless isle and hope I can get into SoO asap. 

I've been tanking dungeons quite succesfully, and I've even fought large packs of timeless isle mobs (without being 90) without dying (Expel Harm ftw), but I'm not sure if I'm prepared to go into LFRs with the tank monk immediately.

I've DPS'd Elemental Shaman mostly, until I reached about 550 ilvl, and had to switch to resto a couple of weeks ago (Now 561 ilvl, 13/14 normal clearance, everything up to Thok going quite easily), and don't quite know what to expect as a tank. 

Will I be able to hop into LFRs with the minimum ilvl requirements (496 for SoO for example) and expect to not get wrecked? Are there any specific things I should look out for in the first two wings of SoO / all wings of ToT? (I did read up on how to place the Dark Shaman walls. Do the slimes there do enough damage for me to want to kite them, or can I just spin2win?) Things like sudden spikes of damage in some phases or mechanics I wouldn't notice as DPS.

Any general tips for brewmasters? Any good addons? I've wanted to get one that shows me my stagger amount, but I keep forgetting to check for one. Is it even important? When should i purify? As rarely as possible, or only if I don't need the chi for blackout kick? Should I use Guard on cooldown or keep it for when shit goes down? How pissed off do Melee DPS get if I try to collect the health orbs and keep rotating/moving the boss? Do I still dodge/parry if mobs are to my sides (At what angle do I stop dodging/parrying? Mobs keep placing themselves weirdly around me and I end up backpedaling just to make sure they're right in front of me) Are raid bosses affected by Dizzying Haze? More importantly, is breath of fire useful on them, or only trash?

I don't know a lot about Mao. I have read some of his theoretical works, and I really like some of his ideas. The more popular ones- the mass line and protracted people's war- make a lot of sense to me. If I were to have some influence over a revolutionary situation, the protracted people's war is the method I would favor. 

That being said, theory does not equal reality. I don't think he lived up to what he preached, but that doesn't take any validity away from what he wrote. There is a lot to learn from the Chinese experience- and I  think the whole thing, Mao included, is very much worth studying. I tend to criticize, though I will learn more, but either way, the Chinese revolution was a very important historical event, and there is a lot to take away from it. Though 'communist' China today has nothing to do with Maoist thought. 


**Lenin-**

I am at odds with. I know a lot about the Russian situation, the conditions they had to work with, and so I am soft on Lenin. People generally criticize his 'authoritarianism'. I am against authoritarianism in principal, but it is important to understand what was happening at the time. ***14*** nations invaded Russia after the revolution. 14. That is something that *no one* here on reddit has ever had to endure. Not even close. I haven't, and I cannot possibly imagine the difficulties that *any* revolutionary faced in those times. So the fact that he created a very powerful intelligence apparatus is understandable to me. The fact that legitimate democracy was not a possibility at that time was understandable to me. I don't think many of his tactics (although some of his ideas) are relevant today, as they wouldn't have been in industrialized Europe or America at the time. But I don't blame him for Stalinism, and I don't blame him for repressing counter revolutionaries. 

In hindsight, his betrayal of Anarchism is a horrible thing. I am an anarchist and would have undoubted been betrayed myself. But with 14 nations at war, in the midst of the first industrial world war, and a protracted civil war against the bourgeoisie in Russia, I can hardly blame him for some of the more harsh actions he, and the Bolsheviks, took. 

The prime goal was to maintain the revolution. And, as much as it sucked and would *not* be favorable to *anyone* alive today, he succeeded in that goal. The bourgeois did not regain control of Russia, and he lived to see them fall. He led a successful communist revolution, and what happened afterwards is the fault of another, considering he died in 1924 and did his best to 'warn' against Stalin, nationalism, and 'the bureaucratic class' (as he and Trotsky put it) before his death. 


**Stalin-**

It is easy to make such excuses for Stalin, but I don't think they hold up. The common excuse is that he *had* to force industrialization leading to WW2. If not, the USSR would've lost against the Nazis. And who knows? Maybe the nazis would have taken over all of Europe. Certainly was a possibility, and the USSR at the time prevented it. I give them (especially the some 22 million that died) credit for that.

After WW2 tho there is a lot less to excuse. USSR had achieved industrialization and placed itself as a major world power, capable of helping other nations and defending themselves against any reasonable threat around. The brutality did not stop. In many ways, it got worse, and the quality of Soviet life did not reflect the advancement they'd accomplished.

I do not like Stalin a bit. But I am somewhat, eh, maybe you'd call it Nostalgic about that era simply because of the revolutionary gains that were achieved. It set the standard for the rest of the world, in many ways. I wish it'd turned out differently- a fucking lot differently- but giving it much thought, I understand why the USSR took the turns that it did.


Saying this, I am no way a Maoist, a leninist, and certainly not a Stalinist. I am a general Marxist with great skepticism about most historical revolutionary movements, but I feel that it's helpful to look at these situations (Soviet revolution, cold war USSR, and China) from a multitude of viewpoints.

As modern leftists, living in well-off society, we should never seek to emulate these examples. But there is a lot to learn from them. And their successes and failures do not hinge on their leaders, but the conditions everyone had to deal with at the time. We may count ourselves lucky that we don't live in those times, and have a *much* better prospect for the future because of it.

Lets just look at one country for a moment. 

Ethiopia.  Per capita GDP  (nominal not PPP) - 513 dollars a year, total GDP ~50 billion USD a year.  Population 91 million.   (on purchasing parity they are at 100 billion USD a year). 

As compared to say, Germany, population, about 82 million, per capita GDP 43000 per year, total GDP about 3500 billion.  

So... to get Ethiopia to to level of germany needs 3450 billion dollars a year.  That would be the entire US federal  government budget roughly (~3800 billion).   The US, combined public and private only gives about 70 billion dollars in air total per year, and a lot of that is military aid, europe combined is about on par.  So even if the US and europe teamed up to just fund Ethiopia, and ignored everyone else, ethiopia would still be somewhere around 1/20th the wealth of the US per capita.  

Now obviously the expectation is that a country would  produce most of that value on its own.  Aid is to cope with  disasters and to  help fund the development of infrastructure etc. 

But it is a VERY very very very very long  way to go from where  many of these countries were in the 1950's or 1960's to somewhere reasonably well off.  India had a literacy rate of 11% in  1947, it's 74% today.  Most of europe and the US have had  literacy rates of &gt;90% for a century (in some cases 2 centuries).  They were looted and repressed by empires, torn apart by strife for decades in many cases, and 

Since 1970 china has been growing at a breakneck pace - this is because they took aid money they were given (in part by the US) invested it well, made serious legal reforms to make  the country attractive to foreign investment.  That's  really the only reasonable model.  But it takes decades for good policy to take hold, and if you cannot keep the political situation under control, say with  coups, religious strife, or just a constant parade of new plans then you never get anywhere.  

I know it's an odd analogy but it's a bit like NASA.  If every major  project you have takes  10 years to complete, but every 8 years someone new takes over and throws out whatever you were working on  then you end up seeming like you've accomplished relatively little because almost nothing ever  gets finished.  

You can't build schools if you have no teachers, you cannot get teachers if you have no roads and money, you cannot get roads unless you have people who would use them and vehicles to drive on them, you cannot get money to buy vehicles unless you have something to trade, and you cannot have something to trade unless you have something people  want to buy, and you can't make anything people want to buy if you have an illiterate population just trying to scrape by.  Either you need to get  lucky and find something in the ground that is tremendously valuable, and then not squander the wealth, or you need massive investment for the sake of it, and that needs to go on for years.

However in the overwhelming majority of circumstances British English is going to be the dialect you should learn A) because it has more speakers overall and B) because you're probably more likely to come across a BE speaker than an AE due to how spread out the BE speaking community is.

On the point about the accents of BE varying, don't accents across the US vary too? US accents probably don't vary as much as the accents of Canada, Ireland and Jamaica, but I'd say there is a comparison between how varied their accents are and the accents of the Commonwealth of Nations. Personally I find it extremely easy to talk to almost any Australian or Canadian accent (except for Quebecois) but certain American ones are difficult for me.

I think you're still greatly underestimating the trauma imparted by a penetrating spear. You're talking about rifle shots, but a shot from a rifle is FAR less damaging than a broad headed spear, especially if held by a person intending to use it to do damage, and for fuck's sake, even more if a rampaging gorilla smacks it around. 

Two other points... 

You can hold the spear to keep yourself separated from the gorilla. That's the point of the crossbar. 

Gorillas aren't Marvel superheros. Like any animal, they experience pain, and back away from it.

Generally in favor for prudent monarchs and city states. It is a very vast and inclusive movement (including HBD fans, Post-Libertarian and Christianity supporters) they are mostly defined as anti-democarcy/anti-democarcy/anti-enlightenment values.

Archeofuturists are similar to reactionaries only they focus on finding the best political structures of the past (archaic) and after taking into account the possibly of a form of economic, cultural, or political collapse (which is a hypothesis of Guillame Faye) they would apply said archaic social institutions in context of technological development. Faye noticed back in the 80s that the french new right movement has the same flaw as Neoreactionaries today: it is a negative rather than positive movement. What I mean is that it is defined as the anti-thesis of other ideologies, rather than an ideology with its own positive traditions and values.

There are few differences between paleo conservative and neoreactionary, especially with your opinion on paleo quoted below

&gt;I would cite the archetypal paleoconservative as H.L. Mencken from the modern time, but paleoconservative is a broad camp that stretches back to the original right/left schism in the French government in 1789.

&gt;A general summary:

&gt;* Strong nationalism
&gt;* Dislike of government
&gt;* Favor a unified culture, religion and monarchy
&gt;* Tend to be aware of caste, race and gender differences
&gt;* Machiavellian realpolitik
&gt;* Individual moral balance defines society

Only that neo reaction is much more varied in specific solutions (formalism, certain anarcho capitalists, republicanism, monarchism, etc etc) and I don't think neo reactionaries are inherently against colonialism. The Neoreactionaries are basically geeks who are reading carlyle and other old right figures are figuring out that democarcy and progressivism sucks.

Paleocons seem to be those who were attempting to previously maintain old right values (Catholics, Southerners, constitutionalists, etc etc) when confronted by progressive values darker self (communism) 

The European equivalent of the paleocons would be the new right, but I dont know if thier ideological roots are similar.

I come to the group from a post-liberatian/ pro- capitalist city state with a recognition of the importance of cultural values and memetic autoimmune defenses.

I agree with most things the Neoreactionaries and paleoconservatives discuss (especially thier ideological fathers carlye,Burke, menken, etc etc) but I want to look towards the future and applicable changes to the state today instead of trying to play to games of the nation state.

And above all I am attempting to vanquish my deep ignorance of these topics and find the truth of good governance.

[Here] (http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/jwh.2010.2349) is a source outlining all of this. The high points:

1. &gt;Today’s new technology, highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), permits the use of urine and self-collected vaginal swabs for testing for Chlamydia in women. Self-administered vaginal swabs are at least equal to clinician- obtained swabs in sensitivity, with no difference in specificity for Chlamydia.


2. &gt;A pelvic examination is certainly needed to fit a contraceptive diaphragm or to insert an intrauterine device (IUD); however, no findings from a pelvic examination would change the decision to prescribe systemic hormonal contraception. Therefore, guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), World Health Organization (WHO), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), and Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) explicitly specify that a **pelvic examination is not required in an asymptomatic woman for the initiation of systemic hormonal contraceptives.**


3. &gt;In the United States, the speculum examination is routinely accompanied by a bimanual pelvic examination for palpation of the uterus and ovaries in hopes that this will lead to earlier detection of ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, **bimanual examinations do not lead to earlier detection of ovarian cancer.**


4. &gt;Uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts may be contributory in a woman who has pelvic pain, distention, menstrual difficulties, or infertility, but **we found no evidence that diagnosis of fibroids before development of symptoms will lead to a clinical benefit.**


5. &gt;For asymptomatic ovarian cysts, a possible benefit of early excision would be to preclude an emergency operation caused by torsion or rupture of the cyst; however, these complications are rare, and operative outcomes are good.


6. &gt;Overscreening leads to false positive tests, which in turn lead to additional diagnostic evaluation with attendant discomfort, costs, and risks. These risks are particularly sa- lient among young women, who have a high prevalence of nonprogressive dysplasia. Such young women have the most to lose from aggressive evaluation and treatment, particularly conization of the cervix. **The risk of preterm birth consequent to treatment for high-grade dysplasia is likely to affect their obstetrical future, even while the risk of progression to cervical cancer is exceedingly small.** A key impetus for the ACOG recommendations for less screening among young women is that **surgical treatments for dysplasia are associated with a 2-fold increased risk of subsequent premature birth and with additional adverse obstetrical outcomes.**


7. &gt;Frequent, routine bimanual examinations may partly explain why U.S. rates of ovarian cystectomy and hysterectomy are more than **twice as high** as rates in European countries, **where the use of the pelvic examination is limited to symptomatic women.**


8. &gt;**Numerous studies show that adolescents delay initiation of needed contraception be- cause of fear of the pelvic examination.**


9. &gt;The expectation of the pelvic examination can thus obstruct public health efforts to reduce unwanted pregnancy in the United States as well as efforts to prevent infertility through early treatment of Chlamydia in- fection.


10. &gt;In Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the bimanual examination is performed only in the evaluation of women with symptoms. It is not combined with routine cervical screening and is not a part of the periodic examination of asymptomatic women. This practice difference may explain, in part, why **women in the United Kingdom undergo so much less ovarian cystectomy and hysterectomy than do women in the United States.**


11. &gt;Overutilization of services is the most important contributor to the high cost of U.S. healthcare. Increasingly, we recognize that more services do not always lead to improved health outcomes and that often the opposite is true: that more services are associated with worse heath outcomes.
 

And these don't even get into the sociological issues accompanying the pelvic exam (the good girl/bad girl dichotomy: good girls get pelvic exams/bad girls don't).

Edit: Wow this article is a lot worse than I thought

&gt;Slaughterhouses insist they hire immigrants because the work is so unpleasant Americans won’t do it. They hired European immigrants when Upton Sinclair wrote “The Jungle,” and they hire Latin American immigrants today.

There have been accusations that Sinclair had never even been inside a slaughterhouse. In fact the main objective of the book was to show how terrible wage slavery was, and had nothing to do with meat packing conditions, something the general public greatly misinterpreted his book as calling for a change in. 

In fact when Theodore Roosevelt read it he commented:

&gt;I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. **Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth.**

Sinclair wrote it to push his socialist agenda

&gt;Because immigration to the United States was more or less banned from 1925 to 1965, and millions of pigs, sheep and cows were slaughtered during those years. 

[Banned to an extent yes, minuscule not](http://www.npg.org/forum_series/images/imm&amp;pop_growth/chart_1.gif)

&gt;“[S]tarting in the early 1960s, a company called Iowa Beef Packers (IBP) began to revolutionize the industry, opening plants in rural areas far from union strongholds, recruiting immigrant workers from Mexico, introducing a new division of labor that eliminated the need for skilled butchers, and ruthlessly battling unions. By the late 1970s, meatpacking companies that wanted to compete with IBP had to adopt its business methods — or go out of business. Wages in the meatpacking industry soon fell by as much as 50 percent.”

[Wrong](http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/2.htm)

&gt;Master contracts covering the industry raised wages and safety standards. **In the 1960s and 1970s, meatpacking workers’ pay and conditions approximated those of auto, steel, and other industrial laborers who worked hard in their plants and through their unions to attain steady jobs with good wages and benefits. Meatpackers’ wages remained substantially higher than the average manufacturing sector wage—15 percent higher in 1960, 19 percent higher in 1970, 17 percent higher in 1980**

And what's wrong with recruiting foreign workers?

&gt;In Rob Stanley’s native South Side, there is more than one monument to the violence that resulted when the right of industry to bargain without the interference of labor unions was backed up by government force. In 1894, President Cleveland sent 2,500 troops to break a strike at the Pullman Palace Car Factory. On Memorial Day, 1937, Chicago police killed 10 striking workers outside the Republic Steel plant.

Interesting what government force is used for

&gt;The greatest victory of the anti-labor movement has not been in busting industries traditionally organized by unions. That’s unnecessary. Those jobs have disappeared as a result of automation and outsourcing to foreign countries. In the U.S., steel industry employment has declined from 521,000 in 1974 to 150,000 today.

Selective reporting if I hadn't seen it. [The US Steel Industry peaked in 1970.](http://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/ibr/2003/spring03/images/steel_tab2.gif) [Carbon Steel in the US was just not consumed as much anymore.](http://phe.rockefeller.edu/dematerialization/table2.jpg) [And prices went down.](http://www.masterresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Figure-31-1024x561.jpg) So what about unionized countries like Germany? [Steel production stayed the same but the number of employees decreased.](http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/lib/images/presse/bpk_041201_schulz/folie_en_24.gif)

I'm seeing the same arguments over and over:

* Someone is taking our jobs

* Automation

* Greedy capitalists can't pay us a better wage

So long as they don't monopolize themselves I don't see a problem with protesting the last. But when you say stuff like *hardworking Mexicans are taking our jobs* that sounds exactly like what a Conservative would say. Good let them, prices will go down which benefits everyone. And of course automation has never led to massive unemployment and has created more jobs. &lt;5% of people work on farms[(down from nearly everybody)](http://www.conservapedia.com/images/thumb/d/de/Jobs1800-2000.jpg/350px-Jobs1800-2000.jpg), and they produce more food today than they ever had.

&gt; between the national currency and gold—and therefore between national currencies. In World War I, European nations went off the gold standard to print money, and the resulting price inflation drove large amounts of the world’s gold to banks in the United States. The United States remained on the gold standard without altering the gold value of the dollar. Investors and others who held gold sent their gold to the United States, where gold maintained its value as a safe and sound investment. At the end of World War I, a few countries, most notably the United States, continued on the gold standard while others temporarily adopted floating exchange rates. The world’s international finance center had shifted from London to New York City, and the British were anxious to regain their old status. Some countries pledged to return to the gold standard with devalued currencies, while others followed the British lead and aimed to return to gold at prewar exchange rates.

That was the fault of the printing press. Not gold.

 
&gt; This was not possible, however. Too much money had been created during the war to allow a return to the gold standard without either large currency devaluations or price deflations. In addition, the U.S. gold stock had doubled to about 40 percent of the world’s monetary gold. There simply was not enough monetary gold in the rest of the world to support the countries’ currencies at the existing exchange rates. As a result, the leading nations established a gold exchange system whereby the governments of the United States and Great Britain would be willing, at all times, to redeem the dollar and the pound for gold, and other countries would hold much of their international reserves in British pounds or U.S. dollars.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The demand for gold increased as countries returned to the gold standard. Because the franc was undervalued when France returned to the gold standard in June 1928, France began to receive gold inflows. The undervalued franc made French exports less expensive in foreign countries’ currencies and made foreign imports into France more expensive in francs. As French exports rose and French imports fell, their international accounts were balanced by gold shipped to France. France’s government, contrary to the tenets of the gold standard, did not use these inflows to expand its money supply. In 1928, the Federal Reserve System raised its discount rate—that is, the rate it charged on loans to member banks—in order to raise interest rates in the United States, which would stem the outflow of American gold and dampen the booming stock market. As a result, the United States began to receive shipments of gold. 

That's price fixing and not the free market.


&gt;By 1929, as countries around the world lost gold to France and the United States, these countries’ governments initiated deflationary policies to stem their gold outflows and remain on the gold standard. These deflationary policies were designed to restrict economic activity and reduce price levels, and that is exactly what they did. Thus began the worldwide Great Depression.

More govt interventions.

 
&gt; The onset of the contraction led to the end of the stockmarket boom and the crash in late October 1929. However, the stock market collapse did not cause the depression; nor can it explain the extraordinary length and depth of the American contraction. In most countries, such as Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands, and the Nordic countries, the depression was less severe and shorter, often ending by 1931. Those countries did not have the banking and financial crises that the United States did, and most left the gold standard earlier than the United States did. In the United States, in contrast, the contraction continued for four years from the summer of 1929 through the first quarter of 1933. During that time real GNP fell 30.5 percent, wholesale prices fell 30.8 percent, and consumer prices fell 24.4 percent. 

This is true. Our depression became Great because of the govt interference in the economy...

Edit: Wow this article is a lot worse than I thought

&gt;Slaughterhouses insist they hire immigrants because the work is so unpleasant Americans won’t do it. They hired European immigrants when Upton Sinclair wrote “The Jungle,” and they hire Latin American immigrants today.

There have been accusations that Sinclair had never even been inside a slaughterhouse. In fact the main objective of the book was to show how terrible wage slavery was, and had nothing to do with meat packing conditions, something the general public greatly misinterpreted his book as calling for a change in. 

In fact when Theodore Roosevelt read it he commented:

&gt;I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. **Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth.**

Sinclair wrote it to push his socialist agenda

&gt;Because immigration to the United States was more or less banned from 1925 to 1965, and millions of pigs, sheep and cows were slaughtered during those years. 

[Banned to an extent yes, minuscule not](http://www.npg.org/forum_series/images/imm&amp;pop_growth/chart_1.gif)

&gt;“[S]tarting in the early 1960s, a company called Iowa Beef Packers (IBP) began to revolutionize the industry, opening plants in rural areas far from union strongholds, recruiting immigrant workers from Mexico, introducing a new division of labor that eliminated the need for skilled butchers, and ruthlessly battling unions. By the late 1970s, meatpacking companies that wanted to compete with IBP had to adopt its business methods — or go out of business. Wages in the meatpacking industry soon fell by as much as 50 percent.”

[Wrong](http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/2.htm)

&gt;Master contracts covering the industry raised wages and safety standards. **In the 1960s and 1970s, meatpacking workers’ pay and conditions approximated those of auto, steel, and other industrial laborers who worked hard in their plants and through their unions to attain steady jobs with good wages and benefits. Meatpackers’ wages remained substantially higher than the average manufacturing sector wage—15 percent higher in 1960, 19 percent higher in 1970, 17 percent higher in 1980**

And what's wrong with recruiting foreign workers?

&gt;In Rob Stanley’s native South Side, there is more than one monument to the violence that resulted when the right of industry to bargain without the interference of labor unions was backed up by government force. In 1894, President Cleveland sent 2,500 troops to break a strike at the Pullman Palace Car Factory. On Memorial Day, 1937, Chicago police killed 10 striking workers outside the Republic Steel plant.

Interesting what government force is used for

&gt;The greatest victory of the anti-labor movement has not been in busting industries traditionally organized by unions. That’s unnecessary. Those jobs have disappeared as a result of automation and outsourcing to foreign countries. In the U.S., steel industry employment has declined from 521,000 in 1974 to 150,000 today.

Selective reporting if I hadn't seen it. [The US Steel Industry peaked in 1970.](http://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/ibr/2003/spring03/images/steel_tab2.gif) [Carbon Steel in the US was just not consumed as much anymore.](http://phe.rockefeller.edu/dematerialization/table2.jpg) [And prices went down.](http://www.masterresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Figure-31-1024x561.jpg) So what about unionized countries like Germany? [Steel production stayed the same but the number of employees decreased.](http://www.thyssenkrupp.com/lib/images/presse/bpk_041201_schulz/folie_en_24.gif)

I'm seeing the same arguments over and over:

* Someone is taking our jobs

* Automation

* Greedy capitalists can't pay us a better wage

So long as they don't monopolize themselves I don't see a problem with protesting the last. But when you say stuff like *hardworking Mexicans are taking our jobs* that sounds exactly like what a Conservative would say. Good let them, prices will go down which benefits everyone. And of course automation has never led to massive unemployment and has created more jobs. &lt;5% of people work on farms[(down from nearly everybody)](http://www.conservapedia.com/images/thumb/d/de/Jobs1800-2000.jpg/350px-Jobs1800-2000.jpg), and they produce more food today than they ever had.

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMA_2).  Gun ownership there is significantly more scarce than what we have here in Texas.  The UN reports only a 16.3 gun (both legal and illicit) per 100 people ratio within the Czech Republic with the majority consisting of handguns and rifles.  The defense forces of the Czech Republic only has 266,250 firearms compared to a higher 283,009 civilian owned firearms.  (136,089 handguns + 137,266 rifles + 9,654 shotguns).

The point I am really trying to get at is that immersion would be furthered not by equipping the survivors with a nice 5.56 and a case of ammo.  I'm from Texas. I own this.  But a DayZ survivor is in some Eastern European block country, not rich, modeled after the Czech Republic.  I want DayZ to be hard.  I want to feel hopeless.

While it is naive to say that the US wasn't torturing people pre 9-11, it would most certainly be true to say that such activity was probably not widespread. Moreover, human rights activists and psychologists as well as national security people knew that it didn't work. For me, the pinnacle of this understanding was that Star Trek TNG episode where Picard was tortured (""There are FOUR lights""). Apparently the writers went into a lot of research into torture and found that it was it less to do with information retrieval and more to do with control.

After 9-11, the common belief that torture was wrong was slowly, over a number of years, demolished. There were reports that hundreds of Afghans in late 2001 were placed into shipping containers and sent off to be interrogated and tortured by Americans hell bent on revenge. Those who opposed the war screamed out ""Look what you're doing! We need to investigate these claims"" while the war supporters screamed back ""We're not terrorists! We don't use torture! There's only a few bad apples! You're hurting our troops and helping the terrorists by repeating these lies!"". 

Then once the Abu Ghraib torture scandal broke, there was a concerted effort on the part of the war supporters, the media that supported the war and the White House itself into normalising torture. Suddenly torture was spoken of as being necessary to safeguard national security. The TV show *24* had scenes where that Jack guy tortured people and saved Americans. Even Christian leaders - who had been supporters of the war from the beginning - began to shift into a, if not pro-torture stance, then at least a head shaking ""well what can you do, terrorists are trying to kill us all and this might be the lesser of two evils"" attitude. (I am an evangelical Christian, BTW, and opposed the war from the very beginning and found myself increasingly concerned with how Christians acted in the lead up to war and its lengthy aftermath).

And along with this pro-torture steak, the US pretty much broke with the attitudes of the rest of the world. The US denigrated other nations who opposed the war. France was especially aimed at, with the whole ""Freedom Fries"" thing blowing up. Americans began to associate its allies with its enemies. The cold war allies who had been social democracies for years were now examples of socialism that America should reject because of their ideological ties to communism and marxism, completely ignoring the role these countries had in defending the west against the Soviets. The NRA and other agencies began making up crime statistics to make it look as though these nations with stricter gun laws were suffering from crime waves. Within the Christian churches, the innovative formation of a European single currency became a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy and many Christians in the US believe that the promised Antichrist will rise up in a united Europe.

What else can I say? I could spend ages about how the ridicule of the UN in the 1990s turned into a hate industry after 9/11, so much so that no one in America took seriously the UN efforts to see if Iraq had WMDs.

In short, as a Non-American, the situation in the US is worse than it has ever been. Pre 9/11 there appeared to be people in the power in the US who actually did make decisions based upon sound judgment - and even if such people were corrupt, they at least did a good job anyway. Since then the people in power have devolved into ideological, rabble rousing extremists. It is a frightening state of affairs.",t3_1u3zyd,False,t1_ceecaq1,OneSalientOversight,14,,collapse

narrow down the topic, why do you think this?

&gt;Suicide bombing is unique to Islam, no other religion in this century so casually murders their own civilian brothers and sisters

thats just straight up false, Suicide bombing has been used by criminals of multiple religions or none at all. Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka pioneered it as a tactic of asymmetric warfare, they were a secular nationalist group composed of Hindus and Christians. even in just the Israel/Palestine conflict, their have been Christian Palestinian suicide bombers, its been used in the USA by right wing extremists (remember when some nutjob flew a plane into an IRS building a couple years ago), Kamikaze attacks in WWII by Shinto Japanese pilots were suicide bombings. 

Also as others have said, suicide is straight up forbidden in Islam, as is the targeting of civilians which are the main victims of such attacks.

&gt;Islam has many conservative members who are OK with marrying off young girls, this seems barbaric. No such amount of Chritsians are approving of having sex with young girls.

Their are a number of Christians that are ok with that also, Fundamental Mormons, African Christians, etc. It was not uncommon for Christian nobility the practice it in the middle ages. It is not exclusive to Islam, nor is it as common as most people believe.

&gt;Islam does not appear to lead to peace and prosperity, every country that is dominated by Islam, mine included, is worse compared to Western nations

Well that is only currently true, Historically their have been many Muslim places that were the leaders of the world in prosperity and peace. the Ottoman Empire was as powerful and rich as most of Europe combined for a long time. What you are commenting on is an accident of history, no more no less.

&gt;Islam provides very harsh social justice, no other religion in modern times is so full of lashings, stoning, acid attacks, et cetera

First off, you are using the term social justice wrong, social justice refers to equal distribution of wealth, rule of law, and safeguarding of rights. Second off, yes other religions do, Judaism in particular has many of the same punishments, but noone has created a Orthodox Jewish court system because it requires the temple to be rebuilt. Ask an Orthodox rabbi if their are lashings and such if one is convicted in a rabbinical court. finally Acid attacks don't have anything to do with Islam, Hindus, animists, and Christians all have committed acid attacks, in Africa, in India, in the Middle east. Acid attacks are condemned in Shariah and punished if found guilty.

&gt;Islam forced itself upon others more than any other modern religion. Islamphobia has develop in many Western nations due to the result of conservative Muslims trying to harshly enforce their regulations on others

thats not true, Christianity has forced itself on more people then Islam.  The only reason we don't hear about it is because Christian rulers were so good at it, they don't need to do it in there home countries anymore. The last Muslim empire was the Ottomans and for centuries they allowed the free practice of non-Muslim religions complete with an independent court system and separate law making bodies for each religious group. Small groups of Muslims ask for pork not to be served at schools, or that they be allowed to wear headscarves in public schools and the media make sit out like they are forcing people to convert. Look at the USA, about 2-3 million Muslims, and not a single problem like in Europe, because The American system allows for religious exceptions do to its legal history with freedom of religion, namely the 5-6 million Jews in the country also asked for the same or similar exceptions and they got them. You claim its forcing Islam on other people, I see it as forcing European governments to accept that people are Muslim. Switzerland has very little trouble with Muslims but ended up banning minarets anyway, France colonized North Africa, drained it of resources and then restricts their citizen's rights to wear hijab (at government jobs, schools, etc.) and Niqab everywhere, and then ask why the 5 million North African descendant French aren't always 100% happy to live in France. 

&gt;Now, you may say that this is not true Islam, but why would the true religion result in the worst followers?

worst followers? How about we look at Hindu nationalism in India which incite massacres of Muslims, or at the current Buddhist Monk-lead genocide of Muslims in Myanmar, or Orthodox Serbian genocide of the the Muslim Bosniaks. All faiths have followers that have done horrible things and are doing horrible things currently, you are being selective in your judgement if you think Muslims are the worse.

There was one really bad day, bit of workplace bullying when I was sick and had an assignment due.  This was a Friday.  I resigned on the Monday telling them I was going to work overseas

I had no visas or tickets booked.  The day after my last day (1 week later as I was still in my probation period) I sent off my application for a working visa to the UK.  I decided on London over NYC as there was easier visa options at the time and I wanted to travel more around Europe than the Americas...

Speaking of the # of players, I don't think it should be a surprise, Europe's population is about twice as USA + Canada, naturally they should have twice as much players given that they have similar gaming cultures (Europe is still a bit more serious imo).  Perhaps that's why you see new talents rising in Europe fast, more players = more new talents.  2 out of 3 challengers qualified, and SHC almost qualified as well.  Meanwhile in NA, not much new talents arise, none of the challenger teams made it through. 

Infrastructure is a huge problem for NA.  EU LCS locates in Germany, that's the center of Europe, it's pretty convenient for European pros to travel, besides Gambit of course.  NA LCS locates in California I believe, I don't watch NA LCS that much, not sure.  California is pretty much the corner of the the states, and it's not even where majority of the population concentrates, most of them live in the northeast.  If so, then that means even Gambit has an easier time of traveling than NA teams, the distance between Germany and European Russia is closer than the distance between Northeastern US and California.

1) Koreans need a scene because theirs is crumbling and there is no money in Korea    
2) Foreigners need to be able to compete amongst themselves.   

 These aren't the same problem however people (as thorin did) often confuse them as the same problem instead of two mutually exclusive problems. You can increase the foreign incentive and build the foreign scene at the same time as giving Koreans the extra prize money they deserve, however, the absolute worst choice in both scenarios is what we have now, no region locking and no real extra money/opportunity in Korea.

 Frankly Korea is going to crumble, this is unnavoidable, LoL is going to chew Sc2 up and spit it out. This isn't something you can change, in 2010 Blizzard had the option to prevent this but at this point it's what's going to happen and people need to accept this, that being said, if we suddenly open the flood gates to every regions qualifiers and ignore the foreign communities lack of options then the lack of a foreign scene will cause WCS NA/EU to simply be WCS Korea 2 and 3 and then 2 scenes die.

 Sc2 isn't Korea like BW was and we are so worried about the already dead Korean scene we are ignoring the other scenes who still have a chance to thrive. Build the foreign scene, give the top players (korea) the bulk of the money, 2 different solutions for 2 different problems.

Now, the full measure of the order would be higher, but I'm accounting only for those strong enough in the Force and skilled enough in combat to fight.

A significant number of Jedi were lost on Geonosis, when they took on a droid army in the arena, we can safely put two hundred and twelve Jedi at Geonosis, very few survived, but the timely arrival of the clones prevented outright defeat. For the sake of numbers we'll take the only concrete number we have on survivors, and say thirty made it out alive.

Accounting for those killed by Grievous, Dooku and Ventress is more difficult, as I haven't explored the EU during the clone wars era that much. However, jedi kill counts for Grievous look to be between nine and twenty, so for the sake of argument we'll award Grievous and Ventress twenty, and Dooku forty.

I don't have a number on how many died in other battles during the clone war. The war lasted three years, on a massive battlefield, we'll say a yearly toll of a thousand Jedi

By the time Anakin becomes Darth Vader, these numbers leave us with little less than seven thousand knights, mostly battered, fatigued and spread thin across an entire galaxy, with a new enemy lining up their shots even as they led the charge against Separatist forces.

It's estimated less than 1% of the surviving Jedi escaped the initial betrayal, which leaves sixty seven and a half surviving Jedi, we'll round that down to sixty seven, since I doubt Jedi make a habit of stitching themselves back together with the Force.

Sixty five of these Jedi would be killed by Vader, inquisitors or bounty hunters during the following nineteen years. Obi-Wan and Yoda being the last of the old Order.

Keep in mind while you do that most believers don't bother reading it, and their beliefs may differ wildly from the book they claim as holy.

The trouble is that there are thousands of sects, and even within each sect, each church, and each person within each church has varying beliefs. There are some general things you can pick up from the more established sects, Catholicism emphasizes confessions and communion, Pentecostals speak in tongues, Mormons think Jesus came to America and they like to baptize dead people (the body doesn't have to be present). The history of religion is also a good thing to understand. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are all based on the same material, with some significant changes in doctrine. Understanding the schisms in Christianity is good too, it started in Constantinople, then split into the Orthodox church and the Catholic church. Protestantism split off from there, originally in Germany, but it took off in England and later America. England formed its own church so the king could get a divorce (and also have power and more autonomy). Religion has a significant influence in European history.

For ancient religions (including those that survive today), it is definitely worth looking into Greek/Roman mythology, Egyptian mythology, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism and Buddhism.

The big ones are the Abraham religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), Hinduism, and Buddhism. There are a lot of other smaller religions, various forms of paganism, ancestor worship, nature worship and the like, but none of them have a major worldwide following that I'm aware of.

A lot of things would devastate the state of normalcy around the world if Africa would ever pull itself up by the straps and change the status quo. 1) Africa is not really free it may sound bad but Multi-Nationals actually own Africa the West knows this and knows that whenever the chance for Africa to liberating itself comes they will be there staring it down at the barrel of a gun (see:Africom) the resources in Africa do not actually belong to Africa or for Africans. 2) Security: with so much resources and lack of security even if there was a way to put more restrictions on the amount of resources leaving the continent to to get higher bargaining price overseas, there is no way of stopping a even more powerful foreign nation with deeper pockets and bigger checks from funding a terrorist or rebel faction to topple the current regime/administration and replace it with one that has already signed hundreds of contracts to foreign corporations about Minerals, Land and Oil in return for guns, a successful coup and also minimal media coverage. And if you did have the military means to protect your resources you'll catch cancer. (see:chavez) 3) Africa has a major mental blind spot for when it comes to protecting itself what does every major country deemed untouchable to invasions have? Africa is the Diamond shop that doesn't see the need to buy a gun to protect its store 4) Technology: I notice that the root attitudes that leads to technological diversity and innovations are usually discouraged in African children and societies at an early age, both at the home and in the culture itself ex: tell your father you want to be anything other than a) a doctor b)a lawyer c) an engineer and you will get slapped. good luck telling your parents you wants to go into cartoons or create a research company that creates cooling system for jet propulsion, so the awareness of ""Every idea counts, encourages them it will only lead to more revenue and more diversity for the nation"" is not there. Technology is most if not the only thing the most successful nations have in common (see: Japan, Canada, Russia, U.S.  5) Lack of self investment. it seems like everyone wants to make enough money to just escape Africa rather than to invest it in the living standards of the population, and a businessmen would be seen as inexperienced or a fool if he/she would even bother to go against that status quo, this law of the land. so the rule is get enough to go spend it in Europe and show others where you from how good you have it and important you are. 6) Lack of pride and patriotism: when was the last time you heard somebody say ""hey! these pair of shades are African you can't have those"" or a suicide bomber dying in the name of voo doo?...no? Africa seem to have a problem with pride, standing for something that is indigenous and native which in the long term undermine and de-value the continent. Luxury is always considered to be the Gucci or Versace not African. And last 7) Understanding psychology: Africa needs a major course in psychology, socially to say the least, to understand the mental working of why certain things never works when putting their heads together, to understand the flawed brain that wants riches and power so bad that it cannot cooperate now for the sake of even greater immeasurable gains of the future the mental mindset that leads to friction and uncooperative tactics inside of a society. there I just gave you 1% of what is facing the continent beside the whole Corruption and and other things that you have heard a million times before.

I just ask because the usual causes of infertility for remote communities anywhere in the world are inbreeding and malnutrition. 

Any outside additions to a gene pool normally result in hybrid vigour, a condition that causes improved growth and general health as well as a dramatic reduction in genetic diseases and abnormalities. It's also been cited by some anthropologists as a reason that isolated tribes (of any people) stole or traded women with neighbouring tribes. 

Here's something about that relating to Aborigines, traditionally they are born into one of two groups (moiety) within a tribe (language group). This is an exogamous system that means they can only marry someone from the other moiety. It is part of a complex kinship system that defines who a member of a tribe is (their name) by relating them to other members of that tribe. Unlike the traditional European way of relating to someone as husband, wife, grandparent, cousin, etc, there are up to 70 different relationships in an Aboriginal tribe. 

There are also some interesting stories about European people belonging to Aboriginal tribes after being adopted by them. It appears some were actually taken when they were children to replace a child in the tribe who had died. Sometimes even adult non-Aborigines are adopted by a tribe and recently some Dutch genes were found in a study of Western Australian Aborigines with purely Aboriginal lineages. This lends some support to the stories that there were survivors from Dutch shipwrecks on the West coast who were adopted and lived in the local tribes. Later explorers wrote about some very light-skinned and different-looking members of tribes that they met with.

I also agree with the other posters that most Australians do not have any personal story involving Aborigines because they only make up 2.4% of the population and tend to be more concentrated in isolated and rural/regional areas where most other Australians don't live. I've lived in regional areas most of my life so I have quite a few stories. I've met people here in Kalgoorlie ranging from those who look like Europeans and do not describe themselves as Aboriginal (because they feel no connection with that part of their heritage) ranging to people I can barely understand due to English being a second language for them.

The only reason Ireland and the UK get the weather they do is because of the atlantic conveyor. (A big assed river of hot water coming up from the equator keeping a lot or North Western Europe comparatively warm)

The problem is that if temps increase too much a lot of polar ice will melt dumping a shit load of cold fresh water onto the end of that conveyor system effectively killing it, which means no more warm winter air for us.

The same thing appears to be happening in the south pole now.  (all that new pack ice that trapped the scientists appears to be coming from the continental ice melting and hitting the colder water, oops)

Then when you start to add in the fun and games of atmospheric pressure differentials you'll have an increase in temp over the equatorial regions the energy of which has got to go somewhere to stabilise. (storms, big ones...yayy etc)

Its another vanity project from a vainglorious mayor that will cost millions, will not solve some pressing issues and could possibly alter fundamental rights of access to public highways.

London congestion is almost at gridlock. It will only take a few junctions to be blocked at the same time and huge sections of London will be locked up for hours. You only have to look back a few years when a lorry got stuck in the Blackwall Tunnel and gridlocked East London for around 6 hours.

[London ranks as one of the most polluted cities in Europe](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/07/london-worst-european-cities-air-pollution), and is not getting any better. Johnsons obsession with maintaining 'traffic flow' does nothing to alleviate this. He actually wants to increase flow so that more traffic can use the roads, rather than move the majority to sustainable transport methods. This policy of smoothing traffic flow is prioritising motorised traffic and may account for the increase in pedestrian and cyclist injuries.

Around 4000 people each year are dying from pollution related causes and [deaths rates are on the increase.](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/air-pollution-death-rate-up-in-half-of-london-boroughs-8924098.html)

Building 'skyways' to separate cycle traffic from the roads may have an affect on the number of cyclist injuries, especially with HGV's but the increase in pollution will counter any savings made.

The skyways will inevitably end up as being entry fee based (seeing as the mayor has been massively successful with ensuring the cycle hire scheme paid for itself) which will lead to either cyclists avoiding it (cycling is popular because running costs are negligible) or possibly bye laws introduced to ban cyclists from using those sections of road (in the name of increase 'cyclists safety'), which alters the fundamental rights of access to public highways (*Pedestrians, cycles and horse riders have right of access to the public highways, motorised vehicles can only do so under license*). There is already enough of an issue with [public space being privatised](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/planning/news/carmona-inside-out).

Because this is illegal they cannot sell it for it's real market price so they are not rich and they are not doing this for fun(these are the people most of you want to kill slowly). On another side there is the market made up mostly by Asian people. They have always consumed these goods, the problem just got worse because more of them can afford it now as they produce most of the stuff all the western world uses. We buy their products, give them the money they have now so we are also a part of the problem.  It's easy and somehow understandable to say fuck the poachers or fuck the Chinese but condemning them on the internet will not solve shit. We eat animals like crazy and we don't really care what happens to them all their life or how they die. We do it in such huge numbers that we can't even grasp their meaning anymore. But hey, that animal is endangered, our children will not be able to enjoy them if we keep killing for the horns. So would it be OK to farm them? Theoretically, if the Chinese started opening huge Rhino farms in Africa and kill them like we kill our cows or pigs, would it make it any better? The ""western world"" would have to be very hypocritical to still condemn that practice when we kill billions of pigs every year in Europe alone. No, I am not a fucking vegetarian, I enjoy meat and, like most of you, I rarely allow myself to think and visualize the way my meal came to me. We enjoy meat too much as a species to ever reduce significantly the numbers of animals we use because of the vegetarian movement. This problem is here to stay until we learn to artificially produce tasty meat in a laboratory, do it on the industrial scale and make it too expensive for people to eat the ""real"" meat. It will take a little time for us to stop seeing the lab meat icky and enjoy it but in the end animals will just be there for petting farms and zoos. I sincerely believe that my grandchildren will never taste ""real"" meat and think of it as something too barbaric to even consider.

This is the one time in DayZ that my real-life work is applicable!!  My masters thesis!!!

Regardless of the previous mentions (all credit to those redditors who also brought it up), **this would be realistic in the context of the area where the map is set**.  Scavenging animals are of particular concern in Europe, due to the post British BSE crisis measures and TB/rabies countermeasures.  Eastern Europe (particularly the regions bordering the former iron curtain perimeter fences) has taken the lead in protecting these birds/animals.  

While having large groups of soaring birds (vultures) gathering in the air above a body/carcass may be unrealistic as there aren't that many birds arriving at any one place, it would be reasonable to have one or two in the air at a given death location.  Other animals also scavenge, e.g. wild pigs, wolves, various birds of prey, carrion crows, etc., so it would be reasonable to see these attending (and you could camp a body waiting for animals to arrive and kill them for food).  These scavengers can also be quite noisy, so that could play into the game in some way.  And in reply to the point made about ""super unrealistic game mechanics"" made earlier... I've never attended an animal carcass that was buzzing with flies immediately... this abundant noise only appears once the first sets of eggs have hatched on a body/carcass... and these aren't half as loud as the beetle larvae!!!

I've a link to one of my collegues videos just for example, I'd appreciate it if no horrible comments are made on his channel as (1) he was being decent and just put the vids up for me to use in my presentation and (2) he doesn't speak English so won't have a fucking clue what you're on about lol!

The vast majority of people we see on Tumblr fall into the latter camp. They aren't the architects of the ideology; they're people who've been drawn in by its cult-like appeal.

They're also overwhelmingly from middle class families; not families that are necessarily wealthy by any stretch of the imagination (though many are), but families with have been able to provide a comfortable and sheltered upbringing for their children. They don't have very much experience with real world problems. Quite often they're not very well socially adapted, either; especially the ones under 19 who haven't yet really gotten out of the high school world.

If you've never experienced real hardship, then smaller problems are going to seem so much worse to you, and these people usually don't have a good support network or coping mechanisms to deal with them.

The SJW ideology offers a world view that is compatible with their perception of reality. And it draws them in for five key reasons:

1. It teaches them their problems are, for all the psuedoacademic crap they come out with, simplistic and two-dimensional. It promotes the view that their every day, relatively minor problems are the real problems in our society.
2. It abdicates responsibility for those problems from themselves, and tells them there's nothing they can do about it. It lets them feel better without having to do anything to improve their own situation.
3. It creates an ""other"" for which they can blame those problems and direct all of their negative energy towards. That is a cathartic process, and it's a well-documented aspect of the success of extremist ideology (e.g., whitelandowners in Zimbabwe, Jews in European history etc.)
4. It establishes a community that shares these views and protects them from the real world when it tries to intrude; an echo chamber where their feelings will be heard, shared and reinforced regardless of their legitimacy.
5. It gives them a sense of identity and purpose where one didn't really exist before. Whether that identity is about race, gender, sexuality, language or just being an SJW, it makes them feel unique and special.

Most of them will grow out of it. The real world will come knocking and if they don't answer, drag them kicking and screaming out of it. When they start dealing with real problems, they'll forget their minor ones or start doing something about it. And for a lot of them, all of their passion will end up being channeled into positive things and causes; some will end up getting involved in real-world, positive, constructive activism.

They are no different to the university students who are fanatical Communists or Libertarians, most of who will later in life become moderate liberals, social democrats and progressive conservatives.

Sadly, a minority will not grow up. A minority won't change and will only get worse. They are the next generation of people who'll create and disseminate the ideology; they're the older SJWs we see less so on Tumblr but elsewhere, the really nasty people full of hate and bitterness.",t3_1u5pjo,False,t3_1u5pjo,ampseph,188,Surprisingly sexually aggressive transethnic Romanian lettucekin,TumblrInAction

Pliny the Elder says the country's name comes from a son of Hephaestus (aka Vulcan) named Aethiops.[29] Similarly, in the 15th century Ge'ez Book of Aksum, the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called Ityopp'is, an extrabiblical son of Cush, son of Ham, said to have founded the city of Axum. In addition to this Cushite figure, two of the earliest Semitic kings are also said to have borne the name Ityopp'is according to traditional Ethiopian king lists. At least as early as c. 850,[30] European scholars considered the name to be derived from the Greek words aitho ""I burn"" + ops ""face"".[31][32]

You must be a pan arabist because they are the only fools who would say that.

Hebrew is the native language as Canaanites spoke a dialect of the language as well as Phoenicians and Moabites also speaking dialects of **the same language that is referred to as Hebrew** -one thing is for certain, Arabic is as 'native' to the land of Israel as English is as native to New York. 

The Arab Palestinians are not descended from the Hebrews, not at all. That is a giant lie. And it is irrelevant what European Jews do because the majority of Israeli Jews are from the region (Middle East and North Africa) having been forced out of the Islamic world. 

According to archeologists Canaanites gradually evolved to Israelite culture,there was no massacres of Canaanites so believe science or act like a monkey, your choice. But by the consensus of scientists (archeologists) Canaanites voluntarily adopted Israelite culture and identity as a means to separate themselves from the ruling class. Therefore Hebrew culture is very much the western definition of indigenous. 

Israel is getting more vibrant and self sufficient by each year. The Israelis rank high on the happiness meter each year and have the highest birthrate in the modern world.

&gt; In 1943, in the Russian front, the decorated leader Rolf Steiner is promoted to Sergeant after another successful mission. Meanwhile the upper-class and arrogant Prussian Captain Hauptmann Stransky is assigned as the new commander of his squad. After a bloody battle of Steiner's squad against the Russian troops led by the brave Lieutenant Meyer that dies in the combat, the coward Stransky claims that he led his squad against the Russian and requests to be awarded with the Iron of Cross to satisfy his personal ambition together with his aristocratic family. Stransky gives the names of Steiner and of the homosexual Lieutenant Triebig as witnesses of his accomplishment, but Steiner, who has problems with the chain of command in the army and with the arrogance of Stransky, refuses to participate in the fraud. When Colonel Brandt gives the order to leave the position in the front, Stransky does not retransmit the order to Steiner's squad, and they are left alone surrounded by the enemy and having to fight to survive.

**Critical reception:**

&gt; At the time of its release, the film did poorly at the box-office in the US and received mixed reviews, its bleak, anti-war tone unable to get noticed amidst the hype of the release of the mega-popular Star Wars in the same year. However, it performed very well in Germany, earning the best box-office takings of any film released there since The Sound of Music and audiences and critics across Europe responded well to the film.

While the developers are of Czech origin - the game takes place in [somewhere where Cyrillic script is used](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Cyrillic_alphabet_world_distribution.svg).

Czech language uses latin script, for that reason and because Czech Republic is landlocked I don't think is takes place there. We need to find a place where they use cyrillic alphabet and have a sea shore.

Also the names of the places are mostly of Slavic origin, that excludes Russian ex-colonies in Middle East.

That lefts us: Russia, Ukraine, Montenegro, Bosnia and Bulgaria. Montenegro and Bosnia use Glorious Serbian Cyrillic Alphabet. Which is not the one used in the game. While Russia and Ukraine use the script inspired in Bulgarian one.

Also Ukrainian language uses some i's and ï's which are not present in the map, however southern Ukraine is mostly Russian speaking. So the real world possibilities for Chernorus location based on evidence are: Black Sea regions of Bulgaria, Russia and Ukraine. 

However the developers of the original Arma II map could have inspired in any region in Eastern Europe with sea (or [just a land portion with sea added later](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/České_Středohoří)) and then added Cyrillic for better exotic ambient.

I personally like to think about Crimean Peninsula when I play the game.

I am unfortunate enough to live in a hole as far as the existing rights model is concerned. I am a native english speaker but I live in Germany. I can consume German language media, but regrettably translation for dubbing is often a pathetic attempt on the original.  Unfortunately, often rights apply to a given translation model only and it is hard to find original English versions of TV and film in Germany until a DVD or Blu-Ray appears. There are some streaming services that are beginning to address this.

Even for books we have a laughable model where an ebook may be withheld from the German market in its English original but the German version is available. It may even be possible to order the dead-tree variant, but emedia sales are blocked.

You have to remember that the great authors and composers lived through a time of almost zero intellectual property protection. Did it stop them?

Lastly whilst I do see that some protection is beneficial. The level of extension used now is grossly disproportionate and the legislative system of language/territorial rights is a mess.

He was an Vietnam veteran who served in the DEA for many years. He had eyewitness testimony of drugs being loaded into CIA C130s in South America and flown into the US http://www.powderburns.org/.

While the obvious profits from war now a days are oil... they also include drugs. The beauty of drug money for intelligence communities is that they aren't declared. So they receive funding from the government, which obviously is auditable. Drug money is more lucrative for them and it isn't auditable. It's liquid cash flow for any black operations they deem necessary - assassinations, theft, ""regime change"" fuck... creating entire armies and buying entire governments (including the US and the UK). In fact the one of Reagans' chief financial advisors made a career out of explaining this situation in talks around the country [US]. She explained that nearly the entire US economy is floating (surviving) on a bed of undeclared drug money and she often asks people if they would be willing to sacrifice their quality of life to exist in a nation with an honest economic foundation (regular middle class type people)... the majority say they would not, for obvious reasons.

We live in a dark and merky world where wars (lost and ruined lives) are lead with the intention of gaining new revenue sources for intelligence communities that can spend that money buying governments to ensure they can use tax money to spy on us while they take over the world and undermine freedom - of which spreading said freedom is supposed to be their MO.

**1) Class:** 'cricket and the Empire were upper class, football is working class' - was this always true? Football was codified largely on the initiative of the public schools: the Cambridge Rules (first unified laws of the game) were agreed in 1848 by Harrow, Eton, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury and two non-public school representatives. Football seems to have reached Vienna at the end of the 19th century through British diplomats, bankers and traders; and similarly reached Brazil in 1894 through a public schoolboy called Charles Miller. Why were people of these backgrounds spreading football *outside* the Empire but cricket *within* it?

**2) Codification:** 'by the time association football was codified in Britain and then slowly spread, other countries had already codified their own versions of football such as gridiron or Aussie rules'. What about countries that didn't have an indigenous codified form of football, e.g. India? Also, were there reasons why British colonies were codifying their own forms of football but, say, Brazil or Austria weren't?

By now, you’re probably sick and tired of various ‘Game of the Year’ polls that everybody + his dog usually rolls out at the end of each year. Every one of them has a big flaw - they limit your choice.  Their nominee listings reflect the taste of whoever compiled them and often make you choose between 3-5 games that you don’t care about. And there is only one check-box in each category. Yay.

But the world of video games is hardly black and white for such primitive ‘Like’ approach.

We, the Riot Pixels team, consider ourselves perfectionists, so we decided to make a GOTY poll of our down (with blackjack and hookers!). We have 23 categories, each of them contains dozens and hundreds of video games released in America and Europe in 2013.

If you don’t want to scroll through unfamiliar games – we have short lists of the most known releases. But you’re free to vote for any obscure game that you like.

We have 5 positive and 3 negative positions in each category, each is worth a certain amount of points. So if you hate a really crappy game – well, drag and drop it where it belongs!

Our engine supports multiple languages, so the poll is available in 7 languages. We have English, Spanish, French, Russian, Czech, Belarussian and Ukrainian versions.

The poll will be open until January 20th. If at some point you realize that you chose a wrong game, you can go back and change your vote.

There are no ads whatsoever at our Riot Top website, so we’re not making a profit of it.

We're just fed up with boring GOTY editorials and fake ‘people’s choice’ polls.

By the way, we will be taking all comments and suggestions posted here on Reddit into account, so if you spot an error, tell us - we'll fix it.


P.S. We have Disqus-powered discussion boards in each category where you can reminisce on your voting, point out errors in listings or talk about preliminary results.",t3_1u5yzk,1388604774,t3_1u5yzk,PhilippVolnov,22,,gaming

*HIST 393, Fall 2013, Civil War and Reconstruction*

I took this with Prof. More who I absolutely adore. He sometimes also teaches HIST 400 Level class in Topic of American History. I'd recommend anything with him as he's very passionate about his topic, welcoming during office hours and genuinely cares about you and what he is teaching. The workload isn't ridiculous and in his 300 levels the conferences are optional so hoozah. The papers and exams are broad topics so you could literally write about anything and as for 400 levels, he pretty much accepts any research topic if you go to him and explain him. In my opinion, one of the best profs of the History department and if you're passionate about American History, he's your man.


*HIST 304, Fall 2013, IR history: Cold War*

I took this with prof. Lorenz (sp?) who is pretty dry but a good guy. If you're familiar with 20th century history, this class is a breeze. His main paper is weirdly format; it's not a research paper and you basically have to go analyse a bunch of newspaper articles which can get quite tiresome eventually. The readings a long but you can get by not reading them. The exams are broad questions, too broad in my opinion but hey, not going to complain. 

*HIST 436, Winter 2013/Fall 2013, Topics in European History: Renaissance Europe/Coffeehouses*

Renaissance Europe: I took this with Paula Clarke and I thought this was going to be about the bloody battles of the Renaissance but oh I was wrong. Alas, I was stuck learning about renaissance humanism which isn't my forté. She is a nice, elderly lady who knows her stuff but potentially has the most sleep-inducing voice and if I couldn't hear her in a 17 person class, I have no idea what it would like a class more than that. She is disorganised and always ends the class realising she hadn't gone through the necessary material.  However, the perks are that she is an easy marker. 

Coffeehouses: I took it this year with Brian Cowan who is potentially the most awkward and hilarious teacher ever. Highly recommend this if you need to pick up knowledge for a trivia party. He is very open about the research topics even though the readings can come off a bit excessive. However, he is an easy marker and an easy going guy when it comes to participation.

*HIST 380, Fall 2011, Western Europe in the Middle Ages*

I took this with Faith Wallis who loooves her primary sources and trust me, medieval primary sources are pretty damn dry. So if you love that, be my guest, you'll have a ball in this class. Her paper marking is slightly ambiguous; I was never sure where I went wrong or how I got certain grades but all in all she's an easy marker.

*HIST 301, Fall 2012, US Presidential campaigning*

I was super pumped for this class as it was exactly during the Obama/Romney run. However this class proved to be the biggest let down ever. I took it with Prof Gil Troy who was a hardcore Democrat which made the class ridiculously biased. Republicans, who are they? His classes made little sense, he was never there, the TAs were awful (""My speciality is 17th century Britain, no idea why I'm teaching this""-TA) and his exams and workloads were ridiculously due to the fact he was never there to teach anything. 

**English**

*ENGL 399, Fall 2012, Canadian Prose Fiction*

I look this with Prof. Lecker. Prof. Lecker is pretty infamous in the English department as people either love him or despise him (take a look at the rate my prof comment, there are some gems in there). I personally didn't like him and even though he knows his canadian literature, he is a ridiculously biased marker. If he loves you, you will do great, if you threaten him (usually unknowingly) or he dislikes you, you are guaranteed to fail. I had a pretty personal experience with him and if you want to know more, just PM me, I don't recommend this class. For your canadian lit requirement, fellow English Lit majors out there, take anything else, *anything else* and you'll have a better time. It was like the Hunger Games and you aren't Katniss Everdeen; you're the poor bloke he gets butchered in the first few minutes. May the odds be ever in your favour.

*ENGL 324, Winter 2012, 20th cent American Prose*

Holy shizzle, this class was ridiculously hard. Prof. Hepburn is the Dean of English and did his phD at Princeton and is best friends with Toni Morrison or something. He's got some great stories but his workload is INSANE. The exams are ridiculously broad and if you haven't read the books about three times, start counting your blessings. His classes were like living in the thunderdome. 

*ENGL 422, Winter 2012, Studies in 19th Cent Lit*

HOLLA PETER GIBIAN. Not only did he get baby sat by Sylvia Plath, but he is the most adorable man ever. He is so passionate, so nice and oh, the best man in the Lit department ever. TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

And were also easily demonstrated, with something as simple as a balloon.

Speaking of balloons, similar arguments were raised against heavier-than-air flying machines. Balloons were demonstrated and indisputable, but the principles of powered flight were obscure to many people, including many scientists who didn't happen to have that particular knowledge. But again, it was well understood by plenty of others, and also easily demonstrable with very simple tools such as a paper airplane.

In the US I stayed at campgrounds or free campsites in city parks (Kansas and Missouri allow it along the Transamerica).  In Australia I camped, or stayed at hostels.  Mostly hostels once I found out they were charging equivalent prices and had them all over the place.  In the Outback I often just camped on the side of the road.  Far enough away from the road to avoid crazy drunk driver crashes, and often behind some natural barrier to avoid the curious.  In Asia hotels were from $5-$15 so I just stayed there, especially since camping isn't as big a thing.  Some people I talked to had luck asking for permission to camp in people's yards, but I really appreciated the running water, wifi, and privacy that a room afforded me at the end of a day.  Europe was back to camping again, but as in most larger cities I would get a hotel room so I could explore without worrying about my stuff I ended up staying in a lot of hotels in Europe.

My planning started with me brainstorming a giant list of all the cool things I'd heard about in the world that I wanted to see.  Then I made a basic plot of a route that would take me past most of them.  Then I started reading about the areas I would be going through in travel books, traveler journals, weather reports, and anything else I could find.  I started putting together a rough estimation of distances between places, figured out how long it would take me to get from place to place, looked at visa requirements, border crossings, elevation maps, and so on in order to get an even more detailed idea of where I needed to go.  Cross-referencing climate with travel dates let me shift my schedule around so I could avoid winter throughout the whole trip, flying to Australia in the northern hemisphere's fall, and crossing over the equator to the north as the seasons changed again, heading north with the spring.  All this turned into a giant spreadsheet with daily mileage estimates, rest days, tourism days and so forth.  I plugged in estimates on prices and used that as a budget to plan for how much I needed to save.  

While I was doing all this planning I also started doing more and more tours in the US.  Lots of overnight camping, and once or twice a year a week or two long tour.  Around Lake Michigan, Seattle to San Francisco, RAGBRAI, the KATY trail, the Natchez Trace Parkway.  Lots of rides to test out gear, find what worked for me, and most importantly of all, test my enjoyment of spending long days on a bike and nights in a tent.  I put on thousands of miles doing that, and in doing so was able to be confident in my gear, my own abilities, and my knowledge of what I was capable of.  Quite a long way from my very first tour.  On that one I actually carried a spare blanket because my sleeping bag wasn't warm enough at night, and I had to walk my bike up lots of hills.  Now I know what it feels like to spend hours riding to the top of a mountain pass, and minutes coasting back down the far side.

It's easy enough to just toss some gear together and hop on your bike.  If you're really interested in it, start doing some overnight camping trips with your bike.  In less than 24 hours you can get a good idea of how prepared you are for it.  Also, check out AdventureCycling.org if you're in the US.

Since then 225,000 have gained Romanian citizenship and access to the rest of the EU, from Moldova alone.

In an investigation sponsored by the European Fund for Investigative Journalism, it was found that all the authentic legal documents required the citizenship in 15 months could be acquired for 700€, 1500€ being quoted for a fast track service.  The price for the two  fraudulent ID cards for grandparents to provide lineage, to acquire a genuine passport, sold for as little as 70€ a piece!

There was an uproar earlier this year when Malta said it would sell passports and access to the EU citizenship for half a million quid.  There's a perceived Sino access via Greece who are now giving out EU passports for anybody taking on a [€250k mortgage](http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1103&amp;MainCatID=11&amp;id=20131117000021), this is just another step.

It's not the uncontrolled Romanian and Bulgarian immigration so much, it is that their own borders and citizenship laws which apply to those *outside* the EU are so porous, lax, prone to corruption, and that they're so poor they're not a destination but a gateway into the EU for former soviet states.  

&gt;Bojdar Dimitrov, a former Bulgarian minister, told The Telegraph that his government had fast-tracked tens of thousands of passports for Macedonians after Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. 

&gt;Mr Dimitrov said: “Bulgarian citizenship is very popular in Macedonia. When I was in the foreign ministry we would issue 500 passports a week. All they would need to prove was that they had Bulgarian heritage.” Bulgaria asserts a historic claim to much of the territory of Macedonia, which emerged from modern Yugoslavia after it broke up in the early Nineties. 

&gt;Some estimates suggest that as many as two thirds of the entire Macedonian population of 2 million could claim Bulgarian citizenship and thus EU membership. 

&gt;Official figures show that in 2012, more than 22,000 Macedonians sought Bulgarian passports...“It is not the Bulgarians you need to be concerned about in Britain but the Moldovans, Russians and Ukrainians, who will take advantage of the relaxed laws in Romania to claim EU passports to travel to your country.” 

&gt;Philip Hollobone, a Conservative MP, said the prospect of non-EU residents coming to the UK would add to public concern about the end of employment restrictions. 

&gt;“This could boost significantly the number of people who come to our shores,” he said. “People will understand, even if they do not agree with it, the concept of free movement within the EU for EU citizens. But they will not understand how that applies to people who are not European citizens.”

This is more of an /r/atheism fallacy than anything else. Don't take it the wrong way, you seem just like someone who was taught the wrong thing and that's perfectly okay! 

The Italian Renaissance was 100% cultural. Yes, technological advances came from it but it wasn't because of some 'rediscovery' of former painting, sculpting, mosaics, etc. Ironically enough, many of the architectural practices they returned to because of their fascination with Romans and Greeks were inferior to Medieval architectural methods. 

The best case of this was in the 17th century in Utrecht, where a Gothic Cathedral was only half finished. The Renaissance folk finished construction using Italian Renaissance (read: Greek/Roman) architectural techniques. Well, when a massive storm of Hurricanes came through the Gothic part of the cathedral stood while the Renaissance part of it was blown away.

Nonetheless, the idea that the Greeks or Romans were any ""more scientific"" than Europe in the Middle Ages is just laughable, no offense. It's a hard thing to deal with that science, as a practice, is a modern phenomena. I don't feel like I can emphasize this enough. Saying the Medieval Era was a ""dark age"" because there was no science is just a historically ignorant statement to make because science as a practice, with a method and name, didn't exist until the 18th century. 

Another issue with this line of thought is that it treats technological change like a game of Civilization. Real life doesn't have a tech tree, technology adapts as the needs of the people change. The Romans had hegemony over most of the Mediterranean, were massively agricultural, and had an enormous slave population. So a lot of potential output a lot of land to cover. Thus, they invented things like the aqueduct to transport lots of water across large parts of the Empire and refined ideas like roads to assist travel across their holdings.

The needs of the people in the Medieval Era were different. They by and large did not have huge empires. They also did not have huge slave populations and without a large empire holding formerly inarable lands together with imported foodstuffs, the now artificially large populations began to suffer without sufficient agricultural production. So things like the heavy plough were invented, so that the rough lands of the North could be worked. But horses choke themselves to death with the plough, and their hooves are not good for working the rocky lands. Thus the horse collar and the horseshoe were created. With lower populations contributing, things like the mill (which did formerly exist, but in rudimentary fashions) were refined to automatically hammer metal, churn butter, and grind grain and save labor. I can do this all day.

If you want a really good book that you can pick up for $1.50, [On Divers Arts](http://www.amazon.com/Divers-Arts-Dover-Art-Instruction/dp/0486237842/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385253237&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=On+Divers+Arts) is a translated almanac of sorts from the 12th century on painting, metallurgy, glasswork. It will show you just how clever and intelligent these people really were.

&gt; I'm going off what I learned in History in high school (granted, that was a while ago). Does the ""Dark age"" actually refer to anything? How did the term come about?

Let's start from the top. A dark age is a real thing. It's a period of time where we have next to no or absolutely no primary sources from the period or even writing about said period. One such example is the end of the Bronze Age, or more commonly known as the ""Bronze Aze collapse"". We have no idea what happened, like, at all. There are a lot of theories, there is evidence for a lot of things, but we simply don't know. All we know is that a bunch of prosperous Mediterranean nations suddenly (as in, a few decades) were wiped off the face of the Earth, starting from the Northwest and working its way across and even into Palestine. The only surviving nation was Egypt where we only have a small amount of writing from this event.

There were also the Greek Dark Ages, which happened around the time of the former but was more severe from around 1100 to 800 BC. To quote wikipedia:

&gt; With the collapse of the palatial centres, no more monumental stone buildings were built and the practice of wall painting may have ceased; writing in the Linear B script ceased, vital trade links were lost, and towns and villages were abandoned. The population of Greece was reduced,[5] and the world of organized state armies, kings, officials, and redistributive systems disappeared.

What happened in the Medieval Era was not that. It's not even close to either of those. The term dark age referring to the Middle Ages comes from possibly the first neckbeard in history -- the monumental loser and tragic genius named Petrarch. Petrarch was a monk in the 14th century, during the bubonic plague as you might also know. Basically, Petrarch was a fucking prodigy. He knew a crap ton of languages and basically read every single book out there. A lot of which were saved texts from the Greeks and Romans. 

You know how your grandma always talks about how it was better back in her day? Well imagine that x100. It wasn't actually better back then, it's just nostalgia and selective thinking makes her think like that. That's what happened with Petrarch and his reading. Now combine that with the fact he lived during the most destructive disease in world history, watching nearly all of Europe get obliterated by this scourge and I think you're starting to put two and two together here. Petrarch saw the end of the bubonic plague, and saw the writings of the Greeks and Romans and thought *""Man, everything much have been so much better back then! Truly we are leaving this era of darkness*."" 

That isn't a direct quote, obviously, but the ""era of darkness"" is roughly a real thing he said. He had a skewed vision, and his writings lived on. The fact that until about the mid 19th century or so we had very little primary sources of the Medieval Era (like, an actual dark age!) except for, you guessed it, our friend Petrarch along with Petrarch calling it an ""era of darkness"" and all the death that came from the Plague and I think you can see where this myth originates from.

Oh, and I called Petrarch a monumental loser because when he left his priesthood he saw a girl on the street. No, he didn't talk to the girl or know who the girl was except her first name. All he did was see her just strolling down the street one day. Yeah he spent like, the next 50 years writing like 350 sonnets about her and how much he loves her. He was writing about her to the day he died. Just a fun little fact there ;P",t3_1u600g,1388599735,t1_ceeua8x,elos_,10,,magicskyfairy

Based on the international customer base, I would think they could sell through 1 million units with an international awareness campaign and no retail presence whatsoever. Ads online, some targeted talk show appearances (Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, Jimmy Fallon), maybe some tv ads. 
  
In addition, a major downside to going retail is the lack of a guided demo. The rift is not the type of thing that should sit on a shelf in Best Buy like the PS4 and XBOne kiosks. A trained individual should walk the person through the process, be there to answer questions, and illuminate possibilities. Without that, there better be some kick-ass introductory software. 
  
I am in favor of the Oculus Bus. Just like [Xbox and Playstation have done in the past](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.joystiq.com/media/2006/10/xbox_safety_dance_3.jpg), have a tricked out bus (there are rental services that provide this) with 10 or more demo stations. Even is it is not a bus, a booth is okay.  
Target the 18-30 demographic - folks that won't mind putting on an HMD if its cool enough. Make stops at colleges, sports events, concerts, that kind of thing. Have multiple demos that hit a certain interest:  
  
* Thrill Ride (Rift Coaster or similar)  
* Movie Watching (VR Cinema or similar)  
* Virtual Attendance (Total Cinema 360 or similar)  
* Space/Cockpit Shooter (EVE Valkyrie or similar)  
* FPS (TimeRifters or similar)  
* Multiplayer Online w/positional audio (MineCrift or similar)  
* Abstract (Ciess, ProtonPulse or similar)  
* Exploration (The Gallery Six Elements or similar)  
* Flight (Lunar Flight or similar)
* Shock and Awe (Titans of Space or similar)  
* Horror (Dreadhalls or similar)
  
Demos are given by trained reps that are enthusiastic, are able to answer questions, and ensure a quality experience. Each event results in thousands of people with their minds blown, that instantly inform their friends how cool their experience was. They get home to look up the Rift, and find a truckload of positive press coverage dating back to August 2012. Sold.

Let's cycle backwards a bit, the Middle Ages(Or Medieval Era). In this time, concepts such as nationhood were alien in concept. You had your liege lord, he had his, and you lived in a Feudal system where that could change at any time. You were never part of a fixed border or a fixed concept that is a nation-state. Yeah, sure, you had Kingdoms, but these were geographical manifestations of a lord's sphere of influence - they could change at any time under certain circumstances. To the average person on the ground, there was you, and your immediate superior.

At this time, religion was thriving. It was really gearing up in power. When people had no fixed political affiliation, what could they *really* identify themselves with? What common ground could any one man have with another? Religion. Religion transcended politics. If the Pope was displeased with a ruler, or excommunicated them, the vassals of said ruler would rise up and depose them because in their eyes, it was *religion* that was the ultimate authority. This is why during the Crusader Era, there was relatively unprecedented levels of peace in Europe, because all those who were fighting for land in Europe were off fighting Holy Wars in the Middle East instead.

You get the point. Religion was the overriding authority. People listened to their holy man or clergy. This was true even up until the early 20^th century for many parts of Europe - particularly places like Ireland, Italy, and Germany. 

This is where I believe Islam is. Not on such an extreme level, but it is still struggling to leave that stage. The concepts and ideas of nationhood, nationalism, belief in your country are starting to take hold in the Islamic world, but they are not concrete. The Middle East is still suffering from the political style that Europe was knee deep in 100 years ago. There is no *security*. When people don't have this, they *will* turn to religion as a constant. When you are born a Muslim in the Middle East, that is *you*. That is what you are. That is your identifier. Of course you're Egyptian, or Iraqi, or Lebanese, but you're a *Muslim*. That's why the Sunnis and Shiites are all killing the shit out of eachother even though they're from the same countries - to those on each side, if you're not of the same denomination, you're as foreign to them as an Afghan to an American.

If you really want to understand why extremism has been on the rise in Islam, you need to go back to World War I and the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman Empire was also the last caliphate of Islam. It was where all Muslims looked to for religious influence, similar to a Catholic to Rome. The Ottomans were a *somewhat* more tolerant, religiously - other than that whole kidnapping Christian children so they could press them into the government or military thing - so that when the Muslim world looked to the Ottomans, they saw how they should behave, and their behavior was kept in check by a centralized area of scholarship and study of Islam, the Ottoman Caliphate. If there were Muslims getting out of line, the Caliphate would deal with them. When the Ottoman Empire fell shortly after World War I's conclusion, Turkish revolutionary Ataturk dissolved the Caliphate, and there you go. What would Catholics do tomorrow if Rome were to disappear? With no more centralization, nobody to keep extremists in check, no ideal model of Islam for others to look to, the Islamic world fragmented. In the same fashion of Mussolini, or Hitler, or even Churchill, strong leaders managed to draw people to their cause, and their cause was fundamentalist Islam. With no more Caliphate to tell them otherwise, nobody to look to, nobody to keep them in check, many Muslims lost for guidance, went to the Fundamentalists, and they grew in power. 

The extremism and violence you see today is a knock on effect from that. 

You can talk about the justification behind it all, if it's morally correct, barbaric, uncivilized, or if we should tolerate it or whatever. I'm not in on that conversation right now.

Well, first of all it hasn't really been in use ""internationally"", but rather various nations have different systems that are mis-characterized as being identical and ""single payer"".

And secondly, you fail to take into account that medical *technology* is ""international"" and that those other systems gain significant cost benefits because they are able to essentially ""piggy back"" on top of the United States' system, which covers the lion's share of the research &amp; development costs, even though we have only a small share of the population using the tech.

You may as well assert that Germany manages to have advanced Jet Fighters of the same make as the US for a significantly lower cost. European defense has been heavily subsidized by the American government in multiple ways.

And so have their medical systems.

&gt; Lastly, let's also talk about something that advertisers care about: Staying power.

Starcraft is actually over 10 years old if you include the first version, which is said to also be the beginning of e-sports. I would also like to include another number: sustained audience. I don't know about chess, but Starcraft and LoL streamers do daily 5K viewers individually. With famous players all around the world (US, Europe, South Korea), that means there is a respectable amount of viewers 24/7, which makes for a quite interesting number of cumulated view hours outside of any event.

&gt; Lastly, let's also talk about something that advertisers care about: Staying power. Chess will survive paulson, or chess.com. StarCraft and League of Legends may, or may not.

That's a strength and a weakness. If you look closely a significant factor that keeps players and viewers in the game is that both Starcraft and LoL can renew themselves by changing - even slightly - the rules and/or some game elements. This is particularly obvious for LoL, which as over 100 characters each with a unique gameplay. At some point, they used to introduce one new character every couple of months, or ""rework"" some character that was not played because obviously weaker than others. Starcraft is a lot more stable, but every season (about 3 months iirc), they change the ""map pool"" for ladder games. Of course, current video games will fade out (only to be replaced by newer video games), and none of them will ever rival the longevity of Chess.

However, it's not all that important for advertisers, because advertising is opportunistic by nature. Times change, people change, games change, products change. What is important to them is to reach as much potential customers as possible. E-sports allows that in two ways: first, in order to reach the E-sports status, a video game must already have a significant player base that might be interested in events and streams. It doesn't matter how long it takes, it just has to happen and live long enough. Second, the E-sport audience is, or guess so, more easily defined than the Chess audience. When you advertise in a big Starcraft event, you know you'll mainly talk to teens/twenteens males that play video games. I don't think the Chess audience can be as narrowly defined.

&gt; Who is a more marketable personality, Carlsen or Emmanuel ""Grubby"" Schenkhuizen? Obviously Carlsen

Not so obvious to me. Remember that Grubby is an independent pro player. He was able to get sponsors all by himself, although he was and still is quite young. And that's even still true for more controversial players like ""Idra"" or ""Destiny"", both of them being very well known for their bad manners. Even Korean players that barely speak English can switch on their stream and get 5K-10K viewers worldwide without telling anyone, if they performed well in a previous tournament. Plus, one may talk to them directly when they are streaming; having a chat box is the norm on streaming sites. Is that the case for the majority of top chess players (genuine question)?

&gt; I don't mean that the same qualities used in StarCraft aren't useful in chess and vice versa - a lot of the discussion on this sub has made me want to get more involved in eSports because I think the skillset IS so similar

Not at all in my opinion. Starcraft is A Real Time Startegy game, an RTS. Some say it is actually more of a tactical game though. The fog of war requires to play very often with only partial information about what the opponent is doing. Finding ways to acquire this information despite the countermeasures of the opponent is crucial. Mind games, the art of making the opponent believe you are preparing a certain kind of attack, also plays a major role.
Figures show that pro players do at the very minimum two actions per second on average in a game that lasts 30 minutes typically. They have to think less deeply about what to do, but they have to think fast and execute fast. Starcraft is also a game of mouse accuracy. Furthermore high level players are admired for their multitasking, their ability to manage multiple fronts at the same time.
The real time aspect is a core element of the game. You can play Chess by email, but you absolutely can't with Starcraft.

&gt; I really like gaming, gamers, etc. but I wish they would stop acting like they're pioneering everything. They didn't invent broadcasting, real sports did.

Perhaps, but you have to remember the context. A decade or two ago, video games were considered an activity for kids or teens. Nowadays it is a huge industry that rivals Hollywood with adult customers (even my mother who plays Farmville is one of them, in a way).

&gt; They didn't invent games, games have always existed.

Video games are not just games, that's a huge misconception. Most of them mix elements from the seven arts and elements of traditional games, but the result is much larger than the sum of these parts. Video games actually re-invented games.

&gt; They're trying to turn a hobby into a professional sport

They are not trying, **they already did!**. According to [this random source](http://chess.geniusprophecy.com/professional-chess.html), about 100 Chess players are able to make a leaving of it. At least [50 pro starcraft players](http://www.sc2earnings.com/) make a quite decent income. And that's just Starcraft, which is now the second game in E-sports. Figures over a whole carrier may tell a different story, but still.

At some point, I got too lazy to include Amazon links. You can find them by a search. I've marked all the shorter essays so you can just quickly look at them.

**Current affairs**

  * **Short!** This essay about [complexity in government](http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/kludgeocracy-in-america) is one of my favorite things I've read recently.
  * On current tax policy: [The Benefit and the Burden](http://www.amazon.com/The-Benefit-Burden-Reform-Why-Need/dp/1451646259/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388602145&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+benefit+and+the+burden).
  * _The Coming Population Crash_ by Pearce about demographic change that's coming in the next decades.

Finally, find some periodicals and podcasts that cover things in depth and follow them regularly. They will gradually expose you to all sorts of ideas that will suggest what you need to read next. I follow the newspapers: _Washington Post_, _The Economist_, _National Affairs_; podcasts: _Econtalk_, _The Diane Rehm Show_, _Fareed Zakaria's GPS_.

**Markets and Libertarianism**

  * If you are interested in the philosophical foundations of libertarian thought, [Capitalism and Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Freedom-Fortieth-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0226264211/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388601892&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=capitalism+and+freedom) is a classic text.
  * I'm currently reading [Basic Economics](http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Economics-Common-Sense-Economy/dp/0465022529/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388601922&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=basic+economics) which is a very readable description of the free market view. The value of this book is carrying through the consequences of basic economic principles through the complexities of the market to their (sometimes surprising) conclusions and pointing out the fallacies often invoked to justify interventions in the market.
  * Of course, _Wealth of Nations_ by Adam Smith is the original classic in this regard, but I don't actually recommend it to start because it is long and not an easy read.
  * **Short!** Hayek's Nobel Prize address, [_The Pretense of Knowledge_](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/hayek-lecture.html).
  * **Short!** _Civil Disobedience_ by Thoreau. The original essay about the right of an individual to disengage from an immoral state.

And a bit further afield (bear with me), I believe a strong understanding of biological evolution is critical to understanding how markets and other complex systems work, and how competition gradually specializes _and_ diversifies while increasing fitness over time. Evolution applies to all systems with scarcity, competition, and some kind of heredity (which includes human learning &amp; imitation). It is an absolutely critical idea to understanding the world. Getting a thorough understanding of how it functions will explain all sorts of phenomena. Therefore I'd recommend any book that covers this well, _The Selfish Gene_ by Dawkins is a classic, but any book will work. _Antifragile_ by Taleb essentially covers the same terrain and expands it beyond biology, but I personally hated the book.

After you've gotten a grasp for a free market view, you should definitely consider [The Non-Libertarian FAQ](http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html) which will point out a lot of the problems of this philosophy. Game theory is a critical concept to understand why markets can fail.

**History**

I don't think there is any substitute for a detailed understanding of history to put different political philosophies in context. You can read all you want about philosophy, but if you can't ground it in historical (or current) fact, then it will be too abstract. 

  * _The Bully Pulpit_ by Kearns-Goodwin is a good but long recent book about the Progressive Era and the role of journalism. This is good motivational material for why the _laissez faire_ economic view fell out of favor.
  * _1491_ and _1493_ by Mann describe the Americas before and after European influence, and give a picture of the world economy.
  * _The Origins of the Modern World_ by Marks. This is an excellent, concise history of the last several centuries of world history, taking a ""world system"" view of history and focusing on the major conceptual developments. I strongly recommend it to anyone, and I need to re-read it myself.
  * _Why Nations Fail_ by Acemonglu describes how solid, representative political institutions are essential for prosperity and gives numerous historical examples.

As far as the Chechen Islamists go the Saudis are definitely on very dodgy ground if they're claiming to back people who've bombed both Russia and the US. Though admittedly the people who bombed Boston didn't seem like they were under control of anyone back in Chechnya let alone Saudi Arabia. 

However in the spirit of cooperation I think the US should try and do some sort of deal with Russia to suppress Chechen Islamists. Interestingly they did with the Taliban, and with great success

&gt; Armitage and Black flew to Moscow to seek help from top Russian diplomatic and intelligence officials.
&gt;
&gt; ""We're in a war,"" Black told the Russians. ""We're coming. Regardless of what you do, we're coming anyway."" He knew Afghanistan was in their sphere of influence and they would be queasy. ""At the very least we want you to look away."" He did not want the Russians trying to gum up CIA operations. ""From my humble position, I think this is a historical opportunity. Let's get out of the last century into the next one.""
&gt;
&gt; The Russians indicated they would help and certainly not obstruct. One noted that Afghanistan was ambush heaven, where the guerrilla fighters had demolished the Russian army. ""With regret,"" the Russian said, ""I have to say that you're really going to get the hell kicked out of you"".
&gt;
&gt; ""We're going to kill them,"" Black said. ""We're going to put their heads on sticks. We're going to rock their world.""
&gt;
&gt; The Russians soon sent a team to the CIA to provide extensive on-the-ground intelligence, especially about the topography and caves of Afghanistan.

IMO the US should send Armitrage and Black back to Moscow, to really ""get out of the last century into the next one"". Of course Russia is never going to be a real US ally in Eastern Europe. However the Chechens and the Syrian Islamist groups are clearly common enemies. I.e. the US may not like Assad but it is likely to like an Islamist Syria even less.

You can say about 3,000 or 4,000 escape from Romania and Bulgaria. A lot of people come to Dortmund.

Fantasy is *NOT* based on the Medieval Era. Fantasy can be based on *any* era of human history, or even on those that do not exist. In Tolkien's case, his works were based in the Medieval Era but also in a time long before then (as a history of Earth). It was very natural for Tolkien's works not to have prominent female human characters. 

However, fantasy does not have to be based on the medieval era *at all*. The Wheel of Time is based on a sort of early Renaissance, and the Chronicles of Narnia takes place in 1940's and 1950's Great Britain, and a number of different worlds from all sorts of time periods. It just so happens that the one we see in the first 2 or 3 books is based on Medieval Europe, while in later works that same book is based in 17th or 18th century Europe.

For the Shosone (show-so-knee) people, horses were very important.

 I don't really have any good single source for all or most of what I'm saying backing my statement, but various letters, textbooks and quotes from the two characters pretty much say Hitler had his own plans for Europe, which involved the greater Germany and master German race and all that fun stuff we know all about, and Mussolini had his plans for rebuilding the Roman empire in it's greatest extent. The thing was, Hitler was probably or almost able to reach this goal alone (trying to kill all the Slavs was just as damaging to his cause, and the other largest reason, IMHO), while there was no way in hell Mussolini's zerging tactics would work in any place other than Albania or Abyssinia. Now, Mussolini still wanted to create his Empire, and multiple times his army was unable to do jack shit, which ended in the Germany army running in and doing their work for them. I'm not sure exactly on how much Hitler was angered at Mussolini for cleaning up all his messes, but to put it into perspective, the Italian (and then later German) invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece set Operation Barbarossa back about six weeks. If Hitler had that time, was a little more competent and worked alongside anti Soviet factions within Russia rather than trying to exterminate the Slavs he would've at least captured Moscow before winter, virtually cutting off all lend lease supply lines going through Russia and leaving them to starve during one of the crucial turning points of the war.

The Foundation was originally founded shortly after World War I, as part of a reformation of the HMFSCP (Her/His Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal), which in turn was the child of Lord Blackwood's band of accomplices and fellow adventurers.

Upon Blackwood's death, the HMFSCP was reorganized, and the position of Administrator was given to Jonathan Deeds II, son of Blackwood's closest friend, confidant, and head of the HMFSCP after Blackwood's retirement. The Overseer Board was originally founded during this time.

World War 2 saw the fracturing of the Foundation into two sides, which later became the Foundation as we know it, and the Coalition. Administrator Deeds was critically injured and put into stasis. The position of Administrator remained empty, and the Overseer Board took control. The bulk of the Foundation that survived the split was the American branch: the European branches in Britain, France, and Germany became the GOC, using the old cliche of Nazi occultists to bolster their magitech development.

The Foundation in America was a split-off branch to begin with, originally under the graces of the American government, and now bolstered by men and resources from the remaining European branch, became independent of government control in the period of reconstruction after the war.

The Cold War was the height of the Foundation's power. The fighting in the shadows between the Foundation and the Coalition was constant, exacerbated by the arrival of GRU-P on the scene. But, through it all, the Foundation was the big man on campus.

But as the 80s arrived, things took a turn for the worse. GRU-P was dying, the GOC, caught up in the red tape of the UN, was building up their magitech capabilities beyond what the Foundation could feasibly counter, and the Foundation had grown too big for its britches. By this point, there were no surviving members of the original Overseer Board, Administrator Deeds was still hidden in stasis, and the current Overseers had removed themselves entirely from the day-to-day operations of the Foundation.

In this environment came corruption, and a cabal was formed of staff in leadership positions who seemed hellbent on driving the Foundation into the ground. The position of Administrator was filled without O5 appointment by a man who didn't even graduate high school. Men and women such as Clef, Bright, Gears, Rights, Kain, Strelkinov, and the like came to positions of power, despite the majority of these people being thoroughly unfit for their positions, and oftentimes mentally ill.

General Bowe was the worst of the cabal, though to be sure the brain damage he suffered in Vietnam did not help his judgement. His attempt to weaponize 076-2 through Task Force Omega-7 was so utterly disastrous that it crippled the Foundation's research and development for decades afterwards.

It was during the darkest days of this, in the late 90s, that Administrator Deeds returned to the land of the living, though in the end he was too late. The Cabal was broken and punishment was doled out, the impotent O5 board replaced. But, all in all, it was too late: Deeds II disappeared soon afterward, becoming a Nobody.

While the millennial restructuring was enough to keep the Foundation alive, it was not enough for them to thrive. Hide-bound to their conservatism, the Foundation is up against a changing world: the paradigm has changed. Knowledge of magic is spreading, information is harder to control, and the masquerade is growing thin. More groups of interest are cropping up, some of them very powerful indeed, and beyond that, the anomalous unaligned are growing in number: the Foundation is no longer necessary: the modern era has proven that people can adapt their life to anomalies with surprising ease. Yet they still hold on, and whatever natural law enforces the masquerade has not died yet.

The current outlook is a four-way cold war between the old and crumbling Foundation, the equally old buy far more spry Coalition, the Horizion Initiative (who bypassed the shadow conflict in the Cold War to build their own strength), and the various groups labeled as the ""Chaos Insurgency"".

At the best of estimates, the Foundation will survive until the 2020s. At that point, its inertia will run out, and it will die. Whether the world dies with it, or whether it will metamorphose to survive, remains unseen",t3_1u6191,False,t3_1u6191,Djoric,11,Cool guy.,SCP

But I don't know why you'd want to unless you really just hate the thought of owing someone money. Mortgage rates are still pretty low. You also can't eat a home. I'd much rather owe a $1000 mortgage payment when I lose my job and have 50K in cash and investments than have no mortgage payment and no other assets. 

Saving up for a house also take a *long* time usually. There's comes a point where you have enough of a downpayment and you want to enjoy the benefits of a house. Financing lets you get those benefits sooner. 

&gt; Was there a time when one could just save and buy a small house, 

This was more common, but the 30 year mortgage has been standard I believe since the 70s. The modern mortgage didn't really exist until 1930s. The government wanted to encourage home ownership and made financing easier to get. This continues today, although the terms have gotten longer and downpayments have decreased. 

This is good and bad. Good because it lets people who want a home buy one, but unfortunately people often buy homes they can't really afford. The US default rate is higher than western Europe, where lending requirements are stiffer.

Stop reading 50 year old books about kings and knights and start learning about actual everyday folk!  Chivalry didn't exist outside the minds of chroniclers!  Knights were grubby, dirty people who were usually far less literate and refined than townie merchants!  Start reading social history, people.

Swords were very common and easy to come by in the Middle Ages.  Just as much or even more so than during the Roman period.  Let's really not pretend like the Romans had either advanced trade connections or advanced technology.  They didn't.  Europe in 1300 dwarfed the Roman World in terms of population, trade, and technology.

We know weapons were common because:
1) most rural men had obligations to fight for their lord as part of their duty. 
2) Generally speaking, families were expected to defend themselves and their houses.  If someone was breaking into your house, you couldn't call the police.  You couldn't send a kid running miles away to bang on the Lord's castle's gate.  You dealt with it yourself.
3) There were laws prohibiting carrying weapons into cities, suggesting most people were armed on the roads
4) likewise, Laws might prohibit Jews from carrying weapons here or there, but make exceptions for travel or other circumstances.
5) You wouldn't walk around a city at night unarmed, generally speaking
6) Court case after court case, document after medieval document, contain crimes of homocide or injury by bladed weapons.  The archives are full of them.  I've seen them.
7) Specific Example: Rural peasant warriors called ""Almogavers"" joined the invasions of Peter III of Aragon after the Sicilian Vespers.  They each came with their own sword and a couple of javelins.

Moreover: The Steel of the Middle Ages was of a markedly higher quality than during the Roman period.  Metalworking advanced greatly during the medieval period, mostly under Muslim-ruled areas.  Remember, the Muslims inherited the best parts of the Roman Empire: Alexandria, the Levant, and later Anatolia.  They also inherited the best parts of Persian, Arab, and Indian civilizations too.  Damascus steel was said to be some of the best in the world, inherited from ancient traditions in India and China.

Medieval trade routes dwarfed the Roman ones; make no mistake.  By the 14th century there were far more people in Europe (pre-black plague) and far more boats going to and fro.  Yes, trade still linked India with England.  Yes, weaponry and technology was traded among Christians and Muslims.

&gt;History shows that absolutely no ruler in a socialist or communist regime is capable of upholding their ideals. 

Similarly, no ruler in a purely capitalistic economy has ""upheld their ideals"", primarily because no pure capitalist economy has ever existed on a large scale. I should also point out that no pure socialistic economy has ever existed. Communism is not an economic system, but rather a social, political, and economic system involving complete removal of government, classes, and money. (and no, no pure communism has ever existed either; at least not on an entire country scale). For the sake of your argumentation, I think you should focus on economic systems only or political systems only.

I also feel I should point out that the US is not a pure capitalistic economy today, nor was it ever. Nearly every economy of the world today is a mixed market economy, which incorporates elements of both capitalism and socialism. The extent to which countries ""lean"" toward one ideal or another varies by country. The US, for example, is more capitalistic than most western European countries but more socialistic than Hong Kong or Singapore. 

&gt;If you subscribe to the notion that socialism/communism is supposed to exist without a state, then I respond that in any circumstance, whether it's survival or business, etc, people will gravitate towards leaders, whether it's in a formal or informal fashion (for instance, my workplace has a fairly ""flat"" structure but even within my group, I always seek the advice of the more experienced people).

There are many, many different forms of theoretical socialism, but none that I know of require abolition of the state. Remember, socialism is an economic system, not a political one. Communism is as you described, but if you wish to discuss viability of communism it wouldn't make sense to compare it to the economic system of capitalism. The two are mutually exclusive, in the sense that communism entails both political and economic implications, but it is more broad and far reaching than capitalism. Capitalism doesn't say anything about the state, and you may be able to have a practicing capitalism without a state (but you cannot have a capitalism within a communism).

&gt;Furthermore, even though I do agree that everyone has the right to have their MOST basic needs fulfilled (via, say, some basic income that allows people to eat, drink water and practice basic hygiene with anything else having to be worked for),

these are socialistic elements, just fyi

&gt;I don't understand how one can transition to an economic system that no longer seeks profit.

Profit *is* part of a socialistic economy. It just isn't the sole factor in determining where capital is allocated. (an example is exactly what you just described, where the government inhibits capitalism to the extent that it ensures basic human necessities are met. A ""pure"" capitalism does not have any such provisions for equality.)

&gt;Yes, infinite growth in a finite world and all that, but without profit, we have stagnation. If you were to tell me that my income would not change for the rest of my life, I would only do the bare minimum to get by, regardless of how much I enjoyed my job. I deserve to be rewarded for my efforts.

Some types of socialism incorporate fixed wages but most do not. It depends on the form of socialism in question. 

&gt;Therefore I do not understand why is it not possible to simply retool the existing system (by enforcing tax laws more harshly on large fortunes and boosting the welfare state, for instance) to allow everyone to have a living wage. Yes, some might call it implausible but I find it much less implausible than the alternative.

This is precisely what mixed market economies of the modern world do. It is rare to see wholesale abandonment of a political or economic system, unless it is following some huge catastrophe or revolution.",t3_1u4txm,False,t3_1u4txm,halothree,2,,changemyview

Do you see bitcoins as steadily increasing in value (on average) for the next 30+ years? No? Then this is not the method because that's how long one saves for retirement, if starting young. Do you expect it to rise in value then drop? Well, trying to time the high point is very risky and like gambling. If you expect it to stabalize, well you better be damn sure it's gonna stabilize at a point higher than your purchase price.

All of this has considerable more risk then diversifying your money across the entire US/European stock market through (index) mutual funds and watching that money grow steadily but surely with the economy.

She has not mastered english very well which led to her choosing a slightly confusing name. Armed with spears and riding a Bengali Tiger (named Marduke, the only thing she reads) she delivers justice to evildoers. 

Nemesis Falcon - Gal Hunts boyfriend. As a baby he fell down a cliff into a falcons nest. The falcons took him in and nurtured him but couldn't give him the ability to fly. After hunters killed his adoptive father and siblings he cast himself from the cliff to save his adoptive mother who had been hit in the wing and despite the height they miraculously survived. Injured, he stumbled through the wild with his mother in his arms and he came upon a hut where an old shaman lived. The shaman took the spirit of the dying falcon and combined it with the young man, giving him the ability to transform his arms into wings. He now swears vengeance on those who would hurt the innocent without thought.

Originally trained as a KBG agent he became a vigilante after becoming frustrated with bureaucracy. The oldest member of the team at 60 years he has become a father figure for the younger members and armed with advanced equipment he is still an invaluable member and a force to be reckoned with. 

Seer Frost - The last of a lost order of monks who wielded magic powers. The rest of the order were killed as their vow of non-violence prevented them from fighting back against a group of witch-hunters. As he faced death the seer received his first vision from the future and saw the oblivion of death. Completely unshackling his powers in shock he reduced the temperature of the entire monastery to absolute zero. With his powers shielding him form the cold he sat there for days to try and come too grips with what he saw. Now wearing a red robe to signal his departure from the order he once belonged to and hunts down murderers using his powers. His friends and foes alike fear him and uses his name to describe his heart as well as his powers. While he holds no love for most people he has shown great fondness for Marduke

I had a girl tell me she didn't have her homework because her parents were in Europe so she was the one that had to settle a fight between the maid and the butler that morning and in the commotion she forgot to grab it. I overheard a kid complaining that his family was downsizing in a move and he would only have a suite instead of a whole wing to himself.

The very first Roman calendar (itself borrowed from the Greeks) had [ten months, starting with Martius and ending with December](http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar-roman.html#anchor-what):

1) Martius

2) Aprilis

3) Maius

4) Junius

5) Quinctilis

6) Sextilis

7) September

8) October

9) November

10) December

These months covered only 304 days of the year. The remaining 61 days, after December, were not part of any month.

Martius was the time of the Spring equinox, and [Spring was a common time for ancient societies to start their year.](http://davesgarden.com/guides/articles/view/2221/#b) (However, it's not clear why the Roman calendar started about 21 days *before* the equinox.)

So, the original Roman calendar, from which our modern Gregorian calendar is descended, did start in Spring.

However, this 10-month year didn't last very long. Within about 50 years, two extra months were added to the year, to make it up to 355 days: Januarius and Februarius (the 10 missing days per year were made up every second year by a ""leap month"" of 20 days, known to the Romans as an ""intercalary"" month). 


The Romans now had **two** beginnings to the year: Januarius was the month that each year's consuls started their year of service, but the calender year was considered to start in Martius. (This is sort of like the modern practice of having a financial year start on a different date to the calendar year.)

It wasn't until Julius Caesar's time, nearly 700 years later, that the New Year [was moved to the first day of Januarius](http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-history.html#anchor-year-always-started) (Caesar did this as part of his reform of the calendar, which became known as the Julian calendar).

The Julian calendar continued to be used in most of Europe long after the Western Roman Empire fell, but [with no consistency about when the start of the year was](http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-history.html#anchor-year-always-started) - it started on different dates in different countries: 1st March; 1st January; 25th March; even 25th December. (Even now, the English tax year starting on 6th April [reflects their previous New Year date of 25th March](http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2738,00.html), adjusted for the Gregorian calendar.)

Eventually, the confusion pushed everyone to consistency. This was assisted by the gradual adoption across Europe of the Gregorian calendar, with its New Year start date of 1st January (going back to Julius Caesar's earlier decision).

The current choice of January 1st is therefore based on Julius Caesar's earlier choice of this date, which was based on the fact that the month of Januarius ""[contained the festival of the god of gates (later the god of all beginnings)](http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar-roman.html#anchor-republican)"".

""Whites"" have been dominant from about 1400-present. 600 meager years. If we had been having this discussion in 1400, it would be about how brown-skinned Arabs and Africans dominate math, science, philosophy, and history, while whites were wallowing in the Dark Ages. Around 600 CE and it would be the same thing, but asked of the Chinese. Around 2000 BCE? All brown-skinned Egyptians creating monuments that have lasted for millenia while whites were scribbling on caves in Europe.

I agree. It's all about relevance though, those civilizations did not bring us to the level of technology we enjoy today, they simply dominated in their day. So yes, the most recent civilizations discoveries and inventions, the pinnacle of human progress at this point in existence carry far more weight and are far more relevant than how out of date science was monopolised by an ancient empire thousands of years ago.

&gt;Even now, in 2014, with declining birth rates in the Western world and the rise of countries like China, India, and Brazil, European hegemony may be seeing the sun set on it. 

Oh it will, Feminism is killing the birth rate, although to be fair, the birth rate is falling worldwide. I did an article on this on my site about how feminism ethnically displaces whites. I 100% agree with you on this. Whites are set to be an ethnic minority in their own ancestral homelands in the future as those from the third world emigrate en masse to Europe for a better life, bring their families, racial mixing and etc.

&gt;To try to assert that this or that skin color of humans is intrinsically dominant is to blind yourself to the realities of the whole of human history.

It's not about skin colour, it's about people from UK and USA creating 81% of all modern tech and discoveries and the rest of the world being dependent on that to not get left behind technologically. The rift was enormous in technology, when there's a tank going up against a tribesman it's a bigger difference than one ancient empire having better swords made out of sturdier metal than another. The only reason the word white is even used is because the person I'm acknowledging said ""*4 years of my life to hear about how being born a white male makes me responsible for all the world's problems.*"" and why do they want us to hate white people or blame them for everything bad? Because of the newest empires being comprised of almost entirely whites, but what did those same people do? Provide almost all our modern comforts based on the lesser discoveries of what you point out were prior civilizations. You cannot even equate ancient egyptian pyramid building methods with the precision of a modern laser, they're totally different leagues.

&gt;In other words, I, a Nigerian male, am more similar to a Ukrainian male than he is to an unrelated Ukrainian female. 

Totally agree.

&gt;Thus, implying that this or that ethnicity or skin color is somehow intrinsically better technologically, mathematically, linguistically, etc. is a fallacy of the utmost degree.

Skin colour doesn't create superiority it's merely aesthetic, the fact the most recent empires responsible for most the worlds modern tech which led them to create dominant nations economically/militarily has been associated with skin colour is a fallacy, I agree. It was to do with culture/politics in those lands. Their way of life led to success, as we can see today similar ways of life are being replicated around the world to achieve the same success as you rightfully point out, China and India are emulating the west and becoming richer/more prosperous. We know certain things DO WORK but who found them first? Europeans. Is that luck or genetics? I can't say.

&gt;The story of human history is one shaped by many factors, but inherent genetic superiority of one ethnicity over another (in any manner of arenas) was not one of them.

I don't really have an opinion on this, the nature/nurture argument can go on forever I don't really have enough knowledge to deduce if this is a fact or not. For all I know a 0.1% difference could be the difference between the western ability to innovate and chinese inability to innovate. I don't know, so I can't make a fair conclusion.

&gt;If you agree with all of this and were arguing something entirely different, then I apologize in advance for my oversight.

It's OK, like I said, we're talking about why people find it acceptable to be anti-white and not even think they're being racist, (due to recent empires being white empires) I'm pointing out that everyone has enslaved their own people ethnicity regardless and it's only OK to hate on whites because they've had the most technologically advanced empire and been the most recent in power. People seem to forget that any ethnicity is capable of the same shit the whites did, just the whites took it to the biggest extreme due to the level of tech they had at that disposal versus all the previous empire.",t3_1u4i4r,1388612404,t1_ceeye00,IllimitableMan,-1,Dark triad expert: - http://illimitablemen.com/ - [3 Points],TheRedPill

it is simply self evident that if you are trying to radically redirect the course of discussion in *the fucking slave trade* you have a ridiculous and unhistoric agenda. In this case, Sarsen's intentions are dishonest, but more importantly, his history is dead wrong.
Clearly **subsaharan africa**, where african american slaves of both USA and Brazilian provenance hail from, is a culturally, geographically, ethnically, and historically distinct place from **north africa**, the location of these ""Barbary pirates"" and to whom the dubious statistic in question refers. So this entire post is predicated on a laughably ignorant, oafish, gradeschool naive comparison between two ""africas"" that are clearly not the same place. While the history of europe's relationship with north africa is long and complex, the history of Europe's relationship with subsaharan Africa is, by any credible historical record, marred by brutal colonialism and slave trading. 

**So Sarsen has started this out with a massively fundamental historical error. So anyone posting to defend him is buying into this nonsense, and therefore, no matter what they write, they have already discredited themselves.

&gt; It is the time of the Crusades during the Middle Ages - the world shaping 200-year collision between Europe and the East. A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin. But Baldwin's days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin's vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath\: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth. Balian takes the sword and steps into history.

&gt; Upon its release, it was met with a mixed reception, with many critics being divided on the film. Critics such as Roger Ebert, however, found the film's message to be deeper than Scott's Gladiator. (*Wikipedia*)

[Collapse of Complex Societies by Dr. Joseph Tainter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI)

Venue: Grand Rapids, MI future.org meeting


The evolution of social complexity concerns the change from societies that were small with few distinctions other than those based in biology: age and sex, to those that are large, differentiated, and highly integrated.

Hunter-gatherer societies have only a few dozen distinct social personalities while modern censuses recognize 10,000 to 20,000 distinct occupations.

Concepts of complexity, e.g.: physics, biology.  Tainter means two
things:

* Differentiation and specialization in structure and function and behavior.  More parts and more kinds of parts.
* Increasing integration and control of behavior.  As number and types of parts increase, mechanisms to bind these together as a system.  Without integration and organization you don't have a system, you merely have an assemblage of parts.

Examples which superficially appear to be complex systems but aren't:

* 1942 N. Africa landings:  500,000 different types of military artifacts.  Julian Steward.  This _wasn't_ a complex system, ships were loaded poorly.  Consequence:  when unloading in N. Africa, guns arrived w/o gunsights or ammunition, no gunners.  Proper operation:  combat loading:  load in reverse order to need on landing.  Not a complex system because of lack of organization.  Great differentiation, poor organization.
* Opposite:  drummers at Bejing Olympics.  Low structural diversity, very high organization -- all the same.  High level of organization, but no differentiation and structure.  Hence:  not a complex system.

#### The Irony of Complexity

Complexity can be counterintuitive.  Complexity simplifies (hence: it's not complicated).  Complexity is an elaboration of structure and control, it simplifies and channels human behavior.  This is why complexity exists: it makes systems function.  

Financial crisis of 2008:  high diversification, little organization.  Hence, not a complex system.  A failure of complexity.

Again:  structure and organization are the elements of complex systems (differentiation?), and complexity simplifies and regularizes.  

What is a collapse?  When a society rapidly loses an established level of complexity.

Post-collapse societies are simpler, have fewer parts, are less well-organized, and often are smaller.

#### Examples of collapse:

* Western Roman Empire, 5th C AD (followed by Dark Ages of Europe)
* Classice Lowland Maya of Guatemala, 9th C AD
* Hittite Empire of Anatolia (Turkey), 13th C BC
* Minoan Civilization of Crete, 14th C BC
* Mycenaean Civilization of Greece, 12th/11th C BC
* Western Zhou Dynasty, China, 771 BC
* Harappan Civilization, Indus Valley, 18th C BC
* Egyptian Old Kingdom, 2181 BC
* Olmec Civilization, Mexico, 5th C BC (?)
* Teotihuacan (~700 AD) &amp; Tula (12th C AD)
* Huari &amp; Tiahuanaco, 11th C AD)

In the Americas:

* St. Louis Indian Mound culutres:  Cahokia (13th C AD)
* Casas Grandes (14th C AD), Chacoan (11th C AD), Hohokam (15th C AD)

#### Misperceptions about human complexity:

* It occurs simply because people invent things. (Contrast:  ""before his time"" -- Leonardo, early (Roman) inventor of Aluminum))

* Complex society ""civilization"" is an accomplishment -- an accumulation of many things invented over time. 

Problem with that:  complexity isn't free.  It has a cost.

#### Complexity in problem solving:

Complexity costs.  The costs may be metabolic or measured in some currency:  time, money, energy.  Ultimately:  energy.  For biological systems:  calories.  For humans ""the accounting is more subtle"":  money and annoyance.

But ultimately, metabolic, hence energy costs.

Before fossil fuels:  complexity meant _people_ worked harder.  People had to work harder to support complexity.  Which means that human societies don't have any intrinsic tendency to increase in complexity, contrary to popular assumption.  There are real reasons _not_ to increase in complexity as it costs more, simply because it costs and people have to work harder.

Why do societies become more complex?

* Complexity increases because it solves problems.  E.g., hybrid cars, new types of institutions, new activities.  Casablanca landings in WWII
* Problems are often solved by developing more complex technologies, adding new positions and social roles, or conducting new kinds of activities.

E.g.:  Complexity responses to the 9-11 terror attacks:

* Proliferated structure:  New gov't agencies (TSA, DHS), reorganized others, increased organizational control over people's behavior.  We've increased complexity.  And it costs us:  taxes, regulations, products we buy, annoyances.
* Complexity costs -- costs can be metabolic or measured in currencies.
* Complexity in problem solving is an economic function.  Complexity has costs and benefits.
* As simple and cost-effective solutions no longer suffice, institutions develop solutions that are more complex and costly.

Economics of complexity:

* What are economics of social or institutional complexity?
* Complexity has benefits
* Higher complexity costs
* Changing complexity changes benefit/cost ratio of complexity
* Changes in the benefit/cost ratio of complexity can mean
different futures for societies.
* Diminishing returns to complexity.  This can profoundly
influence society's future over long periods of time.
* Higher complexity requires societies to acquire more energy to support complexity (e.g.: fossil fuels).  At the same time,
having cheap energy permits and facilitates even higher
complexity.  So complexity _requires_ energy, but having _cheap_ energy permits us to develop more complexity.  This is the energy-complexity spiral.

Energy and complexity go up and down together.  You cannot have complexity without energy, and if you have energy, you're going to have complexity.

&gt;... America's future leadership role may depend even more on how threatening the world appears [then upon 'whether Iraq ultimately comes to be viewed as a failure or a success']. Historically, that leadership role has often emerged out of a compelling crisis: Pearl Harbour, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iran hostage crisis, Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, or the attacks of 9/11. Paradoxically, the relative security which Americans have enjoyed since 2001 makes it easier to doubt the necessity of shouldering the burden of leadership.

Are elements within the current administration considering an ""October surprise"" -- or, more precisely, an October bomb—as a means of shifting the dismal prospects confronting McCain and his fellow Republicans at the polls? Are they weighing the option of either engineering or facilitating a terrorist attack and significant loss of American lives in order to swing the election? ...

""The more successful they've been at intercepting and stopping bad guys, the less proof there is that we're in danger. And therefore, the better they've done at making sure there isn't an attack, the easier it is to say, 'Well, there never was going to be an attack anyway.'

&gt;...To convince the allies of the looming Taliban attack, another Twin Towers like drama is being planned in which Pakistan is the villain apparent while the US-installed Afghan president is ruling the roost. He has 40,000 highly equipped US and NATO forces in addition to the US-trained Afghan army against scattered Taliban militants whose strength hardly exceeds ten thousand. Instead of fighting with them fair and square in Afghanistan, he conveniently shifts the blame onto Pakistan.
Wednesday's barbaric provocation was designed to bring to a standstill the ongoing peace negotiations between the government and tribal elders. It certainly was a conspiracy that fell short of a flare up because the tribal leaders showed their resolve to continue with their peace dialogue to restore normalcy in the area...

Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century

The Project for a New American Century, PNAC, was a think-tank group calling for military 'transformation' of the US so that many large-scale resource wars could be fought at the same time, to create a unipolar world which maintains and increases US control over world resources. The September, 2000, white paper, Rebuilding America's Defenses, was written by Paul Wolfowitz.
&gt;... Further, the process of [military] transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor...

Since Paul Wolfowitz supported ""military transformation,"" he was wishing for the ""new Pearl Harbor"" to speed up the process of militarization and large-scale wars on multiple fronts. A year later came the 911 attack.",t3_1u6ptm,1388661924,t3_1u6ptm,flyinghighernow,1,,altnewz

""After being recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization in 1957, Scientology's tax-exempt status was lost in a 1967 IRS audit.[5] As part of the effort to regain tax exemption during the late 1970s, Scientologists repeatedly infiltrated the IRS, copying large numbers of documents and at one point placing an electronic bugging device in an IRS conference room.[5] These actions took place within a program code-named ""Operation Snow White"" (see below).[5] Eleven high-ranking Scientologists, including Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard, were sentenced to time in prison for acts surrounding this operation.[5] Hubbard himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator as investigators could not link him to the crimes.[5]

The Church then embarked on an aggressive, but more legal course, the church's hundreds of affiliated entities filing a steady stream of lawsuits against the IRS in an attempt to have their tax-exempt status approved.[5] In addition, members of the Church started filing thousands of lawsuits against the IRS, claiming that they were entitled to tax deductions for auditing and training expenses.[5]

They were finally rewarded in October 1993, when the IRS formally announced that the Church of Scientology and its related social betterment organizations had been granted tax exemption again.[5] Since then, the U.S. Department of State has formally criticized several European countries, including Germany and France, for religious discrimination against Scientologists.[6][7] In March 1997, the New York Times published an article chronicling ""Scientology's puzzling journey from tax rebel to tax exempt"" in the United States.[7]""

### Q: [??? female]   Looking at past examples of collapse, are there social structures or institutions which are better at maintaining mass well-being within the society, are there specific institutions within society which can help, essentially, peasents, and other masses to survive it well?

A: Very few governments have conceived of themselves as having the purpose of providing for the general welfare.  That's a fairly recent phenomenon, and even in the world today that's relatively rare.  Local well-being is best assured through local institutions and local organizations, if that's what you're asking me.

### Q: What about religion and collapse?

A: Religion has had a function.  E.g.:  Constantine adopting Christianity explicitly as a unifying factor, essentially: himself as a representative of God on earth.  Which is how European monarchs ruled through the middle ages, as the representatives of God on Earth.  Religion is a unifying factor, but the problem they had with Christianity in the Roman empire was that it was fairly new and highly diversified.  There all of these schisms and sects and so on, so they had to keep having counsels to denounce aryanism and all these other things.  I wouldn't say that religion really played a role, collapse would have happened with or without it.


### Q: [??? Fem]  You said that sustainability may require greater consumption of resources, not less.  If the definition of sustainability is that we want to remain on this planet and healty, I don't get that.  If the definition is that we want to go on consuming and keeping the lifestyle we have, then it makes sense.   Why tell people that sustainability may require consuming more?

A:  The reason is because sustainability is a function of solving problems, and it takes resources to solve problems.  The example we gave in the Roman Empire is that they needed more and more resources to be sustainable, and they undercut their production system to attain that.  But they did achieve two centuries of sustainability which is nothing to laugh at.  In the future the problem may be a lack of resources on our planet, or too much polution, or a changing climate, but we're not going to solve those problems by being poor.  Unless people drastically change the material quality of life they're willing to accept.  I approach sustainability from the assumption that most people will choose to sustain what they are familiar with:  their accustomed way of life.  So the question becomes:  how do you sustain that in the face of problems?  And the answer is:  it takes more and more resources to do so.  I don't say I necessarily approve or advocate that, I just see it as a historical reality.

**Q: I say that's impossible.**

A: Yes, in the long run it _is_ impossible.  I don't know that we're at that point yet, but in the long run, yes.

**Q: Dark ages, survived, a couple of centuries ... ????**


### Q: [??? Male]  It seems you're saying all societies must inevitably collapse.  I'd like to contrast that with Jared Diamond's statement, the subtitle of his book on Collapse is ""how societies choose to fail or succeed"".  It doesn't look as if we have a real choice.

A: No, and that's one of the problems I have with that subtitle of his book.  Societies don't _choose_, they're confronted with circumstances.  ""Do all societies have to collapse?""  I don't want to predict that that's inevitable, although I will say over the past two to three years I've become more pessimistic on that point. 


### Q: [??? Male]  Money &amp; deflation:  could we slow the collapse if we changed the way money works?  We've got a debt-based money system where money is borrowed rather than being issued into existence as Abe Lincoln's greenbacks were.  Inevitably, 40% of the cost in any product or service are interest costs, because even when you're buying something, that company is in debt to somebody.  So we have to have economic growth to pay the growing interest costs, not just in government but in the private sector, which far exceeds government debt.  Does how different societies organized their monetary system play a role in at least slowing collapse if not in making a steady-state existence possible?  

A:  In a sense, by debasing their currency, the Romans were delaying collapse.  Essentially by shifting costs to the future.  Ancient governments rarely had the ability to borrow.  They operated on a cash basis, on the basis of precious metals they had on hand.  That's how they paid their bills.  Our system of finance today is so different, and of course as you point out the entire economic system runs on debt, it runs on finance.  I'm not an economist.  I don't know what would be involved in coming down off of that.  I don't think that's a question I can answer, perhaps others here can.


### Q: [??? Male]  You mentioned that humans do not think broadly.  Here in Grand Rapids, we have a new education program called ""Big History"" being pushed by Bill Gates, to help the poor.  And in order to do that you've got to understand history going all the way back to the Big Bang.  It's similar to the Powers of Ten movie from the 1960s.  And if you know all that history then perhaps you can really understand this world and solve problems.  What do you think of this?

A:  That's a great program, certainly what I'd advocate.  Humans by inclination don't think broadly, but if we taught them at an early age, perhaps some of them could learn to, could learn to be curious about things distant in time or space, and see connections between those distant things and our lives today.  I sometimes think that if I were 30 years younger and starting my career, I'd talk to K-12 educators about how to teach children to be curious about things in time and space.  Children come out of school with no interest in history or geography, subjects most of them hate having to take.  Are there ways of teaching them in ways to be more interesting?  If someone's trying a program along those lines that's wonderful.


### Q: [Max Lockwood]  Given inevitability and global impacts of present civilization collapse, would an active acceleration of the collapse cause more net-negative effects than if we let it happen on its own? 

A:  When I say ""collapse is rapid"" I mean over several decades.  Whether it's over several decades or less, the net effect is going to be that tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of people will starve to death or die of disease.  It's going to be unpleasant either way.  It's not a future we want.

**Q: (followup)  Yes, but would the effects be better sooner or later?  Quick pain vs. later pain?**

A:  I'd have to flip a coin on that one.

Paul Wolfowitz reviews a new Robert Kagan book

&gt;... America's future leadership role may depend even more on how threatening the world appears [then upon 'whether Iraq ultimately comes to be viewed as a failure or a success']. Historically, that leadership role has often emerged out of a compelling crisis: Pearl Harbour, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iran hostage crisis, Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, or the attacks of 9/11. Paradoxically, the relative security which Americans have enjoyed since 2001 makes it easier to doubt the necessity of shouldering the burden of leadership. One hopes it will not take another calamity to convince us of the need for a vigilant foreign policy.

**US: Republicans prepare to play terror card in 2008 election**

*2008 http://wsws.org/articles/2008/jun2008/repu-j04.shtml*

This is a look at the 2008 election campaign, republican focus on terror threats, support by opposition democrats with the war on terror, yet also describing ""opposition [that] emerged within ruling circles"" about strategies, not policies.
&gt;... [Newt] Gingrich’s seemingly off-hand remark (see the next headline on this page) provides an unintended glimpse into the thinking and discussions within top echelons of the Bush administration and the Republican Party...
Are elements within the current administration considering an ""October surprise"" -- or, more precisely, an October bomb—as a means of shifting the dismal prospects confronting McCain and his fellow Republicans at the polls? Are they weighing the option of either engineering or facilitating a terrorist attack and significant loss of American lives in order to swing the election? ...

**Newt Gingrich quips Bush should have allowed some reminder attacks**

*2008 http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Gingrich_Bush_should_have_allowed_attack_0529.html*

&gt;...""This is ... one of the great tragedies of the Bush administration,"" Gingrich continued. ""The more successful they've been at intercepting and stopping bad guys, the less proof there is that we're in danger. And therefore, the better they've done at making sure there isn't an attack, the easier it is to say, 'Well, there never was going to be an attack anyway.' And it's almost like they should every once in a while have allowed an attack to get through just to remind us""...

&gt;...To convince the allies of the looming Taliban attack, another Twin Towers like drama is being planned in which Pakistan is the villain apparent while the US-installed Afghan president is ruling the roost. He has 40,000 highly equipped US and NATO forces in addition to the US-trained Afghan army against scattered Taliban militants whose strength hardly exceeds ten thousand. Instead of fighting with them fair and square in Afghanistan, he conveniently shifts the blame onto Pakistan.
Wednesday's barbaric provocation was designed to bring to a standstill the ongoing peace negotiations between the government and tribal elders. It certainly was a conspiracy that fell short of a flare up because the tribal leaders showed their resolve to continue with their peace dialogue to restore normalcy in the area...

The perception of the threat is so low in this society that it's not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment.

**Rebuilding America's Defenses**

Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century

2000

The Project for a New American Century, PNAC, was a think-tank group calling for military 'transformation' of the US so that many large-scale resource wars could be fought at the same time, to create a unipolar world which maintains and increases US control over world resources. The September, 2000, white paper, Rebuilding America's Defenses, was written by Paul Wolfowitz.
&gt;... Further, the process of [military] transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor...

The Japanese royal family established itself as the head and core of the Shinto faith from the very start almost 1400 years ago, making it sacrilege to attack them. Of course just establishing themselves as the nations religious heads was not enough to guarantee their position. In Europe, the Papal States (the kingdom formerly ruled by the pope) tried several times to expand and exert more military power, and every time they did, they were attacked ferociously by other Italian states, and the Holy Roman Empire, even with threat of excommunication posed.

It was not just the fact that they were of religious significance that kept them safe, it was the fact that they rarely tried to exert the full control over the country that pretty much every other royal family has tried in both Europe and Asia. Because of this, getting rid of the royal family was never seen as needed to become the dominant power (shogun) in Japan.

When Europeans first came to Japan, they described Japanese conditions in analogy, likening the emperor, with great symbolic authority but little political power, to the Pope, and the shogun to secular European rulers.

In other countries where royal families exerted a lot of control and military support, if a lord or rebel group wanted to assume power, it was vital to kill, imprison, or banish the royal family. Not so in Japan. The Imperial family was happy to sit in their capital as the spiritual and religious head of the country, and let the lords outside fight it out for ""real"" control. This practice did end with the Meiji Restoration in the late 1860's, when the position of Shogun was disregarded, and the Emperor was established as the supreme ruler (however the cabinet held a lot of the actual power).

This was also handy because in the rare event where someone was stupid enough to try and get rid of them, pretty much the entire country would defend them.",t3_1u5e44,1388626800,t1_ceeyc2b,Defengar,10,,anime

Instead I see it as an example of human nature.  Albeit one of the ugliest facets of human nature, it is something that transcends race.  The willingness to enslave others for personal gain.  Every race on the planet (it seems) has participated in the act of enslaving people of there own race, or of another.  It's almost to be expected in the barbaric days of ancient times, but completely inexcusable that it lasted as long as it did, and that some forms of slavery still exist to this day.

I just hope that people don't count up all of the enslaved peoples from history to suggest that there's some equality derived from how ""bad we all had it"".   rather, add up all the different cultures who decided it was okay, and realize the propensity for evil like this is a primitive human condition, not a white condition, or a black condition.

2. Depends on the level you want to reach, and depends on your abilities. I wouldn't count on a reasonable language command any shorter than one year, but only if you have 6-8 hours a day to learn each day, every day. Living here amongst the native speakers speeds it up a bit. (Students coming from (East) Germany learnt Hungarian during their first year well enough to finish the University - their first year was dedicated to the language command, and they've started the University on their second year.)

3. I personally just love to be with my wife. But for similar programs you don't have to come to Hungary I guess. A bit more seriously, it depends on the definition of ""fun"". Please clarify.

4. Well, Hungary is not that small you know, even if it's just slightly bigger than the half of Florida, so the question is, which part you're going to visit, and at what time. Budapest is definitely a worth to see; I personally suggest the Palace, Citadell, Parliament, Basilica, and several of the Museums - those are the most frequently visited places. Other cities (Sopron, Kőszeg, Székesfehérvár, Eger, Szeged, Debrecen, Pécs, Esztergom, Visegrad, Tihany, and several more - sorry for not mentioning them) also worth a visit. We have nice walkways among our mountains, Balaton or Lake Tisza (Tisza-tó) in summertime. Őrség, Hortobágy, Zala/Somogy, and several more - each has its own atmosphere. Again, it depends on your field of interest.

5. For me? It's simple:

""nekem szülőhazám itt e lángoktól ölelt
kis ország, messzeringó gyerekkorom világa.
Belőle nőttem én, mint fatörzsből gyönge ága
s remélem, testem is majd e földbe süpped el.
Itthon vagyok. S ha néha lábamhoz térdepel
egy-egy bokor, nevét is, virágát is tudom,
tudom, hogy merre mennek, kik mennek az uton,
s tudom, hogy mit jelenthet egy nyári alkonyon
a házfalakról csorgó, vöröslő fájdalom.""

(For me, it is my birthplace, this little nation embraced
by flames, the world of my childhood rocking in the distance.
I grew out of her like a tender branch from a tree
and I hope one day my body will sink into her.
I am at home. And if a shrub happens to kneel down
beside my foot, I know both its name and its flower;
I know who walks on the road and where they are going,
and what it might mean when in the summer sunset
the house-walls shimmer and drip with crimson-agony.)

&gt; The ""philosophy"" you talk about is simply being optimistic.

Well, not quite. I'm referring to being *unreasonably* optimistic. It seems reasonable to me to pursue owning a home since many, many people own homes. However, it is not reasonable to me to pursue becoming a billionaire since many people attempt this and most fail. 

&gt; We ""netted"" a large portion of the optimistic peoples from Europe and so have an inflated sense of optimism woven into our social culture.

That's an interesting idea, and I've heard this before, but I really wonder how much validity there is to it. Someone who stayed behind in the motherland, for instance, could be just as optimistic as someone who left, but stayed because they were optimistic about the fate of their country. 

&gt; Without this type of mentality existing in at least some of the population there would be virtually no innovation or art and we would still be hunter-gatherers.

The thing I mentioned above about reasonable vs. unreasonable optimism applies to this too. I think a certain amount of game theory applies here, too. Certainly, if literally everyone believed that they couldn't achieve or innovate anything, we would have no innovation. But if only the majority believes it, then just the best would innovate (because they would have the greatest reason to believe that they're on to something), and there would be a certain amount of innovation. But if EVERYONE attempts to innovate, then there is incredible competition, with even utterly unqualified people scratching their way through the ring, and we really only end up with the same amount of innovation, plus a lot of wasted energy that could have been dedicated to more sensible pursuits.

European countries generally have a 3+2+3 system of BA, MA, and PHD, occasionally you'll find 5+3 or 4+4 systems, but the 3+2+3 is the standard. BAs will generally be entirely economics focused, with no generalist requirements like you find in the US. For my program the first year and a half was entirely fixed course-wise, fourth semester we chose 3 out of 5 classes offered, and the fifth and sixth semester were completely open choice from a variety of couses offered at BA and MA level depending on your specialization. 

Whether a thesis is written in a BA differs from country to country, but in most countries you will have to write/defend a bachelors thesis to get your degree. In my case this was about 25-30 pages. The bachelors thesis and scientific writing course counted for about 2/3rds of my sixth semester points. 

Generally speaking though, there is a lot of degree inflation in the EU, and having a bachelors without a masters is mostly useless from an employment prospective (non-academically, that is), if you want to work in with economic research, a PHD is preferable/necessary. Maybe that's why there are more MA programs. 

My general impression is that at the lower levels of education, the european systems are usually more academic than the US one, but that at the higher level it very much evens out, with US research and PHD programs being attractive and desirable, and the US has some of the best economists out there.

Whether it was a neo-nazi, Tom Cruise or Gandhi, its quality as a statement is defined by its content. I don't like seeing blatant ad-hominem arguments upvoted.

However, you could interpret it in a number of ways. The obvious way, although it's a bit redundant, is of an openly-autocratic government. The North Korean people cannot criticise their government, illustrating its control over them. You can also use it in a non-political sense - if there is a person in your life whom you cannot criticise (your boss, your father, your wife), then that person has a significant amount of power over you. If, hypothetically, a corporation were legally protected from public criticism, one could say that they have a disproportionate amount of power over public affairs, and the quote would likewise apply. 

Maybe these aren't fantastic examples, but I don't find the idea that the quote is intrinsically anti-Semitic to be a persuasive one, even if that was the original intent. The statement ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal"" is from the US Declaration of Independence, and is a useful one today when talking about issues of race, sexuality, gender and so on. It originates from Thomas Hobbes, and we can be fairly sure he *wasn't* advocating for gay rights or black rights, but was instead talking about differences in ability: 

""Nature hath made men so equal in the faculties of body and mind as that, though there be found one man sometimes manifestly stronger in body or of quicker mind than another, yet when all is reckoned together the difference between man and man is not so considerable as that one man can thereupon claim to himself any benefit to which another may not pretend as well as he. For as to the strength of body, the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret machination or by confederacy with others that are in the same danger with himself.

And as to the faculties of the mind, setting aside the arts grounded upon words, and especially that skill of proceeding upon general and infallible rules, called science, which very few have and but in few things, as being not a native faculty born with us, nor attained, as prudence, while we look after somewhat else, I find yet a greater equality amongst men than that of strength. For prudence is but experience, which equal time equally bestows on all men in those things they equally apply themselves unto.""

Does this mean that the fact that Hobbes was most likely highly racist, sexist and *not* advocating for blanket equality among all groups (being a white European of the 1700s), and considering that many of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence were slave-owners themselves, mean that the idea of ""all men are created equal"" is of less merit?

Rust is much more like Minecraft than DayZ and the developers are going to eventually remove zombies altogether (maybe this has happened already, I haven't played in a few weeks).  One of the nice things about Rust is because you're gathering and crafting things you have much more control over how quickly your character progresses.  In DayZ there is much more chance involved.  You have to constantly scour buildings in the hope that you'll find some good loot, food, weapons, etc.  If you have bad luck you'll end up pretty frustrated.  There is also an annoying amount of running you'll have to be prepared to do if you get DayZ, especially if you're trying to meet up with friends.  It can literally take upwards of an hour or more to find your friends on a server and then you might get killed on sight by some irritating player or fall through a wall and die, lose all your stuff and have to do it all over again.  This is less of a nuisance in Rust and there are actually no PvP servers you can play on if you'd like.  DayZ can be a lot of fun, however, and it provides many opportunities for unique player interactions.  Just keep in mind that, most of the time, players will just be immediately shooting you in the face or running away from you because they're afraid.

""Not everybody,"" isn't descriptive enough. Either the majority wants to and it happens or the majority doesn't want to and yet it happens anyway. Those are the two situations in which the act of helping others takes place in a populist system (never mind all the reasons the US system doesn't exactly mirror that since they're unnecessary complications of the argument for now).

I have to suppose she thinks both a significant minority do want to help (namely, her fellow democrats) and that another significant minority do not. Literally speaking, this is easy to dispute. People of all political and apolitical stripes donate to charity and volunteer their time for charity. To the extent that people have significantly less to give than they otherwise would, absent heavy taxes, this appears to indicate the unfunded charity hypothesis is quite wrong.

&gt;How does a free society benefit the poor as much as an institution that forces a redistribution of wealth?

In much the same way growing more food benefits everyone on the farm more than simply dividing up the current amount of food more evenly (which itself has a cost in food to the distributors). Wealthier societies have a higher quality of life, even at the very low end. The growth of the quality of life in both the US, Europe, and now Asia, has never been egalitarian, but it has helped billions out of poverty. Conversely, almost every egalitarian scheme of the same time period put some millions to death by starvation.

Consider the internal principle upon which all this is based: Some people in society need help. The state helps them. How would we help them without the state? The first bit is clearly true. The second is not always true and often quite false.

Indeed, I know that USA-specific content, (especially retail deals and carrier content) has been an issue for many outside the US. While this suggestion sounds great in theory, this may not be as easy as it sounds in execution. Right now the tags pick up keywords in the title and automatically tag each post. In this post the system picked up the '?' and tagged it accordingly.   

AFAIK there's no *foolproof* way to automate this when it comes to topics that are region-specific where no indicator is expressed explicitly in the title. If you're thinking 'well why don't people include the region in the title so the system can tag it...' Well then you may have just found us a simpler/quicker solution, one that will still allow us keep the device tags we have come to appreciate (thanks to our CSS dev wizard /u/andrewinmelbourne), which I propose herein:  

Those posting about US-specific content can include a manual tag prefix in the post title i.e. ""[USA] blah blah Best Buy AT&amp;T High Five Yeehaw"" and then we won't need any more CSS to tag anything, since it'll already be there. This way we can keep the auto-tag on devices in addition to any region-specific manual tags, and it will have a higher accuracy rate than an automated method.   

We can start with the [US] prefix and those posting other region-specific content can indicate: [CANADA] [EU] [UK] [INDIA] etc.   

What say ye?  

EDIT: Thanks for your input guys, will chat with our CSS dev /u/andrewinmelbourne (he is on leave at the moment) regarding feasibility. For the time being I recommend we manually tag region-sensitive posts.

But it has gotten worse since Putin came in. Which is saying a lot, since the 90s were pretty horrendous.  I'm not talking about things like small payments to avoid a ticket or to get better medical treatment, I'm talking about what payments and deals are necessary to found a business, win a court case, get a government position, etc. That mind of thing, although difficult to fully quantify, is observable in a trend increasing since Putin took power, specifically since 2003. 

Yeltsin may have told Putin to protect Russia, but what he (and Berezvosky, although that guy liked to claim more credit than he probably deserved), really wanted him to protect Yeltsin (and ""the family""). Putin's first official act was to pardon Yeltsin for any acts of corruption for which he might be charged.  I do give him credit for then refusing to be the oligarch's puppet that Berezovsky et. al. expected him to be, but it doesn't excuse him or the people who brought him in of that first dirty deal. It also doesn't explain why he didn't then go after any of ""the family"" once he was stronger. Yelstin was pardoned, but the oligarchs weren't, and his relatives weren't. All of them are still fine and wealthy. The only exception to this are the few oligarchs who opposed Putin politically. [Run a critical media outlet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Gusinsky)?

Putin made that choice. He made it again a few years later, starting around 2003, when he changed his economic reform policies to ones favoring entrenching his power through, among other means, [corruption](http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=974)/ His so-called reforming officials were corrupt (Kasyanov was known as Misha 2% for his common take, a sadly low number compared to affairs these days), but they were also trying to do something some of the time and some progress was being made. Starting in 2003 Putin got rid of those guys and replaced them close friends, former Petersburg and intelligence colleagues and even judo partners. Renationalization fed corruption, sale of public offices became common, reports of courts corrupton or political court results increased significantly (the Khodokovsky case was an important signal to courts that this was possible), and [the number of billionaires doubled as the real income of Russians stagnated starting in 2005]( https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=17711FFC-0524-76AB-CEB0FE206E46C125).

That new level of corruption was a result of decisions made by Putin and his people, not the result of preexisting corruption that Putin et. al. are incapable of stopping despite their best efforts. 

Even the high profile cases are protected where some leader might see it too embarrassing to appear to support them.In  Russia the Magnitsky case was an international embarrassment , in response to which Putin chose to double down, defend the murderous robbers of the Russian government, use the case as a pretense to go after local civil society and score a few petty points at the expense of Russian orphans.  In a lesser known case, in 2008 Mercedes fully admitted in US courts that they paid millions in bribes to Russian officials and even paid a 185 million USD fine.  but even sworn depositions by Mercedes officials detailing their guilt were not enough to get an investigation going until 2010, when Navalny made it a pet project. No one faced real consequences however. Compare this to Turkey, where there is also official corruption.  [A current scandal involves ministers’ families]( http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/25/22043502-turkey-corruption-crisis-deepens-as-three-cabinet-ministers-resign?lite). The leadership probably knew about it, but didn’t care to act. Not impressive. However, at least when the issue became public the government had to appear to care and force the ministers out.  No one is banning Iranians from adopting children (an Iranian billionaire, himself just arrested for corruption in Iran, is involved) or using the case as excuse to crack down on Turkey’s many protesters. 

I wouldn’t have downvoted you on the modernization issue. I agree that it is pretty obvious that help would be good (that’s what Skolkovo is for but it won’t do it on its own). Some national pride issues might be why people oppose that. That, and the fact that a lot of ""modernizing foreign experts"" who came in in the 90s either failed at their jobs or directly profited from Russia's problems. This bred some understandable misgivings about outside expertise.

I wouldn’t have downvoted the protectionism issue either, but I do understand why some people didn’t like the idea (that’s what comments are for, not downvotes, but I digress). Protectionism protects Russia’s inefficient economy. It is inefficient in no small part because of the political-business octopus that controls much of the economy. The idea behind reducing protectionism is that it forces local businesses to evolve to compete while opening them up to new opportunities and investors abroad. Russia’s businesses wouldn’t be good at that though, especially the big ones. They don’t succeed based on who is the best company, they succeed based on who has the best connections.  Such firms would lose badly to foreign competitors (and when the new trade regulations reduced their abilities to game the system) and outsiders would not want to invest in them when there were more successful foreign competitors as alternatives. The wealthy and powerful oppose reducing protectionism for this reason (which, I’m guessing, is an important reason why Russia is so protectionist). Regular Russians have good reason to fear it too – their uncompetitive employers are the ones that would lose out, and they are the ones that would lose their jobs.   Back to my original topic, this situation would be at least partially true no matter who succeeded Yeltsin, but Putin actively built a system that reinforced and grew these issues. For that, I blame him.

As for what to do, it is easy to criticize. Knowing how to fix it is harder, and I don’t claim to know that beyond vague statements like “political pluralism, better regulations and more rule of law!” When one of the problems with the system Putin built is that it is very good at keeping out or coopting potential rivals, in my position I don’t a see a means of changing it. Which is very sad. Because Russia is great despite the leaders and could be even greater with good ones.

They've manipulated things in Europe and in other nations so that you will be arrested if you publicly question any aspect of the official narrative.

You need to give me an example in which there was positive anarchy *in the real world* i.e in a real physical place where people live and directly interact with each other.  

And interstate conflict is bad, certainly. But you're also ignoring the billions of people who are able to live peacefully in relatively stable authoritative political societies without fear of violence. Furthermore, what you're saying about destructive wars also proves my point in a way...the diffusion of power amongst a multitude of states on the European continent is largely responsible for the destructive wars that have been waged there over the past centuries. If there had been one or two convincing hegemonic states, it's likely that WWI and II wouldn't have happened at all. Consider how much more peaceful the second half of the 20th century was, after power was predominantly concentrated in the hands of the US and USSR. There wasn't a single case of a great-power war for that entire period. There has been an even greater reduction in the scope and frequency of inter-state conflict following the dissolution of the USSR and ensuing 20 year period of total American hegemony.
