I've not accused Russia of anything. In fact, I said specifically we don't know if Russia provided the BUK and crew. 

&gt;there is no hard evidence that Russia gave arms to the separatists

Reuters reported on [compelling evidence that shows exactly that](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/29/us-ukraine-crisis-arms-specialreport-idUSKBN0FY0UA20140729) today. 

&gt;your assumption that the separatists even had Buks is flawed.

As pointed out earlier, the Rebels themselves admitted having operational Buks in response to the July 14th shoot downs bragging they [ 'downed plane from SAM ""9K37M1"" (better known as the ""Book"")'](http://www.vz.ru/news/2014/7/17/696045.html). 

How about the [DNR's own tweet](http://blog.storyful.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/07/Screen-shot-2014-07-19-at-12.56.15-PM.png)?

Multiple images of the Rebel Buk geolocated to Torez   
([Image one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bs2XzV6CIAA3MxQ.jpg:large) is [geolocated here] (https://www.google.com/maps/place/48%C2%B001'28.9%22N+38%C2%B036'56.1%22E/@48.0244266,38.6163938,307m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en),

On July 17th [the AP reported Rebels moving a Buk through Snizhne](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/ukraine-buk-missiles-ap-journalists_n_5622111.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular) in the hours before MH17 was downed.

&gt;If you cant prove Buks you have no proof

So given we **can** prove Buks from multiple independent sources?

&gt;for the Snezhne launch there is zero evidence

You're almost right, if by zero you mean 'a lot more than zero'.

All the evidence listed above shows Rebel Buk in and around Snizhne.

There's this [Torez local](https://twitter.com/WowihaY/status/490181213890830336/photo/1) who used eyewitnesses who saw the launch to locate the actual launch site.

Then this guy [who geolocated the picture released by SBU](http://ukraineatwar.blogspot.com/2014/07/launch-location-detected-of-missile.html)

And the journalist who visited the site and [found burn marks consistent with a Buk launch site](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10984530/MH17-the-clues-which-may-lead-to-missile-launch-site.html) according to Russian Military expert Igor Sutyagin.

&gt;it is pure speculation by the Americans

US State departments or government agencies provided zero of the above pieces of evidence.

&gt;another post here on Reddit tell that soldiers on the ground are drinking beer from bottles

But that's from an unverified speculative claim that the reason US hasn't released [satellite pictures because they show drunk Ukrainians operating the Snizhne launch Buk](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=us+satellite+ukrainian+uniforms+drunk).

Home &gt; Genocide Research &gt; Statements on Record Relating to the Armenian Genocide

""Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?""
[August 22, 1939]

My decision to attack Poland was arrived at last spring. Originally, I feared that the political constellation would compel me to strike simultaneously at England, Russia, France, and Poland. Even this risk would have had to be taken.

Ever since the autumn of 1938, and because I realized that Japan would not join us unconditionally and that Mussolini is threatened by that nit-wit of a king and the treasonable scoundrel of a crown prince, I decided to go with Stalin.

In the last analysis, there are only three great statesmen in the world, Stalin, I, and Mussolini. Mussolini is the weakest, for he has been unable to break the power of either the crown or the church. Stalin and I are the only ones who envisage the future and nothing but the future. Accordingly, I shall in a few weeks stretch out my hand to Stalin at the common German-Russian frontier and undertake the redistribution of the world with him.

Our strength consists in our speed and in our brutality. Genghis Khan led millions of women and children to slaughter — with premeditation and a happy heart. History sees in him solely the founder of a state. It's a matter of indifference to me what a weak western European civilization will say about me.

I have issued the command — and I'll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad — that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness — for the present only in the East — with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space (Lebensraum) which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?

False,0,cjdjcfx,sorceryofthespectacle,1406853365,,"First a story.

I went to high school not too long ago in a blue part of a blue state. A conversation with a teacher over a question that appeared on a test has stuck in my mind.
It was a true or false question:

&gt; Most crime is committed between members of opposite races.

Of course, this question &amp; its expected answer were ultimately motivated by a desire to head racism off at the pass. But the question itself!

The conversation went something like this

-- What does this question mean by opposite race?

-- Well, you know, like white is the opposite of black...

-- I'm afraid I don't really know. What's the opposite of Asian?

-- Caucasian, I guess.

lol and the opposite of Native American is Invasive European amirite?

(One stupid high school teacher, admittedly.)

But it's a conceptual problem that beats close to the heart of what's wrong with our thinking--there is a center, and a periphery. This is the model of all in-group/out-group, or identitarian, movements, and its also a model of how all such movements fail. The postmodern turn is the realization that the center does not define the periphery--this both scares the fuck out of the haters, and gives them hope that even when the chips fall at last and they see that they have lost their empires they can continue acting as if they haven't because, ""Fuck you I do what I want"", and ""As you were saying, isn't truth relative?"".

Not so much an ideology as a logic of hate--very much as you suggest. The dialectic between center and periphery destroyed the cultures we now grant 'whiteness' as much or more than it did other cultures. You can see that by looking at who has actually produced meaningful American culture, and who has become a telescreen for commodified rage. Hint: the best parts of our culture come almost definitionally from the people who struggle to love America, rather than from the people for whom hating the vast majority of it comes naturally.

&gt; constant rhetorical sacrifices to moloch.


It is evident by the knowledge
acquired for us at such bitter cost
by our gnostic collaborators &amp; precursors
that gnon is something like a demiurge
forcing the collapse of a wave function of the worlds
into a grim &amp; lifeless purgatory of obedient matter.

We must remember that those who have written of Elua have not been the true partisans of his faction.

We would do better to speak of it in other ways--as archetypal shaman--who eats poisons and does not die--psychopomp, who knows how to walk on cursed ground without being captured--who sees a world in a grain of sand instead of fear in a handful of dust--who hides the stories of the other gods as trema in the infinite libraries of Mind. Acquirer of forbidden knowledge--Faust, Prometheus, machine bodhisattva--generates more enlightenment-mind per kilowatt/hour than a prayer wheel!--Hanuman, Hermes, Anansi, Coyote--breaker of every Law &amp; transgressor of every locked gate--the one whose winged feet stand not on the ceremony (and who is therefore opposite the vampire in this regard)--the cosmic giggle--the last question, asked at a point of total exhaustion, on the way out the door, that discloses the secret name of evil and thus makes possible its negation--and do not fear but good must triumph precisely because it is not a thing that can be named--good defeats evil as an afterthought, just in case good has something to learn from the struggle; for evil by definition cannot learn--why do they keep raising up what has already been put down--Moloch! Nazis! Vengeful sky gods! Tyrant kings and child-sacrifice! Slavery and austerity and dominion!

There's something, too, about Umberto Eco's thought that a sign is anything that can be used to tell a lie. Isn't this exactly trickster's gift? The archonic signals cannot propagate themselves without also propagating the trickster--and the trickster's very presence introduces a fundamental ambivalence into the stern intonations of the rites of gnon. Suddenly they mean their opposites--the difference between the playful and the grave vanishes and we can't be sure whose allies are under which masks. But the secret is that the rites meant nothing before the trickster gained the power to sneak into the temple in disguise to make a mockery of them.

&gt; social cohesive secret handshake as if it is an end run around logic but at this point it has usurped and become logic.

If knowledge is power... and the dominant logic is will to power... then truth becomes a battleground. Winning becomes a pragmatic criterion--and truth itself is destroyed.",t1_cjdjcfx,t5_2zojk,Philosopher of Magic,1,1,0,1435007844,1406854519,0,,True,,t3_2c6p89,t1_cjdajea,aftermeasure

&gt;Bullock wrote that, ""once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian Churches"".  Phayer wrote that ""By the latter part of the decade of the Thirties church officials were well aware that the ultimate aim of Hitler and other Nazis was the total elimination of Catholicism and of the Christian religion. Since the overwhelming majority of Germans were either Catholic or Protestant this goal had to be a long-term rather than a short-term Nazi objective.""  According to Shirer, ""under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler—backed by Hitler—the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists"".  Gill wrote that the Nazi plan was to ""de-Christianise Germany after the final victory"".  Dill states, “It seems no exaggeration to insist that the greatest challenge the Nazis had to face was their effort to eradicate Christianity in Germany or at least to subjugate it to their general world outlook.”   According to Bendersky, it was Hitler’s long range goal to eliminate the churches once he had consolidated control over his European empire""

I've also tweaked some of the rivers to be smoother in shape and less like a marsh (remember the scale? :P). 

I'm thinking that the height map may take another 1.5 weeks at this rate. But it's all okay! I'm not going to rush this, and I really like the leisurely pace I'm working on it at. Putting maybe ~5 hours a day into this project :)

No, not in the age of sail.

&gt;You keep saying the argentinian settlement was illegal and I still dont understand why you say so.

It's quite simple.

The British claimed the Islands. So did Argentina. This means there is a territorial dispute.

Now in that age gunboat diplomacy was acceptable and common, The British asserted their claim and that was that.

Now in the modern age this is not acceptable. The UK originally was okay with giving the Falklands to Argentina, they are not very useful to us. Only there is a population on the Falklands, and our modern Morales say that the people who live there get to decide what happens to them. So that meant we had to get their permission to sceede them to Argentina. 

Argentina invaded the invasion was very popular in Argentina at the time. Thus, no more playing nice, no trying to meet Argentina halfway. They forced a decision and unfortunately for them, it didn't go there way.

---

&gt;

&gt;__Nazi Germany__ and the __Third Reich__ are common names for [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) during the period from 1933 to 1945, when its government was controlled by [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) and his National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), commonly known as the [Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a [fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism) [totalitarian state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism) which [controlled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung) nearly all aspects of life. Nazi Germany ceased to exist after the [Allied Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) defeated Germany in May 1945, ending [World War II in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_theatre_of_World_War_II).

&gt;After Hitler was appointed [Chancellor of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany) by the President of the [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic) [Paul von Hindenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg) on 30 January 1933, the Nazi Party began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate their power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934, and Hitler became dictator of Germany when the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency were merged. A national [referendum held 19 August 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_referendum,_1934) confirmed Hitler as sole [Führer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChrer) (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's hands, and his word was above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but rather a collection of factions struggling to amass power and gain Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression), the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy). Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of *[Autobahns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn)* (high speed highways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.

&gt;Racism, especially [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism), was a central feature of the regime. The [Germanic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples)—also referred to as the [Nordic race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_race)—were considered to be the purest representation of [Aryanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_race), and therefore the [master race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_race). [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) and others deemed undesirable were persecuted or murdered, and [opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Resistance_to_Nazism) to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist, and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned, or forced into exile. The Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [racial biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism), population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [were curtailed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Nazi_Germany). Recreation and tourism were organised via the [Strength Through Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_Through_Joy) program, and the [1936 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics) showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. [Propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_propaganda) minister [Joseph Goebbels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels) made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotising oratory to control public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and discouraging or banning others.

&gt;Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met. [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_State_of_Austria) and [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Czechoslovak_Republic) were seized in 1938 and 1939. Hitler [made a pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact) with [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin) and [invaded Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland) in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers), Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. *[Reichskommissariats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskommissariat)* took brutal control of conquered areas, and a [German administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Government) was established in what was left of Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned and murdered in [Nazi concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps) and [extermination camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp). The implementation of the regime's racial policies culminated in the mass murder of Jews and other minorities in [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust). Following the [German invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa) of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) in 1941, the tide turned against the Third Reich, and major military defeats were suffered in 1943. Large-scale bombing of German cities, rail lines, and oil plants escalated in 1944. Germany was overrun in 1945 by the Soviets from the east and the [other Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) from the west. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and unnecessary loss of life in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [denazification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification) and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [Nuremberg trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials).

&gt;Does anyone whose religious ancestors ""lived there for centuries"" qualify?

No. Not a single one. The arguement is irrational and immoral. Religous fundamentalism is bad, and these are atrocities.

edit: I think the only tenable solution is a single secular state, probably under U.N. supervision for while. In some sense this mess goes beyond Israel and Palestine, because neighbors like the Syrians (the tribe, not so much the country) consider the region theirs as well, and because the religions involved mean a two state soltuion doesn't dissuade violence, nor does it right any wrongs. Physically, there's enough space for everyone to live there - obviously they live there right now - so I would say the best solutions would be to make a special tribunal like the U.N. has done before, issue reparations for damages done where possible, and enforce universal rights and a separation of church and state.

&gt;

&gt;The __Falkirk Wheel__ is a rotating [boat lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_lift) in Scotland, connecting the [Forth and Clyde Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_and_Clyde_Canal) with the [Union Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Canal_(Scotland\)). Named after the nearby town of [Falkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkirk) in central Scotland, the lift opened in 2002, reconnecting the two canals for the first time since the 1930s as part of the [Millennium Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Link) project.

&gt;The plan to regenerate [central Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Belt)'s canals and reconnect [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow) with [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh) was led by [British Waterways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Waterways) with support and funding from seven local authorities, the [Scottish Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Enterprise) Network, the [European Regional Development Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Regional_Development_Fund), and the [Millennium Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Commission). Planners decided early on to create a dramatic 21st-century landmark structure to reconnect the canals, instead of simply recreating the historic [lock flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_flight).

&gt;The wheel raises boats by 24 metres (79 ft), but the Union Canal is still 11 metres (36 ft) higher than the aqueduct which meets the wheel, and boats must pass through a pair of [locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(water_transport\)) to get between the top of the wheel and the Union Canal. The Falkirk Wheel is the only rotating boat lift of its kind in the world, and one of two boat lifts in the United Kingdom, the other being the [Anderton boat lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderton_boat_lift).

To be honest, I've had much more success going after North America.  
The last couple games I played I didn't even bother with Australia at all.  
Australia only has 1 entry point (unless you're playing with the updated connections, in which case the newest version has it with 3 entry points) but that also means you can't do anything *with* it.  In contrast, North America is only 2 more squares than Australia to take.

Recently a customer asked me about it and I realized I have one to try. So tonight while I was working I decided to go outside and give it a go. Well.... I made it half way and decided to ditch it and go to my true nicaraguan love the Padron 1926 #35. This cigar is my go to when it comes to Nicaraguan cigars. I have so many memories with this little smoke (traveling Europe, backpacking, first box purchase etc!). It's like a little candy treat and in my opinion not really like any of the other 1926 sizes. One year after finals in college I had a #6 sitting on top of the roof looking out enjoying with a fine IPA. I still remember how the smoke swirled and the magic aroma over took my senses! The #35 is like a reliving that experience condensed down to 20 beautiful minutes. ",t1_cjdl36w,t5_2r090,[SmallBatch Land],2,2,0,1435008799,False,0,T2,True,,t3_2canzu,t3_2canzu,Mrsmallbatch

False,0,cjdl5rr,europe,1406857583,,"I understand the general sentiment in Germany is ""we had our economic problems in the past, did the necessary structural reforms and that's why our economy is strong now"" but maybe you should examine this narrative a bit more critically. 

Is Germany's current success (if it can be called that; I mean, things aren't exactly rosy for a lot of Germans) really the result of these reforms or the result of providing the credit and the exports that fuelled the boom in the less competitive Eurozone countries? 

If that narrative made sense, then why is [Germany's economy now slowly but steadily again faltering](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/10/uk-europe-economy-idUKKBN0FF1CG20140710)? Why was the reward of its supposed virtue almost as short-lived as boom the profligate countries of the Eurozone enjoyed?

Consider, for example, how in the past, before the euro, Germany's exports had to out-compete the effects of currency devaluation but now they don't. Consider how the euro gave a lot of credit to the weak peripheral economies and they spent that importing stuff from Germany.

You may not think ""not always dead last"" is good, so how about ""ahead of soaz and mimer?"" Is that good? Because he's ahead of them quite a few times already after only joining his team a month ago. Do you need me to say it for the 3rd time?

&gt; Now looking at his week average vs their season average, he beats them both in GPM and beats soaz in KDA.

I'm not looking at kubon's season, because you didn't talk about his season, you talked about his week compared to the seasons of soaz and mimer. And I have laid that out for you. I'd rather not do it all over again for the 3rd time, so here's how to find it. Go to my comment with all the big bold writing, read the big bold writing, read the writing after the big bold writing. Problem solved. I'd rather not read all the math you supposedly did, because there's a much more reliable source for all of those stats, and some random guy on the internet desperately trying to tweak some numbers in his favor probably isn't going to be very trustworthy. 

Honestly, if your desire for kubon to be a bad player is so strong that you're just refusing to read stats and repeatedly trying to revise what your ""argument"" was, I don't think there's much else I can do to show you that kubon is very much at the level of other tops.

Throughout history, societies have lost territory and been enslaved through conquest.  Are you suggesting peoples of European ancestry should sue the present Mongolian government for their violent actions from 700 years ago?

&gt; Suppose we accept that the Government of Canada - with our body of laws, our customs, and in effect history - has been a continuous agent throughout its existence and is the same body today as it was when these **crimes** were committed. 

What crimes?

&gt; It's facetious to claim a kind of moral discontinuity when this is not only not ancient history but still exists today as a living memory.

Why haven't the American, British, or any other current government for that matter, ever apologized for slavery?  Why have they never compensated the descendants of slaves?

Only people who are somehow implicated in an injustice can apologize for it.  This is what I mean by *moral individualism*. 

Michael J. Sandel, Harvard professor of political philosophy, describes moral individualism in his book *Justice, What's the Right Thing to do?*;

""It assumes that we are, as moral agents, free and independent selves, unbound by prior moral ties, capable of choosing our ends for ourselves. Not custom or tradition or inherited status, but the free choice of each individual is the source of the only moral obligations that constrain us.""

League, like most esports will favor a younger player every year. I remarked about this yesterday in the LCS live thread:

&gt;Though watching this SKP vs NIP game, Gambit's performance over the last few weeks and reading Dyrus's Riot Q&amp;A got me thinking: This is the last season for a lot of pros.

&gt;I suspect that between now and the end of season 5, a lot of famous pros are going to be announcing retirements. And not ""lol I was jk"", but full on retirements or arrangements like what Hotshot and Reginald currently do.

&gt;If you believe in the theory that a pro gamer's peak is only at the 19-24 range, a lot of our current pros in NA and EU are well over that age and must be making arrangements for alternative incomes.

&gt;Or in other words, it's about that time in life you realize you have to settle down and can't expect to be a pro video gamer forever.

A lot of these guys are approaching their mid/late 20's. Like I pointed out, Dyrus's Q&amp;A revealed he has a year left or so, according to his own words (anything can change between now and then).

The 19-24 theory is something I read in an article linked here about Counter-Strike gamers being considered in their prime at 19 due to height of reflexes, awareness and maturity (debatable as fuck that one).

False,0,cjdlt6b,urbanplanning,1406859091,,"Having been to several European cities, I would absolutely love to live in a place like this in the US. As an engineer I love the increase in efficiency of denser development and mass transit that would be encouraged by building like this. But when I read this author's posts there are a few issues that stand out:

Emergency vehicles: you could put fire hydrants all over the place but you still need to get the firefighters and all their equipment and hoses rapidly to the scene. Ambulances--you're going to make the medics park on the avenue and then run a few blocks with a stretcher to the residence and then carry the person back out. Police--it'd be good to get them back on foot patrols, but then they'll have to run through the city to where they are needed.

Jobs: I don't think it's realistic that everyone could just live in a 2nd or 3rd floor apartment and then all be employed at shops within walking distance. People will have to walk through their neighborhoods to a main street to catch a bus/tram/subway to take to their destination assuming it's able to get them within walking distance of it. I live in Illinois--have you seen the size of a snow plow truck? Who is going to clear the snow in narrow streets and where are you going to put it? I like biking but it's less practical in the winter.

Every time someone needs to move (which will probably happen a lot because you have to walk to work) a truck is going to have to fit in there or you'll have to carry all of your stuff a few blocks to the truck. The US is a highly mobile country and the population is still growing and shifting around whereas Europe and Japan aren't as much. Also you'll have all these shops and restaurants. If they're doing good business they'll need lots of deliveries all the time. How are those trucks going to make it through there all the time?

Also, the author stresses the point about 'people spending big bucks to take vacations to cities built like this' however every town and city can't each be a tourist town. It's like how Atlantic City and Las Vegas boomed when they were the only gambling towns. Other states allowed and expanded gambling and now Atlantic City's economy especially is crashing because it isn't special anymore. 

On top of all of this, you can still do the right things to discourage cars and encourage density and walking and end up with an incredibly ugly place with [tiny housing like this](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.430545,-2.949374,3a,75y,74.07h,87.53t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1shwdFQvFHrX3IcD01ZvnHbw!2e0) instead of a cutesy mini-Paris or Venice.

To encourage walkability and Euro-style development I think it would be a lot more direct to focus on zoning that encourages these types and shapes of buildings and street level shops and residential above and green space at the center of blocks and street grids that connect (not suburban collection and branching patterns) rather than building only narrow streets and hoping the rest flows from there. Most of the streets in London and Paris and German cities (actual, functioning, real places (not surviving on tourism or having been built 500 years ago like Italy)) still have at least one lane of traffic and some parking. 

Europeans have and live in these examples of old cities all over the place and the buildings and places they've built in the last century are different. Even they don't duplicate them. Knowing everything we know, 50 years ago the British still chose to build Milton Keynes from scratch more like an American suburb than an old European city. Manhattan is as close as we have in the US of a non-car city on a large scale. People live there and people work there and it's dense. The streets are wide in Manhattan and have parking. Lots of people want to be in Manhattan and the city is on an island surrounded by wide rivers that have only a few crossings so they're forced to expand vertically. Chicago on the other hand is surrounded by hundreds of miles of flat land in three directions and Los Angeles is in big valleys so they spread horizontally like crazy. I guarantee you 100% narrow pedestrian streets in a place like Chicago or LA would never happen.

The second half of the Middle Ages in Italy was marked by frequent conflict between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy, the latter eventually emerging victorious in that it ultimately prevented political unification of northern Italy under Imperial rule. Imperial invasions were led by more or less all medieval Emperors, the most notable episodes being the end of the Investiture controversy by the pilgrimage of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor at Canossa in 1077 and the no less than five major invasions staged by Frederick Barbarossa against the Lombard League, **culminating in the sack of Milan in 1162, after which every building in the city was demolished, except the churches.**

The HST is a collaboration between [NASA](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/NASA) and the [European Space Agency](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/European_Space_Agency). [The Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Space_Telescope_Science_Institute) (STScI) is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and delivery of data products to astronomers. [\[1\]](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_owns_the_Hubble_Space_Telescope)

&gt; Is there a system in place to allow universities or other space agencies to use it?

 Anyone can apply for time on the telescope; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation. Competition for time on the telescope is intense, with about one-fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule. [\[1\]](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hubble_Space_Telescope#/Public_use)

&gt; What's the process like to go from ""we want to look at X"" to ""here are your pictures"".

After a proposal is approved, it can take as long as a year. Demand is high, so usage of the HST must be carefully scheduled to ensure that it is effective and efficient. [\[1\]](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Space_Telescope_Science_Institute#/Observation_scheduling) Sometimes exceptions are made for rare phenomenon; up to 10% of the telescope time is designated ""director's discretionary"" (DD) time. [\[2\]](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hubble_Space_Telescope#/Public_use)

False,0,cjdmqfs,Grenoble,1406861212,,"Hey, 

You're in luck. I just got back from my exchange to Grenoble (and more specifically Stendhal university).

I did not stay at Berlioz but I have a lot of friends who did. 

OK where to start?

Stendhal:

Depending on what university/country you come from you will have different requirements on how many ECTS you will have to take. I had to do at least 30 and I ended up doing 32 (because the numbers didn't work out evenly).

**Exchange student classes I took:**

* Histoire de Grenoble

This is a very popular course. It is taught by Mr Guichard (who is an absolutely lovely man, he is very passionate about grenoble and a very kind teacher). Every second week you go to a museum and the weeks in between people give group presentations. It is impossible to fail one of Mr Guichard's classes.

* Grammaire francais

Again this is taught by Mr Guichard, however I would give this class a miss. Despite being a lovely man he can drone on somewhat and he doesn't actually teach you any usable french grammar. Instead he talks about the origins of french grammar and how french has changed over time. For the most part it wasn't very interesting and everyone was a bit confused. However you are guaranteed to pass.

* Traduction francais/anglais

This was my favourite course out of all the courses I did. I absolutely loved it. Definitely the course where you will learn the most in/or at least find the most interesting. The prof who runs the french -&gt; english TD talks a lot about informal vocab/slang which is great for speaking fluency. The english -&gt; french part of the course is a bit harder. But over all I found this course very rewarding and not too hard.

**French student classes recommended to exchange students:**

* Cinema

This is a very popular course. I didn't love my prof and one day I turned up to class to find out it was actually an exam and he hadn't told anyone.

* Histoire litteraire du XVIIe siecle et civilisation classique

This was actually very interesting. If your french is at a good level I'd say go for it. This course is a bit harder though.

* Communication et sciences sociale

This was a really really really weird course. Nobody understood what the hell we were really studying. It seemed that we were studying 'rumours' or something of the sort? Very very bizarre. The assessment was one assignment at the end which I worked hard on and did well on but I know people who failed.

* Socio-economie de l'audiovisuel

This was absolutely the worst course ever. Mind numbingly boring. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT touch it with a 10 foot pole.

**Courses for general french students not recommended for exchange students**

* Histoire du cinema

I actually really really enjoyed this course. The lecturer was easy to understand, we went through some interesting things. Most everything was on wiki if I didn't understand. 

The problem with doing one of these courses is that you get less ECTS than you would doing a course recommended for exchange students.



**Stendhal Admin**

Oh. My. God. Arriving in Grenoble was a nightmare. They are not helpful whatsoever.

In order to sign up for courses you have to physically knock on people''s doors etc. And nowhere is there a concise timetable of what time each course is on.

Be prepared for disaster.

Also the women who work in the office aren't very helpful. The spanish woman is helpful but quite timid, and also not in charge.

The university itself is not very good to be honest. You can do courses at other universities if you wish (such as science po) but these may be harder to pass.

**Berlioz**

OK, so I personally had a lot of issues with CROUS. I was originally promised residence at a place called 'terralis' but when I arrived I was given a room in 'Ouest'. Ouest is very similar to Berlioz. You get a small room to yourself and a small bathroom. NB most bathrooms come without toilet seats or shower curtains. You'll need to buy these.

Hopefully you get a room with a mini fridge. If you don't go buy one ASAP (for about 40 - 50 euros). 

It can be hard to be social in Berlioz as there isn't really a communal area. The communal kitchen is only hot plates. Nothing else. Not even a bin. And it's about a 50/50 chance of the hot plates working.

I know a lot of people who actually really liked living in Berlioz. It is very close to university - you can walk. also the B and C tram lines run close to it as well. 

If you're into biking I highly recommend getting a metrovelo bike (you rent it monthly). It's cheap and useful for when the trams stop at 1am.

There are HEAPS of parties in Berlioz/Ouest (which are very close to each other). You just need to get into that crowd. This is best done by going to a lot of Integre activities early on (Integre is the exchange student social group). 

The problem with these parties is that they are almost always broken up by security before midnight. 

Berlioz is within walkin distance to CASINO geant. This is where you'll do pretty much all of your shopping. It's a large supermarket with reasonable prices.

**Grenoble itself**

I would recommend getting a french bank account ASAP and then using that account you can get a FREE mobile phone plan (20 euros gives you unlimited everything). 

There are HEAPS of outdoor activities to do. You can even join an outdoor club which does lots of hikes and mountain biking.

I learnt how to ski with ecole de glisse. If you want to ski/snowboard or if you want to learn definitely sign up with them. You get great discounts and free lessons. The majority of European ERASMUS people came to Grenoble because of it's proximity to all the great ski slopes. Ski trips were good fun.

False expectations.  I am always bemused by those in the Anglophone blogosphere who bitch about how they are never ""accepted as belonging here"" after being in Japan X number of years.  As if Japanese are going to look at folks who are (predominantly, within this particular group) white European males and think ""Oh, he must live here"" when the odds of that being true are almost vanishingly small.

Look, [here's some tourism numbers for 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Japan#Statistics), and [here's the number of actual residents](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA#.E6.97.A5.E6.9C.AC.E3.81.AB.E3.81.8A.E3.81.91.E3.82.8B.E5.9B.BD.E7.B1.8D.E5.88.A5.E5.A4.96.E5.9B.BD.E4.BA.BA.E7.99.BB.E9.8C.B2.E8.80.85.E6.95.B0).  America, Australia and Great Britain, the three Anglophone countries listed in the tourist stats, had 1,235,647 people (combined) come to Japan as tourists last year.  In 2013 residents in Japan from those same three countries, combined, totaled just 73,873.

Now, barring New Zealand, Ireland and Canada seriously skewing the statistics (which would be impossible anyway as combined they only had 13,000 Japan residents, less than Great Britain alone), the odds of that English-speaking foreigner on the street being a ""resident of Japan"", and not a ""tourist"", are 5.6% or 1 in 18 persons.

By way of contrast, there were [368,000 Japanese tourists to the UK last year](http://marketing-to-japan.com/japanese-tourism-in-the-uk.html) against [88,000 Japanese nationals and ethnic Japanese living in Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_community_in_the_United_Kingdom), meaning 1 in 5 ""Japanese"" in Britain is actually a resident.  

And from personal experience I would have to say the Japanese residents of Britain, on average, do significantly better speaking and carrying on with their lives in English than Anglophones in Japan do with Japanese.

&gt;wonder how china and korea fare.

Have only ever been to Korea as a tourist, but I don't recall any Koreans coming up to me saying ""Hey bro, where you living in Pusan?""  I *have* lived in China, though, and the experience leads me to chuckle at folks in Japan complaining about how the Japanese keep ""reminding them that they are foreigners"".  Those kind of folks really should try China, they would probably be running home screaming within a week.

I'm sure however that the reasoning is that making it easy for the customer means getting that 2% cut on all those purchases outweighs the cost of all the fraud that does happen.

However the EMV cards - help me understand. The current (USA) system is a magnetic strip with some numbers on it and the hope that the clerk will glance at the card to see if it looks real... the EMV system is encrypting that data so you can't just clone it... the swiper machine proves that the bank issued card is actually in the store rather than an easy to clone magnetic one. Does that pretty much cover it? 

That sounds kind of like DVDs - nobody could rip a DVD at first... you needed a licensed device to decrypt... until there was a slip up that let the cat out of the bag and then anyone could (""illegally"") copy them. EMVs have been in Europe for awhile - are they not hackable? Because if one person CAN hack it... doesn't that ruin the entire system of shifting *ANY* responsibility onto any one else since the big banks made an insecure system that was cheap and more profitable just like the magnetic in principle but much improved?

But that doesn't cover online transactions at all though yes?

The separatists are not just random people that banded together, they are soldiers of the former Ukrainian military. Soldiers from the east of the Ukraine, most of them anyway. They have access to all the same weaponry as the rest of the Ukraine.

As for ""lying about Krim"", no one in the west seems to get that Putin's statement ""there are no Russian soldiers in Krim, they're just locally assembled militia"" was said with a smirk on his face because he was making an obvious (although seemingly not to the west) joke. The joke was about the US calling the violent, armed rioters ""peaceful protesters"". In the same vein, Putin was humorously referring to the military in Crimea as ""locally assembled militia"".

&gt;They have an interest in keeping the ukraine instable to weaken the west and show the remaining ex-sowjet states which arent yet in the eu what happens if they want their freedom.

False,0,cjdnxxy,circlebroke,1406864079,,"Its not that he just killed lots of people, A LOT of nations and peoples did that.

He brought a level of human caused death and destruction not seen before OR SINCE. During his reign its estimated the Mongols killed TEN PERCENT OF WORLD POPULATION.

At the time, world population was roughly 400,000,000. Meaning the Mongols under Khan slaughtered 40,000,000 people. There were literally entire nations put to the sword by him. The population of Iran didn't recover to pre Mongol invasion levels until the 1950's.

To put that 10% into perspective, WW1 and the Spanish Flu that occurred at the same time put together killed 2% of world population. WW2 and the holocaust combined killed only 3.6%.

The amount of sheer brutality and violence the Mongols brought to Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East is absolutely unparalleled. Khan used genocide not as a last resort, but a main weapon to scare other nations and tribes into surrendering to him without putting up a fight.

That isn't what makes him badass. He is a monster because of it. Literally the closest thing to blood god to ever walk the Earth.


You know what makes him badass? The fact he was kicked out of his clan at age 9 with nothing but the clothes on his back and his mother and brothers for company, and 5 years later he was already a self made leader of men.

He had a level of charisma and and aura of confidence and power that drew people to him like moths to flame even when he was barely a teenager. 

He did what no other Mongol leader had ever done in the entire history of the people. He united the steppe under one banner. Not only that, he brought the mongols out of being a socially and technologically primitive people to being a organized, efficient force unlike any the world had ever seen in only a few years. He is one of the very few if any leaders in history who made fascism work on a grand scale.

He then took this force, and he brought the strongest nation on Earth at the time, the nation that had manipulated and bullied the Mongols for generations (the Chinese Jin Empire) to its knees in just four years.

And he wasn't just some rampaging brute. Everything he did was a calculated move, and he never attacked an opponent without giving them at least one out for surrender first.

He was an unparalleled tactical genius who employed macro tactics reminiscent of WW2, not medieval ones. And he was an unparalleled reader of people too. He always knew exactly who to use for what position, and he could tell just from a short encounter if you would be a worthy subordinate. His use of meritocracy (something Napoleon would use later) was one of the biggest reasons for his success. Subutai was an excellent example of this. The guy was the son of a blacksmith who joined up with Genghis at age 17, and within 10 years had risen under Khan to the rank of general, of which he was himself one of the greatest of all time (this is the dude who trashed Georgia, Russia, and literally all of Eastern Europe with literally no supply train).

He established Yassa in his empire, which was a surprisingly progressive code of laws that was a big reason for the Mongolian Empire surviving his death. This set of laws and philosophy he wrote would guide Mongol leaders for generations, and only when they began to abandon it did the empire begin to crumble. It established very strict guidelines for succession, protections for women against domestic abuse, established complete freedom of religion across the empire, made religious leaders and doctors tax exempt, established punishments for stealing, assault, and murder, set foreign policy and military doctrine, established the greatest postal system in human history until the 1800's, etc... Yassa showed that Khan was not only the greatest conqueror who ever lived, but an extremely adept and able statesman.

Another badass thing about Khan was that unlike many commanders, he constantly fought at the front with his men. Even into his old age he still led from the front. Its believed he died from an infection after he was shot in the knee by an arrow (for the second time in his life) and thrown from his horse while fighting the Xia at age 65.

Oh, and durability. The guy was a fucking tank. Throughout his life he was shot by arrows, stabbed, slashed, and pretty much every other manner of wounded and always pulled through somehow.


When it comes down to it, Genghis Khan was a man who wanted it all. You can hate him for his method's of trying to get achieve that goal, the fact he walked a dark path. But you have to respect the fact he actually walked, and didn't just talk. In his climb to the top, he elevated his people to a position they would never have dreamed of a generation earlier, and a place far higher than where they are now. He didn't drive them into a hole like Hitler did, he didn't fall from he mountain top like Napoleon did, and unlike Alexander, his empire survived his death and actually thrived. He started with nothing, and arguably achieved more than and other leader in history, not to mention his exploits were the biggest catalyst the link between Europe and the far east, among other things. 

He was Khan, and thats all there is to it.",t1_cjdnxxy,t5_2tnz9,,3,3,0,1435010384,1406950850,0,,True,,t3_2c84dd,t3_2c84dd,Defengar

Not in the far West. It was not realistic to think the Mongols could have gotten to England or Spain or even France tbh.

These nations had enough space in between them and some of them were busy in their own conflicts. Spain was very powerful at the time and potentially could have fielded an army that could have defeated the Mongols under Genghis Khan, but they were busy fighting the Moors.

Other than that, there was a force where a unified army from the HRE and a few others met the Mongols in battle and pretty much got curbstomped. Like anything, they needed experience as the Mongols brought something new which hadn't been seen in Europe (plains warfare). Same reason the first time they invaded Hungary they killed a ton of people and would have conquered it and continued West but for a few key castles in the West that the Hungarians were able to hold.

Or is there some point in history where it went from ""OK to steal"" to ""Not OK to steal""? (presumably this would be after the ruling classes in Europe stole the New World, Africa, India, and so on). 

Or is it based on income or access to political power? As in, it is wrong for the poor man to steal to feed himself, but right for the rich man to buy a politician to legalize usury so he can charge the poor man 300% interest on his credit card to buy a new house. He could, of course, have simply stolen the money from the poor man, but instead he had enough money to jump through a few hoops so he could legally enshrine his right to steal.

False,0,cjdq3h3,AskHistorians,1406869637,,"A couple of factors were in play there. First, the French presence to the west of the United States was eliminated after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Napoleon originally had designs on expanding French influence in North America using Haiti in order to send troops to New Orleans, but Toussaint L'Oveture led a successful rebellion against the French and foiled Napoleon's designs. Jefferson didn't fund Haiti directly but he allowed officially contraband good into the country, turning a blind eye due to fear of Napoleon's ambitions in North America. After defeat in Haiti, Napoleon became desperate for cash to continue his wars in continental Europe, and authorized Charles de Talleyrand to sell the Louisiana region to the Americans at a highly discounted price, thus removing the French presence from North America. The British presence, however, remained in Canada. This presented the greatest threat to American security. 

Second, the rest of Europe had demonstrated that they were more than willing to attempt to contain Napoleon themselves. They had a greater interest in stopping France from establishing continental hegemony because they were geographically proximate to France. Napoleon's Haitian campaign was a massive misapplication of resources, and there was good reason to believe that he would concentrate his energy on the continent rather than pursuing another campaign in the Americas. The Europeans could effectively contain him for the time being, and if France attempted to re-establish its presence in North America then the US could make whatever alliances were necessary to distract him and keep his hands tied in Europe at that point. 

Thomas Jefferson distrusted both Britain and France but believed that Britain presented a greater threat to American security after the Louisiana Purchase, and Madison took a similar position. The war of the Sixth Coalition provided what looked to be a chance at decisively removing the British presence from North America while Britain fought a much more consequential war on the continent.

My disagreement with him is not in what we want to achieve, but on the realism of his suggestions and what I see as naive interpretations of the situation.

The first thing that struck me was his response to the rockets being fired into Israel and I quote: ""it’s hard to say they’re aimed at civilians, because they never seem to land anywhere that causes serious damage..."". If we're at a level where I have to explain how ridiculous this response is then going further would be just a waste of time.

Unlike the above response, there are issues where I agree with what he wants to achieve but I think he speaks from an ivory tower and has absolutely no clue about the deeper causes of the middle east conflict and thinks it can be solved in the same way conflicts were solved in Europe.

On the issue of Israeli wrongdoings - looking at the history I'm sure no side has been a saint, and I'll not go the route of ""Yes, but Israel was less amoral then any other country"" since I think that's a wrong way to conduct a moral compass, but I do find it fascinating that the issue of morality with respect to civilian casualties around the world in general and the Middle Easy specifically is mostly ignored unless it involves Israel.

The people in rural Anatolia progressed forward, while their relatives living in Germany got left behind. 

If you look at the migration numbers, there are more people moving back to Turkey than there are people coming to Turkey. The majority of people moving back are young people of Turkish descent who grew up in Germany. They are moving back because living in Istanbul or Izmir allows them more freedom than living in the Turkish community in Germany. 

After visiting Istanbul for a few years ago I totally understood why Turkey wants to (and should) be inside the EU - the majority of young progressive Turks on the west coast feel European. I frequently got asked ""why don't you want us inside the EU?""  It was a real shock coming back to the East-Anatolian village feel you encounter in the Turkish quarters in Germany.

False,0,cjdqclo,anarchy,1406870389,,"1. There just isn't a big enough player in the Americas to pose a significant threat.
2. The logistical nightmare would prevent large scale invasion, let alone occupation.
3. Even if the US government disappeared, and somehow the military and all of it's weapons dissipated in a puff of smoke, state governments still have military units. Well armed units, with all those fancy tanks and planes you speak of.  
4. It took an invasion force of 250k+ of some of the best supplied soldiers in the world to conquer and occupy Iraq.  A country of 30+ million, of whom many of them initially outright helped us or abandoned Saddam.  How many do you think would be required for a country of 300+ million citizens, let alone residents (Illegal alien estimates range from 12 to 40 million).  The Iraq invasion also had huge amounts of international support, especially nonmilitary support.  Think of how many countries needed to let troops and supplies go through or around them.  Going off of Wikipedia only 20(ish) countries could even supply 250k troops.  Most of the countries that could supply those men, would either leave their country unprotected (most of these countries have their own enemies and some are currently in conflict), or could not afford the 1 way trip (not even including the occupation or return).  The war cost more than 2 trillion, who could afford 20 trillion (likely way more).

Let's review the threats:

Canada's military, while professional, is laughable.  They just don't have the manpower to occupy, let alone invade several states.  They are hardly a threat, especially when considering #3.

Russia could potentially occupy Alaska, but the costs of occupying anymore would outweigh the benefits.  This isn't a small country we are talking about, this is a massive amount of land and people.  Also there are just way too many local militia groups willing to play hero.  The zerg rush would cripple the invasion.

Mexico could potentially occupy part of the south, but the non-hispanic residents would likely fight tooth and nail against that.  The greatest threat from Mexico is inciting an internal race war.  Their government and military are also not organized enough to undertake such a large operation, they have a hard enough time with the cartels.  The most interesting threat would be the expansion of drug cartels, who could recruit heavily and occupy large swathes of land.

Cuba, LOL.  Without nukes, Cuba poses no threat even to Florida.  Size + weaponry = no threat

Everyone south of Mexico is either too weak to be any sort of threat (besides maybe piracy), or could not afford or organize an invasion.  The sheer amount of resources required would leave the invader open to invasion.  All of South America would have to join hands, and even then would trip over their own feet.  Corruption would prevent any real progress.

Africa :  Same reasons as South America X100.

Europe :  Militaries are too small, and again risk vs benefit would prevent this.  The cost and manpower would cripple Europe, and they would never be able to cooperate.  NATO is a defensive treaty not an offensive treaty, and the EU has a hard time taking a concerted stance.  Some islands and protectorates might be occupied though.

Australia + Japan : Not enough ordinance or manpower.  Neither could risk even moving half of their military, for fear of China.

China : Too far and no benefit.  Cost would be crippling, which would be bad as the USA's international trade would all but stop so China would already be hurting.  They would probably occupy Taiwan, and potentially Haiwaii.  Without the USA's military, they would put more pressure on the surrounding countries and could start invading South Korea, Japan, and the other smaller countries.  Why spend trillions invading a country half the world away, where noone speaks your language, when you can invade the nearby countries you are already pressuring?

North Korea : North Korea's only threat to anyone is the possibility of Nukes.  In a conventional war with any of their neighbors, they would be screwed.  They simply could not make it to the USA.  In the extremely unlikely (considering their craziness they might try) event they did make it to California, the troops would be poorly supplied, outnumbered, and quickly routed.  I would also not consider them to be a modern military, but more of a decrepit cold war military.

Rest of Asia : Navies not large enough to orchestrate a large scale invasion, let alone protect their own waters as well.  Landlocked countries would not pose a threat.

The only real external threat of invasion to the USA would be a coalition of nations.  This coalition would be all but impossible to create in today's world.  The only way this could happen, is if something really bad happened, in which case nukes would be flying not invasions.

And there you have it children, why invasion is the least of our worries.

Zoal began his day like any other day. He woke up by the sunlight bursting in through his window and stretching his arms out to embrace the day. He knew it was a big day. Zoal got his robe and staff and saw a woman in his living room, staring outside. She yelped when he approached her. “I-i-is to-t-today…?” she stumbled. Zoal smiled warmly and replied, “Yes it is, my dear”. As he walked further around his cottage, children ran to him. “Today’s the day, today’s the day!” they chanted. Many were happy, while one sulked in the corner. Zoal asked one child “Is Alex still sad?”. The child looked up at him with big brown eyes. “Yes sir. I think he misses his family”. The man in the robe sighed and approached the boy in the corner who was about seventeen years old.  Alex spat at the man’s feet. Zoal began “Look, I know you’re angry-““You had the chance to save them but didn’t!” interrupted Alex. He then stormed outside. Zoal took a deep breath and followed him.

He loved to go outside, or used to at least. His cottage the last bit of fresh air that this city, even the country had encountered. He had a garden that bloomed with red and yellow roses. Two trees stood proudly at the corner of his garden; sadly these trees would not survive much longer ever though they were bright with color and strong with vigor. Zoal found Alex around the corner where the garden lies. Alex’s face was red with tears and frustration. “I still don’t understand why everything happened. I had my life together. We all did” His eyes burned into the sign above him that read **Vitaly:S**

Alex was one of the few who either didn’t fall for the trap. The others in the cottage were immune to it. Less than a year ago, a man in a golden suit began talking about this great pill, Vitaly: S. which would solve anyone’s problems. All they had to do was put three drops of black oil onto this green pill and make a wish. A woman was asked on stage to test the pill. She wished for her husband’s cancer to go away. As the last drop dissolved, the man in the golden suit called the husband’s doctor and told him to give them the prognosis. The husband was completely cured. The pill even helped a homeless man become a millionaire within five minutes. A week after the pill was introduced and used many times, people found it harder to breathe outside. In fact, the air looked a bit funny. Within six months, America was just one great big dark smoggy country. By the time, scientists figured out what the cause was, the man was already selling the pills in Europe. Nothing could be done to stop the growing smog. There was no hope until Zoal arrived. He visited each person who was immune or who did not use Vitaly and offered them a choice to live. Most people gladly accepted while others choose to remain with their loved ones.  Alex at first refused to go until his parents pushed him out the door. He was the only one in the family to not make a wish. 

“I’ve told you many times, Alex” said Zoal sadly. “Your entire family each made used Vitaly, they did not meet my requirements”. The boy’s tears continued to run down his face. The tears represented the sadness of his family being gone rather than anger towards Zoal. He walked around to the front of the cottage. Everyone gathered outside to get the last rays of sun. They stood in silence for hours. When the sun rays began to fade out, Zoal peacefully said, “It’s time”. Everyone slowly walked inside the cottage.  Zoal plucked a rose before walking inside. He took one last glance at the pollution before walking in the cottage. Everyone looked out the windows as the grey smoke covered their view and the sun disappeared.

False,0,cjdqk37,FutureWhatIf,1406871014,,"Well, let's think about the world wars to see what drove them. 

WWI was mostly caused by the tangle of alliances that existed in 1914. Everyone had a ""If I get attacked you have to help me"" deal with some other country. So once one country got going, everyone had to jump in.

Additionally, most of Europe had overseas territories. That means those countries automatically got brought into the fight, too.

The closest modern analogue to these circumstances is NATO, which obligates all of its members to defend all other members against an attack. There is no comparable treaty between a different set of nations, either because the other treaties don't impose the same obligations, or because the nations who sign them simply aren't strong enough to matter in the calculations of other state actors (i.e., a mutual defense treaty between Lichtenstein and Haiti probably isn't going to make many countries think twice).

NATO accounts for [60% of global military spending](http://www.stripes.com/news/despite-cuts-nato-still-accounts-for-most-of-world-s-military-spending-1.269882). And beyond spending, NATO controls most of the [world's most powerful militaries](http://www.globalfirepower.com/) - basically, money isn't everything: NATO armies tend to get more bang for their buck. So people take NATO seriously.

WWII has a different cause - it was mostly leftover anger from WWI and overt belligerence from Germany and Japan. They *wanted* a big war. The Soviet Union was likely itching for one at the time, too, but we'll now never know if it would have started one.

Generally, that kind of thinking doesn't exist much more today. There are few nation-states that have an active interest in *conquering* others. There are plenty of territorial disputes - Gaza, Kashmir, Senkaku Islands, etc. - but generally, the participants don't want to completely take each other over.

With all that, I happen to think that the most likely cause of a third world war would be accidental escalation, since no one capable of participating in WWIII wants to. 

Maybe Russia finds itself in an escalation with Georgia again, and during operations, somehow destroys several Turkish naval ships in the Black Sea, prompting a quick back-and-forth that costs lives on both sides before their leaders really understand what's happening, like the USS Maine sinking or Gulf of Tonkin incident.

All nations would prefer to avoid further trouble by using back channels, but Turkish media immediately covers the attack, with embedded crews who were there to keep an eye on the Georgia situation able to provide live coverage of the fight. It's impossible to pretend it didn't happen, and, despite Russia's denial, it's clear Russia shot first.

NATO *must* respond or it ceases to exist as any kind of meaningful entity, and the diplomacy of all members states would be seriously called into question. NATO calls for the immediate retreat of all Russian naval ships in the Black Sea to withdraw to the Sea of Azov, which Russia ignores at first.

NATO must respond, but it wants a clear, limited objective so that it can end war by achieving a clear goal. But it also needs to act fast to demonstrate its relevance. It begins limited attacks on the Black Sea Fleet .",t1_cjdqk37,t5_2v3da,,15,15,0,1435461963,False,0,,True,,t3_2ca7cp,t3_2ca7cp,Sarlax

False,0,cjdqyup,explainlikeimfive,1406872286,,"Dragons as we think of them (whether European or Asian)almost definitely didn't exist. They're really cool ideas, massively impressive, but in terms of biology there are a couple of reasons why they probably never evolved.

A six limbed configuration doesn't exist in vertebrates. Amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals are all tetrapods, which literally means they have four limbs. I feel I should add that tails are not limbs in the same way that necks are not limbs; they are extensions of the spine. So we're never going to find a European style dragon because there was never a basal six limbed creature to become the dragon.

Asian dragons typically lack wings but when we look at their depictions we see some common features with modern reptiles, especially large monitor lizards like the Komodo dragon. I read an article once which explored the premise that dragon myths in Asia spread from Indonesia northwards, and that they were misinterpreted tales of large reptiles from these far away islands. Komodo dragons have a venom in their saliva which creates a powerful burning sensation; in addition they have incredibly toxic bacteria in their mouths which cause septic blood poisoning in their prey. It's not a full explanation of dragons in mythology, but it would have lent credibility to the more outlandish tales.

Yet when we get to the nitty gritty part of it, dragons are often explained as a human creation more convincingly than as a forgotten animal or lost dinosaur. Not because we necessarily want to make a 'dragon', but because dragons contain many of the traits we see in other predators which we have an instinctual fear of. They often have the massive size of mega-fauna, the wings and talons of birds of prey, the teeth and manes of lions and the scales of reptiles. Even when one or more of these features are missing dragons seem to be amalgamations of different animal traits more than a distinctive form of their own. The level of variation within their depictions and the lack of even a single fossil as evidence also strongly indicate that as much dragons would have been amazing creatures, they most likely never existed.",t1_cjdqyup,t5_2sokd,,3,3,0,1435462156,False,0,,True,,t3_2camfd,t1_cjdq1r6,Lokostrike

Russia doesn't have a moral duty to protect you. Especially when your country is supporting economic sanctions that will inevitably harm the average Russians. Russia is in the business of protecting Russians. Put Snowden in Germany. Germany wants to let Russia go head to head with the Americans alone, then they can deal with the headache of explaining why they are being forced to give Snowden to the Americans.

Edit: Downvoted, because...? You think Russia is the world police, and has to house American dissidents? It's not their responsibility. What part of this don't you people understand? If your society is so free and so much better than Russian society, you should be able to ride your moral high horse all the way to the courthouse where Snowden will receive a fair trial. 

For the record, I think Snowden is a fucking hero, but don't see why Russia is in any way obligated to protect him - just because it's in your interests for him to remain free. Westerners have such an entitled perspective on the world, they think everyone owes them something. For the record, I'm Canadian, so this is an internal critique. Russia did the right thing in providing a dissident asylum, and they have paid the price for it. Germany didn't pay that price. Canada didn't pay that price. I didn't see them offering asylum. Snowden revealed pertinent information to the German citizens, and they couldn't even provide him protection in return. How about sorting that whole mess out, and getting to the bottom of why a supposedly sovereign European country couldn't protect someone operating in their national interests. Germany has almost twice the GDP of Russia, with half the population. They were in a much better position than Russia to take the hit. On top of that, Russia is now sitting under sanctions. Russia doesn't have the luxury of fucking around and being the good guys. They have to focus on not getting fucked over by the Americans. If you think it's in your interest for Snowden to have asylum, figure out how to do it in your own country. Don't expect a foreign country to bail you out. Particularly when you've sanctioned them, turned all your propaganda against them, and are basically salivating at the thought winning some imaginary war with them.

False,0,cjdrcv1,russia,1406873686,,"I find it extremely interesting that this is a lot of anti-west rhetoric, almost an explanation for the events that have been occurring recently, that should be directed towards the west, but has been written in Russian. It's a bit counterintuitive to make a message inaccessible to the very people you're trying to reach. 

On that note: thank you very much /u/bozmonster for translating. It will help a lot of English speakers get the message that /u/ukrus is trying to convey. 

I find the hate in this message to be a bit scary. The first thing I find scary is that ukrus is blaming all of Russia's shortcomings on western policies. When the USSR collapsed, and there were ""yeses"" from the Russian government, it was because Russia and the countries around it were prepared to be westernized. This was not some ploy, this was the the reason the USSR collapsed in the first place. You cannot possibly place a decision made internally 20 years ago on the US. To try and do so is to avoid taking responsibility. 

Let me just emphasis the fact that the US did give former Soviet States (including Russia) billions in economic aid. On top of that over $350 million went into think tanks in order to generate policies to ensure stability in Russia's future. 


Now, using NATO as a main talking point has become popular. NATO entered countries that accepted NATO alliances. Once again, this was only done at the consent of leaders. This was those country's decision. 

The '99 bombings over Kosovo was definitely the beginning of shift in opinion of western powers. What I truly can't understand is how no one mentions the bombing campaign was a success. A war that took over a hundred thousand lives was stopped in an instant, and a reasonable diplomatic process followed, but I digress. 

Your entire point takes all responsibility from Russia and places it on the US. Every shortcoming Russia's had is now the US's fault. I think the avoidance of responsibility has become somewhat of a motif in current extremist Russian writings, and posts like this illustrate that. 

The truth is that ukrus's message is driven by hate and ignorance. He actually believes that [US citizens didn't know of East and West Germany](http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/2bvqpk/how_is_europe_viewed_in_russia_compared_to_the_us/cj9ig0r?context=3), that MH17 was [shot down by Ukrainian forces as an exercise to shoot down Putin's plane](http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/2boecw/ukrainian_air_defense_exercises_might_be_behind/cj7fseh?context=3), [blames Kiev for the routing of the plane](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aznna/planes_black_box_found_apparently_currently_on/cj0lyec?context=3), and many more things. 

He is so anti-west that his hate consumes his entire message, and any good point he might have in undermined by it. 

I hate extremism on both sides, and to specifically target your message at civilians like this in such a hateful way is not good for either side. Please do not except his hate mongering as a well thought out point. The more that we separate ourselves, the more time it's going to take to bring us back together. Government relations can be fixed in mere years. Animosity amongst civilians takes decades to fix.

There's no reason a profesional should be denied of doing other types of works just because it doesn't relate to his/her field. Of course, depending on the circumstances. In this case it's a graphic design for which the  pov and conceptualization of an architect could be useful.

&gt; In 2002, Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and his architecture firm Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) designed a new flag in response to Commission President Romano Prodi's request to find ways of rebranding the Union in a way that represents Europe's ""diversity and unity"". The proposed new design was dubbed the ""barcode"", as it displays the colors of every European flag (of the then 15 members) as vertical stripes. As well as the barcode comparison, it had been compared unfavourably to wallpaper, a TV test card, and deckchair fabric. Unlike the current flag, it would change to reflect the member states.[22]
It was never officially adopted by the EU or any organisation; however, it was used as the logo of the Austrian EU Presidency in 2006. 

Of course they pretended it to be used, they did it for that reason. It wasn't passed. Sure it's ugly. That doesn't prove that architects are unable to do anything else other than architecture. Or that 'X' professionals are unable to do anything else professionaly for that matter.

The reason that your router cannot block that URL is because (as you so eloquently pointed out in your URL above) it's over HTTPS. I believe standard router Parental Controls accomplish this by scanning the TCP packets for the HOST header, and blocking accordingly. However as this is HTTPS your router is unable to trace the HOST headers.

The more sophisticated way to do this is to set your router's DNS server (assuming it runs an internal one) to point *.whateverwebsiteyouwantblocked.tld to localhost (127.0.0.1) or the router's own IP. That way no device in your network can access the torrenting service.

The green hairy stuff is [*Enteromorpha prolifera*](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/07/photogalleries/100730-environment-china-green-algae-pollution-pictures/) again. People put fertilizers on their lawns and crops, and then it rains and almost all of that goes into the nearest river and ultimately the sea. Pig waste in the water is also a big problem, and in places where sewage is not treated you will get nutrients added to the water from human waste too. Anything rich in iron, phosphorus, and nitrates will do.

Fertilizing your ocean-dwelling algae like this is not a good thing. The bloom is not sustainable, and when the algae die and sink their decomposition will suck all of the oxygen out of the water. It will smell incredibly nasty and fish that swim through the deoxygenated water will die. Rotting algae and anoxic water can produce quite a lot of hydrogen sulfide, which can [kill people and horses](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8242649.stm).

The other problem is neurotoxins. The most famous algae that makes a neurotoxin is red tide (a kind of diatom), but quite a lot of cyanobacteria also make neurotoxins (the better to keep things from eating them). I would not go into that water even though the algae that makes up the bulk of it is not known to be toxic. Exposure to typical toxic algae can cause allergic reactions, the shakes and trouble breathing.

Long-term, you manage algae by controlling nutrient inputs to your rivers. This means using less fertilizer and treating human and animal waste. Nature is your friend here; wetlands - [particularly cattails](http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2011/producer_cattails.pdf) - are very effective at consuming nutrients before they reach the sea. Sewage treatment plants work by allowing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to digest the waste to sequester phosphorus and burn off nitrates.

Check everything that you can at the gate.

Assuming that you are booked with an infant in lap ticket...If you are flying a European carrier, then call them to see if you can book a bulkhead bassinet for your baby boy.

If you can't get a bassinet, then consider bringing a boppy nursing pillow to put on your lap so you and baby can be comfortable when he's sleeping.

If you have a layover in Europe, then check to see if that airport has a family nursery room.  There was a wonderful one that we found in Munich where they have cribs for naps, sinks for washing, microwaves for food, toys for babies &amp; kids.  It was heaven and we didn't find out about it until the last hour of our 5 hour layover.

Small noiseless toys were great for our son. Get some sort of toy leash so all the toys are coonected to your bag so you don't lose them.

Ergo is an excellent idea.  Saved us walking from one gate to another and going through security and customs.

Don't hesitate to ask for help in the airport or on your flight.  Other parents will be happy to help you.

Organize a diaper changing wallet so you don't have to schlep your entire diaper bag with you to the bathroom on the flight.  Airline toilets are small.

if you can then pack supplies for two days, just in case you get stuck at the airport or in transit.

False,0,cjds8z7,worldnews,1406876981,,"Israel was created by the British by the same network that managed cultural revolutions throughout Europe.  [In 1840](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Zionism#After_the_Egyptian.E2.80.93Ottoman_War), Lord Palmerston and Lord Shaftesbury both announced their support for the establishment of the state of Israel.  Perhaps they were lobbied you might naively suspect; no, there was no such thing as Zionism in 1840.  This was an intelligence services scheme.  So, what were they up to?

At this point in history, the British control most of the world.  We have in their way America, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Austria.  Russia and Austria are dealt with during the world wars, but assaults on America and the Ottoman Empire begin immediately after this period:

Three years after Palmerston's declaration of British foreign office support for a previously unheard-of movement - Zionism - the freemasonic order of B'nai B'rith was established in New York in 1843. What were the initial fruits of this order? Although supposedly a Jewish masonic order, they strangely show little interest in Jews.

Among B'nai B'riths early members is Edwin deLeon. He is a prominent leader of ""Young America"" in the model of ethnic nationalist movements that had sprung up everywhere in the world under the direction of Mazzini (financed by Lord Shaftesbury from before) -- everywhere, that is, except in Britain. What can we say about Edwin's dispositions? He was educated by Thomas Cooper, arguably the most vocal proponent of southern secession. Perhaps you are seeing the bigger picture: we have a zionist canard adopted as the foreign policy of the British, rapid development of a masonic order nominally interested in Jews, but instead turning their attention to national subversion in America for the purposes of serving British interests. This is exactly as the Young Turks, Young Italy, and so on do throughout the world in the 19th and early 20th centuries (except, conveniently, England).

To exemplify how deep the treason runs within this circle (Young America), consider that you can see an encryption / decryption device at Ford's theater owned by John Wilkes Booth. An identical one was found in the office of Judah Benjamin. Hours before the assassination of Lincoln, Booth met with Simon Wolf - leader of B'nai B'rith chapter in Washington. Booth was further a friend of Benjamin Peixotto, a major leader of B'nai B'rith. Judah Benjamin escapes to England after the Civil War, never to return. The details go on and on, but you can see how agents of the British foreign office were behind the assassination of Lincoln by now.

It is through the Scottish Rite / B'nai B'rith axis that the turmoil in the Middle East that lasts to this day is established. Emmanuel Carasso, member of B'nai B'rith, is the founder of the Young Turks. This organization plays a leading role in the insurrection and dissolution of the Ottoman empire, with Carasso personally informing the Sultan that he had been deposed. The US ambassadors to Turkey during this time, Oscar Straus, Abraham Elkin, and Henry Morgenthau, were all members of B'nai B'rith.

One of the most important British families in this time is the Herbert family. Aubery Herbert is the British intelligence chief in the Middle East during this era. His father was a patron of the Mazzini networks (Young Turks, etc) and leader of British freemasonry for a while. Herbert was a friend of Lawrence of Arabia, the man who helped to establish the Saudi monarchy and eventual client state of the west to this day. Lawrence is of course more famous for his ""heroic"" leadership in battle in WW1

So there is where things get really interesting.  In 1911 we have major oil discovery in Iran.  Lawrence of Arabia has been in the area for a few years as a researcher and made friends with the al-Faisal and Abudallah families (Saudi, Jordan monarchies respectively).  They lead a revolt in the south against the Ottoman Empire.  The British also make the [Balfour Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) declaring their intention to establish an Israeli state (although folks like Palmerston made that clear previously).  al-Faisal has this to say about the creation of Israel,

&gt;""We Arabs... look with the deepest sympathy on the Zionist movement. Our deputation here in Paris is fully acquainted with the proposals submitted yesterday by the Zionist Organisation to the Peace Conference, and we regard them as moderate and proper. ""

You might start getting confused at this point.  How strange it is that this so-called extremist monarchy of Wahhabism was the first and pretty much only regime to ever embrace Israel.  It is not so strange however once you learn that the al-Faisals (House of Saud) is secretly [Jewish](http://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2011/10/26/the-doenmeh-the-middle-easts-most-whispered-secret-part-ii.html).  This really should come as no surprise, as the British intelligence services for the last ~70 years at this point have been employing the Jewish people nearly to the exclusion of anyone else for tasks including the assassination of American presidents.

Recognizing that the House of Saud, which is actually Jewish, is the one funding all the extremist movements in the Middle East a little clarity begins to emerge.  They finance the most pathetic of attacks from time to time which justify the encampment of Palestinians and strengthen the state of Israel; why not?  Saudi Arabia is run by Zionists after all.  We see relatively little aid to the Palestinian people, none of the oil money flowing to the people, the west backs up the Saudi regime if they are ever in trouble including the [NSA](http://rt.com/usa/175712-snowden-nsa-saudi-partnership/) helping to crush dissent there recently as reported by Snowden.

OK, so where do we stand?  It's pretty clear why Britain supports Israel.  (Some) Jewish people have been very successful agents of British intelligence / foreign policy, financed war efforts, etc., so the two cut a deal.  That's pretty standard geopolitics, no big deal.

It doesn't answer the question of why the USA is allied with Israel though.   To cover that, we have to talk about British influence in America.  We've already seen how their agents helped to stir up the civil war and assassinate Lincoln.  Today, rather than the British monetarist empire with opium trafficking we have the US monetarist empire with cocaine trafficking (and a bit of poppy too, at least as long as US troops can protect the fields in Afghanistan).  These are just two faces of the same system though.

George Bush is infamous for the Iran-Contra scandal that exposed CIA cocaine running into America.  Mena, Arkansas has been exposed as the hub of this trafficking operation while Clinton was governor.  Bush's wife, Barbara comes from the Percy family that organized the Gunpowder Plot (of V for Vendetta fame) in England - one of the oldest and most powerful British families there is.  Prescott Bush (George's father) is infamous himself for helping to organize Nazi industry, finances, etc. during WW2.  Pretty clear that these folks are stooges of British intelligence.

The Clinton years really takes the cake though.  Clinton's primary financial backer was Pamela Harriman (of Brown Brother Harriman, Prescott Bush's firm and the source of the Bush family wealth).  Pam is of the House of Marlborough in England, same as Winston Churchill.  Do you know who else?  Pat Robertson!  The same folks who propped up and opposed Clinton are also in bed with the Bush family.

When people tell you the two party system is a scam, they don't know the half of it.  The ""opposition"" you are naively picking from if you watch TV are really long time friends putting on pure theater for you.  They also happen to work for the British, and thus derives the modern US support for Zionism, for no reason other than America is now a proxy of the British and the British are allies with the Zionists.",t1_cjds8z7,t5_2qh13,,8,8,1,1435012169,False,0,,True,,t3_2cb446,t1_cjdqim5,FreedomIntensifies

For PvE, anything is fine. 

For PvP, it depends on your latency. I have a lancer, slayer, and priest. Lancer is by far the worst affected, because its harder to block cancel w/e. Priest is next hardest, because you can't heal as fast or dodge as fast. Slayer is least affected out of the 3, but still can be neutered pretty hard.

Also accepting too many refugees from that region at once without them ever integrating properly into Western Culture, while changing the demographics of whole towns and cities for the worse. Those refugees should have to accept other cultures and the Euro way of life 100% before even being allowed in. France is fucked up because of all the legal immigration they allowed from their former colonies as well, great way to increase crime rates and problems and cause a divide between citizens. 

With the massive birthrates and massive influx of Muslims into Europe, the demographics will eventually switch tot hem becoming a significant portion of the population, which will shift the influence in Europe the wrong way. People of European ancestry should always be the majority in their own country, rather than this silly idea of multiculturalism requiring large amounts of immigration. Even without the security issue of immigration from the middle east, they still shouldn't allow so much immigration anyway, and anti-immigration should not instantly mean xenophobic, as those people should be able to visit or tour a country or have a temporary work visa without any hate from the local population, but not be a permanent resident. It's mainly one way immigration of people from those countries, as you barely see any non muslim emigrating to the middle east. Who needs to invade when you can come either as an illegal immigrant or refugee and brainwash all the kids you have with high birthrates.

There would have been a much better chance of proper Muslim integration into Europe if immigration was purely through normal means, like most others from outside of the EU would have to do, where being highly educated and useful to the place they're going to would be a requirement.

 [**Cellular frequencies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular%20frequencies): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __cellular frequencies__ are the sets of frequency ranges within the ultra high frequency band that have been allocated for [cellular phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone) use. All [cellular phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone) networks worldwide use a portion of the [radio frequency spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency) designated as [ultra high frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency), or ""UHF"", for the transmission and reception of their signals. The ultra high frequency band is also shared with [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television), [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) and [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) transmission.

&gt;For historical reasons, radio frequencies used for cellular networks differ in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first commercial standard for mobile connection in the United States was [AMPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System), which was in the 800 MHz frequency band. In Nordic countries of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), the first widespread automatic mobile network was based on the [NMT-450 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Mobile_Telephone), which was in the 450 MHz band. As mobile phones became more popular and affordable, mobile providers encountered a problem because they couldn't provide service to the increasing number of customers. They had to develop their existing networks and eventually introduce new standards, often based on other frequencies. Some European countries (and Japan) adopted [TACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TACS) operating in 900 MHz. The [GSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM) standard, which appeared in Europe to replace NMT-450 and other standards, initially used the 900 MHz band too. As demand grew, carriers acquired licenses in the 1,800 MHz band. (Generally speaking, lower frequencies allow carriers to provide coverage over a larger area, while higher frequencies allow carriers to provide service to more customers in a smaller area.)

&gt;In the U.S., the analog AMPS standard that used the cellular band (800 MHz) was replaced by a number of digital systems. Initially, systems based upon the AMPS mobile phone model were popular, including [IS-95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-95) (often known as ""[CDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_division_multiple_access)"", the air interface technology it uses) and [IS-136](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-136) (often known as D-AMPS, Digital AMPS, or ""[TDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_division_multiple_access)"", the air interface technology it uses). Eventually, IS-136 on these frequencies was replaced by most operators with GSM. GSM had already been running for some time on US [PCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Communications_Service) (1,900 MHz) frequencies.

As it is, that leaves science.

False,0,cjdsoyz,AskUK,1406878825,,"The teaching of History (and many other subjects!) in the UK varies considerably because we allow students to specialise much younger than in the US.

An American student will study a general curriculum from K-12, whereas British compulsory schooling only lasts until age 16 and History is only a required subject until age 14. (We do start school earlier than the US, though so it's not quite as bad as it sounds!) 

Another thing (for my generation anyway) is that the teaching was modular, so we wouldn't have a class on American history where we learned it all in chronological order. Instead we would have lots of different modules throughout our school year and any of them might touch on America if it were relevant.

We also did a lot of project work, meaning that you might be doing a module on, say, Ancient History and have a choice of whether you wanted to do a personal project about the Greeks, Egyptians or Romans. Meaning that you might only do in-depth learning on one of the three.

Okay, so that's the framework for the history I studied. I started school at age 4 and the first American history I remember studying was a few years later during a module on the Age of Discovery. We looked at explorers like Cook, Columbus and Magellan and I think there might have been project work because I still have the little hand illustrated booklet I did on the voyages of Cook and I still remember some of the lyrics to the little play my friends and I did about the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, but I don't remember doing anything specific on Magellan. (I can tell you that when I was seven, they were still teaching that ""Columbus's contemporaries thought the world was flat"" bullshit.)

Two or three years later, I did a module on WWII For Kids. (Technically it was just a module on WWII, but there was a strong focus on children to make it more relatable.) We read The Machine Gunners and Goodnight Mr Tom and we had to write poems about The Blitz, Evacuees and the Home Front. We looked at the Kindertransport and the Holocaust too, although mostly in terms of the gradual restrictions on European Jewish kids than on the nitty gritty details of the death camps, because we were still pretty young. The focus was very much on how the war affected Kids Like Us and since American kids weren't particularly affected, there wasn't much of a US focus. We did talk a little about America's role in the European theatre and at one point, my grandmother came in to talk to the class about what it had been like to live through and to let all the kids in my class try on [my grandfather] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24np1r/what_is_an_interesting_fact_about_your/ch9b16i)'s old Battle of Britain flying helmet, which they went absolutely *nuts* for.

Age eleven or twelve, I had a module on Slavery, which covered the Triangle Trade, the Abolitionist Movement, the American Civil War and Emancipation. There was an emphasis on Britain's role, so we didn't learn about the textile industry in the Northern US being part of the triangle, instead there was a focus on the Lancashire cotton mills. Similarly, the primary sources we looked at for the abolitionist movement were mostly from British newspapers and politicians. We didn't cover the American Civil War in the same detail that an American student would. We never learned generals' names or specific battles and I don't think we covered the ""states rights"" argument or the other justifications that were given for the war. It was simplified down to ""At home we stopped slavery with an act of parliament, in America it was a more fundamental part of the economy, so they went to war over it internally, but they eventually did the right thing too."" (We did at least acknowledge that for a while slavery in America allowed us to have our cake and eat it too, having banned slavery in the UK, but still exploiting the economic advantages of cheap US cotton.)

We did a module on WWI somewhere around this age as well. There wasn't much of a focus on the US, beyond a consensus that your isolationist policies totally screwed us and that the death toll would have been smaller if you'd [shown up earlier] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/The_Gap_in_the_Bridge.png). (Sorry.)

We did a module on Suffrage and Civil Rights when I was twelve or thirteen. The main focus was on the UK women's suffrage movement (I was at an all-girls school at the time and suspect that my teachers were once again placing a focus on the parts they thought would hold our interest), but we also covered stuff like the Levellers and the Reform Act in the UK. Content from the States included the US women's suffrage movement, Jim Crow laws and the American civil rights movement. We also studied the ending of Apartheid in South Africa, although I suspect that was on the teacher's own initiative, since it was current affairs rather than history.

At this point I could choose which subjects I wanted to study for my GCSEs. (A previous generation would have known them as O-Levels. If you're a fan of the Harry Potter books it may be helpful to think of them as the OWLs.) Some subjects like Maths and English are compulsory at this level, but subjects like History and Geography you can choose whether to continue with. The UK doesn't have the equivalent of a high school graduation. You sit individual examinations in each subject and are given a mark for each that you show future employers. For this reason, students select the classes they're better at or which will help them to get the job or degree they want in the future. For the final two years of compulsory schooling, all your time is spent working towards these exams. I chose to ditch Geography and keep History.

So for GCSE History you had to pick a module and study it in depth. There were multiple modules you could choose from depending on which exam board you were studying with. This was usually chosen at the teacher level, so all the kids taking History GCSE at my school did the module on 20th Century History which focused on America, Western Europe, Russia, Japan and China. Over the next few years I covered America's role in WWI, the League Of Nations, the Jazz Age, Prohibition, The Dust Bowl, The Great Depression, The New Deal,  Pearl Harbour, America's role in the European and Pacific theatres of WWII, the Bomb, The UN, The Cold War and Vietnam.

I chose not to pursue History from age 16 onwards, so I don't know what American History was on the A-Level syllabus. (I had a friend who studied History at A-Level, but her focus was the Middle Ages, so it wouldn't have included you.)

So while the Revolutionary War and Westwards Expansion got mostly overlooked in my schooling, I think that overall I studied a *lot* of American History when you consider how young and remote your country is compared to, say, France. Also when you compare it to how much South American or African or even Canadian history we studied.

Yeah, that much is beyond doubt. 

&gt;In a capitalist country like the Netherlands, that is arguably seen as bad administration.

That seems a bit like free market fundamentalism: ""our way is the right way, everything else is wrong"". Planned economy might not be the best thing in the world, but it has its strong points, and it surely worked well enough to see us through WWII victorious.

&gt;We see that the huge losses on the USSR side were partially accountable to Stalin's tactics and infrastructure

While it's impossible to argue with the fact that the losses suffered in the frontlines (the minority of Soviet losses, btw: about five times that were the civilians slaughtered by the Germans) could be attributed to the imperfect Soviet military leadership, it's not like anyone in Europe can claim that their military leadership was significantly better, seeing their own history fighting the blitzkrieg.

&gt;we didn't see Eastern Europe flourish in the fifties like Western Europe

In (very, very) short, I ended up in LA County Juvenile Correction Center about 3 months later and wasn't allowed back into California until I was an adult. 

Took me a few years to get my shit straight and eventually I realized I was going nowhere fast after attempting suicide shortly after my 18th birthday. I lied my ass off to get into the US Navy. I am pretty sure my recruiter just glazed over my supposedly 'never touching drugs' because while not having a bunch of common sense I was a pretty smart kid and scored really high on my ASVAB test that I had taken before dropping out of high school. Basically I was told I could do any rating I wanted in the Navy except work with nuclear materials. Being in the service was probably the best thing I ever did for myself because it was probably the first time in my life I realized I was smart and capable. Of course I fucked that all up by being undiagnosed bipolar and getting married because it sounded like a good idea at the time... but that is another long fucked up story - one of many. My mother still says I need to write a book mainly because my bipolar has made my life a series of fucked up tragic adventures. 

Honestly - I've met two presidents, a few other heads of state (PM Netanyahu is an arrogant prick FYI), congressman, ambassadors, and celebrities while I was in the Navy - which is funny when you consider that a few years before that I was sleeping in newspaper recycling bins, a tent on river or that nasty bug infested juvenile hall. I've lived in half a dozen states, traveled cross-country 8 times, been to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean. I've dealt with BP for most of my life but didn't know it and my family had pretty much written me off because of it. Pretty much took me losing everything I own (literally - no exaggeration here) to finally figure out that I have spent my entire life running away and not knowing why. 

When it all comes down to it - I have spent the last 25 years running because of how broken my life was as a teenager. Took me all that time before I realized what I was doing and stopped running away from the memories of my youth. A year ago, I hadn't spoken to my entire family for over two years. I finally called them after walking 50 miles outside of Chicago in the span of a few days because I was afraid if I spent one more day in my apartment I was going to try to hang myself. Now I am closer to my parents then I have ever been in my life and trying to rebuild - with the help of wonderful medications that allow me to finally feel human for once. *Hurray for pharmaceuticals!* 

Everyone deals with emotional pain in different ways. Some people bury it inside and never feel again. Some people are haunted by it. Some people are full of rage or despair.

2-) Turkish population in hungary has never reached a significant number. Even under ottoman rule, hungary was defended using muslim balcan soldiers so the interaction between hungarian and turkish people was weak

Other than that, some people belive that hungarians are a turkic people, who used a different path when turkic tribes immigrated from central asia to middle east and europe, and got mixed with local people in hungary. As a  result, they believe that hungarians are turks or at least half turks :)

If the case did go to the court and you won, you would probably be awarded damages and in addition they would be forced to pay legal fees, perhaps for both sides depending on which country you are in. So I would say yes I think it's very reasonable to ask for a monetary settlement.

The size of the settlement varies very much from country to country. Looking at similar cases might help you figure out the amount, if you can figure out the national courts database in your country. (This is usually fairly easy with a bit of googling). In my country (Iceland) the damages awarded are usually quite small - for a case like this I might guess $1.000 - $15.000 depending on the scale of the publication.

As with all court cases your win (if you went to court) is not guaranteed and as such any settlements would probably be less than the courts would award you.

Anyway I would always request a settlement in exchange for dropping a potential lawsuit because the worst thing that could happen is they reject it. Best is they accept and if not they may make a counter offer.
At the least they should pay any legal fees that you've incurred.
Then there's also the question of whether you want them to publish an apology. That is very common in some similar cases but there's always the question of 'do you want the attention?'

False,0,cjdt64i,funny,1406880983,,"""In two separate papers, published in the journal Science and in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI), researchers describe new genetic factors that could explain weight gain in some people. In the Science study, researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital studying mice found a rare genetic mutation that prevented the animals from burning off fat calories. They also found the same gene was mutated in a group of obese people. And a team based at University College London reported in JCI that a specific form of a gene previously linked to obesity, FTO, can increase craving for high-fat foods.

The discoveries add to the growing body of knowledge about the biology behind weight, and the results confirm that while it’s represented by a single number, weight is the complex combination of a multitude of different metabolic processes, from brain systems that regulate appetite to enzymes that control how efficiently calories are turned from food into energy that the body needs. Making matters even more confusing, these factors are also likely influenced by environmental contributors such as diet and lifestyle.

In the mouse study, the research team determined that mutations in the Mrap2 gene led the animals to eat less initially but still gain about twice as much weight as they normally would. While their appetites returned, these mice continued to gain weight despite being fed the same number of calories as a group of control animals. That led the scientists to figure out that the mice with the mutated gene were simply sequestering fat rather than breaking it down for energy. The mice, like people, possessed two copies of the gene, and mice with even one defective copy experienced significant weight gain, although not as much as those who had two mutated versions of Mrap2.

The scientists found a similar pattern among a group of 500 obese people; they detected four mutations in the human version of Mrap2, and each of the obese individuals possessed only one bad version of the gene.


In the British study, the researchers divided a group of 359 healthy men of normal weight by their FTO gene status. The majority of the men had low-risk versions of the gene, while 45 of the participants had mutations that have been linked to greater appetite and caloric consumption. To figure out how the altered genes were affecting appetite, the team measured levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin both before and after meals that the participants ate; the men with the mutated form of FTO did not show the same drop in ghrelin levels, signifying that they were full, as the men with the low-risk form of FTO.

Genome wide association studies, which compare genetic makeups of obese individuals to those of normal weight, are making it easier to flesh out important genetic factors contributing to weight, and researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health say that to date, these studies have identified over 30 candidate genes on 12 chromosomes associated with body mass index.

“Thus far mutations in about eight genes are known to cause obesity in humans. But these mutations account for under five percent of the obesity in our society, and certainly are not, by themselves, responsible for the current obesity epidemic, since the mutation rate in these genes could not have changed dramatically during the past twenty years,” says Dr. Joseph Majzoub, the chief of the division of endocrinology at Boston Children’s Hospital and an author on the Science paper. “However, mutations in these genes have led to the discovery of pathways that are important in energy balance in humans, giving us hope that drugs can be developed that affect these pathways to prevent excessive weight gain, either by curbing appetite or increased burning of calories.”


Here is a round-up of some recent genes, and their products, that have been linked to obesity :

Leptin: Often referred to as the “obesity hormone,” leptin is made by fat cells and acts as a thermostat for the body’s energy needs. Each individual has his own leptin threshold; if leptin levels fall below that amount, the brain understands that the body is starving, and needs more calories. If leptin levels are maintained or surge above that amount, the brain knows that it doesn’t need to take in more food. Unfortunately, while mouse studies showed that overweight mice had lower levels of leptin, the same wasn’t true of obese people, who generally show higher levels of leptin in their blood. Somehow, researchers how believe, these people are not getting the signal to stop eating, which is referred to as leptin-resistance.

Ghrelin: This gene makes an appetite hormone that can make foods look more desirable–especially high-calorie ones — by influencing the brain’s reward system. Some studies have found that  people who are sleep-deprived have increased ghrelin levels, which may explain why lack of sleep can contribute to weight gain.

Neuropeptide Y: One of the brain’s many chemicals, neuropeptide Y may trigger eating by manipulating appetite, possibly resulting from changes in mood and stress levels. It may also contribute to an increased deposition of fat from food calories.""

It's the same reason we have one of the best academies in Europe but don't seem to promote many players to senior level. We don't have the luxury of taking time, and bringing them through alongside top players where they can develop in a relatively safe environment.

In Europe, because of the Sepa system I can transfer payments almost instantaneously across European countries, and be confident they will be processed and confirmed. In the UK banks now have the capability to allow customers to send money via text messages INSTANTANEOUSLY. In Kenya m-pesa is more popular than any banking deposit system. There is no reason why US banks can't follow in the same direction, and from what I understand that is eventually the plan. For them to do so. Problem is it takes political will to set up a system like sepa across the world. But America's anti-collaborative factions (who view any coordinated system like sepa as a socialist monstrosity) get in the way of such a system being developed in the US or on a US cross border connected way. So you US citizens all get penalized with crappy payment networks because of your fear of a little bit of socialistic grand project work on the payments side (yes it takes evil government infringing on the payments industry to create a system like sepa). The funniest thing about the bitcoiners is they don't even notice that their solution to the problem depends on a much more communist-like collective model than sepa could ever hope to be. With bitcoin the system clearly obliges each according to his hashing ability to provide to each according to his transfer need. All based around a much more powerful manifesto and cult system than Marx's and Lenin's ever was. Funnier still, there's an equal reluctance by the bitcoin collective to acknowledge that the system is flawed and prone to corruption and exploitation of the bitcoin worker bees just the same way the communist system was. But the brainwashing has been that good I guess.

I would imagine other countries would require you to speak the native language as well as English. But if you did have other European languages, especially German, that would open up a lot of opportunities I would think.

Also, in terms of experience, try out as much software as you can, use free trials for things like Hootsuite, Sproutsocial, Hubspot, even Photoshop, make sure you're familiar with all the major social networks and up to date on trends. Get used to different content management systems (you can do that for free by starting sites on Wordpress, Squarespace, Tumblr, Wix etc). And take some of the free exams, such as for Google Adwords. That one isn't proof of proficiency as it's easy to blag, but it will at least show some understanding of the skills you need and it's something else formal to put on your CV. Take a Code Academy course as well, you don't need to know how to code necessarily but an understanding of it will help and means you can hold conversations with the developers. 

And read, read, read to stay up to date. If you get into an interview and can talk with confidence about digital marketing and even suggest ideas that the company haven't tried yet then it'll obviously make you look good.

False,0,cjdtizf,Buttcoin,1406882742,,"&gt; I'm wondering if you all can offer a strong argument as to why bitcoin will not succeed as a more efficient payment rail. I don't mean so that we can buy goods online (though that may come later) - I mean so international financial institutions can transfer value between geographically and financially disparate countries efficiently.

International financial institutions don't actually transfer money as suitcases full of cash. They all have accounts in each other's databases. If bank A wants to transfer money to bank B, they send them a message saying ""please decrease the total in *our account in your systems* by $100, and increase the total of *your account in your systems* by $100"". And if you don't have an account with the specific bank, then you ask your partner bank in the destination country to do it for you.

It really is about changing numbers in a database, not actual transfers of anything tangible at this stage. The validity of these transfers is checked afterwards by automated and manual audits - and after all, you can always change the numbers back if there was a mistake or other problem.

All banks (and other large companies) have access to this messaging network, and can broadcast payments into and out of accounts. (See http://engineering.zenpayroll.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1/ for an introduction). The messaging system might be old, complex and slow in the US, but that's just because banks are cautious about changes and bugs that might halt the system and disrupt their business for a while. Twitter and Reddit can be down for 30 minutes and nobody cares, but banks want software that ""always works"". Upgrading the technology would be a lot easier than adopting bitcoin, EU banks have already done so with SEPA.

Could you perhaps explain what do you see as the advantages of bitcoin for the transfers? The distributed ledger, the limited total number of bitcoins, the fluctuating exchange rate, and above all the *need to actually own bitcoins* would be downsides.",t1_cjdtizf,t5_2sngy,,4,4,0,1435012837,False,0,,True,,t3_2cbg5u,t3_2cbg5u,lehmakook

While many/most in Western Europe would blanche at at the idea of Russia in the EU, the real question is, **why would Russia want to join?** As a large country, Russia already enjoys many of the advantages the EU is designed to emulate: a large economic area, a single currency, large labor markets, etc. Joining the EU would require a lot of effort and expense and loss of autonomy in order to replicate what they already have.

The same treaty rights as those countries, but Russia's population would be the largest by some margin. Potentially the biggest stumbling block.

The image of her as oblivious to the suffering around her is incorrect. She was charitable, and sympathetic to the plight of the poor, and she tried to raise her children to be, too. The memoirs of Madame Campan have more details. [Link to part 1](https://archive.org/details/memoirsofmadamec01campuoft), and [part 2](https://archive.org/details/memoirsofmadamec02campuoft).

She wasn't very interested in subjects traditionally seen as intellectual, and her early education was lacking. According to Antonia Frasers biography, she didn't like to be around people who were overtly intelligent. However, that doesn't mean that she was stupid. She was deeply involved with the politics of the court, and did what she could to influence events in Europe in line with her interests, corresponding secretly with other European monarchs and using her position to gain access to military secrets that would help them in the war against France. During her trial, she showed both her wits and her strength of character, cleverly answering the questions asked without either implicating herself or betraying her beliefs. 

Most people here probably know that the ""let them eat cake"" quote isn't accurate, and instead attribute it to revolutionary slander. However, I've never seen any mention of this quote in any source from the time, or any mention of it being connected to her during her lifetime. Republicans were more likely to attribute her behavior to  counterrevolutionary plotting than to stupidity. The act of accusation against her ([link](http://revolution.fr.free.fr/texte_accmarie.htm) in French) says

&gt;[...] the public prosecutor has raised this accusation against Marie Antoinette, in her interrogation naming herself de Lorraine d'Autriche, widow of Louis Capet, for having maliciously, and by design, 
&gt;
&gt;1) in concert with the brothers of Louis Capet and the infamous minister Calonne, squandered the finances of France in a horrifying manner, and for having sent incalculable sums to the emperor (i.e. her brother, either Joseph II or Leopold II), and for having thus dried out the national treasury. 

Earlier on in the same document we're told that part of this terrifying spending was to satisfy her ""disorderly pleasures"", but taken all in all I think what Fouquier-Tinville is trying to show here has more to do with plots against the state, and less to do with just really wanting more pretty dresses. Especially since her personal expenditures are always mentioned in connection with her sending money to France's enemies. Nowadays, most people don't know about her *actual* counterrevolutionary plots, which makes the Stupid Spoiled Princess trope an easier explanation for her spending. 

In reality, her spending wasn't very noteworthy for a queen at the time, and considering that the king never had a mistress to spend money on, she could have afforded even more expensive habits. It certainly didn't put an actual dent in the state finances. Only 6% of the budget was spent by the court, while over 50% went to managing the debt. (Georges Lefebvre, 1789) Which is a lot of money! But most of it wasn't Marie Antoinette's choice. The court spent a lot to keep the nobles happy with their post-Louis XIV lack of political power with pensions and well-payed positions in the king's household, and the king couldn't have cut down on that without getting into trouble. The problem was also that the extravagance of the court served a political purpose, to glorify the king by displaying the wealth of the nobility and royalty. When public opinion turned against both, people were angered by their waste, instead of dazzled by diamonds and paniers.

Não te deixes enganar muito pelas questões da empregabilidade. Penso que se fores inteligente no teu percurso não tens muito que temer. 

Da minha experiência pessoal no ensino superior, é importante definires o mais cedo possível o que raio queres fazer depois do curso (basicamente, o que eu gostava que me tivessem dito). Tirar mestrado? Cá ou fora? Depois disso é empenhares-te nesse sentido. Pedir alguma guidance aos professores, arranjar estágios, arranjar experiência internacional se possível, ter boas notas (se todos os teus colegas próximos estão a tirar 12s, não quer dizer que não consigas tirar mais), eventualmente fazer cadeiras avulsas fora da tua área.

Acho que há mestrados/formações/caminhos que fazem uma combinação interessante com Filosofia. Muitas áreas da Gestão só tinham a ganhar em contar com mais pessoas com formação base em Filosofia. E tbh, não há assim tanto para saber em Gestão que obrigue a teres formação na área - no mestrado em Gestão da Nova, por exemplo, há alguma malta com licenciatura na áreas de Letras. Filosofia+Marketing também me parece uma combinação interessante. Also, áreas de ética empresarial, economia comportamental, gestão de RH e outras que tais. Também o jornalismo, que mencionas no comentário, beneficiaria de malta com formação base em Filosofia que tenha sentido crítico e alguma noção de ética. 

Se decidires escolher um mestrado mais ""prático"", creio que daqui a 5 anos, um estudante empenhado que escolheu licenciatura em Filosofia contra todo o ruído de empregabilidade e saídas dos cursos se distingue perante um possível empregador dos demais que seguiram áreas que achavam meh porque cederam à pressão dos papás que querem ter um gestor/advogado/whatever na família. 

Com isto não estou a tentar ~empurrar-te para um percurso, mas mais ou menos a dizer de cabeça que o risco não é assim tão grande. Se não correr da melhor maneira, o que não faltam são mestrados bons por aí à tua espera.

&gt; The lull was seemingly first broken by terror factions in Gaza who fired a mortar at Israel at roughly 10 am Friday morning. The mortar, which was followed by another shortly after, failed to land in Israel, falling in Gaza territory...
&gt; Just after the 10am mortar fire from northern Gaza, IDF tanks shelled part of the town of Rafah in southern Gaza, killing at least nine and wounding at least 10, said Health Ministry official Ashraf al-Kidra and Gaza police spokesman Ayman Batniji... An IDF spokesman said a heavy exchange of fire had erupted in the Rafah area, without providing further details.

Haaretz also stated: http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.608331
&gt; Some two hours after the truce deal brokered by the United States and the EU kicked in, mortar shells fired from within the Strip landed near border-region town, and shortly thearafter Palestinian sources reported that several Gaza residents were killed and wounded by IDF artillery fire directed at the southern Gaza Strip.

Also BBC: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28603599
&gt; The Israeli military has told people in Gaza it is resuming operations, saying Hamas broke a planned 72-hour ceasefire just hours after it had begun... Israeli military sources told the BBC the attack was in response to rocket fire on Kerem Shalom in Israel.

Also if you have problems with Israeli sources, Haaretz is actually a reliable source. Haaretz has a very extensive history of criticizing Israeli actions and questioning the IDF.

False,0,cjdv4za,podemos,1406891319,,"Destinando una partida tan importante a dar un subsidio estamos cometiendo el mismo error que los partidos gobernantes al acometer políticas económicas, destinar partidas del presupuesto a los distintos problemas, de forma que la totalidad de los mismos se torna inasumible. Debemos estudiar la problemática social, sus cusas y sus enlaces. Un ejemplo: para mejorar la educación o la sanidad necesitamos contratar a personal, que cuesta dinero, por otro lado existen personas sin ingr5esos que necesitan una renta básica para sobrevivir, que necesita dinero, y si empleamos dinero en contratar a profesores o a médicos estamos solucionando los dos problemas: la educación o sanidad y el de las personas sin ingreso.
Mi propuesta es destinar los recursos a crear empelo allí donde es necesario: educación, sanidad, servicios sociales, reciclaje, limpieza de montes, repoblación de zonas deshabitadas, etc. Es cierto que un sueldo e3s más caro que un subsidio, pero también serán muchos menos a recibir ese sueldo y más alcanzable.
Respecto a las ventajas: 1ª, si conseguimos colocar los seis millones de parados, cosa que costaría unos 150.000 millones de euros incluidos gastos de seguridad social, habremos solucionado el problema de las pensiones, que pasarían de déficit a superávit; 2ª solucionado el problema de la educación, en un 98% falta de personal, ; 3ª solucionado el problema de la sanidad en un 80% falta de personal, 4ª solucionado el problema de los servicios sociales (atención a ancianos, guarderías, ayudas a la drogadicción, etc.) en un 95% gastos de personal, 5ª reciclaje absoluto de residuos sólidos y líquidos, en un 90 % gastos de personal, 6ª mejora de la Agencia Tributaria, imprescindible para combatir el fraude fiscal, en un 99% gastos de personal, etc. etc.
Todos estaréis de acuerdo conmigo que, alcanzado el pleno empleo, la renta básica sería una cuestión residual que afectaría sólo a personas incapaces, que necesiten ayuda especial, mayores sin pensión, etc. Esta problemática podría ser atendida por diversos cauces estatales y autonómicos, como ocurre en la actualidad.
Financiación: Servicio de la deuda: unos 40.000 millones, seguro de desempleo: 30.000 millones, impuestos ecológicos sobre los envases, productos contaminantes, combustibles, químicos, etc., por lo menos entre 30.000 y 60.000 millones, por último hay que tener en cuenta que las actividades de reciclaje producen ingreso de la venta de productos como el papel usado, el vidrio, los abonos, la energía, la biomasa, la madera, etc.
Todo lo anterior nos produce un marco factible desde el punto de vista macroeconómico, enmarcado en políticas de déficit cero, tan valoradas por la Unión Europea y que nos permitiría seguir dentro del euro.
Estas medidas no pretender ser más que un bosquejo de un conjunto más amplio y profundo que debe ser debatido, pero que, a mi modo de ver, es más factible que la propuesta de renta universal básica, causa menos miedo y nos permite seguir en nuestro marco natural europeo.

To expand on that thought: 

&gt; In 1873, there was a huge stock market bubble in Germany, and it blew up. It was called the Founders Crisis. And liberal economic ideas of the type we've been discussing
were completely discredited.

&gt; At this point in time, there was a guy called Liszt who comes along and says, you know, the funny thing about the Brits telling us all the story about how to get rich, if they had actually done that themselves-- you know what their comparative advantage was in? Wool. They would still be making blankets for the people in Flanders.

&gt; How come they're running the world? How come they have the biggest navy in the world? How come they make steel when they basically have no iron ore? What the hell is that all about? So he rewrote how you think about international trade. 

&gt; And at the same time that he did this, he, and also the Bismarck who was running the place did what was called the marriage or iron and rye, bringing together the industrialists in the south, the agrarians in the north. You use the surplus from agriculture to basically buy flattened equipment. You bring it in, you reverse engineer it, you do it faster, you do it faster, you build up German industrial capitalism. Big firms, big banks, forced saving, a big role for the state.

&gt; And it's all driven by exports. There's your difference. But when you're exporting and your sources of demand lie outside your economy, you don't have to worry about
internal demand. The Keynesian story makes no sense if you're Germany. Why would you want to stabilize consumption if you're export dependent? Because all you're going to do is raise your wages and prices, and your BMW is going to go from 50,000 to 100,000 real fast, and you're not going to sell them. So if you don't rely on domestic consumption and rely on external consumption, the dynamics of your economy are completely different.

&gt; What do you care about price control? All this stuff about the neuralgia of the 1920s and the inflation experience, this is a post-war construction. It's really about remaining price competitive in export markets.

&gt; So you need a strong, independent central bank. What else do you care about? Very important: competition. You want to have competition over products, so that you have BMW and Audi competing with each other so they can sell more to the Chinese both because they're competing against product quality. You don't get involved in the Apple, Samsung, buy up patents and sue each other in court crap. You do real competition to get real value out at the end of it.

&gt; Given that the role of the state, these Freiburg liberals-- this is Walter Euken, one of the guys who, post-war, reinvigorates all this stuff. Because after Nazism is is credited, they needed a new thing. And basically it was about the economic constitution, where
competition rather than consumption becomes important, and sound money and central bank independence defines the economy.

&gt; Why is this important? First of all, for 30 years, this is the entire structure of the Euro. If you think about the way the European Union is set up, it's Generalized Ordoliberalism, to give that type of liberalism its name.

Once nationalism and the idea of self-determination spread to the European regions of the empire in the 19th century however, the Ottomans just couldn't provide an adequate answer to it (only in the form of Ottomanism, which to my knowledge was mostly adopted by Muslim Ottomans anyway, and didn't reach out to the religious/ethnic minorities who wanted independence). 

There are many other reasons as to why the Ottoman empire eventually fell.

&gt;

&gt;The Reverend __Thomas Robert Malthus__ [FRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society) (13 February 1766 – 23 December 1834 ) was an English cleric and scholar, influential in the fields of [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy) and [demography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography).  Malthus himself used only his middle name Robert. 

&gt;Malthus became widely known for his theories about change in population. His *[An Essay on the Principle of Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population)* observed that sooner or later population will be checked by [famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine) and [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease), leading to what is known as a [Malthusian catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe). He wrote in opposition to the popular view in 18th-century Europe that saw society as improving and in principle as perfectible.  He thought that the dangers of [population growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth) precluded progress towards a [utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia) society: ""The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man"".  As a cleric, Malthus saw this situation as divinely imposed to teach virtuous behaviour.  Malthus wrote:

&gt;That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,

At any rate, there is the spirit of free speech and then there is the legality, and simply because speech is still legally free does not mean that all are embracing the spirit of free expression when it goes against their own beliefs. So I would say that many redditors, not all mind you, do not embody the spirit of free speech, though prefer to think of themselves as extraordinarily tolerant. 

The legality of free speech is under attack in America though. There is an undercurrent in liberal circles that is attempting to draw a comparison between Constitutional patriotism and insurgent terrorists. People who express these views are increasingly scrutinized by federal agencies who appear to be preparing law enforcement for another civil war. Divisive organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center are hasty to label groups that believe in traditional marriage and oppose wealth redistribution along racial lines as ""hate groups"". This ties into the whole ""hate speech"" nonsense, and is a slow progression toward outlawing some types of free expression.

I have no problem with vehement disagreement, but I find some liberals more willing to go beyond heated conversation and venture into the realm of targeting and ruining people for the opinions they hold.

I think Chinese Indonesian generally integrate better into the country now. Many things have changed since the 98 and things are a lot better for chinese in indonesia as compared to Malaysia, in my opinion. Racists laws were repealed long ago, Chinese New Year became a proper public holiday, a person of Chinese descent is now holding key position in the capital, etc. 

Ask most of the younger Chinese Indonesians you meet in the country, and they'd say they're Indonesian first and Chinese second. One key factor that helps assimilation is the fact that practically all Chinese indonesians are fluent in bahasa Indonesia. I have met many Chinese Malaysians who can barely string a coherent sentence together in bahasa Melayu lol. You must have realised from your own experience in Japan why this is important for assimilation.

Your dad was right. If you'd come to the UK or USA to study your degree, your race won't be much of an issue. The bad news is, because the world's economy is still in deep shit nowadays, it's a lot harder to immigrate to those countries than before. The UK is basically a closed-door for those from outside the EU. H1B is a mess for the US as well. Even for Singapore, it is **a lot** harder to immigrate there now (see this http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2c7r9p/application_for_singapore_citizenship/). You mentioned in your post about working in sg for 2 years, and then citizenship ? Not going to happen. The SG govt were handing out PR like candies before, leading the locals complained a lot about being overrun by foreigners, so they made it a lot harder to get a Singaporean PR and citizenship now. The exact criteria for granting SG PR are purposely left vague, for the govt to exercise discretion and do racial selection of those they want to let into the country (chinese Malaysians are supposedly still favoured though, it's just not as easy as before). So yeah, your best bet if you want to leave Japan and not return to Malaysia is probably to try to find work in sg or do a postgraduate study in the western countries.

Afortunadamente ese negro episodio de nuestra historia, ya pasó hace muchas décadas, y fue un problema social y cultural, no familiar. Por eso haya que erradicarlo de la sociedad, sobre todo, a través de la cultura.
-	Si lo hemos erradicado de las familias, ¿Por qué no luchamos por terminar de erradicarlo de la sociedad con LEYES que castiguen la discriminación en cualquiera de sus manifestaciones en vez de mantenerlas?
-	Y un último ejercicio de imaginación (aunque comprendo que no es lo mismo ser que imaginar), pero si yo fuese mujer, ciudadana de un país como España, miembro de la unión europea, me sentiría ofendida e indignada por escuchar que algún hombre, colectivo de hombres o ley me defendiera. Porque eso es una prueba inequívoca de que en este país a nivel legal y social queda mucho por hacer.

What is the situation today: Catalonia is one of the communities in Spain. At the moment the economic situation in Spain is pretty bad, Catalonia is doing better and also have the highest GDP in Spain. Catalonia also has a really high debt, it needs money to pay that off and doesn't really get help from the government.
The tax system works like this(simplified): All the money goes to the central government, which redistributes it and give it back to the communities of Spain. Catalonia only get 75% of what it is paying as tax. So no surprise they aren't very happy with that. (Like most regions in the world, which pay a lot of money for other places)
So they wanted to renegotiated a maybe even reach a new rule.(for example the basque community always gets 100% of their taxes back) The Catalan government used the threat of a referendum about independence  to make some pressure. The central government didn't care to much and now there will be a kind of a referendum/poll thingy.

That is just the economic part. There is also quite a long of history of Catalonia being focused to become more independent from Madrid since centuries. It has a culture, history and language  which is different to the rest of Spain and a strong cultural identity.

I agree that refers to thing that are not merely social in nature. It is very much used to divide people based on inherited traits. However, all models are man-made, and as such constructs of the society they were devised in. That doesn't make them purely a social construct, but if the model is so poor that it doesn't match any underlying physical delimitations, then they're not *much more than* social constructs. Races misses that by virtue of being mostly designed based on visual characteristics, so there will be some correlation.

EDIT: For the ""Barbarian Migration"" event, you also need Military Tech 15- I found that out the hard way when it was 420 AD and I still hadn't gotten the decision, upon checking the event files I found out why- I was only lvl 13 lol

Second, there is an event called ""Barbarian Migration"" that will trigger sometime around 395. During this event, any Barbarian tribes that border Rome get a decision that brings them into war against Rome, gives Rome a huge penalty when fighting Barbarians, and lets you take and auto-core a Roman province after holding it for 6 months, without spending any MP, gaining any AE, or ending the war. Declining the decision causes you to lose prestige. This basically causes a massive land-grab as all the barbarian tribes eat up the Roman Empire's territory. The ""Barbarian Migration"" event happens to the entire Roman Empire if they don't split, but happens only to the Western Roman Empire if the original empire does split, IIRC.  

In my first Extended Timeline game ever as the Picts, I had control of the British Isles but nothing else when the migration event triggered, and was still able to take part- but since you control territory in mainland Europe anyway, that wouldn't be a concern to you.... Just some info for anyone else playing this mod as a nation in the British Isles.  

I agree with you about the later start dates, it's just not fun when all the tech and ideas are already chosen. I even tried starting as Canada in 1867 and the ideas are still maxed out... There is definitely a lot of sitting around doing nothing with an early start date as well (my Saxony game in the screenshot was started in 58 AD), but at least it's still fun because of all the different choices you have.

It's not that I don't recognize there are problems with specifically Muslim minorities in Europe.  I just find your reasoning (and the guy you replied to) to be faulty as you assert your former logic to be true based on personal experiences of which I can already see one significant point of bias.

Of course, the your assertions against the Koran itself is also...fallible.  You'll note most religions provide justification for wars solely based on having a different religion.  In that respect, Islam is not unique.

You're probably going to retort something along the lines of - other religions that do that (say, Christianity) have gone through reformations and no longer advocate violence.  Well, there are a few examples that I can use to disprove this.

Exhibit A - the Lord's Resistance Army (led by the famous Joseph Kony) is a fundamentalist Christian militia group.  One that can pretty much called a terrorist group.

Exhibit B - Only the Catholic church is able to speak for all of its members.  For protestants, they can vary from small to large groups.  Islam is a bit like the protestant structure in this regard.  There isn't really a caliph that can speak for every Muslim.  Ergo, there are no ""official"" spokespersons for Islam.  You can't point to an extremist imam and say this one speaks for them all.  He only speaks for his specific group.

Exhibit C - The majority religion in Sri Lanka is Buddhism, and Buddhist religious leaders have used this identity to persecute Christians and Muslims.

It seems to me being Muslim is not a prerequisite to committing violence in the name of your religion.  It looks like actually the prerequisite that is common between these various conflicts is politics disguised as religion.",t1_cjdw0wj,t5_2qh13,,2,2,0,1435014019,False,0,,True,,t3_2cb7d2,t1_cjdvmmp,i_already_forgot

Sometimes, patents are involved.  Creativity is a constant theme in what I do, both in tech and in art.   Mostly, I solve problems of one sort or another and aim to do it within economic constraints and schedules.  

I have done a pile of off-the-clock work. 

A few things I am working on now merit patent protection. The vast majority of what I've done is not patented, though not all.  It's expensive to my target client base.   The stuff I am working on now involves superior analysis of the needs I am addressing, and the tech is simple, but not obvious unless you are confronting a specific problem set, which is what invention does.  It's the search for ""hey, that's a feature, not a bug"".  (This talent was responsible for my most successful invention, completely unpatented, but which spawned a company that would be able to patent everything it did from there on out. )  Patents are over-rated.   Marketing is underrated.  The former usually has nothing to do with commercial success, and the latter always does, in my experience. 

I used to say ""It doesn't matter what you design, but design. Solve a problem.""  My father in law had a dozen US patents and at the time, scores of international patents (many they same as the US but at least in the old days, you had to apply in different countries, too.  Before the EU.)    I hung around him for 30+ years.  Rubs off.

I've posted about my experience with 'Finland and alcohol' before on [comment thread #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2aesi3/how_do_breweries_wineyards_in_sweden_deal_with/ciucm7x) and [comment thread #2](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/280hss/question_for_scandinavians_of_this_subreddit_what/ci6e0g8?context=3) in /r/Europe.

I've seen a number of news pieces on the government 'wanting to change the alcohol culture in Finland to be more like European alcohol culture'. I think structural changes to how alcohol is accessed is key to the way to achieve these desired ends. 

I was born and raised in Portland, OR, USA, the 'unofficial beer capital of the USA', where there are more small micro-breweries per-capita than anywhere else in the U.S. (at least when I left for Finland). You could go into the microbrewery, after 9 pm, and take home a [growler, commonly around 1.8L](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_bottle#Growler) of beer home without question. You can go into supermarkets after 9pm to buy beer. There are no restrictions on the percentage of alcohol of beer sold in stores! For example, on my 21st birthday (date of legal drinking age in US), I went to the supermarket at 2 am and picked up a 6 pack of microbrewed beers!

The issue of alcohol taxation is relevant, but in my opinion, a separate matter than how Finns fundamentally access alcohol and thus alcohol culture. 

Maybe start by doing reforms (like many US states have) on the basis of the volume of alcohol brewed/sold each year, to support the small microbreweries, and maybe then policy makers would get their desired 'European drinking culture'.

I have a UK degree which means I just studied psych, not as a small course. Most publishing Phds's will tell you that IQ has a significant heritable portion, which in adults is about 70%. If you want I can direct you to a very famous letter signed by a few dozen phd's that states this.

I can tell you that using wiki as a reference in college will get you laughed at. Feel free to use it to locate links to the papers in the reference section, but any old muppet can and does mess with the main page and you can't trust it.

&gt; The reaso heritabilty goes up with age is due to how you were raised and heritability fluctuates as age moves up.

Yes... once you leave your childhood environment your genetics takes over.
I'm not sure what point you are trying to make. Kids from a crapy environment show more environmental effect ( as I'm well aware as I had a truly crappy chilhood and didn't do well at school). But once adults they spring back as they get control of their environment. However, the crapy childhood will have a major effect on life outcome as it will botch you education up a treat. I went to college in my forties as a result of mine.

I think one of the main issue is that people who don't specialise in the field assume environment mainly means things like'did you go to a good school' or did 'daddy take you to museums'. The real factors that will really depress IQ are much harsher. IN utero environment is a key factor (twins IQ's are about 5 points lower on average). Thing like did your mother drink when pregnant, smoke, take illegal drugs, was she malnourished? Then thing like childhood nutrition to make sure the brain develops correctly, and exposure to social interaction and mental stimulation. Did you have a head injury or major illness that affected your growth?

Most of us don't have any serious long term effect from environmental factors. At least not in Europe where our medical, social and education is much better at providing a level start.

However, IQ is not educational level. I measured high at eighteen when I'd left school as a qualification free teen, and it's not diffferent as a post grad.

It was originally sung in the huge cathedrals of Europe. It started out as just everyone singing one line in unison (kind of like the halo theme) as a way to make church better. Then they figured out that multiple lines being sung together sounded even better. We can trace all of modern music back to this Gregorian Chant.

I think its super cool that something would be written in this old style (presumably to add some old ancient feeling to halo) and then would be sung in places that had lots of reverberation because it sounds cool - when that kind of music started off in those high reverb places because it sounded cool.",t1_cjdwapk,t5_2qh1e,,1,1,0,1435014184,False,0,,True,,t3_2catsx,t3_2catsx,ghrey_ink

I study law in germany and I came to similiar conclusions on the topics, but one question that I am not really sure about is this:

Does EU-Law even apply here? Couldn't the contract just be interpreted as an agreement that every conflict that arises from it should be treated under US-Law? And we all know that US-Law is extremly underdeveloped when it comes to the protection of the customer who signed a contract.

Their logic is ""you signed it, deal with it"", which makes it really hard to do anything under US-Law.

&gt; if you build in the mountains and specifically in wild fire prone areas it should not be the responsibility of the tax payers to come in and save your home.

*Absolutely this.* It's so important for people to understand, and they just don't get it. There are no natural disasters, only human belligerence followed by predictable downfall. If you build your house on a floodplain, your house will be washed away with seasonal flooding. If you try to stop the flooding with a dam, you will lose soil fertility, destroy a major part of the river, disrupt migration patters, cause extinctions of aquatic species including fish and water birds, and probably destroy a major valley. If you build your house on a coastal floodplain, like Florida, you're going to have to swim away when the sea level changes. If you cut down all the trees and build your house on top of a mound of loose soil, like they do in southern California with multimillion dollar homes, then your house is going to fall down the hill like Humpty Dumpty and you should plan your life accordingly.

Wildfires are not a disaster, and in ""real life"" they are not a problem - they are Mother Nature's seasonal way of removing debris from the forest floor and returning nutrients to the soil that would otherwise take decades from ordinary decomposition. Fires benefit ecosystems in many ways; for instance, they open clearings in the forest for sunlight to reach the forest floor, which provides habitat for small wildflowers and grasses on which many animals (including, ultimately, humans) depend.

We know where wildfires happen. We know why wildfires happen. Building homes on fire plains is irresponsible and foolhardy, at best. Destroying a section of forest to protect your house from fire is, as you say, not only destructive, but ineffective. If an insurance company will raise my premium for smoking cigarettes and driving a red car, they sure as hell should know to tax the hell out of people who use resources to build permanent homes in the middle of fire plains.

In Florida - as I'm sure in Colorado and Washington - our forests and ecosystems are adapted to fire, and to some degree dependent on fire. Our native pine trees, *pinus eliottii,* are fire resistant.

When the fires come - as they do each year in dry season - and do their productive job, we sure as hell **should not** send our firefighters to die in there. What a waste of human life. If you bought a house in the path of a wildfire, take your pets, children, and valuables, and get as far away as you can, as quickly as possible. Don't risk other peoples' lives because of your desire to outsmart nature.

Is it that we have built up so many places in the United States that we are now forced to build our houses on fire plains, floodplains, tornado touchdown spots, and deforested mudhills? Then *we are overpopulated.* We're used to the idea that India and China are overpopulated, but too many people on Reddit sit at their computers and say ""Oh, the US is not overpopulated, we have plenty of *space,* we're actually underpopulated because we have to throw more human labor at our dying economy,"" but when you look at things on the ground level, it is very obvious.

The people who lived here before the European invasions knew how to handle their shit. They built mounds on floodplains, such as along the Mississippi River where contemporary houses get washed away every few years or so. Many peoples knew better than to build permanent homes, as being sedentary leads to land degradation, depression, and pathologic behavior, and carried their entire villages with them on seasonal rounds, letting the Earth do her work without trying to fuck shit up.",t1_cjdwj8y,t5_2qkib,,4,4,0,1435014279,False,0,,True,,t3_2c8qbz,t3_2c8qbz,platypocalypse

Some people are even bothered by it: everyone around you is a little drunk, having fun etc, and you are the one that does not find their jokes funny (because they just aren't when you're sober) - to the point it even causes agression.

Que a los trabajadores españoles hay que dárselo todo hecho. Y ten en cuenta que los mismos problemas que tienen hoy en día los partidos políticos y los sindicatos los puede tener Podemos y su hipotético sindicato mañana. Tenemos que reconocer que hay miles de sindicalistas que desarrollan su labor honradamente y en muchas ocasiones jugándose el despido o la cárcel como estamos viendo últimamente. También tienen que aguantar el comportamiento de trabajadores egoístas e insolidarios que tienen un comportamiento esquirol y luego se benefician de los logros que sus compañeros han conseguido con su sacrificio económico. Los mismos que les critican y les jalean por no hacer nada. No tengamos la lengua rápida para criticar al conjunto del sindicalismo por el comportamiento de unos pocos. Son la única línea de defensa de los trabajadores. Y no olvidemos nunca que los sindicatos son el fiel reflejo de los trabajadores a los que representan, el espejo de la verdad, aunque joda. Corruptos, poltroneros y sinvergüenzas los hay en todas las organizaciones y “Podemos” si no los tiene los tendrá. En cuanto a la financiación, ¿acaso ponemos en duda la financiación por parte del estado de ongs de ayuda a los desfavorecidos?

Lo que se hace necesario es fijar una cuota anual en base a la cantidad de afiliados y fiscalizada completamente por organismos independientes de la política, para evitar la injerencia del gobierno de turno. Tal vez el mayor problema sea que el nivel de podredumbre del sistema es tan alto que quizá no exista ningún organismo fiscalizador libre de sospecha. En ese caso el problema no es la financiación de los sindicatos sino la corrupción del propio sistema.

Turns out the white slavers never castrated their slaves. Almost all slaves taken by the Muslims had their balls chopped off, and the women taken as sex slaves. That's why there are blacks in the west, at the very least they were permitted to have children. The Europeans were also the first humans to ban slavery in any lasting way and enforced abolition on groups that chose to continue slavery such as the African kingdoms, the parts of the Muslim world they could impose authority on, the Chinese Empire, and the Indian kingdoms, which would not have prohibited slavery if the Europeans hadn't ordered them to stop.

False,0,cjdwz6c,gaming,1406898238,,"Heh, yeah. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I just can't think very highly of people who play Smash Bros ""pro"" style aka, competitively.

To summarize the rather long conversation that was had roughly a year ago on this topic. My problem stems from the fact that I have played with groups spread across the country and even a few in Europe. In EVERY group I've played in that had someone who plays Smash Bros ""pro"" or competitively they ABSOLUTELY insist that the game be played their way every time. No items, blah blah, you know the list.

Now, I agree with the usual response to this that Smash Bros is designed to be played the way people want to play it. The problem is that these people REFUSE to play it any other way ""because it's not fun."". And sure, I can concede that it may not be fun for them to play actual smash bros, and I will even join that style now and then. But the problem is that they will absolutely not play unless the game is rigged for ""pro"" style. Either they immediately pass the controller and sit there sulking while making comments of ""hah, that's stupid that wouldn't happen if you were playing pro."", or they do some other childish thing like just immediately suicide their lives away ""it's not like the match mattered, it wasn't pro."" just to make the game go faster. I was even invited over to someones place in LA once and things were going great for a bit until one of their friends wanted to play pro. We did it a few times then wanted to switch back and he didn't want to. We explained that we enjoy the other one more and we'd be willing to alternate back, but basically he threatened to leave the convention and head back to his home town if we didn't keep playing pro, awkwardly forcing us to play that way until we found something else to do.

And this is one of the core aspects of why I cannot think very well of people who play ""pro"". Every single ""pro"" player I have personally run into does stuff like this. They emotionally and/or physically (I'll take my games and go home) blackmail their group into playing their way and their way alone, even citing ""But Smash Bros is meant to be played any way you have fun!"" as the reason why we should play their way. But they refuse to let that reason apply to why they should play actual Smash Bros. They also tend to be HIGHLY derisive of non-'pro' players. When they win, smirking and saying stuff like ""Imagine how much harder I would have killed you if I was in my prime pro training!"" or if they lose shaking their head indulgently at you with a smirk saying ""It's been too long since I played pro, you wouldn't have a chance if I was up at my prime.""

Now I will make another point that had to be made in the other one. I am willing to believe that in the world there ARE ""pro"" competitive Smash Bros players that are cool and awesome and willing to play actual Smash Bros without forcing ""pro"" mode on them. But I have YET to see one in person.

Now, I do agree that ""pro"" competitive mode has its place...in competitions and competitions alone. And even then, I think it is perfectly valid to have a competition based around actual Smash Bros instead of ""pro"" mode. Unless training for a competition done in ""pro"" mode, I take very little enjoyment playing that mode and the general populace that I have played with seems to be of that opinion. We are playing for fun, not for prize money or anything, why should we remove all the fun stuff from the game?

I'll also drop one of the other negative vote bombs I usually have in this. I was HEAVILY in favor of Nintendo when they added tripping mechanics and the like to Smash Bros specifically to try and prevent the game from being played ""pro"" or competitive style. I actually cheered for a moment when I found out that was why they did it. And I weep for their weakness in giving in and not continuing this. Not because I don't think 'pro' mode has its place, I already discussed that. But because I know from experience that all over the country (and my limited data points suggest Europe/the world) that there are gamer groups being forced to endure a mode they do not enjoy because someone in the group wants to seem superior and play ""pro"".

This has been a PSA by Mazon_Del, ""Stop the senseless 'pro'-ing, just have fun.""

tldr: Every 'pro' player I have met in person forces everybody to play their way all the time. Not trying anything new isn't fun. I like the tripping mechanic.

I'm not going to deny the fact that Walcott, Bale, Shaw and many others have gone on to have great success with so-called ""bigger clubs"", but would is there really any legitimacy to claiming they have ""a worldwide reputation"" for producing young players and that they are producing ""the best players in the world"".

False,0,cjdxgph,AskHistorians,1406899581,,"Bryan Ward-Perkins looked purely at the archaeological evidence in the West and concluded that for the entire population, their standards of living dropped. Tiled roofs and wheel-made pottery, goods that can apparently be found even in the poorest village, disappeared with the collapse of centralised government. Romans were used to having goods from across the empire within easy reach, goods that were available even for the poorest villager, since cheap affordable pottery was worth transporting in bulk for the seller. What long-distance trade that remained was only for luxury goods, so only the elites benefited from trade, but even their purchasing power was declining. This can be seen in the number of African Red Slip ware (a high-quality kind of pottery considered a luxury) found in Rome, which nosedived in the mid-sixth century, but continued in Marseilles and Barcelona, two cities that still had a wealthy elite and a decent infrastructure in place to support them. Rome, whilst it still had a wealthy elite (mostly clergy), was no longer politically important and the Church used its own resources to feed the population from its estates, primarily in Sicily. Ravenna on the other hand was still politically relevant, and so we can still find plenty of African Red Slip ware there. According to Chris Wickham, the elites recognised their declining economic power, as he saw the increasingly shrill legislation of Visigothic kings in the seventh century as attempts to shore up their control of society, as economically they were no longer overwhelmingly wealthier than their peasants. And as you said, Western cities declined in size - since they were the centres of exchange, it became increasingly difficult to import luxury goods, even in Marseilles/Barcelona, as the cities they traded with were now smaller and less capable of meeting/supplying demand.

I guess what I'm trying to say here is that the state and the economy went hand-in-hand in the fifth/sixth century. The Roman Empire was a huge engine of growth and the state was a fundamental part of the economy. Without the army providing a steady demand, without the grain fleets from Africa providing cheap transportation for other trade-goods, without the regular minting of gold coins to facilitate the exchange of luxury goods, trading networks began to breakdown. Whilst the wealthy aristocracies mostly stayed in power and kept their wealth, it became difficult to keep sourcing the same goods as before. Local, often hand-made, pottery began to dominate archaeological sites, rather than goods imported from elsewhere. Even in wealthy regions, such as North Africa, the long-standing economic structures that sustained trade, such as the massive pottery production centres near Carthage and the tax system, declined partly out of neglect by Vandal rulers, but also partly due to the lack of demand - there was no longer a certain market for them in Rome. 

Ward-Perkins was basically writing a polemical book against the 'rosy' view of Late Antiquity and I actually disagree with him on the speed of economic decline, but the evidence he cited is pretty solid and is confirmed by Chris Wickham's analysis of the Early Medieval economy across Europe. It wasn't a uniform process, since the introduction of local, less-well made goods occurred at different times, even in roughly the same region. Spain is a good example - coastal areas, particularly the Byzantine-controlled part, fared reasonably well, whilst the inland plains collapsed almost immediately after the end of Roman dominance. But at best, the wealthier regions were only coping, rather than thriving. Trade continued, but it was regional and driven by elite-demand, rather than state-demand, causing a gradual decline of living standards until it picked up again in the late seventh century (with all the caveats about regional variation etc).

Adult Careers: Does Childhood IQ Predict Later Life Outcome

Abstract
The author's plenary address at the 3rd International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual Disabilities-Europe Conference in Rome, Italy (October 2010), provided a retrospective overview of a longitudinal study conducted with a cohort of pre-teens (11 and 13 years of age) residing in Warsaw, Poland, in the 1970s. The intent was to examine, over an extended period of years, the relationship between social origin and measured intelligence (IQ), the role that IQ and other psycho-social factors play as predictors of social and economic status in adulthood, and the stability of IQ. The question posed by the “Warsaw Studies” was whether, given the virtual absence of educational, health service, and community distinctions (Warsaw in the 1970s was an ideal laboratory for such a sociological undertaking), would Warsaw schoolchildren still show the usual association between parental occupation and offspring intellectual functioning? The results from a series of follow-up studies indicate that the IQ score at age 13 could be viewed as a relatively good indicator for future life outcomes, defined in terms of attained education, occupational status, and material well being. Dramatic differences in this attainment between the groups of respondents with high and low IQ scores attest to this conclusion. Smaller, yet still significant, differences between talented teenagers and their counterparts from the two control groups who apparently did not have the high IQ advantage also support the thesis that IQ matters much for life success. The findings of the “Warsaw Studies” have implications for the life course and economic conditions of children with intellectual disabilities from disadvantaged backgrounds

Genetic conditions known to affect IQ negatively:

Retts syndrome
Downs syndrome
Fragile X syndrome
....basically you get the idea here.

genetic conditions that known to have a relation to raised IQ.

Myopia (7 points, v/s)
Torsion dystonia (10 points)
Also, some aspergers traits have a relation to increases VS ability.

Also, MRI shows correlation between brain size and IQ .

cogprints.org/1369/3/IQTAN2.pdf 

The relation of IQ (Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test) to brain size was studied in 103 right- and left-handed men and women at Atatürk University in eastern Turkey. Cerebral areas were measured on a midsagittal section of the brain using MRI. An overall correlation of 40 was found between MRI-measured total area and IQ thereby further supporting the IQ–brain size hypothesis. Additional analyses suggested that these results may need qualification. In men, only anterior cerebral area correlated with IQ. In women, total and posterior cerebral areas were correlated with IQ. Other results varied by handedness",t1_cjdxlce,t5_2szyo,,1,1,0,1435014764,1406901093,0,,True,,t3_2c5036,t1_cjc9ibb,jackrabbitfat

1) Antes de 74 ""as famílias eram muito mais pobres"" mas tinham ""famílias numerosas"". Agora o estado ""força as pessoas a pagarem uma quantidade de impostos enorme que as deixa sem dinheiro para criar uma criança"". Então mas se as famílias eram muito mais pobres (mesmo, presumo, contando com o efeito dos impostos) como é que agora é que não têm dinheiro para criar uma criança e antigamente tinham uma catrefada de filhos?

2) Parece que agora nas famílias ""não ha especialização"" e homem e mulher desempenham ""as mesmas funções"". Estamos a falar de quê? Dessa pouca-vergonha (ironia) de a mulher trabalhar? Dessa ignonímia (outra ironia) de o homem lavar a loiça e dar banho aos filhos? E o que é que a alegada falta de especialização e desempenho de iguais funções tem a ver com o divórcio?

3) Parece que ""a segurança social reduziu o incentivo para as famílias teremm filhos"". Estamos a falar da mesma segurança social que reserva uma fatia razoável (que, admito, se calhar devia ser bem maior) do seu orçamento para apoiar precisamente quem tem filhos?

4) Então, qual é o caminho para inverter o rumo? Aparentemente, a educação das crianças ""segundo valores cristãos e conservadores"". Eu olho para as taxas de fertilidade de 2014 na Europa, cruzo-as com as estatísticas sobre afiliação religiosa e descubro que, dos países europeus com fertilidade igual ou maior que a portuguesa só três (Islândia, Moldávia e Malta) têm maior percentagem de cristãos que Portugal. E que entre os países com melhor fertilidade que a nossa contam-se a França e a Suécia, com quase 30% de ateus, o Reino Unido, com cerca de 20%, e a Bélgica e o Luxemburgo, com cerca de 25%. E que dizer da Holanda, onde quase **metade** da população não é religiosa de todo? Qualquer destes países tem uma fertilidade substancialmente superior à portuguesa. Não consegui validar o ponto dos valores ""conservadores"", mas quanto aos valores ""cristãos"" estamos conversados.

If this draws a significant amount of money I'm worried the league will go for the ""sure thing"" instead of developing the youth and gambling on new players.

Just because Ronaldinho and Lampard make big headlines when they sign, it doesn't mean they're the only thing going on in the league. The perception of MLS as a 'retirement league' is built on confirmation bias - when teams use their DP slots on guys who aren't big names but will provide a competitive boost, it doesn't make the headlines. The Union just added a 28 year old goalkeeper who started every game for a team that advanced to the knockout stage of the World Cup, San Jose just signed an Argentinean attacking midfielder who was a consistent starter in the Argentine league, and Portland brought in a centerback on a DP deal last month who regularly played for a midtable-to-lower end EPL side over the past several years. This after Portland has already filled two DP slots on Diego Valeri (who has been one of the MLS' best attacking midfielders since joining last year) and Fanendo Adi, a 23 year old striker they signed from Copenhagen. 

None of them are big names, but they're solid players, and that's sort of the point. But no one covers that while Lampard and Ronaldinho get all the headlines, and it feeds the perception that the only thing the MLS is interested in doing is recruiting European stars after they're well past their prime, despite the fact that they're only a small part of the overall story in the MLS.

Cultures are about continuity. Because you want to preserve a culture doesnt mean you want it stay stale.
Cultures are what connects the past with the present and the future. It is a stream of achievements, ideals and intentions that are constantly influencing each other.
They are the sum of the Historical inheritance of a people. 

You are correct, cultural preservation in most cases does not actually require you to do anything about it, it mostly is about keep doing what you do.
However when outside forces attempt to intervene you need to retaliate.

Im going to give you an example of language. The EU is big into standardization when it comes to food. 
What this does not include however is that ""German"" is a pretty big language that is fundamentally different in the different regions it is spoken.
The names of all Vegetables that were sold in stores were to be Standardized to essentialy what is Standard German in Germany, these words however are not used in Austrian or bavarian german *at all*, thus an intervention was required and it did indeed stop it.

The other part is availability.
Ive talked about the Perchtenlauf which is a pretty big cultural event here.
Beeing important to people is one thing, but a big part of it is beeing able to get it to the people. Thus the cities need to acknowledge and allow it so it can happen safeley and without causing damage to the infrastructure as this is a pretty big commotion that involves large ammounts of beer and drunk youths.

In my country, this is put forth and streets get locked down by the police to allow this to continue.
If this would not be the case it would probably end up with a couple of arrests and damage done because of a lack of understanding.

False,0,cjdy6d4,femalefashionadvice,1406901376,,"Thank you for your reply. I respectfully disagree, but definitely see where you are coming from. A lot of bohemian fashion of the 60s borrowed elements from India because a lot of philosophy and religious tradition was filtering through as well - many people reading the Bhagavad Gita, going to learn to meditate with a guru and coming back with a Sanskrit name, etc. I don't think this was done in a colonialist spirit of appropriation but with a genuine disgust with Western culture and desire to learn more and attain enlightenment. Of course, that's just my perspective, it probably felt a lot different for Indians to see a bunch of white hippies hanging around and seemingly playing at being Indian in some strange way.

I also don't think the ""exoticism"" is all tokenized other cultures, either. Much of it is intra-cultural and comes from within Europe. Emulating ancient Greek and Roman dress, medieval dress, romantic and Arthurian fairy tales and such, other time periods whether real or fictionalized. Then you have for example [Erykah Badu](http://imgur.com/vxxJd9A) who has a really bohemian spirit and appearance IMO when she rocks this sort of look, but in her case it is all inspired by her African-American and west African roots, not by Europe at all. And I don't have pics, but I have certainly known a few Indian-Americans who were very much bohemian/hippies in their lifestyle and did a combination of euro-bohemian and Indian-inspired bohemian style in their appearance... Which reflects what was natural and authentic for them.

I hope this helps a bit. ""Bohemian"" is a European word and you may want a different word with different connotations to feel comfortable with it.

I think, that with time, technology will be able to compliment this demographic situation not just in Japan but in Europe as well.

As for Africa and the Middle East/South Asia, these regions have been degrading quickly in the past decades due to the rise of radical islam, proxy wars of the NATO and Russia and the Israel-Palestine conflict. In the 70s, many middle eastern countries were much more socially progressive and prosperous, and by today many of them is in ruins because of wars, and kicked back into the middle ages culturally because of radical islam.

Q. Which brand of condom is the SAFEST and least likely to break? Do condoms break? Why?


All condoms sold in the EU/US (and other developed countries) have to undergo normalised testing during manufacture (as dictated by the ISO and other regulations, which also dictate what sizes/thickness they can be).
So if you're buying condoms that are legally available (inc. free) in your country, you can rest assured they have been tested to a high standard and will be safe to use.

False,0,cjdyxg8,funny,1406903082,,"I'll give another version. The Arab world has been attacking Israel since it came into existence in 1948. In fact, as soon as it was declared a country it was attacked by all sides. At that time, West Bank and Gaza weren't controlled by Israel; they were under Egyptian and Jordanian control, and they treated the Palestinians at least as badly as they are treated currently, if not worse. They also didn't recognize the Palestinians as a nation at all.

In 1967, Israel's neighbours once again attacked it, only this time Israel took those lands. Immediately, its enemies called on it to return the land it had just won in a war it didn't start (try to remember the last time you heard of that happening.) All of a sudden, the PLO popped up, declaring Palestinian nationalhood and demanding lands for the Palestinian people.

Since then, there has been an ongoing dispute about who these lands should be controlled by. Meantime, within the Palestinian people, there are many different factions who have different solutions for the problem. Unfortunately, in 2006 (right after Israel withdrew from Gaza, incidentally) The Palestinians there elected Hamas to lead them. Hamas is a terrorist organization (declared so by Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union, Jordan, Egypt and Japan) and it's in their charter to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. They've repeatedly used suicide bombing as a tactic to achieve their goals, and used human shields like schools and hospitals to fire rockets from. That's Israel's real enemy.

Israel drops pamphlets, makes warning phone calls, and fires warning shots before a bombing. Yes, they make mistakes, yes, civilians die and it's tragic. But they operate with a completely different set of rules than the group they're fighting, and that puts them at a distinct disadvantage.

Israel is a tiny state in the region. They're far from perfect, but anyone that calls them awful hasn't looked at literally every other country involved in an armed conflict around the world. I do believe many Palestinians want a two state solution, and if that would end the fighting I'd back it 100%. But at least for now, the group they put in charge isn't interested.

Sometimes it can be even worse, with things selling for the same number of £/€ as $ (eg something that's $300 will be £300).

Let's start with physicians per 1,000 people
http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/health_workforce/PhysiciansDensity_Total/atlas.html

Guinea has something like 0.1 per 1,000. Liberia ten times less - 0.01. Liberia is struggling at the moment. Guinea seems to be maintaining at least, some sort of stability.

The USA has 2.5 per 1,000. Still low, by world standards (some EU countries have 5 or 6) but it's *25 times as many* as the country that's just coping, and 250 times as many than the country that's not doing too well. And these will be doctors with more training with better equipment and improved access to drugs. Don't bother worrying about ""Oh, what about Obama destroying the health system"" or whatever. Even our current health services, with their various crises, are miles ahead of what the currently affected countries can conjure up.

So there's that.

Secondly, SARS! Not the cheeriest of things to think about, granted, but the western world coped okay with that. A similarly horrific mortality rate (what's the difference between 10% and 60% really?) and spread more easily than Ebola. We coped with that (although yeah, it was terrifying)

(2.5 Lassa fever. More diseases to worry about! Or not. Lassa is a similar virus to Ebola in that it causes similar symptoms, albeit with a lower mortality rate, and is transmissible in the same way. West Africa is ravaged by it. Something like 100,000+ cases per year - numbers uncertain - but even then the developed world has only seen a few cases of it arriving by plane, and a grand total of zero of them resulted in onward infection. Not to say that Ebola will behave in exactly the same way, but I think it's a valuable lesson to learn that something behaving one way in Africa will *not* behave the same way in another setting)

Third - money. We have lots of money. And it is in *everyone's* interest to see that this problem gets solved. Rich or poor, there is no divide in this issue. Money and resources will be piled on top of this thing until it's finished.

Fourth - funerals. In the affected region, they have funeral practices which involve hand washing the dead and having close contact with them. This has been a major driving force in the spread. That just wouldn't happen in developed nations. Ok, well, maybe a bit, but to nowhere near the same extent

Fifth - education. There is simply a massive lack in education over there. This is hindering the process enormously. The simple instructions of ""Go to the doctor, you will have more chance of living and less chance of killing your family because this is a *virus*, not a *curse put upon you by a snake in a box*"" just aren't getting through.

Sixth - it's not as contagious as you think it is. I mean, it is still horribly contagious. The numbers alone tell you that. But it's not so contagious that people are passing it around in the same way that the flu gets passed around. This is a virus that destroys families and close communities in a very predictable way, not entire populations.

Seventh - cities aren't as big a deal as you think they might be. Because it requires such close contact with ill people, it's not the sort of virus that, like the flu, explodes outwards exponentially once it hits a city. Current figures are showing no real significant difference in rates of infection in cities compared to remote rural areas. If anything, infection rates in cities (per unit of population) are much lower, possibly due to improved education, access to healthcare and easier tracking of contacts.

So if it did ever land on our shores, there are a multitude of reasons why it would never reach the horrific proportions it has over there.

*But*, take note, this is not to say that a few cases might not turn up, and a few secondary infections. For myself, and I imagine others like you, this would be a time of great panic and a good time to reflect on the most significant aspect of this whole situation:

*The virus will never do as much damage to you as the fear of the virus itself can.*

Try not to panic about it, easier said than done though. Avoid reading the news wherever possible. Remember to eat healthy, take exercise and think about practicing breathing exercises or do yoga or something.

Theories within CMC come at the medium from a lot of different angles. 

**Media richness.** This is one of the first theories surrounding CMC that came out of the organizational communication literature. The main thrust is that all communication media, electronic or otherwise, have four major capacities to varying degrees:

Capacity to transmit non-verbal cues (Inflection, facial expression, gestures, etc.)

Capacity for immediate feedback through the same medium

Capacity for personalization (i.e. adapting message to a specific target)

Capacity for natural language (i.e. communicating through a human language as opposed to a machine/mathematical language)

An example of a medium very low in all of these would be an all-numeric spreadsheet; the medium highest in all of these is widely considered face-to-face communication.

Media richness theory says that, when communicators have an equivocal message task (a task where information can be interpreted differently or given different importance by different people, and where there is usually not an objectively correct answer), that richer media will allow that task to be accomplished more efficiently (in less time) than less rich media. A common example is making a hiring decision from among several qualified candidates: some of the people involved in the decision may value education, some may value experience, etc. 

When the task is not equivocal (such as a SAT-style math problem that has a single objectively correct answer) media richness matters less for efficiency.

This theory isn't used quite as much these days, largely because researchers believe that people have created ways of circumventing the restrictions of text-only communication online as we have, as a whole, gained more experience with its use.

Testing some of this theory's propositions with a tech-savvy undergraduate population was my master's thesis. Conclusion: It was a great theory in the 1980s and it serves as a useful foundation for talking about media, but its predictions re: equivocal message tasks don't really hold these days.

Daft, R. L., Lengel, R. H., &amp; Trevino, L. K. (1987). Message equivocality, media selection, and manager performance: Implications for information systems. MIS quarterly, 355-366.

**Social identity deindividuation**. This is the idea that group identity can supercede the individual identities of its members, and that this is particuarly likely in online environments where we have far fewer cues about individual identity (no real names or faces, etc.) This generally causes considerable in group favoritism and out-group derogation. I'd say it's the closest real academic theory to the ""Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory"" from a Penny Arcade comic strip.

Reicher, S. D., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. European review of social psychology, 6(1), 161-198.

**Computers as social actors.** The idea that humans now, in some cases, interact with computers much as they would interact with another human being... in some cases ascribing human qualities to computers and the programs that govern their communication. This is a new area (and is one that has clear applications for gaming.)

No, I'm saying it's only reported in Russia, China, India, when it's beneficial to the government- which is FAR WORSE.

Russia will lose any economic war against Europe 5x over.  Get on board and read some up on it.

China and india have literally a billion people who who have no internet.  China especially, tells it's citizens what it wants them to know.  I don't really consider them ""Well informed"" and ""Speaking for them"".  I know you think Democracy is a crock of shit, but the rest of the world doesn't.

WHY DO YOU NEED TO USE CAPS?  I'M NOT EXPECTING THEM TO PRINT PUTIN KILLED MY BABY AT ALL.  HOWEVER, I WOULD THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE.

Actually, they did.  Russia's stance has been ""Ukraine did it"" and if they didn't, ""prove we did do it"".  Of course that's going to be a lot more difficult now that the site has been trashed by the rebels.

False,0,cjdzr9m,worldnews,1406904798,,"Like most things, it's a relic from European imperialism and the Cold War. Before the Six Day War in 1967, the US tried very hard to be impartial, and it was mostly the UK and France that supported Israel, as the region had been part of their empires before Arab independence. LBJ, an international hawk who went as far as fabricating the Gulf of Tonkin incident for justifying the Vietnam War, sided with Israel because of the other Arab states' leanings towards the USSR. Nasser had just been awarded the Order of Lenin and Hero of the Soviet Union medals. The Middle East had long been a site of proxy Russian influence dating back to the Great Game with the British Empire.

Continuing to fund Israel pisses off all its neighbors, but the US doesn't have any interests in places like Syria or Jordan, except to not attack Israel or sponsor terrorism that could affect the US or further destabilize the region's US interests. So they give Israel weapons to maintain a strong relationship, which of course pisses off everyone more. The US was more concerned about Egypt, since it has control of the Suez (the reason for the 1956 war) and a larger military, so the US paid them off, giving it more foreign aid than any other country except Israel.

It would also be a lot harder at this point to switch sides, since the Arabs have such an (understandably) deep-seated distrust towards the West, and to do so would mean losing Israel as the strongest regional ally. So as long as the status quo that's lasted for nearly half a century stands, politicians won't anger the powerful pro-Israeli groups and lobbyists in the US by changing policy, even if he/she denounces their disproportionate use of force.",t1_cjdzr9m,t5_2qh13,,1,1,0,1435015809,False,0,,True,,t3_2cb446,t1_cjdqc3f,jvalordv

Still looking for an IK chest piece (and boots) so I can run Call of the ancients, they absorb 50% damage for you with the lightning rune. Besides that I'll probably run 2 piece might of the earth, for the very short earthquake cooldown. After patch 2.1, the procs from Odyn's son, Thunderfury and Thundergod's will all scale on lightning damage. That, combined with legendary gems (There's a lightning one) and the buffs to earthquake, should make this a very effective setup.
