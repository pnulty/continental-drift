Natural monopolies *tend* to exist via state granted use of land.  That is the big issue with utilities today.  If you look to Europe they have actually more competition in a sense and better ISPs.  I say in a sense because what they really have done is say the existing infrastructure is on government land (up to the phone poles on any land isn't actually yours) thus all companies have to grant use with compensation.  Actually that isn't a bad model, but an alternative is saying you can multiple lines run the same places.  For congestion reasons the socialized model isn't half bad here, but you can dig in the lines if it became a real concern.  If such a competition existed it would probably push itself to the European model anyway.

NK would only be slightly harder considering we've had a lot of advances in military. NK's army might be willing to fight harder but their tanks, artillery, air force and navy would just all be sitting ducks. The only thing they have are air defense systems, which are radar based and not really proven to work anyway. It sounds all good, but a couple nights of stealth bombing and stealth drone bombing and coast bombardmen would wipe out most of their military and we could easily focus on those air defense systems and then bring in the rest of the air force. Coast bombardment is especially devestating and NK is setup nicely for it. We don't usually get easy wars like that these days. 

NK would be broken in 3 weeks or less, and that's just with the US doing the work. If China, Russia and Europe pitched in, NK could be crushed with a coordinated attack in a matter of days. No invasion, just destroy their military and it's infrastructure. Let them brainwash their people about the NK master race from the ruble of their state and military buildings. 

Seriously, it would be minor US casualties. Most victims would be South Korean. That's why you really want to hit them hard, because if they do have a working nuke it would suck if they hit SK.

All in all I don't see that we have many options here. Crazy dude is going to start stockpiling nukes and if he starts detonating them for fun in our direction that warrants action. I think most Americans will agree once they see a nuke go off. Shit you might be able to see it from Alaska!

ukpolitics,t1_c8776iy,,0,"It's not outrageous. UKIP's policies are very similar to the 2020 Tax Commission proposal by the IOD and Taxpayers Alliance.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/20/chancellor-spending-cuts-income-tax

&gt; George Osborne should prolong the coalition's spending cuts by an extra five years to allow for dramatic tax reductions, with a single rate of income tax set at 30%, according to a report by one of Downing Street's favourite thinktanks.
&gt;
&gt; The TaxPayers' Alliance, whose director Matthew Elliott was recently sounded out for a job in No 10, says in its 2020 Tax Commission that tax cuts are vital to promote growth and help hard-pressed families.
&gt;
&gt; The most eye-catching proposal in the 417-page report, which is jointly published by the Taxpayers' Alliance and the Institute of Directors, is a call for a ""single proportionate income tax rate"" of 30%.
&gt;
&gt; This would be achieved by cutting the ratio of spending and taxation to 33% of national income, forcing Osborne to maintain the current level of spending cuts until 2020.
&gt;
&gt; In his original fiscal mandate, outlined in his emergency budget in June 2010, Osborne had expected the austerity plan to continue until 2015. But in his autumn statement last year Osborne announced that the cuts would be extended for a further two years.
&gt;
&gt; The report by the Taxpayers' Alliance says that a single income tax could be introduced in six steps:
&gt;
&gt; • Cut taxes to 33% of national income. Taxes currently account for 37.5% of national income.
&gt;
&gt; • Ensure that marginal tax rates do not exceed 30% and the personal tax allowance should rise to £10,000.
&gt;
&gt; • Taxes on capital and labour income ""disguised"" as business taxes should be abolished and replaced with a tax on distributed income.
&gt;
&gt; • Transaction, wealth and inheritance tax should be abolished.
&gt;
&gt; • Consumption taxes should remain for the moment but transport taxes should be cut.
&gt;
&gt; • Local authorities should raise half of their spending power from local taxes.
&gt;
&gt; Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ""Right now the government's first priority has to be strong economic growth to create jobs and ease the pressure on families struggling to make ends meet. Tax reform is essential to make that possible. At the same time, the tax system has to be fair, and seen to be fair.
&gt;
&gt; ""Our current, complicated tax code where income is too often either taxed repeatedly or not at all doesn't pass that test. The single income tax is a serious plan for a tax system that can restore Britain's economic fortunes and leave more of their money in taxpayers' pockets.""
&gt;
&gt; Allister Heath, editor of City AM and chairman of the 2020 Tax Commission, said: ""It is time for Britain to make a vital choice between tweaking the status quo and letting our economy continue to be crippled by complex and punitive taxes, and drastically changing course with a radical but realistic plan for a tax system fit for the 21st century.
&gt;
&gt; ""The 2020 Tax Commission has set out that plan and would ensure that income is taxed once at a single, much more reasonable, rate. It could create the conditions to establish the UK as a global trading hub, generating renewed prosperity for all those who live and work here. Politicians who are serious about Britain's future need to take it up.""
&gt;
&gt; The introduction of a single income tax would have echoes of Osborne's flirtation with a flatter rates of tax. In an interview with Radio 4's Today programme in September 2005, two months after his appointment as shadow chancellor, Osborne said: ""I am fully conscious that we may not be able to introduce a pure flat tax, but we may be able to move towards simpler and flatter taxes.
&gt;
&gt; ""What I am really talking about is removing a lot of the complexity from the tax system – a lot of the reliefs and exemptions – in return for either a lower rate or a bigger tax allowance. The rest of the world, including many countries in Europe, are reducing taxes.""

Have them write up an estimate for you. If these shops find something wrong with your car take the estimates to a VW dealership that ISN'T the one you bought it from or have had it serviced by. Show them the estimates of what the other shops have found wrong on your car. Ask them to perform their own estimate on your car and see if they can find the same problems too. If they can't find anything then you know something is up.

I'm not well-enough acquainted with the situation to know the up-to-date military developments.  What I get I just skim from the news/books, so my guess is as good as any casual observer I guess.  

Anyways, I've heard that in a lot of cases, the Syrian military has pulled out of the villages and rebel-held areas, resorting to shelling and air strikes.  Not *all* villages, but the rebel strongholds.  

I've also heard that in a lot of places, the Assad's forces control the day, and the rebels control the night.  So the military can conduct raids, but at night it isn't safe for them. 

As for why people aren't defecting, there may be a lot of reasons.  I'm sure a lot believe in the cause and believe in Assad (even Sunnis).  Some fear for their lives and their families if they defect.  Some must fear they would be executed or tortured by the rebels.

Foodforthought,t1_c879iub,,0,"&gt;Lincoln had newspaper editors who didn't agree with him arrested. 

That doesn't contradict what I said. Lincoln certainly made some controversial decisions, (albeit under enormous pressure) and exceeded his authority a few times. However, this must be weighed against the bulk of his actions and the moral standards of the time.

&gt;proponents of large, centralized government power. 

Not all historians hold the same ideological viewpoint. 

&gt; Lincoln didn't ""preserve the Union,"" he destroyed it

No, that was the Confederates. Lincoln genuinely attempted to keep the union together through peaceful means, war was the last option available to him. Also, when last I checked The USA is still a single nation.

&gt;Before he came into power the Union was voluntary, based on rational alignments of values.

Lincoln was hardly the start of these troubles, look at the Nullification crisis.

&gt;In all actuality, if you actually examine history, Lincoln didn't ""despise slavery."" 

Where are you getting this from? Lincoln maintained a steadfast opposition to slavery throughout his adult life. This is seen in both public and private statements on the matter. 

&gt; He was indifferent to it

"" I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world.""

""You know I dislike slavery; and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it. ... I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations, under the constitution, in regard to your slaves. I confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down, and caught, and carried back to their stripes, and unrewarded toils; but I bite my lip and keep quiet. In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip, on a Steam Boat from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio, there were, on board, ten or a dozen slaves, shackled together with irons. That sight was a continued torment to me; and I see something like it every time I touch the Ohio, or any other slave-border. It is hardly fair for you to assume, that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually exercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution and the Union. . . How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that ""all men are created equal."" We now practically read it ""all men are created equal, except negroes."" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read ""all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and catholics."" When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty— to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be take pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy ""


&gt; the only reason he opposed it politically was because popular trends of the time didn't want white labor to have to compete with black labor (and ex-slaves) side-by-side. 

This is a highly simplistic reading of the issue. Yes the North was not enamoured with abolitionism (abolitionist parties never gathered more than about 10% public support) and often opposed slavery for selfish reasons. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this was true of Lincoln as well.
Also, this rationale for hating slavery doesn't even adequately explain why white northerners disliked slavery.  Working class Northerners rarely had to compete with black slaves for jobs (after all it was the divergent economic models used by the North and South that caused the sectional crisis). To these workers the problem was both moral and ideological. In their minds having slave labour devalued the worth of the work they were doing, and slavery was seen as turning whites into immoral layabouts who participated in miscegenation. 

&gt;Once again, you never hear about that unless you actually delve into historical facts 

Luckily I have. 

&gt;Lincoln attacked the South because of economics

Oh this old chestnut. During the civil war there was never any doubt that slavery was the primary reason for succession. The idea of 'states rights' was a myth created during the 1890s (the so called 'era of good feelings') as a way of reuniting the north and south.

Do you honestly believe that the North should simply have stood by while the South seceded?  

&gt;What did the South do? They said ""we're going to open Southern ports to Europe tariff-free."" This would have effectively wiped out the North's economic power


Read the Confederate constitution some time. It makes abundantly clear what their priorities were. Tarrifs may have been a bone of contention (they had been since the 1830s) but it was  a secondary issue. Slavery was the essential condition for the outbreak of war. 

This article gives a pretty balanced account of the significance of Tarrifs. http://www.kosmosonline.org/2011/01/29/did-tariffs-really-cause-the-civil-war-the-morrill-act-at-150/ 

""When weighed against the sum of other evidence, it is difficult to maintain that the tariff was the lone, central issue of the secession crisis by any measure, but at least in the modern era most historians who follow the tariff thesis do not do this. It is therefore something of a strawman to expunge all discussion of the tariff on account of its later connection to “Lost Cause” historiography, and some historians who attack the tariff thesis are guilty of this tendency. Tariff politics at any time in history are notoriously complex, and analysis of them requires both political knowledge and an understanding of their economic effects.""


&gt; Lincoln made up some silly narrative about slavery, 

You act as if slavery was an issue of Lincolns making, rather than the most severe and intractable sectional issue in America at the time. You ignore the vast bulk of historical data showing how slavery was central to the ideological and economic gulf between the North and South. You miss out on how vital slavery was to the Southern economy and way of life, how schoolchildren were indoctrinated to accept slavery as a ""positive good"".

&gt;He suspended the Constitution

He had the legal right to suspend Habeas Corpus. It was a controversial move, but not enough to classify him as a 'tyrant ' (especially when weighed against the fact that he went to Congress for approval after declaring war despite not being required to)

&gt; decree called ""the Emancipation Proclamation,"" when President's don't have the power to make laws in the first place,

He had authority to issue it as a part of his powers as commander in Chief. Lincoln was also supported by international law, which held that countries may seize contraband during a time of war. Find me one serious historian who thinks what he did was illegal.

Let me point you to [Hamdi v. Rumsfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdi_v._Rumsfeld) which all of the idiots in /r/politics don't know about.

&gt; for example in Colorado, state law makes criminal libel a felony carrying up to 18 months in prison and a fine up to $100,000 for the first offense

From wikipedia:

&gt; Some states codify what constitutes slander and libel together into the same set of laws. Criminal libel is rarely prosecuted but exists on the books in many states, and is constitutionally permitted in circumstances essentially identical to those where civil libels liability is constitutional. Defenses to libel that can result in dismissal before trial include the statement being one of opinion rather than fact or being ""fair comment and criticism,"" though neither of these are imperatives on the US constitution. Truth is always an absolute defense against a defamation suit in the United States.

...

&gt; SAME AS IN US! You need a protest permits in US as well.. If you don't have them - you'll be fined.

You do not need a permit to protest in the U.S. Sometimes you need a permit to hold a planned protest on public property because of so-called ""[time, place and manner restrictions](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/timeplacemanner.htm)."" These are a tradeoff of unbounded protest and allowing the public to use public facilities that might be ""occupied"" by dipshits sleeping in tents for weeks.

For that matter, our balance in this regard is one of the best in the world. No matter how much we hate the Westboro Baptist Church, they're allowed to protest. In the UK or elsewhere they would be subject to criminal sanctions. I can't think of any other European country that wouldn't.

Which is a fundament of the anti-tax, get-government-out-of-everything American libertarian movement.

&gt; That is absolutely false. That is one of the few, but critical legitimate roles that libertarians give to government: the role of protecting and defending individual liberties and rights from those who would violate them.

But *only* by violence or fraud. American libertarianism provides no concern for economic pressure or desperation, instead expecting contract law to somehow promote economic and social equality rather than damage it and people's rights with it.

&gt; ...and pervades the republican and democratic parties (based on their actions, not their meaningless words), resulting in the power of government going to the highest bidders. This corporate/government conglomeration then works both sides to grow it's own power at the expense of the rights and freedoms of the people.

Why yes. I would agree that American libertarianism leads unerringly to one of two conclusions: fascism, or simple government failure. Not because it tries to do that, but because the view is utterly, fundamentally flawed and incapable of producing a sustainable government. When you believe in the freedom of the wealthy to use their wealth to control the government over your right to check their power to do so, you inevitably must forfeit your power over government to the wealthy.

A philosophy that produces a workable society isn't about freedom first. It's about *producing a workable society* first; freedom is a perk of that and a part of that, but everyone's going to have to give up a measure of it to make sure society functions, and the more powerful the person the bigger the measure will probably be necessary.

And in America, once you acknowledge that, we call you a liberal (a term which also doesn't mean the same thing in every country, and in fact in some countries describes the same frothing 'leave it to the market' view that American libertarians stand for). You can argue that the descriptions are synonymous and this entire argument is a result of the odd lingo Americans use to describe their political ideologies versus other countries (particularly European ones), and I'd be inclined to agree.

But because of that, I won't be calling any sane people libertarians anytime soon without using the qualifier ""European"", or as previously mentioned ""left-libertarian"", because the Randians stole that word in America as surely as they would steal everything else if they could get away with it.",0,t5_2cneq,t3_17mnc7,True,0,0,,Indon_Dasani,t1_c87aric,,1359688217,0,c87aric,False,1431147233,False,

Our guns, our food, our ammunition kept you're nation from starving to death in the First World War, and kept you folks going in the Second.  Let's also not forget the fact that without use, you may have become the Peoples Republic of England under a hammer and sickle as well.

&gt; I doubt you had a point by point response, because I don't think you actually read it. Sigh.

I had one, but why bother.  You're a human being that has resigned to accept rape and theft without allowing the weakest among you a chance to defend themselves.

All because what?  The fear of a few killings with firearms?  England may have a lot less gun crime, but you have a lot more rapes and burglaries and other crimes.

In America, we have MILLIONS of firearms owned by MILLIONS of people.  There are more gun owners in the United States then there are people in all your islands.  Yet compared to this population our gun crime is relatively rare.  YES, rare.  In fact, almost half our gun crime is due to a small segment of our population comprised of Black men between the ages of 16-25 years old.  Remove them from the statistics, and our crime drops even further to that of most Western European nations.

FURTHERMORE, most of our gun crime is incredibly localized in urban areas.  The rest of the United States is actually incredibly safe from gang violence and sees very little crime.  

Criminals in our nation fear gun owners far more than they fear police.  They hesitate to invade a home where an armed homeowner is present because they will probably die.  They also hesitate to attack people in areas where they may be carrying firearms.  The type of crime that you folks in the UK experience is completely alien to most Americans outside of our most urbanized settings.  That is because in most of our cities, guns are banned.

The vast majority of gun owners in this nation are good, law abiding people, who never willfully hurt people with their arms.  They keep them for home defense, for sport, and all other legal purposes.  It is our right to own them, and we know from looking at you folks across the pond that it's a terrible idea to give them up.

todayilearned,t1_c87ays7,,0,"You make some very good points. 

I think there is merit in the idea that we may not be doing uncontacted tribes a service by forcibly keeping others away from them. There are good examples of primitive cultures meeting modern people and benefiting while still maintaining much of there culture. Though in this case it seems that this tribe is pretty okay with not having visitors.

As for the African/Native American point. I think its true that not many people of African heritage living in ""first world"" countries are lining up to move to Africa. But Africa's current state is due to European colonialism. If Europe had left Africa alone there is no telling what the continent would be like today. Africa wasn't given the chance to see itself grow into a more modern civilization.

The Native American situation is similar. Indian reservations have some of the highest poverty in the United States and for a culture that once occupied the entire continent, being forcibly sectioned off into some of the worst property in the US is a hardly a positive development. (And casinos have made some tribes a lot of money, but most are left out.) Some tribes near the East Coast used the modern system to successfully sue in US Court to be allowed to stay on their lands, a decision that was ignored by President Jackson and they were were marched to Oklahoma. The Iroquois League had a pretty advanced society and even had their own written Constitution, but were still treated like savages. So yes, on reservations they have cars, heating, plumbing, and movies but you'd have to ask some tribal members if they feel this was a good trade off for the near extinction of their people and rape of their culture.

pokemon,t3_17nmwk,,0,"I would like to offer my knowledge in order to help here.  There is one significant dead giveaway when it comes to spotting fakes.  For Gen 3 GBA games, the labels are something to look at.  Legitimate game cartridges will have a shiny/holographic label.  Look at the image for the game the user is selling.  If the label doesn't seem shiny, it's most likely a fake.  Also, as /u/Space_Seacow pointed out, there are often things on the label that don't look right, such as the Nintendo seal and E rating.  I've been burned once when I bought a emerald that turned out to be a fake.
  
Things you should look for:
1.) Where is the seller located?  Most, if not all of the bootlegged copies come from Asia.  Try to find a seller in your home country.  If you live in Europe, also look for sellers in the U.S.
2.) Take note of the sellers rating.  Only buy from sellers that have a high rating.
3.) Return policy.  It's best to find a seller that offers a return policy, or to pay through something like pay-pal so that if you do get burned, you can still get your money back.
4.) Finding a seller that is selling the game with the original packaging is another bonus, as this usually means that the game itself is also legitimate.  This isn't required, as my legitimate Leaf Green didn't come with a box, but it certainly helps.

There are also some ways i've used to check if a game is fake:
1.) If you have a DS and a gen 4 game (d/p/pl/hg/ss), insert the GBA game in and go to the start up screen of the gen 4 game.  If it picks up the game and displays the GBA games name for transferring, then it should be good.
2.) Also, if you start up the GBA game and it gives you a message about the save file, saying something along the line of ""the game can still be played,""  this is another possible indicator that it could be fake.

I know that this is a long message, but I don't want others to have to go through what I went through.

The attack on Baghdad in 1258 was led by [Hulagu Khan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulagu_Khan) who was a grandson of [Genghis Khan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan). I've read estimates of those killed from close to one hundred thousand to as many as a million people killed. E.g.:

&gt;The number of Muslim citizens killed is open to question, but the estimates range from 80,000 to a million.
The Mongols were finally obliged to remove their camp to avoid the smell of rotting corpses.
&gt;
&gt;Two wagon trains of treasure left Baghdad for Karakorum, the Mongol capital and Mangu's home. Baghdad
was looted for a month, until few citizens or buildings remained standing. Ibn al-ALkami survived to be
named ruler of the city's remains, but he lived only three months, dying it is said of a broken heart.
&gt;
&gt;The fall of Baghdad motivated most of the Muslim fortress cities to surrender. Only Aleppo fell in combat,
to a combined force of Mongols and crusaders, who saw the steppe horsemen as allies of convenience in their
war against Islam. Mustasim's death, along with that of his sons, brought to an end the Abbassid caliphate,
established 500 years before by Muhammad's uncle Abbas. All of Islam could have been in peril, but both
timing and Mongol tradition saved them. As Genghis Khan's death had stopped the invasion of Europe, so did Mangu's
death halt the sweep of death into the Middle East. Hulagu returned to Karakorum to take part in the election
of the new great khan. He left behind a smaller army under his subordinate Kit-boga, who was defeated by Mamluk

The [Siege of Baghdad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Baghdad_%281258%29) was a devastating blow to the intellectual foundation created by the Abbasid Caliphate.

&gt;The [Grand Library of Baghdad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom), containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Survivors said that the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river and red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed.

[Steven Dutch](http://www.uwgb.edu/geoscience/faculty/dutch.asp) at the University of Wisconsin has suggested that this event alone was an enormous blow to a spirit of intellectual inquiry in Islam from which Islam never recovered.

&gt;Iraq in 1258 was very different from present day Iraq. Its agriculture was supported by a canal network thousands of years old. Baghdad was one of the most brilliant intellectual centers in the world. The Mongol destruction of Baghdad was a psychological blow from which Islam never recovered. Already Islam was turning inward, becoming more suspicious of conflicts between faith and reason and more conservative. With the sack of Baghdad, the intellectual flowering of Islam was snuffed out. Imagining the Athens of Pericles and Aristotle obliterated by a nuclear weapon begins to suggest the enormity of the blow. The Mongols filled in the irrigation canals and left Iraq too depopulated to restore them.

australia,t1_c87cpgp,,0,"&gt;Except if the businesses reduce their emissions to be competitive. That's the whole point - it's a price on volume of emissions, not a tax.

If businesses can show they reduced their carbon footprint, then the tax on their products would decrease. The government would have to be monitoring this anyway under a carbon trading scheme.

&gt;See, I'd rather the people polluting pay per amount of pollution - whether they're international or local destination goods/services.

Taxing Australian exports seems silly, what should be done instead is pressure for other countries to implement their own tax.

&gt;Yeah, but they are a regressive tax because it applies disproportionately on the poorer people.

Kind of going against the definition of a flat tax. Unless you're saying that more well off people don't also spend more?

&gt;By keep the taxes in Australia - you mean will be paid for by Australians - but any foreign based businesses get to avoid it. 

Foreign businesses don't avoid GST.

&gt;Hrmm.. I think I prefer to charge the polluters based on amount of pollution and that way they can avoid it by being more efficient.

TBH I'm ok with this as well, I just really dislike the notion of an international carbon trading system, as we would be simply giving money to Europe.

Not to mention Australia gets a bit of a raw deal in this case, sure we might be digging up the coal, but other countries are using it (which is why I do prefer a tax on the end product rather than the 'start').

When it comes to consoles, If I had a game CD, then gave you the game CD, I can no longer play a game because I don't have the CD.

With digital software, things change slightly, Valve could, realistically, transfer a *STEAM* licence between two people, but not necessarily the full license. Only games which purely use steamworks and steams DRM fall into the category of 'Games that can be easily resold'.

I bought Battlefield 2 on steam. Steam provided me with a CD Key to play the game. I used the CD key to bind battlefield 2 to my EA account. If I resold my steam license at this point, sure, the person buying would be able to launch battlefield 2, but without EA also rescinding my CD key and valve subsequently providing that to the new owner, they wouldn't actually be able to play it.

When you look at it this way, you essentially are suing Gamestop for refusing to resell a PC game, and suing valve specifically for this isn't going to have the desired effect because in far too many cases it's completely out of Valves control.

I'm pretty sure no one here is opposed to the concept of reselling PC games, it's something we've all wanted for MANY years, but people can ultimately accept the gargantuan effort required and logistical nightmare associated with the fact that valve only holds the full license for games they create.

Not to mention the fact that tracking resells would be very easy for valve so they could calculate EXACTLY what their ""losses"" would be (yes, this is very subjective, I know) but ultimately could lead to the demise of steam sales, or they wouldn't be as awesome, simply because Valve would start looking for places to make a little more money because their current model doesn't work anymore.",0,t5_2qhwp,t3_17kwyj,True,-1,-1,,FrostyCoolSlug,t1_c87cya5,,1359695719,0,c87cya5,False,1431148510,1359695915,

WTF,t1_c879e6a,,0,"The context is important because 1) the artists were trailblazers in the field and 2) the artists/work were symbolic of the time.  

Most of this work came immediately after WW2.  I believe most of these artists are American, but they immigrated from Europe because of the war.  Their homes were destroyed, everything they knew was gone and they sought a new life and a new way of thinking.  Their work is symbolic, and a product of, that struggle.  

They also sparked a new trend in painting and it elevated American's cultural status in the world.  It represented freedom of thought, and the CIA used it as a cultural weapon against the communists.

So if you copied that work it wouldn't mean anything because nothing meaningful motivated you, and it's been done before.  It doesn't mean you can't make work for you own benefit.  Just don't expect to sell it for a lot.

todayilearned,t1_c87bdwk,,0,"Much older than 16, I just thought a little humor might lighten the mood. Interesting how you consider that my argument, not massive drug abuse, militaries capable of horrific power, income inequality, sex slaves, unfathomable pollution which is destroying the world, child molestation, more depression, overfishing, and animal abuse. 

By the way the United States has a murder rate of 4.8 per 100000, when you look at urban areas the rate can rise to over 10/100000. Europe is averaged at around 3.5 per 100000. So yes, there are much higher rates in other less developed parts of the world, you're right. 

I didn't notice any statistics on your tribal murder point. I have read up plenty on primitive and uncontacted tribes and I'm not sure where you are getting your information. Perhaps you are talking about the tribal regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan? In which case we are talking about two different things. I have been referring to primitive living tribes like the one featured in the article. These tribes have maintained their traditional lifestyle. They are found in the Pacific Islands, the Amazon and parts of Africa. As I mentioned before, those that still live in a hunter/gatherer society are know for impressive sex parity and also a deep respect for natural order. Your argument seems to be based entirely on conjecture and abstraction. I know of very little evidence to suggest that there are still tribes that practice cannibalism and human sacrifice. These are not warrior tribes from some movie, they are relatively simple people. 

I was never suggesting that we should go back to the caveman days, please don't put words in my mouth. I'm am very comfortable living in modern society. I like my car, I love a good movie, and you may of noticed that I am using a computer. Last week I had the flu, something that would killed me 100 years ago, I get it.  We have made great advances and accomplished things that once seemed impossible. But I don't think we live anywhere near perfection. You seem to place us on such a high moral footing, where the faults of these tribes are unforgivable yet the faults of the western society is acceptable. The fantasy you've built around yourself is the same fantasy that has led advanced cultures to pillage and destroy any culture deemed inferior for hundreds of years.

It is not these tribes that are destroying the environment. It is not these tribes that have killed hundred of millions of people in constant war over the last century alone. It is not these tribes that have developed the capacity to annihilate all life on Earth. If you gave a tribesman a history lesson on the past 100 years, do you think he might consider us the savages? They fight with bows and arrows, we fight with drones and tanks. How many tribal children are gunned down in their schools? How many tribesmen and women go hungry despite living amongst incredible wealth? How many tribesmen are abusing drugs and alcohol? 

I do not consider the civilized world to be evil. But I do consider it to be greatly flawed. These tribes have flaws to. Humanity has flaws. I'm flawed and you're flawed.

atheism,t1_c87d82h,,0,"Well, I can do a quick and dirty version of it.  

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income) is a chart that shows what after-tax income is like for every country.  So far, so good for the USA, we're on top with 26,672, but we're not that far ahead the competitors, the top ten (save number ten [Sweden] at 19,736) all have per capita income above 20,000 per capita.  So here's where the difference sets in.

""Disposable income"" on this data set does not include out of pocket expenses for health care and education and doesn't factor social services in as ""income"", although it realistically could be described as such.  Turns out, Americans spend pretty much all that disposable income, while our European counterparts [save it](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-09-029/EN/KS-SF-09-029-EN.PDF).  In fact, American, on average, borrowed [more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_debt) than they made.  Part of that goes to [health care](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/out-of-pocket-health-care-spending/), part of it goes to [education](http://www.mainstreet.com/article/smart-spending/budgeting/empty-pockets-americans-spending-more-health-care-2012), some on other services provided for free (yet not included as income) in those other countries.

So while I couldn't, in the fifteen minutes I've been looking through this, find a direct comparison (I assume because no one's bothered), the evidence I've presented here makes it pretty clear that Americans, while making marginally more, shell out a lot more out-of-pocket expenses than their European counterparts.

atheism,t1_c877ur4,,0,"These anti-American circle-jerk submissions are always very narrow and without context or logic. People will compare the US to a country that is doing one thing better and then conclude that the US is particularly bad on a global scale. Let's take a look at some of the facts.

**1)** The US education system is not as bad as people say it is.

Americans have the [highest rate of secondary education completion](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/high-school-graduation-rate.aspx) out of developed countries.

The US public education system brings people of each specific demographic up to a higher standard of learning than they'd receive in any other country except Finland. [Link 1](http://www.vdare.com/articles/pisa-and-bad-students-american-schools-add-value-but-demography-is-still-destiny), [Link 2](http://www.vdare.com/articles/pisa-scores-show-demography-is-destiny-in-education-too-but-washington-doesnt-want-you-to-k)


The US [has the highest education attainment out of any major industrialized nation](http://www.educationalpolicy.org/pdf/Global2005.pdf). Americans are more likely to attain university-level education than Europeans, Canadians, Australians etc...

And American universities lead in academic performance in literally every broad subject:

[Natural Sciences and Mathematics](http://www.arwu.org/FieldSCI2010.jsp)

[Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences](http://www.arwu.org/FieldENG2010.jsp)

[Life and Agriculture Sciences](http://www.arwu.org/FieldLIFE2010.jsp)

[Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy](http://www.arwu.org/FieldMED2010.jsp)

[Social Sciences](http://www.arwu.org/FieldSOC2010.jsp)

The reason Finland does so well in public education is partially because they have almost no minorities. 99% of Finns are white, they have a statistical advantage due to demographics, they have less people who tend to be disadvantaged and under-perform in school in all western countries.

The US is not the only country performing poorly compared to Finland.

**2)** I agree US drug policies have been stupid, but the US is not alone. Meanwhile, the US is one of the first among countries to have a robust, successful legalization campaign, at least for marijuana. [Washington (my state) and Colorado have legalized recreational use of marijuana](http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/07/news/economy/marijuana-legalization-washington-colorado/index.html). This will be [done by other states in due time](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-next-seven-states-to-legalize-pot-20121218). 

Portugal isn't just doing the oppose of what the US has done, they've done the opposite of what almost every country has done. And the US is actually making more progress than just about anyone else.

**3)** The US is actually out-performing the majority of developed countries economically. Europe and Canada for example actually had larger bank-bailouts than the US did, relative to GDP. The US exited recession earlier than most developed countries and has grown more since then. The US unemployment rate is lower than the EU average.

The only country really outperforming the US is Australia, and that is mostly due to their exploding primary sector industry based around their mineral wealth. This is a result of circumstance, not some quality of the Australian economic policies.

Meanwhile, up until only the last quarter, the US had more stable GDP growth than Iceland, making moot the whole idea about Ireland somehow doing better at recovering from the recession. 

In fact, the US exited recession *before* Iceland did.  Compare GDP trends:

[Iceland](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/iceland-gdp-growth.png?s=icgpsaq)

[United States](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-states-gdp-growth.png?s=gdp+cqoq)

Iceland's has gone in and out of negative GDP growth several times since the recession began and after most countries began recovering. The US has had a much more stable trend of growth than Iceland.

People are so addicted to that constant dichotomy of USA = bad, (Insert country) = good that they have no problem ignoring the facts in the process.

there was a try to get the slaves from Muslim markets but french and spanish crashed the party by destroying the pirate fleets in Mediterranean seas and Russians figured out how to kill slavery trade in east Europe at that time so everyone slowly moved to the black continent and later ""criminal deportation"" tactics. it is very interesting to see how fast europeans forgot about own slaves. even there were scandals with arabian royalty which still stole people into slavery until 70'ens.(i think you saw the one american movie about american engineer who was forced to work for

europe,t1_c870ebv,,0,"We've had ""enough"" non-WEC immigrants to ""warrant"" stereotypes for a long time, but the right-wing didn't deem it necessary to discriminate (hah!) between them and e.g., immigrants from Southern or Eastern Europe until maybe 20 years ago. I think that the Turkish share of immigrants, if anything, was higher back then. They were the largest share of the ""guest worker"" program, and while a few Italians and Spaniards had been part of it, most people from Southern and Eastern European countries only came after their countries had joined the EU.

I believe this is more about socioeconomic tensions than anything else. As opposed to more recent immigrants, the ""guest workers"" didn't have much of an education and were hired for low paying jobs. Partly because of that, they didn't mix with the general population, and social mobility in Germany isn't very good (I blame our outdated three-tiered school system). Not quite as bad as e.g., in the UK, but almost. So, you have people who look different and are predominantly lower class. I'm sure that if their socioeconomically similar counterparts of the native population all had red hair, we'd see similar antagonism against gingers. Nobody has an issue with Turkish-German engineers, for example, but with what people have come to euphamise as ""youth"" -- and those are hardly Islamic fundamentalists but about as Muslim as most of the Christians around here, which is to say ""not very"".  
However, Islamists make a great target. Nobody likes them, not even the Muslim population that actually takes their faith seriously. And yet, they get thrown into the same category. I think that's because rejecting sharia law in Europe is something everybody can get behind, ridiculous as this perceived threat may be, and it lets people voice their antagonism in a seemingly rational way.

Exactly!  I am well aware of the fact that war was inevitable but you have to remember that without Gavrilo the unique circumstances that made WWI what it is would not have happened.  Things would have changed and the outcomes could have made a very different world then what we have today.  

The kindling was all set up but it needed the match to set the fire ablaze, Gavrilo and more importantly the assassination of Franz helped set the fire alight.  You may dismiss that the war was inevitable (and it was) but the mere fact that he did kill Franz, and that he did help put the war into motion is what is important.  Without him we would not have seen the rise of Communist Russia (and if it did then it would have been at a later date and maybe to late to give funding to the Communist Chinese so that they could win the war against Japan and the ROC among many other things that may have been delayed.)

If the kids as a fever, my first choice is Children's Tylenol, hers is some TCM concoction some 'doctor' prescribed, that doesn't do a damn thing to reduce the fever.

The other issue is the general expertise of many of the doctors here.  They just aren't up to a Western standard of expertise.  They prescribe antibiotics for everything and anything.  My wife was prescribed a medicine once that I found was banned in the US and Europe for renal side affects.  One doctor at a local hospital here killed a kid by giving them an adult dose of something, so I was told.

SubredditDrama,t3_17n9nz,,0,"Edit: my mobile screwed up. This was not supposed to be a reply to the main post, it was supposed to be a comment elaborating on the vicious killings Europeans performed around the same time period of the Aztecs.  But fuck it, I typed this all up on mobile and I'm not retyping it. 

Adding into this, while the South American nations had the twisted idea that their deities required child sacrifices, when the Spanish came they had no qualms killing them in particularly brutal ways because *their* religion taught non-believers were to be killed in a more painful, gruesome way. 

One of the last rulers of the Inca had *really* bad luck. When the Spanish approached him they tried to convert him to Christianity by giving him the book and saying it would tell him about God. The king got pissed off because the book wasn't speaking to him and they didn't have the same concept of letters, so he threw the book. 

And the Spanish weren't happy about that. 

That started a more violent path, which finally led to the king being taken hostage for other reasons. He was allowed to have his wives with him, and was kept in relative comfort. 

But his bad luck struck again, and he walked in on one of the worst of the worst Spanish soldiers raping his favorite wife. Naturally he goes ballistic, and the soldier makes up a story to his superiors claiming the king was planning to escape. 

So they decide to execute him. Now; inca religion dictates the body has to be in one piece for him to go to the afterlife. So when they're getting ready to kill him, they say he can convert to Christianity and be pretty much hung, or he can remain his own faith and be beaten, drawn and quartered, and then his remains could be burned to ashes. 

Of course the king died. But while everybody is talking about how savage the Aztecs and Inca were, nobody really thinks of the savagery the killings the Europeans performed were. Sure, they don't have the same shock-and-awe of having a heart ripped out, but they were pretty brutal and ruthless. 

Actually pretty much every nation/kingdom/tribe was pretty immoral around then. They didn't see it that way, but they really were. ",0,t5_2ss5b,t3_17n9nz,True,3,3,,IHaveTimeToKill,t1_c87dt50,,1359699182,0,c87dt50,False,1435635449,False,

From the liner notes:  
*""Lucky Thompson was born in Detroit, 1924. After serious musical studies, he moved to New York in 1943 and used then to gig in the 52nd Street clubs with Lionel Hampton, Hot Lips Page, Big Sid Catlett, Billy Eckstine, Erroll Garner and Count Basie. In 1948 he made his first European appearance at the Festival of Nice. Back to New York, he formed his own band and worked regularly at the Savoy Ballroom during two years. He returned to France in 1956 as a member of Stan Kenton's band. He lived in Europe for six years, touring and recording with musicians of several countries. This session, recorded during his European period, makes one able to appreciate Thompson's ample and warm style and his invention so personal and melodic.""*
  
This looks like a budget LP, part of a ""Jazz Anthology"" series from a French label, Musidisc Records. I think I picked this one up at the dollar tables at the [WFMU Record Fair](http://wfmu.org/recfair/) a few years ago. And this was definitely a dollar well spent. The music is drawn from two sessions in the spring of 1956, with Thompson backed up by a couple of configurations led by the French drummer Dave Pochonet.  The only other name I recognize here is pianist Martial Solal, who plays on about half the tunes in a septet (the other half is a ten-piece group).  Thompson is the star of the show, of course. He has a big sound on the blues tunes and a nice soulful touch on the ballads. The arrangements for the larger band remind me of what Miles and Gil Evans were doing on Birth of the Cool. Most of these tunes don't really burn - they simmer. There's nothing revolutionary happening here, just some nice tasty jazz.  

Unfortunately none of the songs from this album are on YouTube, but Thompson recorded a bunch of sessions in Paris around the same time, so I'll point you to a few of those instead:

This says Finnish doctors get ~$70k for GP and ~$90k for specialists. Bit lower than we pay in the UK.

http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/facts_and_figures/salaries.pdf (long load, page 72!)

This puts teachers average salaries at $50k-$70k depending upon the age bracket. note that these numbers are more complex, as they're not the statutory pay, and the average are all much more than the statutory maximum, which makes no sense to me.

US wages vary wildly, South Dakota pays an average of $35k and CA/NY/MA pays an average of $70k. This suggests that CA/NY/MA pay more, as their average for all age groups is greater than the average of Finland.

These numbers are all in USD.

This seems to say more about the wages of doctors in the respective countries than it does about those of teachers. This seems to be teachers saying ""finland pays its teachers almost what it pays its doctors, therefore we should get the same as our doctors, right?""

I think that you will find that a lot of safety features were implemented as selling points. Take for example seatbelts (Volvo) and crash zones (merc) both of which were implemented of their own accords and without government legislation. Maybe not in the US, but European car makers make quite a big deal about having the safest cars and adding safety features. But sure, believe what you want to. Almost anything you buy could be a statement, your phone is your clothes are, your haircut etc. But that doesn't mean that it is inefficient. What do you suggest removing from a modern car to make it somehow magically more efficient?

The other thing you are not considering is that ""powerful"" cars don't actually use all that power all the time. That power is available when you need it, but when you are cruising at the speed limit you use only what you need to keep the car moving at that speed. My car for example has 200bhp (in a smallish car) and a lot of torque whenever I put my foot down. But when I'm cruising along on the highway I get over 60mpg!

You obviously don't seem to like/enjoy driving much, but there is a lot more to driving than just going as fast as you can. You need power to be able to go through corners effectively, and accelerate to an efficient speed from lights etc. putting a ridiculously low powered engine in a car on the belief that somehow it is better for the environment is just silly.

You mention Priuses being quite slow (and they are to 60mph) but you will find that off the lights on a residential road they are pretty hard to beat. This is because they use a torque electric motor to bring the car up to a steady cruising speed where the petrol engine has to use relatively little fuel to maintain speed and is quite efficient. That's right, cars are less efficient when they are going slower, and a lot more efficient when they are traveling at highway speeds. Cars use the most fuel when accelerating not maintaining speed, so your analogy of limiting a cpu's execution speed is stupid.

As amc178 points out, there are a lot of efficient small capacity engines out there, but one of the things they don't skimp on is power (for their capacity). That 200hp engine I was talking about is only 1.4L for example. Part of the reason for this is that they work at their maximum efficiency at a steady cruising speed, but have the power to get you there quickly.

If you remember back to the days when you presumably did highschool physics, you may remember that to move a mass a certain distance at a certain speed you need to provide an amount of force. The total amount of work to move an object a set distance doesn't change if you move it faster or slower, but what does change is the amount of force required at any given point. You apply a higher force for a shorter amount of time if you are moving it faster, and a lower force for a longer time if you are moving it slower. If you were to calculate the area under the graph (the total work done) you will find that both are the same, you just got one job done quicker.",0,t5_2qh13,t3_17iqme,True,1,1,,hdragun,t1_c87eblg,,1359701536,0,c87eblg,False,1431149131,False,

Another point is that GDP is not a good measurement and is very deceiving.
GDP is just the size of the economy. Of course the GDP of the US is bigger, it has 300+ million citizens.
Did you mean GDP per capita?
Still extremely deceiving because we do not know how the wealth is distributed.
for example if the top 0.0001% has 10 private planes each and palaces while the rest of the country starves i.e. a nation of slaves, it does not make a country great to live in.
So how about that economic inequality?How about the work hours?Infrastructure?safety? % of prisoners? Violent offenses?

What matters is the quality of life of most of the citizenry.

polandball,t1_c86s4ip,,0,"I always thought of the US as a bit of an enigma because it's such a cohesive nation, it comes off almost artificial and that's because it didn't form like most countries. It was this already developed nation fresh out of the door with a large amount of land yet to be utilized and a massive slave and immigrant population. A young country with a vast amount of potential and a clean slate. So you might ask why say, Mexico or other Latin American didn't come up like the US. To begin with Latin America was settled a good portion of a century before North America and Latin America had more advanced Native groups than the North and the Spanish had a different approach to colonization than the English. To put it bluntly Spain was Catholic and Britain was Protestant. The Spanish less often obliterated Native American tribes but instead converted and assimilated them. With a country governed by Spanish populated by Natives Spain took more easily to exploitation of it's colonies. That doubled with the Spanish exclusion from the reformation and it's enlightened ideologies Spain was ideologically further in the past than Northern Europe and that is reflected in Colonization. Where as in North America Native American tribes are decimated and Africans and European poor come flooding in on ships. To Spain America was an exploit, to the British, Dutch and French it was a new Europe, someplace to further Enlightened ideology and escape the despotism of the old country. The average American was in equals with those in the home country in theory and didn't just want a good country, they wanted a better country, a better home. This kind of attitude from immigrants, the idea that their life in America would be better than their life in Europe is why the English failed in the Thirteen Colonies. When it came to governance the British wanted to exploit but like a bunch of nobs filled it with people who didn't want to be exploited.

While the proportion of civillians that died due to the bombings was probably higher than what would have resulted from an invasion, the japanese civilians were considered fanatical, and more would probably have died than in the invasion of a european country. While this fact was no doubt exaggerated by US propaganda, I don't think they were exaggerating much. [1,000 japanese civilians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties) committed suicide by jumping off a cliff in the Battle of Saipan rather than defect due to an order from the emperor. The emperor's order, had the Americans invaded, would probably have been ""Fight to the death"", and it seems likely many would have followed it. Whether or not that justifies the bomb is debatable, but its not like there wasn't a reason to consider it.~~ EDIT: Freon23 says this is mostly propaganda, and [this](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article37013.html) seems to confirm that claim.

DISCLAIMER: Because this is the internet, this kind of goes without saying, but I'm no expert. I'm trying to make sense of the information I'm aware of in the hope that others will find it valuable. If anything about my explanation seems wrong, please tell me specifically what I'm getting wrong.

&gt; we know what a nuclear explosion looks like, and I'm sure anyone that has seen the effects of those weapons also knows what they can do. Anyone that had a soul would not want to develop these weapons

Yes, by this time they knew firsthand how devastating they could be, but I would disagree about there being no humane way to develop their potential. For example, EMP blasts are an extremely powerful and humane way to severely cripple an enemy. If nuclear weapons research stopped after the creation of the bomb, we would only know how to use nuclear weapons to kill people. 

There are also several [other](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon#Non-weapons_uses) non-military uses for nuclear bombs. This particular test was probably done partially to test the potential for using nuclear weapons as a method of large scale earth displacement, which could have many potential peaceful benefits, like creating harbors and destroying chemical weapons. While many of these uses appear to have more downsides than upsides, we wouldn't have known that had we not tested it.

I don't know the details of every nuclear test, and I suspect more were done than was absolutely necessary due to the large quantity of tests recorded, and I think we all know that most were intended to test their effects as weapons. I'm not sure that means we shouldn't have done those tests. While people make fun of the American reaction to the Soviets nowadays and tend to view the arms race as an international dick wagging competition (which is, from what I gather, not too far off), the Soviets were some scary, crazy-ass mofos. As disgusting as those weapons can be, I wouldn't let a power hungry sociopath get them first. For a present day comparison, imagine the US without precision weapons and only the designs for the first nuclear weapons taking the high ground and abandoning nuclear weapon research, while North Korea was left to do as they please. Personally I'd rather risk mutually assured destruction and nuclear winter than risk living in the conditions the North Koreans are forced to endure.

TL;DR While I appreciate what you're saying and suspect you know most of these arguments, sadly its not that simple. Developing nuclear weapons does not necessarily make you evil. It simply increases you chance of doing great evil.",0,t5_2qh1e,t3_17n0p1,True,3,3,,[deleted],t1_c87f3rt,,1359706154,0,c87f3rt,False,1431149501,1359710293,

IWantOut,t3_17o898,,0,"&gt; If I manage to get in to a study abroad program somewhere in the UK for a 4 year program, how would that change my ability to become a permanent resident?

A quick note: UK universities usually only have a 3 year programme, unless you don't have the grades/requirements for the course you want to take and need to do a filler year in the beginning. They can also be 4 years if you do a year abroad or in industry.

Onto the question, it won't help at all. Getting a degree in the UK vs getting one in the US doesn't help with finding a job there, which is how you'd need to become a permanent resident. As dgs1300 mentioned, the economy is pretty bad right now, and I have no clue how long it will take to pick up again, so keep that in mind. It's hard to find work out here even if you're a UK citizen, and the order of hiring is UK citizen &gt; EU citizen &gt; foreigner. The only way I can see studying in the UK might help is for degrees that they might have widely different methods across the pond (e.g. archaeology), or that you'll be able to be in the country whilst looking for a job instead of having to do it from America.

&gt; Are there any skills or subjects I need to learn in order to succeed in another country?

Skills? Don't be a typical arrogant American. Adapt to the culture and try to blend in with it. Subjects on the other hand are tricky. STEM jobs are in demand, but if you want a more specific idea look at their [shortage occupation list](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pdf), which shows what jobs you can easily get, because to find a job not on this list and get a visa for it is slightly trickier. This does not mean that if you're interested in something not on this list to pursue a career in one on the list because you'll be miserable in school. Their system is more difficult than the American one (from personal experience), and you'll hate studying something your heart isn't 100% in. Also, it's a bitch to transfer courses unless they have the same classes.

&gt; What, if anything, can I do now to help me with my goals of studying and/or living abroad later in life?

Do well in school. Take as many APs as you can without wanting to jump off a cliff, but know that the 'credits' won't transfer as they do in America because their system is different. Don't worry too much about grades (except the APs need to have a score of 3+, which is standard really) because it's more content and extras than the actual GPA. Familiarise yourself with the [Tier 4 visa](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/) and its rules. Get a list of universities and narrow it down to 5, which is the maximum you can apply to. Look at their admissions criteria and see how you match up. Be realistic with these schools, don't apply to UCL or if you're not top 10% in your class and/or have amazing test scores. Try not to look in London unless you or your family has enough money to support you, where the requirement is $1,600/month, but you'll want to aim for $2,000/month to have money to spend on fun.

And most importantly **visit England.** Sure it may look jolly good on the TV and in films, but you won't know until you visit. Get your list of unis and visit them and talk to the students when you're not on tour. I learnt more about my unis talking to the students than I did from the tour itself. Go to the supermarkets and see where they are, go to the bus station and look at the routes (you'll probably be taking a bus when you live off campus), and finally go on rightmove or zoopla and look at how expensive flats and house shares are, because you only get accommodation for the first year. Also go out at night and see how safe it is. Walk from your hotel to the city centre and back sometime around 9 pm. Figure out what people do for fun in the town, and if you have a specific interest look into it there. For instance, I like 40k. There's a 40k group that meets every Tuesday about 10 minutes away from my flat, it's great. Sure I can take the bus/train into London as it's only 1-1.5 hour journey, but it's a cost and time issue, where I'm usually too busy on the weekends.

Sorry, that's a lot. I remember as a junior I had no clue what I wanted to do, so good on you for knowing at that age. If you have any questions about it, whether they're about the geeky side of England or the visa aspect, feel free to ask.

&gt;This is obviously a lie, it makes a lot of sense to marry your daughter, so you won't have to support her.

You are thinking of this in an incredibly one-sided way. Yes, it makes sense in some circumstances for a father to marry off his daughters so he won't have to support them. *But why would you, even let's say a ""middle-class"" man living in early modern Europe, marry a young girl whose age was prohibitive to her effectively running your household and performing the labor-intensive duties of a not-upperclass wife?* Your counterpoint also *assumes* two things: that mothers did not take a serious role in helping their children find suitable marriages, and that arranged marriages were the norm among common people. Neither of these things are necessarily true. Never mind that a discussion of generalization is pretty useless in this area, because norms varied radically in time and place even within these periods.

PoliticalDiscussion,t3_17ooms,,0,"Hard to say... He was definitely a Hawk.

After reading the Wikipedia account of his Presidency, I would make the following notes:

- He cracked down hard on the steel companies for their proposed price increase, including a grand jury investigation into their possible collusion, and a number of other tactics that were definitely manipulative and bordering on coercive. 

- ""Kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and encourage growth of the economy. He presided over the first government budget to top the $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 led to the country's first non-war, non-recession deficit.""

- ""John F. Kennedy initially proposed an overhaul of American immigration policy that later was to become the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, sponsored by Kennedy's brother Senator Edward Kennedy. It dramatically shifted the source of immigration from Northern and Western European countries towards immigration from Latin America and Asia and shifted the emphasis of selection of immigrants towards facilitating family reunification. Kennedy wanted to dismantle the selection of immigrants based on country of origin and saw this as an extension of his civil rights policies.""

- ""Kennedy called his domestic program the ""New Frontier"". It ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession.""

So far, all Democratic boiler-plate, however...

-  In his 1963 State of the Union address, he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20–90% to a range of 14–65%;

-  he proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47%

- ""In 1960, Kennedy stated: ""Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom"". Subsequently as president, Kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with Israel, and he is credited as the founder of the US-Israeli military alliance.

So... standard Democrat domestic policy, more or less. Republican on tax policy (particularly with that 90% to 65% top bracket tax cut, but that's really just making an insane rate less insane), very pro- Israel, and hawkish generally speaking in foreign policy.

AskHistorians,t3_17ohn2,,0,"I'm pretty new to reddit and this is my VERY first post, but this is something I've been recently reading about. 

I think the farthest back we really need to go for this answer is the end of WW1. As another user already mentioned (sorry if there's some quick link for quotation, but I'll figure it out later) the U.S. started its course of global financing at the end of this conflict. Americans began to have more and more of the chips on the table. 

Briefly on communism: all that needs to be stated in this regard is that the ideology of communism sought to empower the people of the world against the forces that enslaved them, which mostly meant capitalism. To the early communists and socialists, the capitalist system needed reformatting, so supporting this system was essentially contra to what needed to happen. They had a new patch and wanted everyone to update, but not everyone was sold on the new version. So to communists, the conclusion of their logic could only lead to the dismantling and restructuring of the system of capitalism. This understandably made capitalists upset.

What happened after WW2 was more or less Game of Thrones. The spark that lit the ever-increasing heat of the Cold War was, in my humble opinion, Germany. The Soviet advance on German forces left huge swathes of land under the control of the USSR. Because of the communist urge to spread communism (which remember dismantled capitalism), they thought it might be a good idea to hold onto the eastern half of Germany that they currently controlled. The Allies, represented strongest by the United States, didn't like the idea of the Soviet Union owning land in the heart of Europe, a zone of money-loving oligarchs! Obviously there wasn't much of an argument to be made by either side, so no resolution was reached on Germany right away. 

Meanwhile, that whole nuclear bomb thing the U.S. pulled was sort of a big deal to a country that was gunnin' to be top dog, so the Soviets started their research into nuclear weaponry. This was again an argument that had little chance of resolution. How many duels have ever been concluded by both agents agreeing to drop their weapons at the same time?

Since no true progress could be made there, the USSR and the US decided to spread ideological support throughout the world instead of confront each other globally. Similar analogies may be viewed at any local high school. the US wanted friends so they did cool shit for some people if they promised not to be friends with that dumb jerk Soviet Union. Sometimes these new friends would fight each other (Korea, Vietnam, Guatemala, Cuba, etc.), so the US and USSR would give them the tools, but would never throw blows directly at each other. 

Long answer short: since communism and capitalism were ideologically incompatible, the fight to contain or diminish communist influence globally seemed at least like a good idea to the potential targets of a communist uprising.

stocks,t3_17opvx,,0,"Hey there!  

In order to buy any number of stocks in any company, you will need a broker - a middleman who places your order for you (you couldn't order directly from a cook in a restaurant, right? Think of a broker as your waiter). 

There are 2 types of brokers:

Online - Simply put, a website. Go to the site, enter the stock symbol you'd like to purchase, and click ""Buy"" after funding your account. You will likely get charged a small, flat fee per trade (mine charges $10 per trade, to give you an idea) - but whether you buy 1 or 1,000 shares, the fee will not change. It is by purchase (double-check with your broker).

Most online brokers have various tools you can use to research stocks and mutual funds so that you can make an informed decision as to what to buy.


Traditional - This is what I imagine you're currently thinking of when you use the word, ""broker."" This is the guy or company you go and visit, and they actively manage your money for you by buying and selling stocks they see fit. They take a commission fee (a percentage, I believe), and you get what's left. 

Europe has its own stock market, so that will not be a problem. 

As for having to buy a minimum number of stocks, the USA does not have any such rule - you can buy 1 or 1,000. In Japan (where I currently live), you are often required to buy a minimum number of stocks  (whether this is due to company regulations or the Japanese stock market as a whole, I do not know). The rules likely vary depending where you are - maybe try Googling that one, or waiting for someone from the EU to respond.

Hope this was clear - but I'd be happy to clarify if anything wasn't! I'd suggest some brokers, but in Europe I really have no idea. Sorry about that. ",0,t5_2qjfk,t3_17opvx,True,4,4,,delveccio,t1_c87fstl,,1359711839,0,c87fstl,False,1431149829,False,

AskHistorians,t1_c87f9ma,,0,"Actually, Liberia very much had to deal with conquest during the Scramble for Africa (late 19th century). True, it wasn't military conquest, but Britain and France worked very hard to grab land in the country and were quite successful. In 1885, Britain forced Liberia into a boundary agreement that set the Sierra Leone border at the River Mano, which was a not insignificant loss of land for Liberia. The French did something similar by annexing a large portion of south-east Liberia. 

And there's definitely evidence that America didn't do a whole lot to prevent this. In 1890 and 1892 the Liberian government sent appeals to Washington and London to "" obtain their commitment to the preservation of Liberia's territorial integrity"" [(UNESCO's General History of Africa, Volume VII)](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/general-history-of-africa/volumes/complete-edition/volume-vii-africa-under-colonial-domination-1880-1935/#c181028). In both cases, neither nation would commit to anything. In fact, in 1907 the US supported France in taking a large section of land beyond the Makona river as their own. 

In conclusion, though there was no real military conflict in Liberia, the country very much had to deal with resisting European colonialism, basically without the help of Western allies.

The problem with this thinking is that it undermines major criticisms of the Government. If we find ourselves in a cycle of instantly assuming the Government are part of some evil conspiracy in whatever it does, it actually enables it to hide the actual concerning things because all criticism gathers together in some big cloud of 'oh I hate the Government - no matter what'. We need to be logical and serious with our arguments. One real criticism here is why are we reducing the Armed Forces budget and simultaneously offering support to further regions?

You could even have a point if you were to suggest that the UK is sending it's troops to teach the Milanese troops how to fight so we train them on our weapons systems so we can sell them there instead of American or Chinese. No idea if that's true, but if you were to suggest that i'd think 'meh, there's a logic there' but a rogue BBC article about small cotton plantations is not really enough to convince me, sorry. 

What we are seeing is the increasing spread of fundamentalism right across the Middle East into N. Africa, and networks are beginning to penetrate Europe and the US. We are at war, but this one shouldn't be fought with guns. We are using our traditional 'well if we kill enough of them, they wont be able to fight' logic which may work in war where there's an army, a definitive number of individuals who if we kill enough of, are immobilised. Things are a little different though when those people are little teams who aren't connected but at the same time are.  

I hold my hands up and say that I don't know how to resolve this problem. I think communication and dissemination of information and empowerment of the grass roots seems logical, but ultimately, I don't know - i'm not smart enough unfortunately.

President Obama Commemorates the ‘Senseless’ Holocaust  
By Eliana Johnson  
  


President Obama issued a statement yesterday to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. He noted that survivors who bore witness to “the horrors of the cattle cars, ghettos, and concentration camps have witnessed humanity at its very worst and know too well the pain of losing loved ones to senseless violence.” (We noted below how some in Europe chose to mark the day, which takes place each year on January 27, the day Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz.)

The idea that all violence is “senseless” violence is one that has taken deep root on the left; it’s also, unfortunately, one that poses a major impediment to understanding the world.  

Nazism may have been an ideology to which the United States was — and to which the president is — implacably opposed, **but it is hardly “senseless.”** By the early 1930s, the Nazi party had hundreds of thousands of devoted members and repeatedly attracted a third of the votes in German elections; its political leaders campaigned on a platform comprising **25 non-senseless points**, including the “unification of all Germans,” a demand for “land and territory for the sustenance of our people,” and an assertion that “no Jew can be a member of the race.” Suffice it to say, **many sensible Germans were persuaded**. 

On September 12, 2012, President Obama also lamented the “the kind of senseless violence that took the lives” of four Americans in Benghazi. That, you may recall, is the day the president supposedly said the murders occurred as a result of a non-senseless terrorist attack carried out by jihadists. 

This sanitized version of events, both past and present, is surely more comforting. It’s also truly senseless.

From what I've read about it, I doubt there was much political will to do so. Chiang Kai-Shek was hostile to the US, he hadn't proven a very reliable ally in WWII (and he and General Stilwell seemed to have a strong mutual loathing), their graft, corruption and incompetence was well-known in Washington by the end of WWII. Add to which, the 'Generalissimo' had become increasingly totalitarian and by then had abandoned even the pretense of working towards democracy. 

To me, it seems almost more remarkable that the US supported the KMT to the extent that they did. With Europe in ruins and countries still under occupation, there was certainly a lot of things that might've had greater priority than propping up an ungrateful dictator. Perhaps they were betting on replacing him in a coup once the communists were defeated? At the very least, Chiang himself thought that the US was behind several coup attempts against him.

* Standard landline or mobile on the same network: Will count against your free minutes and not cost a lot to call otherwise
* Mobile on a different network: Will count against your free minutes but historically might cost more otherwise
* Everything else (non-geographic landline numbers like premium rate lines, or overseas, or whatever, probably not usable with inclusive minutes and price will vary from case to case)",0,t5_2sokd,t3_17nxts,True,1,1,,frymaster,t1_c87ged5,,1359717748,0,c87ged5,False,1431150109,False,

### TL;DR
If you had done the math, own3d was probably losing money on every viewer hour watched, more viewers means losing more money.

### They fucked up because they could not control their costs.
Their strategy meant their cost structure was higher. One gets the impression that they have insufficient internal controls to *measure* and find ways to reduce costs.

1. They did not default to 360p early enough (or at all?), when I watched own3d everything was defaulted to HD. Twitch.tv defaults to 360p, load up incognito/privacy mode in your browser, and everything you view will be 360p if you don't change it. This is critical to control your costs. Twitch was especially clever, unintentionally?, by not calling the highest res ""HD"" which own3d did, as there's more epeen bonus from viewing in ""HD"". 
    Let's do the math on what the difference means. We [assume $0.02 per GB costs](http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2012/09/cdn-pricing-stable-survey-data-shows-pricing-down-15-this-year.html) for their CDN (resolution bitrate measured in bits, transfer measured in bytes, it's just convention.)

    Resolution|Transfer/hour for 1000 viewers|Cost per hour (0.02/GB)
    |:---|:---|:---
    700kbps/360p|307GB|$6.15
    5000kbps/1080p|2197GB|$43.95
    
    This means that 1000 viewers watching a stream for an hour costs own3d $6.15 if they were all 360p, and $43.95 if they were 1080p. That's an enormous difference. Obviously, not all 1080p streams were pushing 5000kb/s, but even at 3000kbit/s, we're looking at many multiple higher costs, I'm also using the 700kbit/s transcode bitrate that twitch uses, own3d was probably somewhat comparable. Not defaulting to lower resolutions is INSANE. If you can get 2/3 of your viewers to default to lower resolutions in the flash player because they don't care or don't know any better, why not? Many viewers probably don't fullscreen their streams, there's not point in pushing 1080p to them.
    
    Another possible solution to encourage lower resolutions (that I am surprised Twitch isn't pursuing), would be to straight up deny clients that have adblock from using higher-cost resolutions. They tried to block HD for those using adblock earlier, but were unsuccessful or gave up. Hulu is able to do it, there's no reason own3d cannot try as well. It might be a couple of hours work a week, but they can probably make up the labor costs in a couple hours. People might moan and complain, but they get over these things because #ESPORTS (cough), the remainder would be stuck with 480p and deal with it.

2. They could have run their streaming platform and servers themselves. Twitch.tv runs their own servers, this is why Europeans and Australians had troubles with Twitch. Own3d outsources their streaming providers to Limelight Networks, Level3, and Edgecast. They don't own their streaming servers, they let someone else handle it. This is great if your traffic is bursty (see: Riot LoL events), but sucks when you've got baseline traffic, which is the overwhelming majority of the case. The smart way to move would be to self-host baseline traffic and to burst to more expensive CDNs during major spikes and areas which have bad coverage (this is what Netflix is increasingly doing). 
    It's especially ridiculous that they didn't pursue this strategy because they have a good way to measure performance, they have a flash client for god's sake, it's pretty easy to switch between servers, and to switch over to different networks based on performance — in fact, this can be a bit of a competitive advantage and gives your company much greater value from the technology/IP from automatic discovery of cheapest bandwidth. Programming in some logic on the viewer can make things very interesting, had they decided to roll their own network with supplemental CDNs.
    Let's look at the cost structure difference between CDNs and rolling your own for 1000 viewers 24 hours per day per month on 5000kbps/1080p at a CDN rate of $0.02/GB:
    
    Host|Cost per 1000viewers/month|Maths
    |:---|:---|:---
    Roll your own|$5000|1000viewers * 5mbit/s * $1/mbit/month
    3rd-party CDN|$31640.63|1000viewers * 5mbit/s ÷ 8mbits/byte ÷ 1024MB/GB * 86400seconds/day * 30days * $0.02/GB
    
    HOLY SHIT, right? There are some upfront server costs, as well as power and cross connects for the rack (you're realistically only adding about a thousand dollars or so per month), but considering you can get HE or Cogent traffic for $0.50-0.75/mbit for a long term contract instead of the $1/mbit I used it's fair to ignore that. You can pay for a rack full of servers in 1 month with costs like that.
    
    Here's the kicker, we're assuming that own3d is competent and is able to pull $0.015 to $0.02 current wholesale prices for CDN traffic. What if they were thoroughly incompetent and paid $0.04 to $0.06, which is what non-negotiated prices from places like Amazon S3 would cost? There's no price sheet, it's different for everyone, but it's entirely possible that they're paying double my guess of $0.02. That would be a MASSIVE fuckup if that were the case, on the other hand if they were clever they might be able to get sub $0.01 but I'm not sure they can do that with streaming traffic, they might be able to with VODs.

### More viewers meant losing money faster!
Their revenue share model meant that they were expecting net revenues after streamer revshare of around $0.004 per commercial watched (50-50 or 60-40 share in favor of streamer according to the parter program promo materials on their website). On paper this may sound good, but let's calculate it out with an average of 6 commercials per hour — streamers can't spam commercials, or else they run out the ad inventory and fill rates go down. $0.004*6 commercials per hour while 1080p is about 2GB/hour which is $0.04, so we're looking at revenues of $0.024 per viewer with costs of $0.04 per viewer in HD/1080p. Whoops, they're losing money on every single HD viewer, including those who view ads. 360p, on the other hand, is of course profitable on a variable cost basis. There was also gnashing about fill rates (percent of people actually getting ads) last year, and I suspect they're getting lower fills now. Own3d probably has more Eastern European and Asian viewers as well (competitive advantage from using CDNs, but costs way more), but Eastern Europe/Korea are Tier 2 markets and get lower ad fill/rates, so it's not exactly something to boast about. Add in half the viewers using adblock or mobile devices, and you've got a recipe for disaster. There's no way their margins could cover this if they had a fill rate of 25%, and if half the viewers are using adblock and even more viewing on their ipads/phones, 25% isn't that improbable. They also pay for employee salaries, website/hosting, VODs (which more than likely lose money), etc. They also go months at a time with very little ad inventory, such as right after the winter holidays.

Sure, topline growth is important, but sometimes that's outside your control. It's hard to ascribe a company failing due to an inability to attract advertisers in a new (albeit exiting and growing) market. 

Controlling per-unit costs with easy wins such as investing in infrastructure by rolling their own streaming servers seemed like a big win, but perhaps they didn't have the in-house experience. It's far easier to see where it failed than to execute, and from seeing later successes from companies that have failed, I'm sure the employees from own3d had a lot of lessons-learned and will make their future endeavors much more successful.

### Because of an inability control costs, own3d looks like a moneypit to potential investors.
The joke in the SF startup community for companies with bad/nonexistent monetization strategies is, ""We lose money on every sale, but make it up on volume."" The weird thing is, that can actually work — assuming you're in the growth phase and seeking top-line growth to justify further funding. It runs on the assumption that growth is more important than profitability, you can always ""milk the cow"" when you've gotten big and outgrown your competition. However, it's a fine line and a bit like playing with nitroglycerin, as in the case with Own3d showed, if you can't get the VC funding, it's game over. From the VC perspective, it makes sense to encourage this behavior, as you can diversify by investing in many different companies that shoot for the moon, which will maximize fat-tailed risk-return profiles (this is the key!!!). I suspect own3d business model didn't look viable because their margins weren't improving and wasn't clear that it could scale. Losing money when the upper bound in this industry is advertising, and the drama over fill rates shows they had growth scalability issues, a major red flag if you're going the swing-the-fences-profitability-be-damned strategy. One, or the other is fine (see: twitch), but if own3d is bleeding MORE red ink, without showing a commensurate growth in their customers (see: advertisers), it's no surprise they had to close up shop, it was just a matter of when.

### FUNFACT
If you had watched 24 hour per day at 5000kbit/s HD and turned on adblock with an estimated cost of $0.02/GB, you would have personally cost own3d around $350 for watching streams over one year (2GB/hour * 24hours * 365 days * 0.02/GB).",0,t5_2rfxx,t3_17otcd,True,70,70,,hail__eris,t1_c87gfmu,,1359718086,0,c87gfmu,False,1431150126,1359721643,

The stops are usually around 3-5 minutes, depending on the size of the place.

There's no check-in or security - you just you can arrive at the station as your train is pulling in, and just step on. Tickets get checked on board. The only place they have airline style security is for the Eurostar under the English Channel.

The timetables are all posted online - you tend not to catch a high speed train at random, it's usually a more thought-out journey. Most of the small towns are accessible through local rail services, so you catch the high speed train to the nearest hub, and the local train from there. 

Speeds vary dramatically depending on the type of track and the terrain - when you're winding through valleys, it's slowish, but on the good tracks and open plains, it's very VERY fast. Top speed on an average line is about 120 mph, and the fastest I've seen is 200 mph.

It's not about the waitresses showing a bit of flesh. It's about the way they interact with costumers. I know that coming from Europe the waiters style in USA is a shock (too friendly and demanding of attention), but hooters was even more strange. There was too much flirting, too much lonely guys seeking attention from attractive women for a tip, too much siting at tables, and too much showing the goods. It was really strange and we all described it as being close to prostitution interaction. Not that they do anything, but the way waitresses speak, flirt, the body language and how they talk with costumers is really close to how prostitutes talk to you in Europe to try to lure you in. 

We had a discussion afterwards about it, is this a step backwards because of objectification of women and exploiting the loneliness of men? or is it a step forward in normalization of human desire and attention seeking making it profitable in a capitalistic system? just a place to vent and get your ""feminine attention fix"". We didn't get to a conclusion.

It didn't help that we were surrounded by a table of a 21 years old birthday, a few tables of two ""bro's"" fighting for the attention of the waitress, and my personal favorite a table of a Muslim family, mother and daughter in hiyab.

It's a fact that the majority of militaries in Europe are simply not fit for purpose.  There's eight strategic airlift planes in the entire EU, all of them belonging to Britain.  Without British or American help, the rest of the EU's military has to make do with co-opting civilian aircraft of has to stay within the EU's borders, twiggling their thumbs.

The biggest danger about falling behind is team morale dropping. Don't be the player that AFKs in fountain, spams surrender votes, or says GG after every lost fight.""

In my honest opinion this is Bullshit 95% of the time. First of all there is a reason that you are as behind as you are, and it's the way you and your team have been playing up until this point. There is no evidence to suggest that you suddenly start playing better and even if you did the enemy is still ahead. Second people need to learn to read the game. What do I mean?

IWantOut,t1_c87gv2y,,0,"Hmm, as far as I understand (and do really check into this) once you finish university in Canada you do get the chance to look for work but this has an expiry date(I think up to 2 years) -. I've only met/worked with one person who did that from Nigeria and he finished school at Waterloo university in Ontario - he was able to get a work permit right after. However before I give you false information(if this rule has been changed) please double check with the Canadian Embassy here in Sweden. 

In Canada there is no bullshit thing like queue points, pretty much look online and you'll find something. However you do have to deal with LCBO = System Bolaget but with better prices and decent opening hours. For a good uni I can recommend Guelph University. Toronto is 1 hr bus ride away and it's a small city but it's a student city like Uppsala but way better IMO. Much more student stuff to do and the University is one big Campus  5-10 minutes from downtown Guelph center. Be warned Jobs are hard to come by in Guelph.  If you really wanna be safe You can go to school/live in Waterloo or Kitchener. Waterloo/Kitchener is two different cities that are right next to each other (you can walk, drive, ride a bike between them). They are a bit farther away from Toronto however.

I'm sorry this seems like a novel, but these are all facts you should consider(assuming you really want to move out of Sweden). Canada is a pro-active country. What I mean by this is that the people who come to Canada make an effort to be there, they work and they work hard. Yes they pay taxes, they have good services but the country does work. Not to slam Sweden but honestly the lazyness I've seen here wont cut it in Canada. If you really wanna go be prepared to open up to people, talk to them, work hard and you will make  good life. The immediate downside I can see to Canada(Ontario area) it is expensive in Toronto. Not Stockholm prices but for the working student it is a bit difficult.  Canada has opportunities and it is a big and beautiful country, but I warn you come with a driver's license as well ( getting a license in Canada is run by a private horrible company that likes to fail people to meet quota's).  Scope out areas you would like to live and go to school, and check what's around. It is a big multi-cultural country be open-minded talk to other Canadians as well. I lived in Toronto, Waterloo/Kitchener and Guelph. All in Ontario and from friends and family I have been told that British Columbia  and Vancouver are far more expensive than Ontario.

explainlikeimfive,t3_17otz0,,0,"How did it split up?

Korea had a civil war, China backed the communists and America naturally backed the capitalists. China and the communists held the north and America held the South. An agreement was made that the dividing line between the nations would be held on the 38th parallel. 

Why is it so poor?

A government that centralizes the wealth at the very top. The poor barely have enough to survive, and in many cases don't and starve to death. They don't know what the world outside looks like, and they are lead to believe that North Korea and its leader is the most glorious nation on the planet. They don't rebel as the army is massive, and nobody would be able to threaten it.

Military is relatively advanced, if invaded they would put up one hell of a fight. Think Japan in WW2 mixed with the Viet Cong in the Vietnam war. It would be a very dirty war for anyone that would try to invade. Also if anyone invaded China would back them up, hence why the USA/South Koea has never gone in. They keep spending on the military as well they do need to protect themselves, if North Korea was weak the South would certainly attempt to invade. 

Long term plan is just to have a number of nuclear warheads, but never to use them. The nukes increase their bargaining power and make sure no country would ever try invade.

Why is cooperation with the west not an option? Well quite simple there are many who feel the west has consistently fucked them over, impoverished nations and stolen their wealth. Which to be fair it definitely has. On paper North Korea fights the tyranny of capitalism.

There won't be a war. If America invaded North Korea, China and Russia would back up the North Koreans with everything they have. America is no longer vastly superior to other nations that it can push the world around like it used to. Everything America does from now on will come with resistance from China and Russia. And if comes down to it America will back down. Europe has no interest in assisting America try and hold on to power so their historic allies are no longer there. Look at the recent Japan-China breakdown of relations and how the USA didn't back up Japan, the USA won't be as aggressive as it was in the past. No more removing democratically elected presidents and replacing them with dictators.

Also North Korea isn't going to do anything, all this is just posturing. If they have nuclear arms they would just use them to prevent any attack on their soil. Look at it from their perspective, the largest and most powerful nation on the planet wants you dead, you have a right to be scared.

pics,t3_17nvfk,,0,"European transport economist here. This plan is NOT feasible and a bad idea. As much as I love HSRail, it has a very very specific use, which will fit horribly in the states. For a HSRail line to work well you need:

- The right distance. 250km to 650km are more or less the limits of what makes sense. Less than 250km and people will prefer to drive. More than 650km and it's better to fly. With 400km you are in the sweet spot, it takes 1:30 by HSRail, 4 hours by car, and flying it's 45 minute flight, but with one hour to get to the airport, one hour waiting and one hour to get to your final destination, so you still save quite a bit of time. Which pairs of big cities in the US are about 400 km away?

- The right price. Yes, HSRail lines are expensive, but they can cost from 12 million euro per km to 25 million per km. If the terrain is not easy, costs can make the whole thing go to hell. Building a HSRail line in an already built up area is pretty much impossible.

- Enough traffic. You need to link with the line two cities which are big enough, to be able to have a significant potential demand. That would mean two cities that are 2-3 million people each at least.

- Advantages against cars. In Europe, gas is pretty expensive, so 400km by car will cost you at least 20-25€ in gas, so paying 70€ for a train ticket is more reasonable. With the cheap gas in the US, the difference is bigger.

- Local public transport. HSRail is better than the car only if you don't need a car in your destination. For that you need good local public transport, good bus and metro systems. That is commonplace in Europe, but not in the US.

So, sorry to be that guy, but HSRail is a bad idea for the US, at least the way things are now.

Out salary cap ensures that as long as our league keeps improving, our players will be some of the most valuable on the transfer market.  If any of our players are good enough to get a look from a first division team (and it seems like there are more and more who are good enough every transfer window), teams in Europe will be able to afford to offer them more money than we can.  

The transfer fees that we've seen this year have been big money for MLS, but not really breaking the bank for the teams they have gone to.  I expect the exodus of MLS best players, or at least most promising young players, to continue well into the future.  

The good news is that the draft will balance these losses.  The talent coming in from the draft is also improving every year.  Not to mention the experienced players that are coming to MLS are getting younger and younger.  I don't mind being a selling league for a while if we can pool those resources and begin competing financially for bigger name players who are still in their prime.

auckland,t3_17owyq,,0,"It is worth it. But you should take a lot of care.

Auckland drivers tend to be very aggressive and impatient. Most of them don't cycle, and don't understand why cyclists do things the way that they (cyclists) do. 

Auckland roads are designed with soley  drivers in mind. After years of driving on such roads, drivers have been conditioned into being not so mindful of other road users. This results in drivers becoming very aggressive, impatient and sometimes downright violent when they have to slow down or think about how to share the road.

I don't know what it's like in european cities. But in Auckland, often the safest thing to do is to hog a whole lane, so that cars can see you clearly and can't pass you. This stops you from getting killed, but it can get drivers really angry, because they don't understand why you are doing it. And they just can't handle adding a few more seconds to their travel time. So hog a lane when you have to. But be prepared to put up with verbal abuse and threats.

I'm not slamming all Auckland drivers though. Much, if not most of the time that I've been cycling, as long as I've been highly visible I've noticed most drivers actively thinking about my presence on the road that I'm sharing with them, and noticed them thinking about how to drive in a way that has my safety in mind. But visibility is the key here.

Most of the problems I've had have been with drivers that haven't noticed me. 

If a driver is frustrated with your presence, this can be a good thing. It means that they know you are there. And that means that they are less likely to kill you.

AskHistorians,t3_17oifv,,0,"Everybody has heard of the Alamo, the 300, Vercingetorix’s last stand at Alesia and the other legendary, back to the wall battles. I would like to share a little known (even in India) battle that was just as heroic nonetheless.

The Battle of Rezang La: The last position of C Company, 13 Kumaon Regiment of the Indian National Army.
On November 17th, 1962, 120 soldiers from C company take up positions in Rezang La (a pass) to defend against an expected Chinese incursion. This company was broken up into 3 platoons- 7, 8 &amp; 9 platoons. They set up a defensive parameter, barbed wire and mined their positions. Identified potential avenues of incursion and set up mg positions best suited to catch the invaders in a cross fire. Just doing minimal work like walking…was a challenge, 18,000 feet up in the Himalayas, To put things into perspective, the tallest mountain in Europe- Mt Elbrus stands about 5,500 feet tall. It being winter, the temperatures could dip to as low as -25, factor in thin air….breathing by itself was a painful task. The post was a forward post, and given the nature of the terrain it could not be defended in depth, and the line was rather linear. Essentially, if the Chinese broke through their front, it was GG time for the Indian soldiers. 

Sentries were posted on guard duty and the men settled in for the night. The veterans, quite simply went into a sound sleep, but most of the men were too nervous, they sat by the heaters in their tents writing letters to their loved ones, and dozed off into a fitful slumber. 

Their C/O, constantly on rounds, keeping the morale of the men up, chatting with them, sharing a cup of chai, a dash of rum to keep the cold out did not have the time or luxury to sit back and relax. His C/O, Brigade Commander, Brigadier Raina had called him aside before he left for Rezang la, and openly confided in him. The post was important tactically, but not strategically, artillery support and air support had been switched to other more vital sectors, but if the Chinese got through at Rezang la, it would spell disaster for the Brigade, as they would then gain access to a road that kept the brigade in supply. His parting words still rang in Shaitan’s ears – “Major, you might not have air support, you might not have arty or reinforcements from division, but what you have….is your honour, and your promise to the flag. What you have are 120 men, fight…fight to the last man, and to the last round, Jai Hind”.

He gathered his men together at dawn, and offered them the choice, they could leave…with honour, those who wanted too, could simply withdraw to the rear. Not a single one of them took up the Major on his offer, they simply said that they have the blessings of Lord Krishna, and they will only be carried out from Rezang la, but never leave it on their own two feet.

Come the morning of the 18th of November, at 0500 in the morning, whistles blow across the from the Chinese side, the men from 13 Kumaon…are ready and at their positions, some are happy that atleast for once, Military intelligence was not just an oxymoron, but they actually managed to predict the location and date of the offensive rather accurately. 

The attack went in, it was approximately half a division (about 5,000 men) supported by heavy artillery, the Chinese, using the doctrine of the human wave, first attempted multiple frontal assaults, which were repulsed with heavy losses. They tried again, a 4th wave, the defenders numbers were thinning out. 

The defense might have lacked depth, but the Chinese were attacking across very difficult terrain and up a massive slope, in arctic conditions. They too did not lack for bravery, and charged like men possessed at the Indian positions. Hukam Chand and his LMG mowed them down. The Chinese officer in command decided to change his tactics, they found a small path that lead to the rear of the Indian position, and pushed through about 700 of their troops quickly into the Indian rear. Platoon 8, reversed its position and fought…again, outnumbered and out gunned.

The Chinese reached the Indian lines, and it became a brutal bayonet to bayonet combat, however the thick parkas they wore meant Indian bayonets weren’t penetrating. Naik (private) Singh Ram – a giant of a man and a wrestler to boot, decided to drop his bayonets and fight with his bare hands, he simply caught hold of 2 Chinese soldiers, and bashed their heads in by smashing them. The eventual happened, 8 platoon  went down…to a last man. The Chinese, honorable opponents that they were, recognized the bravery of the men fighting them, and sank a bayonet in the ground near his head and put a helmet on top as a mark of the man’s bravery.

With 1/3rd of their troop completely destroyed, suffering from causalities and running low on ammo, Major Shaitan Singh realized that true to his ethos, he and his troop would have died defending…to the last man, and the last round, but he wanted this tale to get out…to inspire generations of his countrymen so he summoned his radio man, Sergeant Nihal Singh and told him to get back to HQ and warn them that the Chinese had broken through, but it was too late, the enemy had broken through. 7 Platoon went down fighting, to the last man, and 9 platoon was holding out in the company HQ. The major made Nihal promise that he too would not go down fighting, but break through the Chinese cordon and escape to tell the tale of the 120.

The resourceful Sergeant did precisely as he was told, but while making his escape, he saw his beloved commander, Major Shaitan Singh go down fighting. Resolved not to let the Chinese touch his body, he tied himself to the Major’s body and rolled down a slope. He made his way to Brigade HQ and told the tale, the tale of the 123. The army being the army, he was then sent up the food chain till he reached New Delhi. There, the generals in charge refused to believe his tale and threatened to court martial him for his audacity to lie so much. He stuck to his guns, the thought of the brave sacrifice of his comrades going in vain pained him and not matter the pressure, he refused to budge from his stance.

An enquiry then found his tale to be true, of the 120 men who marched into battle that day, 118 died. 2 men got away, and only because their commander had trusted them with a sacred mission.
This battle was strategically important too, the Chinese offensive stalled, as otherwise it might have reached the strategically important position of Chushul and then threatening the entire front, however the sacrifice of C Company meant that the division had time to guage the movement of the Chinese and then fortify Chushul threby preventing the line from folding.

In hindsight….Army intelligence did prove to be a bit of an oxymoron.

If you are looking for a clan visit http://tw.tghq.org/ [tw.tghq.org] and sign up. You only need a mic or a laptop for teamspeak. It doesn't matter which platform or from where are you - we have it all coverd.
 
First you will need to go to ''join tg'' and then fill out the application form. All that I ask from you that you write in the box ''reffered'' (how did you hear about us) write that SLO_Defib sent you. After you fill it out you will have to wait at maximum 24 hours to get a respoce via e-mail. You will find all the information you need on the registering in on the website.
 
If you get accepted you first need to complete the BC (bootcamp - a test with 43 answers about TG. All you need to do is open the study document in another window/tab and find the answers) and then you will be asigned to a squad. All that you need to do then is attend 2 practises a week (if you miss thoes you can attend one of the 2 optional).
 
About TG: 
TG was created in November 2004 to bring together like-minded gamers from around the globe and from multiple platforms, to provide them Head Quarters (web site) where they can share their backgrounds, experience, and interests in teamwork and tactics. With our Warfare and Sports franchises, we have over 1800+ active members.
 We have fully stocked battalions for the Battlefield series (PC, PS3 and 360) for US/EU/AUS. If you've been looking for that clan with a large group of people from the same timezone as you, you have found it! :)
 You will be assigned to a squad with which you can practice with, and if you want, you can join a Competitive Squad .
 Our clan lives off of a 12 man ACTIVE squad system at the base level (each squad has its own platoon), with 2 or more fireteams in each squad. You can be assured all of these members will be very active and always at your side in matches. We are a military based clan, and require dedication, a mic, and the ability to communicate. We are NOT some random clan which you join on a whim and then go inactive until some bored administrator kicks you.
 If you sign up for us you will be tested on your ability to note what we stand for, before we accept you.

politics,t1_c87c904,,0,"&gt;I don't consider decimating currency value nor do I consider pegging this, and the inevitable capital flight which would occur, to be a good exchange for sustained deficit spending.

Heh, Japan. 

And we've seen what austerity provides by looking overseas. Its failing everywhere its been tried.

&gt;You asked what the effect of high debt were, I provided a source that investigates the effect debt overhangs have on growth. You first rejected that debt overhangs occured at all on government and then on currency issuers even though the source I provided covered modern fiat issuers.

So the US has exploded its deficit, yet has no problems borrowing and neither does Japan. Where are the bond vigilantes? And you seem to believe that high debt automatically devalues the currency. Again, that isn't happening in Japan, that has been stuck with near deflation for two decades.

Austerity is failing badly in Europe. The UK is entering what looks like a triple dip. Greece and Italy are instituting austerity and it didn't cause people to want to want to lend to them (they don't control their currency, so this is a real issue to them). This is almost certainly because austerity has savaged their GDP, causing potential lenders to look at them as a bad investment, precisely the opposite effect of what you seem to believe would give the bond markets more confidence. Contrast that with the US, which saw increasing debt and increasing GDP and lowering unemployment. Until recently, our government has allowed debt to grow in response to the economic woes. But we just raised the payroll tax again and this mornings unemployment numbers, big surprise, are inching upward again. 

I think the relationships are clear in recent history. Countries that institute austerity are failing. Those that aren't are doing better. Has it occurred to you and the Peterson folks that people just don't have the currency to sustain aggregate demand?

To paraphrase what you said: The United States of America  has a GDP equal to 88% of the GDP of the European Union (a/k/a United States of Europe). 

That's pretty impressive when you think about the fact that:
- Europe suffered through two devastating world wars and took decades to recover
-They absorbed several post-Soviet states with moderate success
-They lack the organizational efficiency of having a common language
-They provide paid parental leave to all citizens
-Most Europeans get at least 3 weeks of vacation by law, Americans are provided 0 weeks by law.

I'll take those benefits any day of the week.

They will always have [Breda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redhead_Day). :)

&gt; rejecting sharia law in Europe is something everybody can get behind, ridiculous as this perceived threat may be

Sharia is a type of threat. Not because Muslims will take the children, rape the wives, and burn the houses of Daily Mail readers, but in the sense that (any) dynamic interest groups shouldn't be allowed to create parallel legal structures in secular societies with established judicial branches. The most worrying aspect in this case is that it restricts the rights of vulnerable members of the Muslim communities. While it is true that they have the option to use civil courts, the peer pressure is huge and they don't want to be seen as traitors, eventually thrown out of their cultural environment and becoming outcasts. Even one woman finding herself in this position is one too many.

I was reading this a while ago:

http://news.yahoo.com/divorce-cases-could-soon-settled-under-sharia-law-095516943.html

&gt; Divorce settlements by religious courts including Sharia could soon be allowed under British law after a landmark legal decision. The move comes after a High Court referred a couple's divorce case for settlement under Beth Din, or Jewish law. According to the Times, it is the first time in British legal history when an English family judge has agreed to refer a divorce dispute to a religious court.

In the end, it's not about Sharia, Beth Din, or similar structures. This brings us back to the original issue: although the population of many modern nation states accepts immigration as a natural human phenomenon, respecting cultural sensitivities while integrating remains a difficult balancing act.",0,t5_2qh4j,t3_17kfby,True,1,1,,krattr,t1_c87hujz,,1359728026,0,c87hujz,False,1431150842,1359759518,

AskHistorians,t1_c87eyjb,,0,"I can't agree more. Being loyal/disloyal to Moscow and following the directives overruled everything.

So, since WWII, Stalin picked up the old russian expansionist policy right where the tsar has left it. 

One of the most obvious sign was that they diverted substantial military resources to Rumania, Hungary and the Balkans, instead of focusing on the shortest way to Germany, through Poland.

An important first step being Central Europe, where they helped on power those communists, who were loyal to them and sidelined everyone (on the left) who has shown any kind of independent thinking.

In Yugoslavia Tito was able to hold on his power thanks to his popularity. This led to being called a traitor and Yugoslavia ended up on the other side of the iron curtain.

In the 1956 revolution in Hungary, the new government was led by Imre Nagy, who among other things was Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1953 to 1955. So we cannot say he was a counterrevolutionary or capitalist or anything else, but during he showed signs of independent thinking and during the revolution proclaimed Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact.

In 1968 in Czechoslovakia, the communist leaderhip showed signs of independent thinking, introduced some reforms and it ended up in the ""friendly help"" of their communist neighbours in the form of military invasion.

Che Guevara showed signs of independent thinking, even from Fidel. Thanks to that, Moscow prohibited to the bolivian communists to help him.

The souring of soviet-sino relationships and a border clash after Beijing refused to recognize the supremacy of Moscow.

OK, no more examples.

My point is, during the cold war, from Moscows point of view the communist parties were not members of some kind of world liberation movements, but the agents of Soviet interests and expansion, in the moment they diverted from this line they were in trouble.

From the first russian expansions onwards Russia and later the Soviet Union was an aggressively expanding empire, who had to face many enemies from mongols through the british and finally the U.S. They were reasonably successful and reached the rank of superpower, but it ended abruptly.

And to answer OP's question: the proxy wars were fought to contain this expansion.

PoliticalHumor,t1_c87c8is,,0,"&gt; Don't forget that we were the masters of a global empire during both the first and second world wars, the Germans had no chance in either beyond the initial blitzkreig (it is generally agreed that the Germans fell because of the Russians, not the Americans, and they lost their chance at taking the UK when they canned operation sea lion (hitler was a moron), because after that the UK was too well fortified and they simply didn't have the manpower).

Hardly masters, when the Japanese attacked throughout the Pacific, the British abandoned their cousins in Australia, and we had to help defend a portion of your 'empire'.

&gt; As for food and the like, the UK was (and pretty much still is) food self-sufficient. We actually only finished paying off your ""help"" during the war in 2006 :)

[During the 1st World War, German U-boats were so effective, the UK was down to a 6 weeks supply of food.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom#World_War_I)

In the 2nd World War, help from the US again helped you all out.

&gt; And because you guys were such total dicks after the war and wouldn't ship food to Germany, we retained rationing in the UK until 1952 so we could import food from the USA to ship to Germany. Also on the subject of USA-were-dicks, the USA charged Germany for their occupation, a fee which actually outweighed the money provided under the Marshall plan. They dismantled and stole German factories and laboratories as payment.

Of course they charged them.  But unlike you folks who instituted Versaille upon the Germans and helped percipitate the 2nd World War, we actually rebuilt and defended them from the USSR.

As usual, the US had to come in and sort European affairs out.

ottawa,t1_c87cjwn,,0,"Ok, that may be true regarding the rural land, although the rural land you speak of could include the Greenbelt which does separate the more urban areas (Kanata, Orleans, Barrhaven; which I know are suburbs, but are significantly more built up than for example Richmond) from each other. To be higher-density urban environments would really create a number of small clumps of apartment/condo buildings and wide spaces between them. That's not really sustainable either.  

Medium-density suburbs as opposed to the low-density versions we have now could work, but not everyone wants to live in a high-dnesity condo or apartment, myself included. So I suppose we close to agree on the higher-than-current-possibly-up-to-medium-density suburbs and infills closer to the downtown are a good thing. The thing I have issue with is you saying it's not an option right now but may be in the future, at least with cycling in mind. The problem with that is: 
A) We'd have to raze a HUGE bunch of current suburbia since there's no way we could fit more houses between the ""McMansions"" mentioned elsewhere in this thread. (I really wouldn't consider my townhouse or the ones on my street to be a McMansion, but that's beside the point)
B) As for cycling, it would only work for about half the year, since we've got a hell of a lot nastier weather than Amsterdam and other European cities that are more bike-friendly. For the transit system to be a reasonable alternative, it would have to be a LOT bigger and more expensive. Like another 3 LRTs going all the way from end to end to end of the city, as well as more buses.  
 
TL,DR: I agree with you that medium-density suburbs instead of the low-density ones we've got is a good idea. I disagree that a bunch of the ideas put forth to council are actually workable in our climate and city area, unless a large portion of the city was completely rebuilt. It's not that it isn't a great goal, it is, it's just not quite workable here.

Then there are those countries that have cultural restrictions on gender but have gone on to have female presidents and prime ministers e.g. Banazir Bhutto, female, PM of Pakistan. 

The important thing is that minorities have no difficulty being elected to public office, certainly in Western Europe, and when they are their ethnicity is rarely even brought up as an issue.  At that point it's difficult to see their ethnicity as being a glass ceiling, not as much as it was seen as a milestone in the US, for completely understandable reasons from a historic perspective.  In Europe it was more about the suffragette movement, that was their milestone, and now people don't really think twice about there being female European leaders.

It's also difficult to see the Gypsy issue, which exists, as an ethnic issue rather than a cultural/life-choice issue.  A gypsy, remember, is completely indiscernible to any other European outside the constraints of their lifestyle.  When they stop being a traveller, settle down, and integrate into society, they are completely indistinguishable from anybody else, and it's impossible to get elected without settling down, having a career, for anybody; so it's not like skin colour or religion in that respect (although I do support more recognition of travellerer/gypsy lifestyle and tailoring tax and legal systems to accommodate a traveller lifestyle so they can be seen to be contributing and integrated).

The case that was brought forward was a company called ""Usedsoft"" which bought ""used"" licenses of Oracle software (which only needs a ""valid serial"" kind of authentication to be operated, not an online activation) from companies that no longer needed them. Oracle tried to forbid selling of keys acquired this way, the court nixed this. That's what the Consumer group is trying to argue on.


However, the court did not say that a publisher had to *enable* the sale of used software and in Germany specificially the BGH (the highest court authority in the nation) ruled in 2010 that binding software to an account irrevocably and forbidding the resale of the account was a legitimate practice. This case was explicitly about Steam.

In a clan or tribal situation, the clan identity is carried by members of both genders, and slights to the clan are felt by both. This is not something limited just to the men. The group identity is not a specifc ownership product of the men. 

A daughter who breaks these taboos, or even worse, is victimized herself,  is considered to have dishonoured the whole family. And the killing can come from both parents.

 Let's look at some recent examples. **Warning! Triggers.**
[Table 1 and Table 2 US and EU Honour Killings](http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/211/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence)

Mothers, Sisters, Grandmothers can be found assisting the father. In one case even holding the girl down while the father stabs her to death.

Just because the father's name is stamped on the clan or family, doesn't mean that just the males are affected, or involved. 

If we look at an example of Tribal behaviour in Pre-colonial North America, the revenge / Mourning wars of the Iroquoi were driven by the women of the society as much as the men.[Page 33 of this book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Ordeal-Longhouse-Colonization-Institute/product-reviews/0807843946/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1) The honour of the group had to be maintained and the dead lost to skirmishes replaced with hostages or victims to torture to death, and it  was the women of **matrilineal** Iroquois society that were the driving force and huge political influence behind this phenomenon.

So, I have to disagree. The patrilineality of the society in questions doesn't make the family honour a father only thing, or a male only thing. The women who buy into the society itself, and accept their tribal, family, or clan identity, are aiding, abetting, and in some cases committing these kinds of crimes.

If you do decide to do this, make absolutely sure you look up the play and know what you're getting into.

In any event, I live in Chicago, so I can help you out with more traditional options.

Art Institute or Shedd Aquarium are always excellent bets.  If you want awww factor, go with the aquarium, if you want intellectually stimulating conversation, go with the Art Institute.  (If you do go to the Art Institute, I highly recommend the 1920-1960 European stuff.  The Magrittes are especially phenomenal.)

Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind at the Neo-Futurarium (on Ashland by Foster).  30 plays in 60 minutes, totally hilarious (only drawback is that it starts quite late, like at 11 or so.)  This would absolutely be my recommendation if the timing works for you.

Also Second City is an option, but you might have to be 21+.  Not sure.

Chat softly over hot chocolate at Hot Chocolate.

Walk into Ragstock in Lakeview and try on ridiculous clothes (has to be the right kind of guy for this one.)  A better idea might be to window shop/browse in an antiques store on Clark in Andersonville (there are tons, and this is always a hugely fun date.)

I think the Pick Me Up Cafe on Roscoe has board games you could play over coffee...but you'll have to check on that.

AskHistorians,t3_17ohn2,,0,"&gt; Why was Communism such a big deal…

It wasn't.

There were red scares before the Cold War, but there was no global showdown over communism.  Communism was a nuisance that was intervened against or put down or stamped out from the mid-1800s through WWII.  [The U.S. even let China go communist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Hands#The_men_who_.22lost.22_China) without much of a fight in the late 40s, despite nominally being allied with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist party.

The Cold War was fought over issues of power and hegemony.  What changed wasn't that communism was all-of-a-sudden more threatening after WWII.  In fact, Stalin took significant actions that made Soviet communism less threatening to external powers (and his WWII alliance partners), for example:

* His ""[Socialism in One Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_One_Country)"" doctrine that renounced global revolution;
* Having Trotsky, the main proponent of permanent revolution, assassinated in 1940; and,
* Disbanding Comintern in 1943 and replacing it later with Comecon.

The Cold War occurred not because of ideological conflict (although ideological differences exacerbated differences and communication problems between the two superpowers), but because of the destruction of the balance of power in Europe after the defeat of Nazi Germany, the inability of the British Empire to maintain its great power status, and the ruin of the rest of continental Europe, including former-great power France.

While Stalin was probably a paranoiac, the Soviet Union has legitimate security concerns following WWII.  It had been invaded by Germany twice in 30 years, had lost 20-30 million men in the war, its economy was barely industrialized and was still mostly comprised of agriculture and peasants, and even though the United States had supplied the USSR with the majority of its materiel to keep it in the war effort, the the US &amp; UK waited three long years to create a Western front.  The USSR was not interested in leaving itself open to yet another attack from Europe.

Stalin pursued a sphere of influence policy, a very traditional foreign policy from the balance of power era, creating a buffer zone out of Eastern Europe.  Germany – the country that had just invaded Russia twice – was kept divided and subordinated.  Poland – traditionally hostile to Russia – was also kept subordinated.  The best way to ensure that these countries were not going to be hostile was to convert them into ideologically and structurally similar regime types, led by clients whose power and position would be dependent on Moscow.

While Churchill was more understanding of spheres of influence balance of power politics, the United States was not.  To the United States it didn't matter much if Eastern Europe were dominated by German totalitarianism or Soviet totalitarianism – each was an unacceptable result of WWII.  The Red Army remained throughout Eastern Europe, and the USSR was the most formidable land power in the world, with an army unmatched in size.  The industrial core of continental Europe – West Germany, France, Northern Italy, the low countries – were a stone's throw away from the massive Red Army.  Theoretically, the Red Army could sweep into Western Europe before the United States (much less Britain) could mount any response at all.

The doctrine of containment was formulated by a State Department official, and former U.S. ambassador to the USSR, George Kennan.  Kennan was a ""realist,"" which in international relations theory means (nb: oversimplifying greatly here) that he was more concerned about the balance of power than ideological differences.  He wrote ""[The Long Telegram](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Long_Telegram)"" and the [""X"" article](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Sources_of_Soviet_Conduct) explaining why the Soviet Union posed a threat and why containment ought to be the strategy for mitigating that threat.  Containment was less about communism than it was about preventing the imposition of Soviet-friendly regimes around the world through revolution or Soviet imperialism.  (It should be noted here that Kennan was far less cavalier about intervention around the world, and mostly was interested in protecting key industrialized regions, whereas Paul Nitze (principal author of [NSC-68](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSC-68)) was far more convinced that Soviet expansion had to be countered everywhere it cropped up.)

The proxy wars were fought to prevent the USSR or the U.S. from gaining an advantage in the balance of power.  Proxy wars were fought rather than direct wars between the superpowers because of the risk of escalation into a nuclear exchange or a World War III.

Throughout the Cold War, the United States was willing to differentiate between communist countries.  Tito's Yugoslavia remained independent of Soviet influence (even defiant of it).  Likewise, following the [Sino-Soviet split](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split), the United States and People's Republic of China informally allied against Soviet ""hegemonism.""  The key example of this is the collaborative effort between the U.S. and China (with help from Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the UK) to aid Afghans in expelling Soviet troops from 1979 through 1989.

Insofar as communism was an indicator of alignment with the USSR, the U.S. was willing to fight its spread.

pics,t1_c87fv0c,,0,"Hey, thanks for that answer, it was really clear and nicely explained. I do see how HSR could be a bad idea in the US. My only point is, for us in Europe, it does help. Which is why I will not answer on your points concerning the US, I mostly agree with you anyway.

However:
&gt;[...] so let's look elsewhere. London to Paris by flight will run you 1 hour and 15 minutes and (depending on the day) $100-$150. The Eurostar is 2 hours and 15-30 minutes (depending on the train and the number of stops) and, averaging the fares together and using the current exchange rate, $210. In the interest of accuracy, it's possible to get a standard (i.e. non-business class) Eurostar fare at a rate competitive with flights at off-peak times while booking at least a month ahead, but you can just as easily get a plane ticket for the same cost and less time.

Bleh, you took an example where it doesn't work, fine. But I used to live near Lyon and had business in Paris, and TGV works absolutely great! It is cheaper than flights (the price range is exponential according to time of day and reservation, but fairly consistently, even high speed train is a lot cheaper than plane, especially since the low-costs don't offer it). Then during the year I spent in Germany, the high speed liaison Frankfurt-Paris was the only reason I'd go home on long weekends (the high speed part is only actually past the French border). That one is also a growing success, more and more travelers use it (or actually in the past couple years I don't use it so I have less first hand experience)
In general, high speed rail system is where the SNCF (French railway company) gets the most income.
http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/La-France-fete-le-succes-du-TGV

(side note, I read also in this link that France was able to export the TGV technology to other countries, which then in turn helps the French economy. This is a point I hadn't thought of myself)

Sorry, I am only giving more specific examples about France, because it is the country I have used it the most (also, I am half French), this year I am in the Czech Republic and no high speed trains, so I use the bus.

Also, very important. Those time comparisons in your example make me absolutely go for the train. You have to be at the airport an hour and a half before flight, or an hour at least (and then you're cutting it close). Also the airports are outside of the cities, so you have to count the time getting to the departure airport, and after arrival to get back into the destination city. Train stations are in city centers. Not regarding the price on those, I would go 100% for the train. (but yeah, I took the Eurostar once and it sucked. I'd either recommend the boat if you have time, or the plane. Never again Eurostar)",0,t5_2qh0u,t3_17nvfk,True,4,4,,Kwizi,t1_c87lojp,,1359741177,0,c87lojp,False,1431152683,False,

The BLS is saying that nothing really happened.  It's about the same as it was before.  Some bright news, some less.  Wall Street seems to like it more than I do though.

From Jan 2011 to now, the Unemployment rate has gone from Just over 9, to just under 8.  Not fabulous, but not terrible. Especially when you take into account Europe acting like an anchor to the world economy.  Fortunately the U.S. has a very strong and robust economy to be able to weather this storm.  

From the BLS

&gt;The number of unemployed persons, at 12.3 million, was **little changed** in January.   
The unemployment rate was 7.9 percent and has **been at or near that level since September 2012**.  

&gt;Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.3 percent), adult women
(7.3 percent), teenagers (23.4 percent), whites (7.0 percent), blacks (13.8 percent), and Hispanics (9.7
percent) showed **little or no change** in January. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.5 percent (not
seasonally adjusted), little changed from a year earlier. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)  

&gt;In January, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was about
**unchanged** at 4.7 million and accounted for 38.1 percent of the unemployed. (See table A-12.)  

&gt;Both the employment-population ratio (58.6 percent) and the civilian labor force participation rate
(63.6 percent) were **unchanged** in January. (See table A-1.)  

&gt;The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 8.0 million, **changed little** in January. 

And it goes on like this.  No change.  Little change.  About the same.  This is pretty much what most economist were expecting, although I think they were hoping to be surprised.  

The reason I think Wall Street likes it is because of the revisions.  November rose from 161,000 to 247,000.  (Those conspiracy theory threads about the government lying about unemployment for the election seem silly now, yes?)  December went up from 196,000 from 155,000. 

I think most people are ready for the economy to finally kick into gear.  Maybe Wall Street sees those adjustments as a sign it soon will.

So much wrong with this post, I'm not even sure where to start.  Let me just highlight a few things.

First, why the fuck are you talking about Japan?  The person I responded to made the statement that:

&gt;I thought that was irrelevant because in Europe gun policy is pretty strict...

As such, I confined my discussion to EUROPE.  Now, because of many socio-economic differences between eastern and western Europe, it made sense to me to limit the comparison to Western Europe.

Now, you can certainly make the case that we should look at all of Europe and we could have discussed that as well.  With that said, my choice of using Western Europe is totally defensible based on the context of the conversation.

Choosing Japan IS NOT. 

...and I'm the one using ""dishonest and distorted information to try to fool people..."" right?  Give me a fucking break.

Second, your ratio of 11 to 1 isn't actually correct.  You CLAIM that you are measuring the ratios of ""double digit school massacres"" but you are actually comparing the ratio of ""total casualties in double digit school massacres"".  These are not the same thing, or even close to it.

...and I'm the one using ""dishonest and distorted information to try to fool people..."" right? 

I could go on and on about the total bullshit you are spewing but I think I've made my point.  You can ""call me out"" on my data all you want, but at least it is based in reality and my methodology is defensible, if not perfect.

""Is the above point a bad thing?"" and ""What's wrong with that?"" are not rhetorical questions which secretly mean ""Stop bashing Valve, you bastard!""

&gt; Sorry you took offence to this...

No offence taken here. This is why I started off with, ""Man, I really don't get your perspective here..."" I was trying to emphasize that I'm giving you the benefit of a doubt; it's just that I didn't understand or agree with most of your points.

&gt; he is quoting CS:GO rather than any other game featured on there.

Initially, yes. But then he said, ""So we tried a third-party product to see if we had some artificial home-field advantage. We saw the same pricing phenomenon.""

&gt; how do you compare the app store to steam may I ask?

Isn't that the biggest digital distributor of iOS and Mac games? I'm just assuming that, so maybe I'm mistaken?

&gt; Making it literally impossible to bypass without having someone overseas bypass games for you, yes that is actively encouraging it, wouldn't you agree?

Eh, I'll agree that it's actively *enabling* regional pricing and doing so more effectively than Amazon. Close enough, perhaps? They could still be outright encouraging regional pricing for all I know, but I have yet to see enough evidence to convince me.

That's a good point which I had forgotten.

Sorry if my previous comment read like an attempted smackdown. You actually had some points with which I agreed right off the bat, at least to an extent... like that bit about Valve breaking several laws in countries where they operate... well, I don't know enough about the legalities to word it that strongly myself, but I definitely feel like Valve is going against the spirit of that EU court ruling a few months ago... the one which said consumers are allowed to re-sell their license keys for purchased software.

economy,t1_c87h8ef,,0,"&gt; funded on the European level .... rather than all falling on the German tax payer.

But isn't that the problem?  Ex-Germany, Europe is broke.  There is no money to fund anything.  If they wanted to, they would need to do so by borrowing - and the only place they can borrow at sustainable rates is via ECB handouts, i.e., Germany - so it all comes back to the same place in the end.

The bottom line is that a market doesn't allow dead-broke, flagrantly overspending countries to borrow at 3%.  If you want them to borrow at 3%, the market has to be rigged, and somebody's got to pay for it.  Here, that is the German taxpayer - and they don't like the idea.

As for not demanding austerity - your whole argument depends on the assumption that the other EU countries will somehow move back into financial health, if they aren't ""dismantled"".  Why are you so confident in that?  What is going to make them magically become healthy again?   It may be that they never move anywhere, they just absorb the bailout money, continue increasing their welfare spending and bureaucratic theft, and carry on as normal.  And that is what the Germans fear - that if allowed, they will just carry on as normal, overspending until the next crisis makes them beg for more money from Germany.

I agree on investors (and corporate executives, more importantly) losing everything when their businesses fail.

By and large, this was a kind of melding of Darwinism with the social stratification and colonialism of the era. You can actually see the the elements of the racial hiearchy in terms of the nature of conquest by European countries. ""Races"" at the bottom were those who were enslaved. Those near the top, like Slavic people or those in the Middle East, were never completely conquered. In the middle were ""Asians"" who were mostly conquered in in the 19th Century. 

Racial categories were constantly adjusted to fit within this paradigm of social hierarchy, and therefore the physical traits were tweaked to conform to those that confirmed the racial hypothoses. It was a classic case of bad methodology. 

In any case, once these became codified ""scientifically"", there was often a case of self-fulfilling prophecy. As black skin became increasingly associated with slaves, legal codes began to make it more and more likely that only black people would be enslaved, which further increased the association of black skin and slavery.  

P.S. One fun excercise to expose the flaws of ""Scientific Racism"" is to ask someone what specifically defines a race, biologically. In otherwords, what feature/features MUST someone have to be a part of a race. It's literally impossible to do so and encompass every member of a currently defined ""race.""

The warranty is much more useful on a European luxury brand than it is a reliable family car (however, I suppose they also depreciate in value more, so it may still be the same ratio). Also, what tends to break on the car you're looking at? Try and find some forums of owners and see what common issues are, and when they tend to occur.

Because of that, I think it's impossible to make the generalizations you're aiming at. However, for a reliable brand like a Honda, I can't imagine you'd be in as much trouble as you would be with a 3-year old Jaguar, for instance. A 3-year old Honda with that few miles on it should be reliable enough that I'd be *very* comfortable with it.

It also depends on how much repair work you're comfortable doing yourself. A luxury brand out of warranty can be worth it if you have a well-equipped garage and some general know-how.

When you barge in without autorization in another country, invade the guy home, and try to take him out of country without any sort of arrest mandate, extradition autorisation, trial or whatever, i'm pretty sure it's not very far from it. It's a common practice for FBI nowadays, even on copyright grounds.

economy,t1_c87nkij,,0,"&gt; But isn't that the problem? Ex-Germany, Europe is broke. 

No, Greece is broke. But.. since lack of confidence (caused by lack of coherent, decisive action) is causing banks &amp; investors to dump their European sovereign debt...raising sovereign borrowing costs... Europe *will be broke* if we don't do something soon. That's what happened to Portugal. Now the press is saying it will happen to France... a country with an 87% debt/GDP and a AA rating!... lack of confidence goes a long way!

Frankly, I'm sure that the French voter would rather have spent his money on an EU solution back in 2009... rather than wait for increases in sovereign borrowing costs caused by inaction to eat all of that money up today. *(Source: I live in France)*. Same thing goes for the Dutch, the Belgians, and the Finnish. 

&gt; As for not demanding austerity - your whole argument depends on the assumption that the other EU countries will somehow move back into financial health, if they aren't ""dismantled"". Why are you so confident in that? 

Well... if you are a right-wing economist... you can count on business cycle theory for that confidence. If you are a left-wing economist meanwhile, I'd point to the fact that most of Keyes' General Theory is about the role of investment &amp; financial markets on the real economy (i.e. build investor confidence in the stability of the real economy.. and the rest will follow).

So..in that respect, we can say that rightwing economists believe in magic and leftwing economists believe in engineering when it comes to this issue. 

&gt;  It may be that they never move anywhere, they just absorb the bailout money, continue increasing their welfare spending and bureaucratic theft, and carry on as normal.

That is exactly what the Nay-sayers said about bailing out the six eastern european countries... BUT, it got done so thoroughly, that ECFIN now tries to go around convincing us all that there never was a crisis in Poland (too bad for them that old stats don't just disappear once they've been put on the internet!) The ECFIN 2010 report on Poland was called ""The Polish banking system: hit by the crisis or merely by a cool breeze?""

http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/country_focus/2010/pdf/cf-7-02_en.pdf

&gt; I agree on investors (and corporate executives, more importantly) losing everything when their businesses fail. Why they haven't been allowed to lose here is either rampant corruption, or because the central bankers really don't understand the ramifications and are therefore afraid to let them really fail (the Lehman effect), or both.

Yeah, bank lobbies are definitely part of the problem. 

As for central bankers... they are not all created alike. Keep in mind that the ECB was involved in the vienna initiative. I cannot really explain the sudden about face of it all though.. its as if the polish were somehow more worthy of being saved...in the eyes of the ECB. Also... I once attended a lecture by the Icelandic central bank director for a course i took... he was definitely a hawk who was pro-hair-cutting.

I wouldn't say it's not well known on the other hand but I think it's recognition isn't as much as it should be, I think it's a brilliant work of modern literature not just in Scotland but in Europe as a whole. It not something which you can completely take in at first either, I missed a lot of it's meaning on my first read through but it sticks with you and something I return to every so often.

There is some of Alistair Gray's work I really like that isn't so famous though, Poor Things and the History Makers are amazing too. Also if you can find it you must read his short story Five Letters from an Eastern Empire. It remains a favourite short story of mine, the style is fantastic and it's meaning and political message really sticks with you. It's up there with Joyce's The Dead or Chekov's The Black Monk in my opinion.

On Ian Banks stuff, I actually amen't a big fan of his fiction. My problem is his characterization always hit me as particularly weak, I never really cared much about his characters. I have been reading his science fiction on the other hand and in particular his Culture series and I love it, it's the only science fiction other than Azimov or Clarke that has actually grabbed me.

Gandhi leads his civil disobedience and marches against the Nazis, but soon realize that the Nazis have no compunction against gunning down civilians.

He realizes that Nazis are immoral and that they cannot argued with rationally or morally. He basically admits defeat and ends up being killed.

I conquered Ireland, gave up my European holdings to France, then vassalised Scotland. The vassalisation of Scotland didn't go all that well. I was winning pretty well but then a cataclysmic battle happened where my army was almost totally lost. After the battle I asked to vassalise them and they accepted, which is pretty retarded because they could have ransacked my whole country at that point, I only had two regiments left after.

Then, I'm just cruising along and having a good time and the pricks backstab me and invade. I was doing pretty well overall, once I re-mobilised I took the fight to them. I was always losing a lot more guys than them even when I outnumbered them, but I eventually figured out that this might be because my general was pretty bad (am I right in guessing that generals are way more important than I previously thought?) so I hired a new one and was really impressed with how he was performing.. but I'd forgot about my financial situation and went bankrupt and things kind of went to shit from there.

Scotland was pretty forgiving. they had occupied a tonne of shit right up to the outskirts of London and then they accepted a white peace.

My morale is at approximately 0 for every battle. Is this totally because of my terrible prestige from the bankruptcy? I'm having to use my main army to just make suicide attacks to wear away at groups of peasants and welshmen and it's not terribly efficient.

Is there some way to keep a better eye on all your loans? All I can see is the reminder that one is coming due, I haven't found a spot where I can see all my current loans.

JFK is probably the best entry point for almost anywhere in Europe, so flights for supporters will be only a bit longer than flying to Moscow or Istanbul.  It would recognize the popularity of the European Leagues over here.

&gt;Israeli media recently spread news about a report of the Bulgarian investigative authorities blaming militant Shiite group Hebollah for the attack.

&gt;Bulgarian authorities, however, denied the existence of such a report.

.....

&gt;But do they have conclusive evidence they have made public? No use jumping the gun on something we don't know.

its been made public through journalistic investigation by spiegel (one of europe's largest weekly magazine publications).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel
&gt;On June 4, 2012, Der Spiegel published an investigative article stating that Israel has armed its newest submarines with nuclear missiles. Numerous Israeli and German officials were quoted testifying to the nuclear capabilities of the submarines and the placement of nuclear missiles aboard the ships. In response to the article, officials from both Germany and Israel refused to comment.

http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/israel-deploys-nuclear-weapons-on-german-submarines-a-836671.html
&gt;Documents from the archives of the German Foreign Ministry make it clear, however, that the German government has known about the [nuclear weapons] program since 1961. The last discussion for which there is evidence took place in 1977, when then-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt spoke to then-Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan about the issue.

even just look at the case regarding the whistleblower, mordechai vanunu...

also, there are documents showing that Israel offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons...

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/23/israel-south-africa-nuclear-weapons
&gt;Secret South African documents reveal that Israel offered to sell nuclear warheads to the apartheid regime, providing the first official documentary evidence of the state's possession of nuclear weapons.

&gt;The ""top secret"" minutes of meetings between senior officials from the two countries in 1975 show that South Africa's defence minister, PW Botha, asked for the warheads and Shimon Peres, then Israel's defence minister and now its president, responded by offering them ""in three sizes"". The two men also signed a broad-ranging agreement governing military ties between the two countries that included a clause declaring that ""the very existence of this agreement"" was to remain secret.

&gt;The documents, uncovered by an American academic, Sasha Polakow-Suransky, in research for a book on the close relationship between the two countries, provide evidence that Israel has nuclear weapons despite its policy of ""ambiguity"" in neither confirming nor denying their existence.",0,t5_2qh13,t3_17mnyh,True,1,1,,two_comedians,t1_c87pq1n,,1359751843,0,c87pq1n,False,1431154584,1359752733,

funny,t1_c87npj3,,0,"What you're stating is the traditional wisdom regarding the AK, which gets repeated ad nauseam in gun shops and ranges throughout the US, but I consider it to be a rather simplistic and hyperbolic viewpoint.

The AK indeed possesses the many advantages you describe--reliability, ease of manufacture, ease of use, etc.

The drawbacks are a bit harder to pinpoint. Stamped construction certainly isn't a flaw--most every modern combat rifle besides the AR uses a stamped receiver. They're lighter and easier to make. Even Stoner's designs following the AR dispensed with forged receivers.

AK accuracy is also far better than it gets credit for--especially the modern 5.45x39 '74 variants. It may not quite rival a comparable AR in terms of groupings, but it achieves well beyond the accuracy requirements for an effective fighting rifle.

The most considerable flaw is the difficulty in mounting optics, but that's not insurmountable.

Many American shooters snobbishly dismiss the AK using patronizing terms such as ""peasant"" and ""commie,"" but in reality, it's a totally world-class rifle that's successfully used by several modern armies, and performs admirably against its American and European counterparts.

Anyway, we digress.

As for it not working unless it had the 'ideal settings' (material conditions), Marx had not intended for Marxism to be taken up in a then-backwards country like Tsarist Russia. Neither Russia nor China had it's productive forces advanced enough for a 'perfect transition to a worker state.' Marx's socialism was intended for so-called advanced capitalist nations who had already been through their industrial revolution. This means America, Germany, Britain, etc. It almost happened in Germany after WWI too, which would have allied with the Soviet Union and then have a tremendously influential socialist presence in Europe. Then perhaps these degenerations would not have happened, at least in Germany. Thus Russia, who underwent industrialization under Stalin, and China, which was largely made up of peasants and was still in the Feudal stage, skipped a few steps. When it comes to class struggle there are no steps one can skip or the end result will inevitably be western perceived authoritarian in nature.

Acid attacks don't happen in most places with frequency, including the Muslim world. In addition, where she worked is probably irrelevant, seeing as they sell underwear in the Muslim world too.

&gt;That is silly, it is well known where Europe Muslims are coming from.

According to your own phraseology, it shouldn't matter where they come from because it all falls under the singular Muslim Culture. As it goes the Muslim community in London is quite diverse, she could be from Somalia just as she could come from Pakistan.

&gt;Yes. The KKK in the south of the United States is a fucked up thing and was largely born because of blacks as well as a response to immigration of the Irish. It was a problem, hell it's still a problem. It is not a bad thing to identify it as such.

news,t1_c87q1f9,,0,"That's just my point, you don't possess the necessary knowledge without my explaining it to you. I can tell you that two centuries earlier, the idea of working for a wage was ludicrous because the world - Britain excepted - still operated on a market economy. Barter remained common for all goods and services. A worker either apprenticed themselves to learn a trade, or they labored in agriculture for a sustenance living.

One century earlier, the average laborer worked 12-14 hour days, six days a week, in incredibly dirty dangerous conditions. If he/she worked in a factory, there were no safety precautions taken and if the worker threatened to strike, he/she was replaced by a more willing worker, or a black laborer. By black laborer, I'm including Sicilians, Greeks, East Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and Mexicans, because each race was considered ""black"" on some level. The laws covering this labor fell under the ""freedom of contract"" clause, meaning if you agreed to work for a wage, you did whatever the boss demanded regardless of danger or long hours.

The reason our food server was able to draw attention to this incident is because of the advances in work conditions made possible by labor unions. We now have 8 hour work days and laws requiring overtime pay; we work five day weeks; if an employer is at fault for bodily injury, they now have to pay; child labor is no longer acceptable in the US; employers are required to give breaks. The list goes on-and-on, but it offers the historical precedence that allowed this food server to speak up and actually be heard. It is also a system that employers hate because it restricts them from taking more-for-less from the employee. Republicans would love to rollback the advances made in labor as we've witnessed in numerous political battles across the nation (Wisconsin, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee).

I've given you ideas that any American historian immediately recognizes, but you don't want a list of ""unqualified sources.""

I think the most important part that people need to understand about eighteenth century warfare is that generals, generally, did not actually want to fight. After all, it was a lot of risk to commit your forces to a pitched battle. So, generals often wanted to ""lever"" enemy forces out of position by moving so that the opposing side's position was untenable. 

I drew a picture to (kind of) illustrate what I mean. [Yay paint art](http://i.imgur.com/teEMvw5.png) The general of the Green Army wants to attack the Red Army which is positioned across the bridge. Instead of simply attacking and fighting a battle, the Green Army detaches forces, crossed at the lower bridge, and moves to flank. Instead of giving battle in this position, the General of the Red Army would most likely retreat. If you are interested in this, I would recommend the works of Antoine-Henry de Jomini, who wrote after the Napoleonic Wars. He is concerned with ""geometric warfare"", lines, interior lines, etc. [Here's a link to his work in English](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13549/13549-h/13549-h.htm#ARTICLE_XXII), and here it is [in the original French](http://archive.org/stream/prcisdelartdela00jomigoog#page/n7/mode/2up)

This also applied during the sieges of the period. Siege warfare was the most ""scientific"" of the types of battles during this period. Generally, it would happen like this:

The attacking force would completely encircle the opposing fortification and call for the surrender of the defenders. They rarely surrendered at this point, even if there was no hope of victory. At least a token defense was necessary in order to satisfy the honor of the defending officer. 

So, after a general set of bombardments from the attackers, if there was no help from reinforcements forthcoming, the defender would most often surrender and be allowed to leave, sometimes with weapons, often on the condition that they did not participate in the war for a set period of time.

If the defenders did NOT surrender, the attackers would begin to dig a set of trenches towards the walls of the fort. These trenches worked at an angle, almost parallel with the walls of the fort to prevent defensive cannon fire from travelling down the length of said trench. These are called traverses. All the while, the attackers siege guns (Which differ from field guns, in that they are much, much larger) would be pounding a section of the fort to smithereens, attempting to open a braech in the wall. 

If a force was so weak that it could not sally forth and attack, it was pretty much inevitable what would happen next. The attackers' cannon would open part of the wall, and the traverses would come up close to the breach. Generally, another attempt was made to get the defenders to surrender. If this did not happen, the attackers would storm the breach. The first wave, almost certain to die to a man, was known as a [forlorn hope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forlorn_Hope). Even though they were likely to die, there was often competition to lead this amongst the lower officers in order to advance their careers. If it came down to the attacker being forced to storm the breach, the lives of the defenders were forfeit if the attack was not repulsed. 

If you want to read more about sieges, an example of an unsuccessful siege is [The Siege of Acre (1799)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Acre_(1799)), by Napoleon. An example of a more common siege is the [Siege of Fort William Henry (1757)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Fort_William_Henry), by the Marquis de Montcalm, during the French and Indian War.

Eighteenth century warfare had three real components, which I will talk about: infantry, cavalry, and artillery.

Now, when I was young and in high school, learning about the American Revolution, we all had a good laugh at how the British always wore bright uniforms and marched in tight formations, but this made sense during the time period. Marching in close formation makes it much easier to keep control of a group of men, especially since most 18th century soldiers would desert if they ever had a chance. The bright uniforms contributed to the *esprit de corps* of the group and made it easier for commanders to keep track of who was where. The tight formation also allowed musket bearing soldiers to concentrate their relatively inaccurate fire (A British ""Brown Bess"" musket was, at most, somewhat accurate at up to 50-100 yards.)

Of course, not all infantry fought like this. Light infantry almost always had a place on the battlefield. Generally, each infantry force had a light company made up of the men with the most aptitude for marksmanship. These men were often known as *chasseurs* (Hunters) or *Tirailleurs* (Shooters) in French, or *Jagers* in German. The Austrians even had the [Girandoni Air Rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_Air_Rifle) which produced no smoke and made very little noise, for use in their light infantry detachments. Light infantry were especially important in colonial wars such as in North America, since horses and cavalry were difficult to supply in the wilderness and at a distinct disadvantage fighting in dense terrain. So, light infantry such as [Rogers Rangers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers'_Rangers) worked covertly to attack enemy supply lines, raid camps, and so on. They even used Native American style canoes and sleds to get around quickly. 

Cavalry, even though it no longer dominated the battlefield as it had in the medieval period, was still extremely important. Light cavalry acted as scouts for armies and performed duties such as raiding supply lines, harassing and pursuing retreating enemies, or working around the flanks of a battle and skirmishing with enemy light infantry and other cavalry. The most famous type of light cavalry are the [hussars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussars#Hussars_in_the_18th_century), who were known for particularly flamboyant outfits and being roguish, especially around women. Another important type of light cavalry that really came into its own during the Napoleonic Wars are [lancers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancers#17th.E2.80.9319th_century), since their weapon was deadly on the charge. The Poles were known as the best lancers in Europe. The Polish Regiment of Imperial Guard Lancers was a particularly feared unit under the command of Napoleon.

Even with the advent of gunpowder, armored cavalry still was important, too. [Curiassiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuirassiers) were generally composed of the most well-born members of the army. They were big men on big horses, wearing armor that could deflect musket balls. They were generally used as sledgehammers, smashing open enemy formations and breaking them.

Cavalry, while effective sometimes, was at a distinct disadvantage when attacking unsupported. Disciplined infantry, when threatened by cavalry, could form [an infantry square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_square). The densely packed bayonets of the square meant that horses would not charge, and the cavalrymen were vulnerable to simply being shot off their horses. The most famous example of this is during the Battle of Waterloo, when Marshal Ney, thinking the British were retreating, launched an unsupported cavalry attack. The disciplined British regulars formed square and simply butchered most of the French cavalry. I personally think the movie Waterloo did a good job of depicting this. For the aerial shots, they used something like 20,000 actual extras, no CGI or anything. [Here's the clip.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17YqczWI2R8)

The third branch of the eighteenth century army was the artillery corps. The artillery was interesting, since to be a proper artilleryman, you had to be educated rather than simply well-born. Napoleon himself was originally an artilleryman, even. So, the artillery were the most meritocratic of the branches. The artillery was also known as the king of the battlefield. Guns could deny access to an area, knock big holes in formations with round shot, or turn themselves into giant shotguns by using [grapeshot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapeshot). While much of the artillery corps was slow moving, particularly daring artillerymen functioned as [horse artillery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_artillery) which traveled around the battlefield at a gallop, quickly unlimbered, fired, limbered up, then galloped off. 

Napoleon, again, was known for his particularly skillful use of artillery. He liked to concentrate all of his artillery fire on the weakest section of the enemy's formation, then break it with infantry or aggressive cavalry attacks.

What works depends on your view point. The evidence can tell you what changes cause what outcomes, but it can't tell you which outcomes are better. What works depends on what you are trying to achieve.

Usually different policies result in different tradeoffs. Perhaps, greater economic growth comes at the expense of raising inequality. Maybe it doesn't. That's a question for the evidence. Which route society should take is purely a matter of personal view point. Telling me you consider yourself a human being doesn't tell me anything about your preferences.

&gt;I do consider it humorous that you are using a technology that requires cooperation to promote an ideology that states, to me, every one is out for themselves.

That statement is a sure sign that you either don't have a good understanding of libertarianism or haven't opened your mind to give is a chance. 

I am a libertarian in part because I value cooperation. I believe that people have an incredible ability to work together and solve problems, thus they should be given the freedom to do so.

Studies of the morality of libertarians disprove your notion that libertarians only care about themselves. They care just as much about other people as liberals do. It's just that they care about other people in different ways.

&gt;If you fostered a sense of community in the USA you would be a happier people but it is pointless discussing this with a person that hold views such as yourself. Maybe you should take some time to come to Europe walk and talk to people and see for yourself, I have seen how the ideas of Libertarianism have affected the US maybe you should try and challenge your belief system?

I'm not really sure why you think the US is so much more libertarian than Europe. 

It's really hard to measure these things, but if I had to say based on what I know right now, I think Denmark is probably more libertarian than the US. Sure their tax rates are higher, but they have a much more libertarian foreign policy and are much better on drugs and prostitution. I don't believe that they are any more heavily regulated that we are. I don't know a ton about their immigration and visa policies, but at least for other European countries they are almost certainly much more libertarian than the US.

I don't even think the US is the top 10 most libertarian countries in the world. My guess would be that I could find 10 countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Estonia, Chile, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden that were more libertarian than the US. I'm not saying for sure that all those countries are more libertarian than the US, but I find it likely that several of them are.

Calgary,t1_c87qasf,,0,"We can commit to many infrastructures to encourage more sustainable living; bike lanes have an advantage of being constantly visible, unlike, say, tort and insurance reform to prevent accidents from bankrupting pedestrians, cyclists, or drivers of motor vehicles. If we want sustainable personal transportation, we need it to be *accessible* to more than just those who have the wits to work around the infrastructure.

My personal preference would be some new well-lit arterial urban 2-3m wide paved pathways (with 1m shoulders for visibility and snow storage) paralleling major streets. Such paths would support mixed use for pedestrians, cyclists, dog walkers, strollers, refreshment stands, and the occasional motorized vehicle, and most of all, make such practices visible.

In most of Europe, most cyclists have no issue taking most mixed use urban sidewalks or bike lanes at 30 km/h or faster, because all users of the space are constantly reminded by visual, tactile, and auditory cues that they are using a shared space. I do not hesitate to approach such speeds in snow-covered northern Europe because I can trust the infrastructure enough that I can constantly scan for other people and vehicles rather than worrying about what's underneath my wheels.

Having experienced how alternative strategies can enable even inexperienced cyclists to safely and successfully commute year-round, I'm confident that Calgary could do better for the many potential cyclists who have reservations about this, that, or the other.

I've also developed a bit of a personal bias against the default snow *removal* strategy employed in much of Canada, and in favour of snow *management* strategies that leave paved surfaces which leave more effective gripping surfaces for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles.

That mostly puts me into the potential commuter cyclists category while in Calgary, unless I'm exceptionally well-rested and have some extra time to discover how the snow-clearing crews have made particular stretches more dangerous that day.",0,t5_2qn40,t3_17n1be,True,1,1,,[deleted],t1_c87ruz7,,1359757995,0,c87ruz7,False,1431155600,False,

The word was most likely originally developed and used in reference to pagan rituals in ancient Indo-Europe. As ""civilized"" as the British are today, they often forget that their ancestors were the *most* savage of the savages. However, when we ask God to ""bless"" someone today, we are really asking for the same thing-- but instead of being covered in the blood of a sheep or a pig or a young virgin girl, we're asking for God to figuratively cover them in the blood of Jesus Christ.

People often say that the MLS will NEVER rival the European leagues. That's just not true. The MLS has an incredible potential and resources within the United States. If they successfully cultivate love of the game then it could most certainly become a desired destination. But that takes a ridiculous amount of work, which is being done. The MLS has only existed for 17 years in a country with no previous predisposition or legitimate interest in the sport. In that short time they have raised the league and the sport to one of the most attended in the nation.

Then there's the problem of different tax laws in each state, in some states, like Texas, people pay virtually no tax. 

Another issue is the matter of your Sales Tax, which we call Value Added Tax (VAT) and as the name suggests, taxes only the value added at each stage of production. Most countries around the world have changed over to VAT, but the US stuck with the Sales tax.

The biggest problem is that it changes so often, most European tax systems have remained the same for much longer. In France, the core of the tax code has been the same for well over a century.

worldnews,t1_c87s0te,,0,"Boiled really really far down, sort of. Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because they thought it would keep the US occupied and away from the European theater. Instead, it got the US interested in war which it previously wasn't keen on. The nukes were because the military weighed the estimated losses of a ground invasion and decided a quick bomb blow would cause less loss of life and convince Japan to surrender. They did not, so we did it a second time. That one worked to force a surrender. In a very broad nutshell.

worldnews,t1_c87rrs5,,0,"EDIT: I was pretty tired when I wrote this the first time, so I'll try again. 

The fact that things are a certain way *in Belgium* does not mean that they apply to the entirety of Europe. Burqas are for example completely legal in my country. 

""Article 7 due to people of certain descent being judged more harshly in court.
11.1 and 17.2 People primarily of certain descent are being targeted if their car is deemed too expensive and if they can not prove they are innocent the car is impounded.""

2. *None* of those things apply to my country. 

3. Most of Europe is secular. If some states decide to implement that in a way that prohibits public servants from showing a preference for some religions, I don't have a problem with that. They're still allowed to practice their religion in private. Nobody is persecuted for their belief. And every religion is treated equally in that regard.  

4. I'm not sure how I feel about burqas being banned. On one hand, I think that people should have a right to be anonymous in non-violent protests. The fact that wearing Guy Fawkes masks are banned at demonstrations in my country is pretty silly, in my opinion. On the other hand, I wouldn't want people to wear Guy Fawkes masks or balaclavas everywhere they go. 

If someone were to walk into a bank, wearing a balaclava, people would probably feel uncomfortable. And people should have every right to ask them to take off the balaclava. Wearing hats at school or at dinner is considered pretty rude. And my teachers used to ask me to take off my hat in class all the time. Why should a burqa or hijab be any different? 

There is also the issue that the article outlines. It makes criminal investigations a lot harder. It really has nothing to do with religion, and I don't understand why people keep insisting on making it an issue of religion. 
 
Hope I was a little bit clearer this time.

It is an oversimplification to say that it was just a balance of power between the US and Soviets.

I also greatly enjoyed this book, and I also find a great deal to quibble with in this post.  The idea the Communism was not itself particularly important to _Communist states_ is, I don't think, a thesis that many credible historians would take seriously.

AskHistorians,t1_c87r3kw,,0,"&gt; At its core, I'd say that the Cold War was a conflict over Eastern Europe more than anything else. But since there was a combined nuclear and conventional stalemate and Europe, both superpowers searched for an advantage elsewhere in the world.

I tend to share this view. There is no suitable metaphor for strategy between two opposing forces more suited to explaining this than grappling.

Neither participant works with a ""god's eye view"" of the world, and instead has to keep in physical contact with an adversary to track his movements. 

Make no mistake, either opponent would love to go for a blood-choke which is a clean move that will easily incapacitate. Unfortunately, this is an easy move to counter in the open and leads to distracting actions like fumbling with limbs to intertwine other limbs. Occasionally, this fumbling can create a race to avoid - or create - a joint-lock that could end the fight. These joint-locks are inconvenient proxy wars abroad.

So how do you win a grappling contest where both are so equally matched in physique and skill? You gain a position of advantage, and protect the advantage. From the top, you can attack with less effort than it takes your opponent to defend. If you can maintain this position, you can wear him down enough to get a quick move in. In the political sense, that advantage would be control over necessary resources, or forcing your adversary into an arms race while you focus your constructive efforts elsewhere.",0,t5_2ssp3,t3_17ohn2,True,7,7,,[deleted],t1_c87spmk,,1359760710,0,c87spmk,False,1431156075,False,
