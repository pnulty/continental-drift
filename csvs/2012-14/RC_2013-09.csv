Basically, you used to just order a bra by your bust measurement, like other garments (dresses, shirts, etc).  So, your bust would measure 36"", you'd order a 36 bra.  Then they added cup sizes which were basically estimates of projection, but still the number correlated to your *bust* size (36A was 36 bust with small ""boob"" amount 36B was medium boob-age, etc).  Some point in the 60/70s they switched it to underband measurement (the European regulating body actually passed a regulation saying it had to be this way), and women wanted to keep ordering their same sizes, so then the measuring system agapted to that.

t5_2sokd,,"Another part of the answer that I don't see in the other comments here yet, is that many black people in the USA grow up with what is effectively a different language that uses almost all of the same vocabulary as English.

Huge numbers of slaves were brought from portions of Africa that spoke languages from the Niger-Congo language family.  When they were all mixed up and mushed together in the US with other black slaves who spoke other languages, they didn't have a common vocabulary, but they *did* have a common grammar.  So, they picked up the vocabulary of English to communicate with each other, but in many ways kept their Niger-Congo based grammar rather than fully adopting English's Germanic (Indo-European family) grammar.

Even after slavery, segregation continued for generations, and there's still a lot of segregation today, so this way of speaking has continued to develop as a linguistically separate entity, and still retains many elements Niger-Congo languages, even though they're using English vocabulary.

Many black people essentially grow up bilingual - they learn how to speak ""black English"" growing up at home, and then separately have to learn how to speak ""white English"" in order to be taken seriously by the dominant society around them.

First, Israel has very little to gain from any outcome in this civil war. If assad wins, hezbollah and iran's greatest ally is still sitting on their doorstep, only now looking for external scapegoats to placate his population. If the jihadists win, they now have syria's chemical weapons and are inherently anti-semitic/anti-israel. 

What israel **does** have an interest in is the destruction of assad's chemical weapons, and violent international response to the use of chemical weapons. 

On top of this, israel is an easy target for retaliation if involved in any large scale operation against syria. 

So the fact that israelis support action which punishes the use of chemical weapons, but are wary of their own country's involvement makes sense. In fact, most israelis oppose their country's involvement for the same reason most americans/europeans who are against involvement oppose their countries getting involved. But the circlejerk can't be seen sympathizing with israelis, right?

Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer specialist who worked for the CIA and the NSA and leaked details of several top-secret United States and British government mass surveillance programs to the press.[2][3]

Based on information Snowden leaked to The Guardian[4] in May 2013 while employed at NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, the British newspaper published a series of exposés that revealed programs such as the interception of U.S. and European telephone metadata and the PRISM, XKeyscore, and Tempora Internet surveillance programs. Snowden's release of NSA material was called the most significant leak in US history by Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg.[5][6][7]


On June 14, 2013, United States federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property.[8][9][10] Snowden had left the United States prior to the publication of his disclosures, first to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he received temporary asylum and now resides in an undisclosed location.

The nazis weren't special in their evil acts. That level of human atrocity was (dare I say) well surpassed by every group prior to it (in terms of evil torture. the large numbers are only due to the earth being just recently able to support so many people. But, I should say, even counting wwII, violence in that century is hugely down from the previous).

On all measures; child abuse (spanking even), rape, slavery, verbal abuse, witch-hunt-ish things, lynching, war-ing, class warfare, stealing, petty crimes, capital punishment, religious war, thievery and so on are all way way down, incredibly so in the last 100 years or so. Even animal abuse is way down (you have no idea how bad it used to be). 

US, of course, lags all of Europe by a measurable margin, but it is nothing like a few decades ago, and far worse, a century or two ago. 

The theories for the concentrations of violence seem pretty reasonable too. The one I recall right now: In most developed nations, a legitimate distrust of government to provide truth and liberty lead to people taking morality into their own hands and that leads to a viscous cycle. ""Evil-doers"" usually believe they are morally righteous in their actions (a surprisingly convincing case can be made in most cases when different moralities/religions are allowed). And that breeds retaliatory moral-action. That's a common theme explored in such books as Crime and Punishment.

Pinker's book about the subject is really good.

""At one point his seventh-grade Greek teacher, Herr Joseph Degenhart, told Albert to his face that it would be better if he simply were not there"" (Source 1).

TL:DR Einstein never failed math in the sense that he understood everything.  Einstein indeed failed math CLASS.  A combination of his stubbornness and harmful teachers cause that.

Source 1: Kaku, Michio. ""The Early Years."" Einstein's cosmos: how Albert Einstein's vision transformed our understanding of space and time. New York: W.W. Norton, 20052004. 34. Print.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: People wanted more proof so here it is:

Einstein was born in **Ulm, Germany**.  He attended primary school in Germany.  At the age of 10 he attended secondary school** Luitpold Gymnasium** in the city **Munich, Germany**.  

/u/HotDogOnAPlate was kind enough to find a picture of his grades provided [Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Albert_Einstein%27s_exam_of_maturity_grades_%28color2%29.jpg). 

These links are the German Grading System showing that **1 is the highest and 6 is the lowest**. 

Source 1: [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Germany)

Source 2: [Here](http://www.studyineurope.eu/study-in-germany/grades)

Source 3: [Here](http://www.uni-ulm.de/fileadmin/website_uni_ulm/io/INC_Application_Exchange_Guide/INC_Grading_System.pdf)

Remember, I'm not saying Einstein was bad in math, he was amazing, but he was a stubborn person. That stubbornness even affected him later in life.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT 3: Since I am very curious and glad we are having an engaging discussion, we are an intelligent group and reason logically. To reason logically you need proof to support your claim so we know it isn't just a thought. Please provide a source with your claims. 

-------------------------------------

FINAL EDIT:  Alright, here it is.  I don't know if anybody has figured it out yet, but this post was purely for the discussion.  I'm taking a general psychology class so I became a little interested in how people think.  I chose this Einstein post because the only people that would click on it would be quite intelligent.  The truth is that I don't really believe Einstein failed math.  Michio Kaku's book never said he failed math either.  

This was for me to see how much I could skew and twist real evidence to support a false claim.  Some people believed me, some people argued without evidence, and some people gave very engaging discussion and had evidence to support their claims. 

All my evidence is true, the only thing I have done is describe them to you in a false, but reasonable, way. All quotes and sources are correct.  I even knew he didn't fail cause of Kaku's book. Same book, chapter 2, page 34, ""Contrary to myth, Einstein was a good student in school, but he was only good in areas he cared about, such as math and science."".  

I enjoyed all the discussions because it required me to think creatively and see how I could pull proof for my side using true information about Einstein.  

True things:

1. He was stubborn

2. His school hated him

3. All sources and quotes are true

The false claim:

1. He failed math.

So there you have it. I'd like to thank /u/misunderstandgap, /u/HotDogOnAPlate, and /u/jleonardbc  for the most engaging conversations.

Being from the Eastern Europe, and also young and dumb, before I moved to Germany I thought we as a nation were more lazy and thus much poorer than the Germans. 

Living in Germany convinced me otherwise. Everyone there worked a lot less. And if you think about it, it makes sense. A big reason life is of lower quality in poor countries is that a lot of extra effort results in a lot less income.

And living in Germany (back then West Germany) I understood that national wealth has nothing do with national culture. It is all about investment, and laws and regulations. That's how Germans got to have 6 weeks of paid vacation while still being quite well of as a nation.

Still being quite young and dumb, before I moved to the US I thought it would be even wealthier and more comfortable than Germany. Haha!

The US has a huge division between the bottom and top of its people. In the US it is easy to drive from something looking like the top of the first world, to something looking like it is from third world, in about half an hour of driving.

I strongly recommend living in a different place of the world for a while. Preferably a couple of different places.

This is just a small selection of the many brands Puerto Rico produces, many of which aren't even available for sale online.  Some considerations:

* [Try to avoid the brands controlled by Puerto Rico Coffee Roasters LLC](https://puertoricocoffeeroasters.com/index.php), a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Company.  They prefer quantity over quality and will often blend Puerto Rican coffee with cheaper coffees from elsewhere.  As of 2008 they control several major brands of Puerto Rican coffee, most notably Yaucono (that's why it's so easy to find in restaurants and supermarkets--nowadays this is like our Folger's or Nescafé).

* Puerto Rican coffee is rather expensive unless bought locally.  At the supermarket level, the coffee pound or half kilogram is at US $4-$6 when it comes to the ordinary quality brands, higher prices in the case of artisan or premium grade coffees.  On the online stores the prices you'll see for the items are 2x - 3x of what we get in local stores; the same being true for other stores.  Do consider that, due to being under US rule, almost all of the social assistance from the US federal government is available, making agricultural work unnattractive to many.  This, paired up with high cost of labor (being at the lower rung of the more developed countries and dependencies) and raw materials for agricultural production, make it impossible for us to offer something cheap like just about all other coffee producing regions.

* [Puerto Rico has a lengthy history with coffee production](http://elyunque.com/coffee.htm)--in fact, Puerto Rico's coffee exports during the late Spanish colonial empire times were much of the reason why coffee grew popular in Europe.  However, the US colonial times (1898-present) have ushered in a slow decadence of our industry; this largely because Puerto Rico's production wasn't suited for the mass market demand (which wasn't even so developed at the time in the case of coffee) the USA already had satisfied from Brazil, Colombia and later from other places from Central and South America.",,3,t1_cbzdx3m,Moka Pot,0,1378003709,True,t3_1lgxmv,1429630626,LucarioBoricua,cbzdx3m,False,0,3,1378005668,0,t3_1lgxmv,Coffee

t5_2qh6c,,"&gt;TL;DR Its the fault of christians that christians are falling apart.

If those Christians falling apart depend on the life of other Christians instead of Jesus, they should not be Christians in the first place.

I don't think people are leaving the church, except in some places, but church is growing in many other places. Church attendance has been pretty stable as a whole in the United States, but I don't have more recent statistics about that.

To be honest, if some people are really leaving church for those stupid stereotypes and internet memes, I find this good in a way. **I don't want a lot of shitty dishonest Christians at church, we have more than enough of them,** (and I know what it is because have been one of those Chrostians sometimes) but maybe a few good, loving, stable, educated, and caring Christians would be better to spread the good news, the Gospel. **We don't need a bigger church, but a stronger church.**

Finally, **it's pathetic to simply blame the church.** People are leaving a lot of things, from higher education, to family and communities. Depression and mental illness is also raising, so it's not a good signal for the Western Society.

If people are really leaving the church, and they don't want to hear Jesus' message, **then let them die out**. Demographically, they are have less children through the years and most of them believe that family is pointless for their empty life.

t5_2vizz,,"&gt;I couldn't imagine all there would be to do in the Indian countryside, lots of trees to climb and to saunter among the hills and mountains would be the greatest thing.

It really depends on where you go, but I made a point at some times not to use the designated paths to places I wanted to go but instead grab my GPS and just wander through the hills towards it. It was a great experience where I was, but I was extremely lucky. The monsoon season had actually just begun, but there was a pause in the weather while I was there after it had rained for a while. So I got to experience summertime there without any rain, watching nature unfold. It was great. And I never saw a single tourist except me for the whole time, because they had all gone thinking that the monsoon was about to start.

But remember that India is a _HUGE_ place. Every state is different, most are very different within themselves. So I wouldn't want to aimlessly wander in central India, for instance, or in Kashmir or other dangerous places, but it was great at the coast where I was. A good travel guide is an absolute must, and knowing natives who spoke the local language was also a big help as I could go shopping at markets etc. without being pestered by tourist trappers all the time.

&gt;Did the people you met in India ever try to touch your hair?

Actually, no, but people there can be unfamiliarly affectionate even towards strangers. Having someone you just met casually put their hand around your shoulder while talking is a bit of a strange experience, especially for a European. Plus as I said, they're always very friendly - I've had the poorest of people in the village where my friend lived invite me into their house and serve me sweets, or a man who was sleeping on a raw bed frame outside a tiny hut wake up and wave and smile to me as I walked by.

t5_2qh1i,,"It was the Summer of 2003.  We met in a bookstore in London on my last day touring Europe after a 10-month stint as a foreign exchange student in Bordeaux, France.  I was searching for something to read on the plane-ride home. I muttered something, I forget what.  She heard me and struck up a conversation. She was small, cute, lively, mid-20s. Her name was Catherine.  We talked for a few minutes and the attraction was clearly mutual.  She offered to show me around London and of course I agreed!

We walked around to a couple of local shops. I bought a swag hat that ended up being my favorite for years.  We got Chinese food because English food is awful, but even that was pretty terrible. Must be the English atmosphere. We went to a local park and she goaded me until I performed a half-decent cartwheel.  I may even have photographic proof somewhere.  We walked along the Thames, beneath the great Ferris Wheel. We would have ridden it, but it was out of commission at the time.  

We walked, and talked, and wandered, so long that time practically ceased to exist.  At 4 Am we found ourselves seated at the foot of a statue of a man on a horse. I remember looking around at the giant clocks on buildings. There were clocks, everywhere! If memory serves, the number was somewhere from a dozen to 18.  Such an easy thing to overlook, and yet so bizarre when you think about it.  

By then she knew I was leaving the next day, but nothing was going to stop us at that point.  We gathered my bags from the hostel I'd been staying at, went back to her place, and the rest you can probably guess without multiple-choice.  

As for the original topic? Well, we had both guessed the other at mid-20s, and we were both wrong. I was 21, and she was 34, but like I said, that wasn't going to stop us at that point.  

I flew out the next day, my emotions mixed up like a rubix cube in a blender.  Truth to tell, it had been a pretty difficult and painful time in Europe, and until that very last day I wanted nothing more than to get back to the States. This last minute change was more than I was emotionally prepared for.  I gave her a wolfs-head necklace as a keepsake. It wasn't the most romantic thing, but it was all I had.  

For the next six months we talked constantly on the phone.  I had come back to a particularly difficult situation that year so having her around kept me sane. It was great long-distance relationship, and, predictably, it was doomed.  

I went to visit her that Christmas, and right when I showed up I got the sickest I've been in my life. My fever spiked up to a hundred and 'wtf'. It's the only time in my life I've had hallucinations so bad I couldn't distinguish between reality and fiction, including any recreational drugs I may or may not have experimented with.  Neither of us handled it well.  

Around the time I was recovering from my sickness is when she called the relationship off.  To be clear, I don't blame her. I was pretty miserable company, and it was hardly the reunion either of us had been imagining.  Of course, the illness can hardly be blamed entirely. I for one could not stand her cruel, petty sense of humor, and I'm sure she had equal complaints about myself.   When the week was over we were all too happy to see the last of the other, and we've never spoken since.

t5_2ssp3,,"Looking at the history of architecture around the world, almost all humans lived in very small structures, with few rooms and little privacy (by contemporary ""western"" standards.)  Most people slept in proximity to each other - in the same room or space - through most of the history of humanity.

In many cases in European history (and early American history) servants slept in the same room as their lords/owners/masters/employers.  While the children may not have been in the same room as their wealthy parents, in at least some cases, the servants were stuck listening to these people going at it.

Complicating things, it is not clear that our current expectation that one goes to sleep well after sunset (thanks to artificial lighting) and sleeps for 5, 6 8 or whatever hours in a more-or-less uninterrupted stretch has been the norm for much of human history.  Without artificial lighting (not only electric, but remember that oil/candles were quite expensive through most of human history) people may sleep in several blocks, and be awake for some time (tens of minutes or a few hours) for several blocks between.

Right now the best performing region is getting smaller, with some Kespa and ESF players retiring.
The lack of popularity is killing the KR scene, JD actively asking fans to come watch PL when it is meant to be the prestige tournament to play in. Flash saying that he misses the old BW excitment when the crowd is there.  I won't be surprised if the KR scene is quite sustained by the BW fans for the BW legions (yet even some of them are retiring and are not in KR team anymore)
Dying out is certainly not going to happen as long as some players are still playing the game, but is there going to be a healthy and sustainable scene?  

From the looks of it, I am not too sure. 
Kr scene keeps getting smaller, EU/NA scene buying up KR talents and rarely any new foreign talent rising up. 
The release in HotS didn't help the chinese scene a single bit, still as small as it was in WoL. 
Taiwan still has a small SC2 scene but gets overshadowed completely by League (well, almost the whole asia is only focusing on League and SF4)

I wish SC2 had more moments where the crowd would go crazy, just like watching League pulling off awesome combos (which occurs more often than we think).  
There is at least one wow and intense moment in almost every single league game, even when it is extremely one sided just because landing those combos are amazing to watch.
I know most SC2 players hate League but you can't deny how much entertainment it provides to the viewers.  Even for a newbie like my friend who doesn't even know how moba is played just gets excited because of the tense moments such as stealing dragon/ganking etc.  
You don't get these much of these moments in SC2, especially with all ins because you just know it's over, there is just too much stuff shooting and we are basically watching the other player slow and painful death animation.
I don't remember when was the last time in KR we had a crowd roar nearly as loud as this one:

SC2 would still be around for the EU/NA audience and there are still players including me playing it occassionally but for all the issues, including the spectator enjoyment and the fun level playing the game, aren't likely to be solved in LotV.

t5_2v3da,,"I assume this means that the US is embargoed by every country, and no longer recognized diplomatically by anyone.

First of all, the economy of the US would collapse without overseas trade or investment. Wages would fall and the US would be in a depression for about 20-30 years. After that domestic production would begin to pick-up the slack. The standard of living would start to rise to 2013 levels. By 2050, the US would be fully recovered and be self-sufficient, new energy resources, namely solar and wind power, as well as coal, would be used and electric cars would be the norm.

Outside the US, there are some serious political ramifications:

* UN: Without the support of the US, the United Nations is dissolved because it can no longer meet.

* NATO: Without the US, NATO is dissolved.

* China: The People's Republic of China would have its economy collapse due to its reliance on US consumerism. This likely sparks a revolt resulting in the overthrow of the Communist regime.

* Russia: Without the US recognized diplomatically, and the internal strife China faces, Russia takes the slot of Number 1 on the world stage, and begins to boom as Europe and Asia begin to trade with Russia instead of the US.

* Rest of the world: Since the US produces 20% of the world's food with only 5% of the population, certain areas would experience widespread famine without the food of the US. Banking and financial centers would collapse as they can no longer collect their debt in the US, but US banks can still collect their debt held by foreign banks. 

* Middle East: The Middle East is much weaker as it is no longer supplying the US with oil hurting its economy. However, without Israel accepting aid from the US, the Arab nations prepare to strike against Israel and launch an invasion, coupled with insurgent strikes made by Palestinians, resulting in the crippling of Israel.

Overall, the rest of the world would be hurt a lot more then the US would be long-term. While the US would be hurt, it has the ability to become self-sufficient if it wants to. The rest of the world relies heavily on the US for food, and as a market for their goods.

Clothing, food, technology, it's all cheaper. 

People consider food to be expensive because they eat out a lot, buy shitty processed food, buy convenient healthy food (for example, those little packs of carrots with included cup of ranch dressing), or eat a lot of meat. We can control those things. If things were really tight, I could always plant a garden and buy a few chickens.

Gasoline will probably rise which is honestly a good thing. Europeans pay ~$8 a gallon and their society is still functioning. It's motivation to find alternative forms of energy. It discourages driving which at the present time is horrible for both the environment and our health. Automobiles have also become a status symbol, encouraging people to spend more money they should on transport. 

Medical care is the biggest area I would need to worry about. But I find it much more productive to think of ways to make it work then simply give up or complain about it. There's also the option of medical tourism. And of course taking care of ourselves to reduce medical spending.

It was not the fault of the US that Britain and France lost their colonies. Both nations had been tremendously weakened by the war and were in no shape to maintain power over imperial possessions. If the US did try to interfere and end imperialism then we did a terrible job because there were some rather brutal wars for independence fought in places such as Algeria from France (54-62).

Places such as India were let go when it was clear that public sentiment was strongly for independence. So it came down to either a peaceful transition or a bloody war against the people there.

I will agree that US intervention has not helped the middle east at all. Iraq and perhaps even Afghanistan are arguably worse off than before. *However*, that wasn't my point. My issue is with Europeans demanding something be done, then refusing to be the ones to do it. So then the US does something, Europe looks at us like we're savages, and the people we intervened on the behalf of view us as invaders. It needs to stop. It's doing nobody any good.

As for colonialism working? The only thing maintaining a colonial presence in the middle east would do is unite the people against the occupiers (which we see already with US and our version of colonialism).

Honestly, I think that the majority of Arab nations are not ready for democracy. Islam is not compatible with democracy. So unless the influence of Islam wanes to the point where it is somewhat moderate (such as it did with Turkey in the early part of the 20th century), the only way to keep peace and something vaguely resembling civil rights is for a secular dictator to maintain power. But that dictator can't be an outside force or they'll all rebel against them.

no, of course not, that's racist. i would argue that white men have only dominated the early modern era economy and that blaming any one group of people is inherently ignorant. i think the modern feminism movement is detrimental in many ways but they don't deserve all of the blame. also, i think that any culture or society that would have had the opportunities of Europe during the renaissance would have done pretty much the same thing.

You should also look into learning more in regards to frameworks. The people saying the Linux stuff isn't that relevant are wrong. When using Git or SASS etc. you'll often use the command line to get things done. 

The more you know the better when it comes to LAMP etc. Not saying you have to be a pro or anything but just the basic commands for permissions and moving around, installing etc.

There are consequences for your actions, that's exactly my point. Intent doesn't matter for anything. Break the rules, face the consequences.

No one is going to cuddle him and say it's okay that you gave the other guy early dementia cus ""you didn't mean it"". What a bullshit cop out. If you can't control your body and the only way you know to tackle is targeting, then _you_ don't belong on the field. Not the QB you destroyed.

...no? Gambit countered CJ teams once. The problem with your statement is:

- After a couple months Koreans came back and won IEM WC, so that point is wrong to begin with.
- Gambit without Edward is quite mediocre. They stopped being a world-class team.

Comparing Gambit to CJ teams in Season 3 is very misleading. Gambit (until very recently) had been a world-class EU team, yet CJ teams always got crushed in OGN semis 0-3. CJ teams lie in a weird position where they are better than the mid-tier teams, but not as good as the top-tier ones. Your reasoning is very similar to ""KR&gt;EU because SKT&gt;&gt;EG/NiP"", which is inaccurate for comparing teams of different regional skill level. People say KR is better than EU because SKT/KT/Ozone&gt;&gt;LD/Fnatic/GMB, which is an appropriate comparison, between top-tier teams of the two regions.

&gt; Soaz and Xpeke will go even against anyone unless camped

In IEM cologne Soaz lost to longpanda (possibly the worst top laner in Korea at the time) and xPeke lost on Orianna to Mightily's Karthus (Mightily was a low plat player at the time, he was later kicked for sucking).

It's been proven over and over again throughout history that the better prepared, better equipped and better led armys can easily beat 2 to 1 odds, hell... 5 to 1 or even 10 to 1 can happen.

China's army would be demolished by European or American coalition forces in a ground war.

The technology gap was smaller during the Korean conflict and coalition forces continually beat the snot out out of both north Korean and Chinese military. The only reason there was a back and forth was because of China's attrition rates.

With today's military technology in Europe and the US, China would get their asses handed to them.

Even Germany proved (WW2) that better equipment and strategies can kick the snot out of the largest of army's. They proved that by kicking the crap out of an entire continent for 6 years with a comparably small army.

Size means nothing when it comes to an army if they don't have the equipment , strategies or experience (China).",,0,t1_cbzhtml,,0,1378019665,True,t3_1lgmh6,1429628805,nicholsml,cbzhtml,False,0,0,1378019872,0,t1_cbzeguh,politics

It would mean the fall of the house of Saud. He who controls the valve of oil controls the windpipe of Europe and Asia  It would change the world. 

It's been speculated that they could lose this immense source of strategic power and wealth with a few sound systems mounted on the backs of truck and 20 Shiia Imans. This is why the Sauds are give a free hand to do what they want to crush Shiia dissent in Barhain, which is the opposite of Syria, A Sunni majority led by Shiia, but a Shiia majority led by a Sunni, ( put in place by the Sauds. 

It would also led to the loss of the petrodollar. The use of the petro$ means that the US can print dollars to pay for price increases in oil. Industrialized countries without oil, such as Japan EU or China, have to export to the US in order to obtain dollars to exchange for Opec oil; for example, cars in the case of Japan. So America gets oil and services and goods (eg cars) in exchange for pieces of paper. Not only that but Opec's excess dollars were then reinvested in the US and other industrialized countries, thus funding the US budget deficit and reducing US interest rates.

It would be a massive blow to lose the petrodollar. If no one bought US$ anymore I wonder how far it would drop in value.

You have that the other way around.  Compare black vs. whites for instance.  Whites are *much* less likely to be circumcised.

Part of this is due to the post 1900 European immigration waves.

You have to remember that Kellog was aiming to reduce the population of the undesirables (particularly in the south) through sterilization and other eugenic practices.  Circumcision was thought to lesson the desire for sex. They were also big on burning the clitorises off of girls with carbolic acid.   See the 'race betterment foundation' and other examples of the 'health' fads and where they were practised in the US.

This is also the same period that brought us planned parenthood with its pro-eugenics roots as well, if you are interested in history.  Or modern breakfast cereal (pressed grains were thought to lower your libido.)

If anything, the race part is incidental.  It was a north vs. south thing.

""The two British sports of cricket and football have established themselves as cornerstones of many cultures, exemplified in India and Argentina. The contemporary success both of these nations enjoy in international competition has established a strong connection between these sports and the cultures which sustain them. India, as a British colony, and Argentina, as a site of British neocolonial influence, both defined their relationships with Great Britain and the rest of the world, in some sense, with how they chased small round objects.

This paper will highlight how the differing class appeals of cricket and football combined with the distinct social structures of India and Argentina to form venue for dissent against British hegemony through sport developed by the very same hegemon. Indians used cricket to combat British control through direct competition and clubs patronized by aristocracy while Argentines forged and propagated an independent style of football to assert self-reliance and originality through grass roots, urban footballing development. Furthermore, Indians and Argentines both developed national heroes and utilized them as key stepping stones on a pathway to asserting a national identity. First, however, this paper will establish the origins and important social organization of cricket and football and their transportation to India and Argentina.""

So that first part of the paper discusses the different class appeals of the sports; namely, cricket appealed to the aristocracy in England due to the social nature of the sport, where the upper class would mingle while the sport carried on. The wealthy patronized teams as cricket was seen as an expensive sport with all the equipment to play it ""properly."" This spread to India for two main reasons (I posit): (1) the main British influence was upper class, aristocratic, or the officers in the military who favored cricket; and (2) Indian Rajas modeled themselves after British aristocrats and would field teams of Indians to either appease Brits to show how alike they were or beat them in open competition to prove Indians could be competitive and masculine. This last part stems from a solid literature about the emasculation of the Indian male due to the dominant British presence in India. For evidence about those looking to use cricket to appease Brits and climb the colonial governmental ladder, check out the Parsee cricket teams.  [This book as summarizes these arguments regarding emasculation and the Parsee use of cricket to climb the colonial power structure.](http://www.amazon.com/Cricket-Colonial-India-1780-Society/dp/0415400147)

Argentina, in part because there was less overt repression and less incentive to climb a political structure to reach the upper echelons of a colonial structure, and in part because the British settlers were largely businessmen and workers and not military and established schools (where football flourished), football dominated. Furthermore, Argentina didn't have the regionally powerful/wealthy Rajas that could patronize a football team, wealth just wasn't concentrated geospatially in a similar way.

It became a game of the poor that was improvised on the streets. You have to look no further than Maradona's autobiography when you see how important it was to the Argentine's that they are beating the English at their own game with their OWN STYLE. It shows that we took your sport as you took our resources. It is how the Argentine's were able to rebel. For more evidence, there is a story of two Argentine coaches Bilardo and Menotti which tells how Argentine's responded to being successful vs. playing with their independent style. Jonathan Wilson in *Inverting the Pyramid* tells this story, and he cites this chapter: ""In Search of National Identity: Argentinian Football and Europe"" in *Tribal Identities: Nationalism, Europe, and Sport* edited by J.A. Mangan which lays out the argument beautifully.

That's the gist. Forgive typos and errant commas this was in a haste. I hope that tells the story.

Isto não tem nada a ver com o preço da água engarrafada nem da água da torneira, tem a ver com o facto de o comerciante começar a reparar que está a perder imenso dinheiro de cada vez que alguém consome um copo de água ao invés de uma garrafa. Claro que isto foi levado ao extremo.

 A questão aqui é que existe um contrato social não declarado que funciona mais ou menos assim: ""Eu, comerciante, comprometo-me a dar um copo de água a quem mo pedir, desde que a pessoa em questão esteja a consumir alguma coisa que me ajude a recuperar o que eu paguei pelo dito copo."" Daí nunca ng querer saber do copo de água com o café.

A mesma coisa se passa, por exemplo com a utilização de casa de banho. Quantos sitios é que têm uma plaquinha a dizer que a ""Utilização da casa de banho é exclusivamente para clientes"" ? Montes, mas nunca ninguém questiona isso. Mas a verdade é que ter uma casa de banho aberta ao público tem os seus custos. Se o cliente não pagou nada para fazer offset a esses custos, pode utilizá-la ?

Por exemplo, eu tenho um restaurante, e aqui no meu concelho, onde pagamos a água super cara, eu nem sequer tenho esgoto (impossibilidade devido ao solo ser basicamente rocha) e portanto tenho uma fossa. De cada vez que tenho que pagar para esvaziar a fossa sinto que me estão a assaltar á mão armada. Se acrescentarmos a isso a quantidade de vezes que alguém que não é cliente vem usar a minha casa de banho, quanto é que eu tou a pagar para alguém vir usar a minha casa de banho?

Mexico, New Zealand, Australia, England, Germany, South Korea, and France. I also spent time in another dozen countries for lesser amounts of time, including a lot of Asia, some Africa, some Middle East, but little of that area in particular.

There are some significant differences between theists in other countries. I noticed that in Europe generally religion plays a little less of a role, but it's not hard to find many who are just as fundamentalist in their religion as the Deep South in the U.S. Aussies were generally far less bothered about religion, more concerned with beer and work and fun. New Zealand it was less clear depending on where you work, Auckland or the North Shore, Miarangi Bay and the like, pretty much like Australia. Southern parts of the north island, and some cities we visited in the South Island seemed a bit more conservative and religious, but I had a semi cursory view so can't say for sure.

South Korea and places like Taiwan, it's not in your face, but there is deeply religious beliefs as a strong undercurrent. The difference seems to be those religious beliefs aren't focused so much on a particular creation story, deity, savior, or sin, but more on concepts like respect and honor, duty and tradition, peace and understanding. Which makes them feel less religious until it comes to things like a funeral, or leaving a religion, marrying a westerner. Then you see those feelings come across as religious. 

I would very much agree that the U.S. on average tends to be one of the more, if not the most, religiously focused of the heavy industrialized nations. And one of the most impacted by the varying beliefs and confrontations.

It's possible that this style just doesn't have the action some gamers want, but if it's intrigue and a self-narrated sim you want, Paradox has your number.

My advice is to try Europa Universalis first. Play as Castille. EU is effectively the same game system, but deals with nations, which I found much easier to use to get the hang of the ""grand strategy"" system, rather than starting with the title/court system of CKII.

If you want to stick with CKII to learn, try as William the Bastard. You should probably win your war against England, but you will swiftly be taught a lesson about how important it is to delegate power to your vassals, lest they rise against you, or at least resist your rule enough to hinder your success as king.

Regardless, *pay attention to tooltips*. All the information you need is on the screen, and the rest is best learned through experience. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and mess around just to see what happens. Winning is entirely what you decide it is.

Force yourself to start over when you feel bored or overwhelmed, until you feel you can really act with purpose. Play all rungs on the power ladder, and try to navigate around. Do not load when you lose power; learn to climb back up.

Are you going to invent a solution to people getting old? being disabled? being children? Thats what welfare is. How about unemployment, what are you going to do to make it so that good paying jobs are available?

and exactly what is it that private schools do which makes them better? hey, I know, lets have the public schools do the same thing- like smaller class sizes, that seems like a no brainer, hmm, how many hundreds of thousands of teaching jobs have republicans killed? not that private schools are actually any better, they're just hyper selective.

&gt; Why do they deserve that? How about the paper boy? He works, should he be able to raise a family of three throwing flyers around? The only way your idea works is if all work is worth a living wage, and the sad, simply truth is that it doesn't.

Not like that job even exists anymore, but yes, if its worth having someone do for you, its worth paying a living. And getting back to your earlier point about ending welfare, I suppose his children should have thought twice about getting born to a guy delivering papers?

t5_2rg0n,,"I'm not sure you understood my point. Donating the blood or organ isn't indicative of the donor's state of disease (why would it be?). *Requiring* blood or an organ is indicative of a state of disease. The fetus existing is not a state of disease; it's a stage of human development.

&gt;The point is that as a general matter the law does not reach out and control your body to assist in the development/health/survival of another.

Except in perpetuating states of health. Let's list some of the ways:

- The government taxes us (e.g., takes money that we've earned, and thus reaches into our personal property) to provide welfare for those who cannot provide for themselves.

- The government taxes us to provide free public education to our children

- There are laws that prevent the neglect and murder of children and dependent adults

But as I said, pregnancy is *sui generis*. There is no other time in biology when someone's body is obligated to support another person's body, so we can only approach it with analogy, but all analogies of disease are inappropriate because pregnancy isn't a disease and being a fetus isn't a disease.

&gt;Do you know how many lives we could save if we could use all healthy corpses as donor material?

And it may eventually come to that. In some countries in Europe, instead of opting-in to organ donation, you need to opt-out, so the default is that you're an organ donor. But again, *obligating* people to give up their organs, even post-mortem, is obligating them to care for someone's disease.

There's a reason that the Irish referred to themselves as Gaels/Feni and all others as ""Gall"" meaning foreigner or outsider. They saw themselves as a single nationality.

Like I said, however, it varied. Some Irish Kings like Brian Bóroimhe really did rule over all of Ireland. There were other clans and dynasties, yes, but they were brought thoroughly in line and were made subservient to the king.

That was the nature of the feudalism, it always depended on the king. Ireland was frequently disjointed and decentralised, but that doesn't mean that it always was, or disqualify it as a nation.

Japan and Taiwan can, South Korea too though in those cases they'd each have to develop it domestically with a bit of technology transfer from the US.

Iran could probably manage it too if they got their priorities straight. So could North Korea - they have tens of thousands of missiles and artillery pieces aimed at South Korea. However Iran and North Korea seem to waste lots of cash failing to produce ICBMs and nuclear warheads. A factory to churn out anti ship cruise missiles is a lot less technically challenging than that and it would give them a way to keep the US away. A Sunburn type missile needs conventional explosives and a fairly low tech engine and the Russians will sell you Sunburns which you can clone. An ICBM needs plutonium. The guidance on the way down seems to be deeply non trivial too if you want to evade missile defence. None of the nuclear powers will sell ICBMs or the technology to a non nuclear power.

I actually think NK's ability to cause devastation in South Korea is a pretty good deterrent to the US. Iran has a large army and population and a few Sunburns though probably not enough to saturate a US CVBG's defences. Still the US military is noticeably wary of fighting a war against Iran.

I think it's interesting that conventional wisdom in rogue states says that you should develop nukes to deter the US. That's dead wrong - developing nukes makes a US attack more likely in the short term and in long term you can't afford to build enough to penetrate US defences anyway.

t5_2s3nb,,"One day, all the radio telescopes on Earth began picking up a strong signal coming from outerspace. The news exploded overnight. Within a few hours every major media outlet was on the story continuously, major governments called emergency sessions, and militaries were put on high alert. Within the first day, physicists, mathematicians, cryptographers, amateur radio operators, and everyone and their brother was working full time to decode the signal.

Which was very strange. The signal didn't originate in one point in space. It seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. The entire universe had started broadcasting apparently, at every single point in space, timed perfectly so every signal would reach Earth at exactly the same time. Much discussion was had over what kind of technology would allow this, or what the motive could possibly be. But most of the attention was focused on decoding the content of the message itself.

The message came in binary on's and offs, or 1's and 0's. It would broadcast a single bit every second, every so often stopping for 5 seconds before resuming, then stopping for 10 seconds after that. Each ""group"" of bits had no apparent standard order. Sometimes the groups were as big as a few hundred bits, sometimes they were only 2 or 3. Usually they were between 5 and 20. There was definitely a statistical pattern to it, but no one knew what it meant. The groups of bits that came after the 5 second pause were usually much shorter than the ones that came before. But this rule wasn't always true either, sometimes they were much larger.

Other weird patterns started to get noticed. The shorter groups of bits would often be in a regular pattern like 1111, or 101010, but there was no order to it. And the longer groups followed no apparent pattern whatsoever. Many people did find patterns, but they were forced, and only applied to one or two of the examples.

At this point thousands of these groups of bits had already been received. There was a 30 second pause, and then the signal just started sending out data continuously for many days. It only stopped after broadcasting a group much larger than the any of the previous groups, and then it never started back up. The signal was gone. All within a few weeks of first contact.

On Earth, life was finally getting to go back to normal and discussion died down somewhat from where it had been. Sports started being played on TV again. Politicians went back to arguing, though their speeches started to reference the future a lot more. People just went about their normal lives, but few people weren't wondering in the back of their minds, what would happen next.

Only a few weeks went by when the news exploded again. A team in Europe had cracked it. It was a computer programming language. Many had suspected that it might be so, but no one had been able to figure out what the rules of the language were. The team had produced an interpreter that could take a group of bits from the message, run it, and then produce the group of bits that came after it. The language itself was strange and completely different than computer languages used on Earth. It involved weird operations on bits that made no sense, or seemed extremely inefficient (it was also required lots of goto statements to do anything, to the horror of Earth programmers.)

Supercomputers were given the task of running a compiled version of the last group of bits, the really long one that came before it stopped entirely. They ran for days, never producing an output. Detailed analysis of the program revealed all sorts of weird things going on internally. Parts of the program appeared to represent equations commonly used by scientists and engineers. One part contained a full representation of the periodic table. Another seemed to represent animated 3d structures, moving around in complicated ways. It became clear the message was instructions to build something. *But what?*

The machine itself was very complicated, but it could be built relatively cheaply with Earth level technology. Some of the parts were apparently capable of self-assembling themselves, or assembling other parts, if carefully fed instructions from normal computers. Initially no one had any idea what it would do, but the consensus eventually formed that it was some kind of computer. It somehow took advantage of physics scientists hadn't even discovered yet.

Governments immediately imposed bans on building them and everyone was afraid of what they might do. But the information was already public, and the machine was just cheap enough that moderately wealthy individuals or organizations could do it on their own. And so many were built. And nothing happened. The machine just sat there. Doing nothing.

Careful study of the devices eventually led to discovering an interface with the computer itself. It used the same language that had been used to encode the original message to Earth. And it was *immeasurably* fast. Possibly infinitely fast. No one actually knew. Eventually the program that it was running was extracted.

It appeared to run some kind of physics simulation, with the same laws as our own universe. On top of that was another function which ran at a very specific point in time in the simulation.

&gt;Fluoride salts are used to enhance the strength of teeth by the formation of fluorapatite, a naturally occurring component of tooth enamel.[8][9] Although sodium fluoride is also used to fluoridate water and, indeed, is the standard by which other water-fluoridation compounds are gauged, hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) and its salt sodium hexafluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) are more commonly used additives in the U.S.[10] Toothpaste often contains sodium fluoride to prevent cavities.[11] Alternatively, sodium fluoride is used as a cleaning agent, e.g. as a ""laundry sour"".[7] A variety of specialty chemical applications exist in synthesis and extractive metallurgy. It reacts with electrophilic chlorides including acyl chlorides, sulfur chlorides, and phosphorus chloride.[12] Like other fluorides, sodium fluoride finds use in desilylation in organic synthesis. The fluoride is the reagent for the synthesis of fluorocarbons.

&gt;In medical imaging, fluorine-18-labelled sodium fluoride is used in positron emission tomography (PET). Relative to conventional bone scintigraphy carried out with gamma cameras or SPECT systems, PET offers more sensitivity and spatial resolution. A disadvantage of PET is that fluorine-18 labelled sodium fluoride is less widely available than conventional technetium-99m-labelled radiopharmaceuticals.

As far as I understand the statement Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills actually the last licenses to sell sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride to Syria were issued 17 and 18 January 2012 and for ""metal ﬁnishing of aluminium proﬁles used for making aluminium showers, windows, etc."".

These licenses were revoked on 30 July 2012 as part of EU sanctions against Syria.

Right now you could say that Russia is experiencing a 'Eurasianist' identity which isn't solely concerned with Western powers, and that has 'unique' values as a separate civilisation. Orthodox resurgence should be mentioned as well, which has been a key part of the post-Soviet identity and has contributed to widespread homophobia. Russia joined the European Council under Kozyrev and a lot has changed since then though. 

You also have to remember that joining the Council of Europe was not a given; Kozyrev and Yeltsin were giving mixed messages even up until the NATO-Russia founding act. 

Russia's interests in Asia and the Middle East were different from other NATO members because of Russia's location. Russia's identity forbade them from being integrated in the same way as Poland or other ex-Soviet countries. Russia wanted to be separate and *sovereign* from Europe and the West but be part of  them as well. The eventual acceptance of the NATO enlargement also convinced Russia that a parallel dialogue for cooperation could be built as well. America made this happen, and got Russia invited to the Council of Europe and the G7. This was backed up with the NATO-Russia founding act (1997?).

 Also to show just how far Russia changed its identity to the West from when the wall collapsed to the NATO Russia founding act, you have to see that by this point Russia had been selling helicopters and jets to the new European NATO members, clearly Russia was 'in' with Europe (not seeing NATO as a threat) and had succeeded in constructing a new identity.",,1,t1_cbzjg4k,,0,1378032581,True,t3_1lh71f,1429628010,callumgg,cbzjg4k,False,0,1,False,0,t1_cbzj9zy,Ask_Politics

If you'll remember, this pipeline has been Putin's reminder that he's not taking shit from anyone.

If you look at how Putin came into power and basically saved Russia as a country in the course of a decade, it involved nationalizing Gazprom and overthrowing an incredibly powerful oil oligarchy.

t5_2qorf,,"&gt;What I am trying to say is that the Bitcoin protocol and network will never freeze accounts or stop transactions from happening.

The network it self never will. But for anyone with even moderate wealth in bitcoins, it will pay to stay legal. A single slip up in your encrypted-tor-proxy-internet use will leave a permanent bread crumb to your illegal activity/money laundering/terrorist funding. For kids with 0.1 bitcoins in their wallet who want to buy a little bit of weed, fine. That can't be stopped, but the government doesn't care about that.

&gt;As long as transactions are semi-anonymous or pseudonymous then it's vastly too expensive to use the Rubber-Hose method on everyone using bitcoin.

They will already determine guilt before they resort to any threats. Like I said, there are many ways to analyze the entire transaction ledger already. In the future, if you can figure out a person's wallet number and a single transaction they made, that info could be plugged into an algorithm to give you their entire bitcoin history.

&gt;Bitcoin has never been made illegal in any country and it most likely will not be.

It doesn't have to be made illegal. Perhaps in the future wallet numbers may simply have to be declared in tax filings, like foreign bank accounts are today.

&gt;Plus the US Gov might try to stop bitcoin, but I don't live in the US. If the US gov. makes a big attempt, the UK, EU, China and Russia are all great places for Bitcoin.

t5_2ssp3,,"I would like to suggest a couple things.

Firstly, The Netherlands is a small country, so from the start large countries like Britain and France have a leg-up on the Dutch. It's not so much that the Dutch declined, but that they had industrialized to capacity and other European powers simply had more resources at their disposal.

Second, the standard of living was higher in NL than in general it was for Britain/France, meaning there were less available people to work in factories.

Third, the Netherlands is a relatively poor place to find natural resources, most of the peat was dug up early on and natural gas wasn't useful until later. There wasn't much coal or timber to be had like in other countries, so the Dutch had to rely on trade for these resources.

So in the end, it boils down to sheer size, which the Netherlands doesn't do well in. It has been an industrialized and high living standard country since its Golden Age, and over time became overshadowed the same way America overshadowed England later.


This is also another reason the western world may look wearily on China, because they have so many people and resources to exploit (coal, rare earth metals, etc.). Maybe China will be the next to overshadow the current superpower, but that is yet to be seen.

t5_2cneq,,"&gt; Should it be 70% or more now too? You bet your ass it should. Any nation that doesn't tax the people who have all the money - ie, the wealthy - is doing itself a huge disservice. 39.6% is a sick joke, and the other tax loopholes that allow the wealthy to pay some preposterously low number like 15% are downright in the ""crimes against the citizens"" level.

If you raise taxes to 70%, the rich will leave.  They get up and go.  They're not static entities, and citizenship or residency isn't an inelastic good.  You raise the price (i.e. tax rate) and at some point, people stop being american, and move to Switzerland, Hong Kong, or somewhere else with a low tax rate.

Many rich people are able to pay only 15%, because they make their income from capital gains, the marginal income tax rate in the top bracket is 39.6%.  Throw in state and local income tax on top of that (e.g. NYC), and rich people with ordinary income are actually paying a rate that is similar to the UK, Germany, and many other EU countries.  That's great news if you've got tons of investments, but really bad news if you're a physician or an engineer, let's say.

Here's what you should be pissed about.  People who are employed at certain federal government agencies (i.e. the federal reserve) can realize previously held stock options *as capital gains* rather than as ordinary income.  Most people that get stock options as compensation are the super rich, with a few exceptions.  Normally, when you get stock options as compensation, it's taxed as regular income, at the higher rate.  But, by being a Washington insider, you can start work at the federal reserve, execute previously acquired stock options, and have **original income taxed as capital gains**, thus avoiding the extra 14.9% tax that's assigned to regular income. 

Basically, the reason that the tax code is so complex, is that the people in power made it that way, then switched to the private sector, already knowing how to take advantage of the system.  It's how people show up at the federal reserve with 100k in the bank, and then leave with 20 million.  They're not earning that from their nominal public sector salary, they're earning that because they're little corrupt fuckers.

If there's one thing I consistently see on /r/politics, is the ""soak the rich argument."" But that's a misdirection from the true problem, which is that Washington is rife with corruption.  I mean, literally, what passes as acceptable in the United States, (e.g. working for the FDA and Pfizer in alternate years) would be clearly prosecuted as corruption in Europe, Japan, or Hong Kong.  Shit, in china they might even put you to death for it (don't agree with that - but that's besides the point)

But hating on the rich is just populist anger.  Raising taxes to 70% would be devastating to the US economy, because all of those people would simply leave, bringing all of their capital to some other country that's more competitive.

Want to fix the system?  Here's what I think you do.  Remove all of the exceptions -all of that shit on Schedule A and elsewhere about fucking ""R&amp;D expenditures"" or ""oil exploration"" or ""domestic production.""  That's where the bullshit rubber hits the bullshit road.  Even the popular stuff like home mortgage interest rate deduction should go, everything.  Say that, if you have income, it's taxed at 15-20%, and make it progressive, but have it hit the top tax rate at a relatively low income rate, say 20k for a single person. Tax corporations at the same rate, to remove any incentive to avoid incorporating to avoid personal income tax. 

The tax code I'm describing exists, and it works splendidly. It's in Hong Kong, where the tax code is, altogether, 200 pages long, english and chinese together.  The american public have a huge incentive to get this done, because it actually makes our tax code more progressive.  How?  By eliminating all of the tricks and loopholes that the rich, with their high powered accountants are able to use.  It would put everybody the same responsibilities, proportionally, unlike the current tax code which places greater responsibility on the poor, as a proportion of income.
  
Washington's going to drag its heels the whole way, however, because all of that tax code complexity assures employment for giant armies of bureaucrats and government lawyers who's jobs exist solely to administer all of the bullshit.  I can only hope that such interests can be overcome some day.

tl;dr A convoluted tax code isn't just a pain in the ass to navigate.  It gives people in power with the resources needed to afford an accountant, the ability to pay a lower tax rate by taking advantage of all of the loopholes in the US tax code.  Poor people can't afford good accountants, and so the system can only really be gamed by the rich.",,0,t1_cbzkh32,,0,1378040426,True,t3_1lhcc6,1429627531,albinus1927,cbzkh32,False,0,0,False,0,t1_cbzjmrx,politics

Top flight players, make it because they not only go through the same training as other players in the clubs' youth setups, they also have a little bit extra that is beyond what football education can give you. It's what makes them world class. Why can't we just take a large group of kids, build world class facilities for them and hopefully produce a worthy team? Because other countries have a football culture, a large number of the population is participating in a weeding out process that produces a proper team. The only way is natural selection.

Until we have a distributed network of training setups across the country and football can provide a good income for at least our top flight players, we won't have the kind of participation that can engineer a proper team.

School level football I feel, has hit a ceiling. Only a handful of schools have facilities for kids to train, work out and get the kind of build and skills that can hopefully get them picked up by a European club. A couple of guys I play with have auditioned in London and Singapore.

So our best hope, the way things are going, is 20 - 30 Indian players playing for European or South American clubs, who can form our national team.

One thing I'll say about Middle East (not Islam) is that region is ruled by tribes, unlike kingdoms in Europe. People in that region go to their local elder or tribe leader, not their official government. That's what makes it harder to break. Governments in the West merged and became larger, stronger, with a national identity.

For places like the USA and Australia the main factor was that by the time football reached their shores, both countries had already invented their own mainstream sports they called football (American football/Gridiron and Australian rules football/Aussie rules), so association football was given the nickname soccer, and struggled to compete with already established and popular sports. In Australia soccer was seen as a foreign/un-Australian sport until around the 1950s, when the ""Populate or Perish"" policy brought a wave of working migrants from central and eastern Europe who established soccer clubs in their new home and helped to increase the popularity of the sport.

Even now Aussie rules, rugby and cricket remain the most popular sports in the country, and football still faces opposition from some who consider it to be a foreign game. However, the game is slowly becoming more mainstream with the introduction and growth of the A-League as well as the success of the national team in the last 10 or so years.

I know the thread was about India in particular but I just thought I'd share what I can remember about the spread of the game in general. Hope that helps!

I'm using [military spending](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/45102a24ca026b43431f6ecf0327192e.png) for the sake of simplicity 

[source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget)

The US absolutely dwarfs that of every other country on earth in military spending by a large margin.   If you start to narrow down factors and get into specifics about the military might it can get more complex.   

For instance there are an estimated 2.8 million active members in the Chinese Military.   That's 1.8 million more than the US has.   However, in a 3rd generation war, it would be nearly impossible for the Chinese to mobilize, feed and effectively use a military of that scope.

t5_2ssp3,,"It's no really a case of decline but more a case of being surpassed in economic growth. This had a number of reasons: 
 
- Mercantilism/Colbertisme (other country's protecting their own trade) Example: Act of Navigation (1651) Banned foreign ships from trading in English ports.  

- high wages/ low productivity 

- Costly wars and disastrous wars. In 1672 an alliance of France, England, Sweden, Munster and Cologne Invaded the Netherlands and almost conquered it. This year is dubbed rampjaar (""disaster year"") in Dutch. 

- Political Corruptness/Laziness the Netherlands where a republic and governed by a group of people called 'regenten' they where members of rich and influenced families, the most important regent was the *raadpensionaris van het gewest Holland* of *Landsadvocaat* the most important military role was *de Stadhouder* *de facto* was this a hereditary position hold by a member of the House of Orange. 

 There was always a power struggle between the *Staatsgezinden* ( people who supported the Landsadvocaat ) and the *Prinsgezinden* ( people who supported the Stadhouders ) in times of peace and prosperity the *landsadvocaat* held the most power, between 1650 and 1672 there was no *stadhouders*. when in 1672 the french invaded the people blamed the regents for the state of the army and demanded a *stadhouder*. William III was made *stadhouder* and defended the republic. William had ambitions to become king! and in 1689 he became king of England, this meant safety for the Nederlands but the Bill of Rights prevented that William revoked bills like The Acts of Navigation. But it also meant that The Netherlands needed support England in some large wars, with peace deals that clearly favored British interests. (I'am looking a you Peace of Utrecht (1713)) 

 In the same period ( early to late 18th centenary) the ruling class became corrupted and lazy they where more busy protecting their interests than protection the Dutch interest, they where becoming also more of a aristocracy/Plutocracy. They where appointing important jobs to each other, it was increasingly harder to join their class.

- Political stability in the rest of Europe
  One of the most important factors in the decline of the republic is the growth of other countries. The Netherlands is a small country ( DUH ) and can't produce the same amount of goods than the economic power house France, the same is with manpower and military strength. The Dutch Republic most successful years where in the period that England, France and The Holy Roman Empire where weak. 
 
 England had to deal with their civil wars (1639-1651) and the political aftermath. From 1688 there was a fast economic growth.  

 France became a powerhouse under the rule of Louis XIV (1643-1715) he gave France the largest army in the world, this forced the Dutch to invest in their army what raided the tax burden in the Netherlands.

 between 1618-1648 their was the 30 year war in the HRE which devastated much of what is now Germany. The Netherlands where involved in this war, but the war didn't affect the Netherlands that much. After the war the HRE could rebuild them self.

It's amusing because I think that sometimes we forget that Freemasonry, as an organization, and as a loose philosophy, is an awesome thing itself.

t5_2qh13,,"&gt; Destroy someone's country? Really? I mean I'm pretty sure most people from North Africa in France are actually second generation immigrants.

What does this have to do with anything? As a European you have not lived under a post colonial or colonial society. It's not your fault obviously, but you need to be far more empathetic to understand that colonialism was horribly detrimental for most of the world. The French were probably the worst among the colonizers; at least the British did a LOT for infrastructure and it's quite obvious to see the difference between former British colonies and former French colonies.

&gt; You're blaming French society for why immigrants who have voluntarily moved there don't have jobs. Bull fucking shit. The idea that a French company would refuse to hire, for instance, a qualified engineer because he has an Arabic name is bullshit. The reason why a lot of immigrants don't get jobs is because they aren't well educated. And there aren't that many low qualified jobs even for ethnic French people. 

Voluntary? By the strictest definition of the word, yes. But you are taking out all context here. If your home country has been torn apart in the wake of post-colonialism, is it really voluntary? Do you think these people really WANT to abandon their native cultures? No, but they have mouths to feed and family to care for, so they do what's best for their family.

Illegal immigrants in the USA from mexico are ""voluntary""but when you look at how shitty the situation is in mexico and their motives for crossing the border, it's hardly ""voluntary"".

&gt;Reports of “Brussels Big Brother Bid” to impose speed controls are inaccurate beyond the limit

&gt; September 1, 2013
&gt; 
&gt; Reports in the press today suggest that the EU intends to bring forward “formal proposals this autumn” to introduce automatic speed controls -known as “Intelligent Speed Adaptation” or ISA, into cars. **This is quite simply not true and the Commission had made this very clear to the journalists concerned.**
&gt; 
&gt; The Mail on Sunday for example, uses a quote from a Commission spokesman but chooses to leave out the first and most important sentence given to the paper’s reporter, which was this:
&gt; 
&gt; **“The Commission has not tabled – and does not have in the pipeline – even a non-binding Recommendation, let alone anything more.”**
&gt; 
&gt; For the record, the rest of the quote supplied said this:
&gt; 
&gt; “The Commission has supported past research into ISA. There is a current stakeholder consultation and study focusing on speed limiting technology already fitted to HGVs and buses. One aspect of that is whether ISA could in the long-term be an alternative.
&gt; 
&gt; And a second consultation on in-vehicle safety systems in general. Taking account of the consultation results, the Commission will publish in the autumn a document by its technical experts which will no doubt refer to ISA among many other things. That is all. (NB such “staff working documents” are not adopted by the Commission at political level and have no legal status.) Nothing more is expected in the foreseeable future.
&gt; 
&gt; It is part of the EC’s job – because it has been mandated to do so by Member States, including the UK – to look at, promote research into and consult stakeholders about new road safety technology which might ultimately save lives. This is done in close cooperation with Member States and the UK has generally supported such efforts.”
&gt; 
&gt; It might also seem strange to some that the UK government -if the press reports are accurate at least in that respect – apparently objects so violently to even being consulted about a range of future ways in which lives could be saved on Europe’s roads.

THEN he purchased the means to make even yet still more money, and THEN he was given honorary nobilities in several countries. And now there are laws against profiteering. Why? Because of the Rothschild coups. 

What rules/laws/regulations gave Rockefeller his monopoly? I'm confused.... First (what would become) Standard Oil became a monopoly through horizontal integration, and then later vertical...

Here, maybe you can find a part in that article where it says the government helped them into their monopoly. 

The Federal Reserve was made through what was essentially a hostage situation whereby the biggest players bullied the government into allowing them to become the Federal Reserve.

t5_2ssp3,,"Dang,  you  posted  this  while  I  was  rooting  around  looking  for  an  old  notebook  of  research  I  did  twenty-two  years  ago.  Since  I  made  the  effort,  I  will  fill  out  your  answer  with  more  details.      
      Holy  Roman  Emperor  Karl  V  was  deep  in  debt  to  the  Welser  banking  house  of  Augsburg.  In  return  for  reducing  this  debt,  he  made  a  concession  for  the  German  bankers  to  develop  a  territory  they  called  Klein  Venedig  (little  Venice).  They  sent  Ambrosius  Ehinger  to  this  undeveloped  area,  where  he  established  the  settlement  of  Maricabo  in  1529.  A  small  number  of  German  miners  went  along,  but  they  soon  died  from  tropical  diseases.  The  4,000  African  slaves  the  German  bankers  bought  and  sent  to  Venezuela  established  a  sugar  plantation  that  was  more  successful.      
     Nikolaus  Federman  was  one  of  Ehinger's  deputies.  He  explored  much  of  south  eastern  Columbia  and  south  western  Venezuela,  looking  for  the  legendary  city  of  El  Dorado.  Federman  was  supposed  to  be  looking  for  a  south  west  passage  to  the  Pacific.  The  Orinoco  river  was  so  large  and  had  such  a  strong  flow,  Spanish  explorers  as  far  back  as  Columbus  thought  it  might  be  a  short-cut  to  Asia.  This  expedition  failed  to  produce  the  desired  results.  It  also  caused  all  sorts  of  legal  troubles  for  Nikolaus  Federman.  The  Welser  banking  house  sued  Federman  for  100,000  ducats  and  they  won  the  initial  case.  Federman  could  not  pay  that  enormous  sum.  He  was  still  appealing  this  law-suit  in  1541  at  the  Spanish  Council  of  the  Indes,  when  he  died.  Federman's  notebooks  were  post-humously  published  in  1557  in  the  book  ""Indianische  Historia.  Ein  Schone  kurtzweilige  Historia  Nicalus  Federmanns""   It  is  one  of  the  earliest  chronicles  about  European  exploration  of  the  interior  of  Venezuela.      
     The  house  of  Welser  sent  two  additional  governors  to  Klein  Venedig.  Georg  von  Speyer,  who  died  shortly  after  his  arrival  in  Maricabo,  and  Philipp  von  Hutton.  Hutton  also  was  enthralled  by  the  legend   of  El  Dorado  and  went  deep  into  the  jungles  of  the  upper  Orinoco  Basin  looking  for  it.  He  was  gone  for  so  long,  the  Spanish  thought  he  had  died.  The  Spanish  appointed  their  own  governor  and  cancelled  the  Klein  Venedig  colonial  charter.  When  Philip  von  Hutton  emerged  from  the  jungle  in  1546,  the  Spanish  charged  him  with  treason  and  deriliction  of  duty.  They  sent  him  back  to  Europe,  thus  ending  the  first  German  attempt  at  establishing  colonies  in  South  America.

The problem lies in having 1 season, with 2 different splits, where neither split affects the other, and the only thing that really matters is how you do in the playoffs of the second split.


I think this whole ""split"" business needs to be done away with, to be frank. The only issue with that, is that Riot wants to create an environment where you can rise through the ranks from challenger to professional, and having one long season means fewer chances for you to do so. Instead, they need to have one long season alongside a developmental league, and then at the end of the season, have a qualifier for the next season.


No matter what system you propose with their multiple splits within 1 season, there will be massive problems. You look at OGN and you see that, even though Sword was great at the start of the year, they are no longer a top korean team, but they still get to go to worlds because they did well in prior splits, and everyone has an issue with that. You look at LPL, and their seeds are determined PURELY by best of ones, and their own playoffs are 100% pointless. You look at EU and NA, and you're left with half of your season being pointless.

All the passages in the Bible about stoning children can be ignored because the people who use the Bible have found loopholes around them. Most muslims in the East haven't. So when the Koran tells you to behead a homosexual if you see one, it's a lot more of a scary thing. 

There's a huge difference between the Islam which is found in the West and the the Islam found in the East. There's also huge differences in catholicism depending on where you find it. Catholics and Protestants in the UK and Europe tend to be relatively passive but if you compare them to South America or Africa you would be amazed how violent they can be and how literally they interpret their holy books. 

I don't think Islam is inherently bad. But I think that it is bad so long as its followers continue to read its scripture literally. In a liberal democracy every one is allowed to believe what they want. However when belief becomes a certain kind of action I think we have a problem. Anglicans, Catholics and Protestants in the UK will seldom if ever turn their beliefs into violent action. If the Catholic or Anglican Churches stepped up their language and started inciting violence then I think we might have to take action against them, which might be banning or censorship. It all depends on how literally people take the religion's message and whether we can expect them to act or not. Eastern Islam should be banned. Western Islam, from what I see, is mostly ok. It's pretty non violent from my experience and that means it is ok. So long as it can remain that way and not become more Eastern, then that's fine for me.

SC2 is rarely in the top 3 on Twitch anymore, even absent a major event in another game (it is at the time I write this post because TakeTV is live and there's nothing going on at PAX right now).

Wow, I am very impressed at the Israelis' desire to see the Americans attack Syria. I am sure that if we polled them on their desire to see the Americans wipe Gaza off the face of the map, the results would be similar. Should the US give a fuck? I think not.

&gt; Obama’s action weakens America and makes it the laughing stock of the Middle East.”

And how many constituents does he have there? I suppose it could be as high as, say, 100 K American citizens, or maybe a bit more. Can't really blame him for caring more what the 316 M he has at home [think — 50% against, 42% for](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/polls-americans-attack-syria-support-limited-action/story?id=20118605) — and this is before the congressional debate.

What seems to be missing from the Israeli mainstream perspective — yes, I know there are a few sane people in the hard-coreopposition there, say 1% — is that the erosion of the US position in the Middle East is by no means a result of Obama's decision. On the contrary — Obama's decision is a result of this erosion. 

The Israelis should definitely worry. This latest turn of events proves that the balance of forces is shifting and the ability of the US to unilaterally call the shots in the Middle East — as it has been able to do for the last several decades in support of Israel — is slowly but surely disappearing and the day may come sooner than many of them seem to think, where Israel will have to contend with an environment in which it is Russia, China, and the EU having as much or more influence as the US, in addition to the regional powers — Turkey, Iran, Egypt. In this environment, they will not be able to leverage a lobby in support of their expansionist policies and may find themselves all alone facing a very hostile, well armed environment in which the [Arab Peace Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Peace_Plan) will seem like an absolute best option, but guess what — by then it'll be off the table.

t5_2ssp3,,"Most of the English colonies played cricket above all other games. The English were historically actually pretty bad at exporting football.

The Caribbean, Australasia, India/Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa (even, arguably Canada) all took to cricket with much more zeal than football. In fact, if anything most of the English colonies are significantly *behind* at football vs the other European colonies.

This is most likely due to a few reasons. Football was never very popular with the British ruling and diplomatic classes, with cricket the preferred game for gentlemen. Football amongst the British working classes was also not the huge sport it is now until towards the end of the 1880s, so even the few who got out to the colonies may not have spread it much. 

It was also favored as the game to bet on during the 1800s amongst the ruling classes, which considering the relative boredom of colony life probably added to them wanting the game played even more consistently than they did in the UK. This in turn may well have opened it up to more locals due to the high demand for players/grounds/services, as it did for staff/locals etc on English country estates during the same period, as well as providing a keen source of pride for colonies when they were able to beat their occupiers.

  Also IMO valve have a huge problem with the matchmaking in that game.

The line where lack of proper nutrition becomes child abuse is difficult to draw. I believe we can all agree a parent that feeds their overweight child fastfood every day is not a fit parent, and child services should be involved. 

I see your point about a line being difficult to draw, but saying circumcision shouldn't be allowed is not a slippery slope. There are no other instances like it.

Dr. Doom's cunning is legendary, he tricked the devil. He was able to built doom bots which are far more powerful than anything the EU ever came up with.

His magic abilities are sometimes said to be just a few notch below Dr. Strange (depends on the writer), who takes on extra-dimensional beings like Shuma-Gorath. Shuma Gorath conquered 100 universes.

His suit is second only to Iron Man.

In a straight up fight? 

-------------------------------

Palpatine is dead. All of them. The galaxy seemed so save and peacful again. If there wasn't these rumors. Something odd was happening in the Outer Rim. Something was on this moon. He felt it in the Force and Luke knew better than to deny such feelings.

He looked across. It was not as hot as it had seemed. Yes, it was a dessert, but dessert doesn't necessary mean hot. Only that it lacked vegetation as far as he could see. And then he felt it. It was strange, new. This wasn't the force, this was something different.

His instincts once again saved him, as the energy blast missed him by an inch. ""I knew you would come to meet your Doom!""

The shock was deep. It cannot be. There, standing in front of the sun was the silhouette of something familiar. And this mechanical voice. Interrupted only by his breathing. Luke could not think, could nearly move: ""Father?""

No, it wasn't it. Luke could remember his Aura. This wasn't him. It was an impersonator. Something different. He activated his Lightsaber.

""Who are you?""

""You dare to not know who I am? Your ignorance insults me! And for this insult you must be punished. This whole galaxy stinks of stupidity and inferiority. I will not tolerate this any more! Know that I am here to save you! To protect you all from your imperfections! Know that I Have come to rule you! Know that I AM HE. I AM THE ALMIGHTY DR. DOOM! I WI...""

""You talk too much!"" Lukes use of the Force is unmatched. Without even taking a sweat he immobilizes Doom. Another pretender, full of himself. Will they never learn?

But something was wrong. This... no.. this... AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!

Luke falls down to the ground. A smell of burned flesh fills the air. Behind him stands Dr. Doom with a smile behind his mask. ""It is in fact an inferior galaxy""

Slowly he walks to the DoomBot that he has used as a decoy. What did this Jedi think? That Doom was stupid enough to face him alone? Face him in person? This Jedi was a mere pawn, nothing more. He was an means to an end. Doom removed the machine from his wrist. It had taken quite a while to built it. Eventually he had it finished. Now it was his. All of it. Doom started to laugh as he felt the power of the force crawling through his body! All the power of the most powerful Jedi was now his.

Not my story, it's my dad's. he was backpacking through Europe about 20 years ago and stayed in Nice for a couple nights. He met up with a couple of other backpackers on the train and they decided to go get a drink.

So they go to a bar near their hostel, and sit down to have a drink. After a few beers, my dad noticed that a table of rather fine, french women were being accosted by some stupidly drunk Algerian sailors. So my dad and his friends, with the help of some ""dutch courage"" decide to intervene and go over to their table and ask the women if they want to come sit with them. And immediately after that, everything went to shit.

The Algerians flip their shit and start getting all up in my dads face. Now keep in mind that its a little late, and that the bar is filled with a fuckton of other people who are completely drunk off their asses. So appparently, somebody else noticed this little altercation, went bezerk and slammed a chair into one of the algerians face.

It's an absolute clusterfuck, people are smashing eachother in the face with barstools, pint glasses and fists. So my dad and his friends do the smart thing and escape out the side door.

So now their all in the alley next to the bar, but guess who else is their with them? The fucking Algerians. So shit is tense and everyone is clenching their assholes. But the Algerian who got clocked right in his shit eating face pulls out a fucking Smith and Wesson and my dad  and friends bolt it.

So now their running down a sidestreet in Nice at 1 in the morning, with a bunch of batshit crazy Algerians trying to kick their shit in.

SO after about 10 minutes of running, they think they've escaped. WRONG. all of a sudden they hear a loud *BANG* and one my dads pals goes down. luckily he only got hit by a ricochet. so they help him out and nope the fuck out of there.

So they finally manage to escape the Algerians, so my dad and friend 1 go and get friend 2 patched up. After a trip to the hospital they had to back to their hostel, which is near the bar, and they run into the fine french foxes from earlier. The ladies are grateful and invite them to stay the night at their place.

So after what i can only presume was a night in Fuckcity: population: 3. my dad parts ways with his fellow backpackers part ways and he continues down the train line.

t5_2s7tt,,"&gt; Somalia is really a red herring, it's not an anarchist ""state"" (more problematic language). It's a failed state that has descended into anarchy in the sense of chaos, not in the sense of any shared anarchist philosophy among its people. Bringing up Somalia is useful rhetorical shorthand for ""stateless societies do not work.""

I think that by this point it should be noted that an insurgent group known as [Al-Shabaab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shabaab) has been responsible for dragging the country's conflict on. Only intervention by the African Union managed to lower their numbers.

If it were not for Siad Maximed Barre's left-wing policies, the Somali government would not have been destabilised and it would not have collapsed. For this reason, Somalia is actually a very strong case against big-government.

&gt; While I do advocate government, that doesn't necessarily put me in a position of defending every terrible government that can't handle it's shit or maintain law and order.When the state fails, it's bad for society, Somalia being a good example.

One of the reasons why Somalia is in the horrible state it's in now is because the people there don't know how to form a coherent, functioning society. Almost every country in sub-Saharan Africa is the way it is because of the fact that the indigenous natives are not familiar with the concepts of peaceful co-operation and complex civilisation. 

European colonialisation was very bad for this reason, as a new, unfamiliar system of governance was given to people who were little more advanced than tribal collectives which engaged in conflict with each-other. Perhaps if we had given the African people another millennium or so without interference, they may have built extremely elaborate empires by that point.

TL;DR: You can't really use Somalia as an example of a Libertarian society as the people consist largely of backwards, primitive tribals who live still in straw huts and are on the same level of civilisation that western Europeans were prior to the early modern era. You can hardly compare a country filled with uncivilized savages with a western country which has fully-educated and modern people, like Britain or France. 

**EDIT**: I just want to make it absolutely clear that this has nothing to do with race. Afghanistan and Iraq are both in an even worse state than state than Somalia, and the people of both countries can be described as white. I utterly despise white supremacists. It's just a fact that East Africa is a region of the world has not developed as quickly as Europe, and European colonialism made the proccess even slower.

t5_2ssp3,,"Just to add on:

The reason why Flanders was substantially poorer at this time had very much to do with the Industrial Revolution. Along with England, Wallonia was one of the earliest regions in the world to industrialize - specifically in coal production and iron smelting. This made the region, comparative to its size and population, incredibly rich. Along with the fact that French was the language of the courts for most of the 18th and 19th centuries, this led to both the aristocratic and bourgeois elites in Belgium speaking french, not dutch. Economically, Flanders had also been on a decline even prior to the 80's year war. Antwerp's ports were blockaded for decades, and the cloth manufacturing industries in the old staple ports of Flanders wasn't worth nearly as much as it was in the medieval and early Renaissance periods. It was only after WWII that Flanders slowly became the economic center of Belgium, as traditional blue collar industries faltered.

Another item to remember is that when we speak of Belgian colonies, we are pretty much only speaking of the one colony Belgium had - Congo. Yes, after WWI Rwanda was added from the German colonial possessions, and Belgium did have a tiny concession in China too (like every European colonial power), but ultimately when we speak of Belgian colonial history, we are exclusively speaking of Congo. Now, the Congo, as a colonial possession, was exclusively under control of Leopold II for the first 30 years of its colonial history. By exclusively, I mean that all of the Congo was private property of the King of Belgium. The King spoke french, and so did his court. It was only natural that the administrators of his private possessions would be able to use the same language in its administration.

I think a just asinteresting question however would be why french is actually the spoken language of the Congo at all. Even compared to its colonial neighbors, the education and administration of the Belgian Congo was absolutely abysmal. I cannot remember the source directly (if anyone can help me out here, please do!) but I do remember a figure being quoted that after independence from Belgium, Congo has less than half a a dozen registered doctors - primarily because Belgium has spent so little in educating the people of its colony. Why then, would its people adopt a language no one spoke?

This is just such an easy opinion to have. We know *for a fact* that the primary reason that it was even possible for the Nazi regime in Germany to get away with rounding up millions of Jewish citizens, as well as citizens of other minorities (gypsies, gays, mentally handicapped, etc.) and kill them off was a sustained and deliberate campaign of what we today know as hate speech.

And before someone invokes Godwin's Law and cries ""argumentum ad hitlerum"": If we are not even willing to discuss what we learnt from those dark years, which make up a huge historical trauma in all of European culture, how can we ever progress from it?

""Hate speech"" has a very specific definition: Speech targeted at a minority group with the purpose of marginalising said group, ultimately legitimising violence against it. It's not an easy definition to work with legally, which is why most jurisdictions leave it to judges and juries to decide precisely what is and isn't ""hate speech"". But we can't simply ignore the problem. We won't repeat past mistakes.

&gt; No the comic is making a statement about being politically correct and people that insinuate someone is ""hate mongering"" because they're not all ""inclusive"" or ""sensitive to [insert whatever label here]"" hence the last caption at the end: ""The world must be tailored to me and my ridiculously restrictive standards... what's a little censorship between friends?""

It's an argument *ad absurdum*. Nobody feels that being sensitive to their own circumstances in life is a ridiculous expectation. If you're in a room with a paraplegic, you wouldn't feel that it's appropriate to point out how great rock climbing is, because you know it's likely to evoke unpleasant feelings in them. If you do, most people would think you're an absolute asshole. Likewise, you're not being ""censored"" for being expected to act decently around other people — which, among other things, involves not using their social identity as a derogatory term. You're not being put to jail, but you're also not free from social repercussions, such as people rightly thinking ill of you.

If you have an *actual argument*, the content of that argument should be possible to present without insulting anyone. If you find that your opinion evokes protest from people in a marginalised position, to the point where they dislike you for having it, consider the possibility that you may have been wrong about the circumstances that someone other than yourself has to deal with.

t5_2s7tt,,"Mozart, big genius, everyone gets compared to him. He actually wrote music that was far simpler than Bach's 

music, but in a way he was like Edison - a brilliant salesman. He toured Europe playing piano from a young age, 

he wrote music at a young age, he died at a young age. But he began the middle class's obsession with music as 

an art, taking it away from religious establishments and the royalty. It still remained though - Haydn worked 

almost exclusively for the Esterhazy family on a big country estate for most of this life. He was isolated, but 

this meant he didn't follow the times and made important new ground. Famous pieces include the Farewell 

Symphony, where players gradually left the stage during the music. The next day after that concert the Duke gave 

them all a pay rise so they wouldn't walk out! Handel, although German, came to England and wrote music for King 

George, including the Water Music, played on barges on the River Thames, in London. Those three composers were 

the Classical Era.

**1820ish** Romantic Era. This era followed society a bit in allowing greater emotional connection to everyday 

life. Chopin wrote some pretty sad music. He also got middle class people to have a hobby in music - people 

would sit at the piano and play simple pieces, meaning music could be experienced by so many more people than 

before. Beethoven was pretty key here - he threw out the Classical era rules and did exciting things. He made 

larger orchestras, he combined voice and orchestra (see Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the fourth movement). 

Harmony (notes stacked on top of each other) became very complicated, and the era ended with people like Mahler 

and Bruckner writing truly apocalyptic works - Bruckner's 8th Symphony is one, Mahler's 8th Symphony (Symphony 

Of A Thousand) is another. Listen to both if you can!

**1900** Tchaikovsky and the rest of the Russian Five deserve mention. Ballet was integral to these chaps - 

think Swan Lake, the Nutcracker. They defined Russian music very well - Western, but with folk and tradition at 

every layer. They carve a good twenty years.

**1920** Here, things get complicated. Schoenberg rips up everything. He says - why should certain notes have 

priority to other notes? Think like this - in Happy Birthday, the note you end on is the most important. This is 

called the tonic. The next most important note is the dominant, and is the note you start Happy Birthday on. 

These two notes pretty much characterise four hundred years or classical music to this point. But Schoenberg 

creates an almost-Communism of music, giving every pitch equal rights. There are twelve distinct pitches in 

Western music, so he splits them randomly into two sets, called Hexachords, and builds works of music around 

those two sets of pitches. He uses rhythm very freely as well. Not everyone follows this new kind of music, 

called Serialism, and so other movements like Neo-Classicism try to return to simpler times. The audience like 

these simpler times as well!

**1950** Electronics come into play - think of every electronic effect you can have, and that someone like 

Skrillex might use. They are all used, but on real instruments.

**beyond 1950s** Search 'Stockhausen Helicopter' - this composer puts a string quartet, that is, two violins, a 

viola, and a cello, into FOUR *helicopters* and gets them to fly around. Another piece of his features musicians 

on trapezes (like circus trapezes, but more static!) - music becomes much more about the placement of novelties 

(such as the location, or electronic effects) than it does about enjoyment. Music is stretched apart and 

manipulated completely. THis still happens today, but nowadays, we also get a lot more regular stuff. Yes, we 

have composers like John Cage who make money out of four minutes and thirty-three seconds of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, 

but we also have chaps like me who compose more regular music.

Weirdly, if you go to a concert hall, it's likely you will hear music from Classical and Romantic eras. Baroque 

is a more elite group (mainly due to instrument and music cost, but also with issues like authenticity with an 

audience really doesn't *normally* care about), and Modern music (1920s-on) is either bewildering or untested. 

Which is why music is often seen as 'stuffy'. Because the wild stuff is behind closed doors!


I can go into much greater detail, or follow up on points, or answer questions, on any of these sections. But 

probably only one at a time! Oh, and brass instruments and Romans/Greeks. If you want, I'll do a section on 

that. I'd be honoured if you copy-and-pasted this into Word or something and kept it, but you don't need to!

&gt; 
&gt; The decision to limit eligibility in the Championship Series to players 17 and older is not based upon an American standard. The Championship Series is a true pro sports league and its players will be training and competing for most of the year. They won’t just be attending a few weekend tournaments, scattered throughout the calendar. Championship Series pro players will be living with their teams, traveling extensively and making an adult commitment to eSports. They will need to be able to make decisions and sacrifices which require a high degree of maturity.
&gt; 
&gt; Our pros will have full-time jobs and we believe that 17 is the appropriate minimum age for a player to operate at this level.

&gt;ABSTRACT: Hair samples from 76 burials at Semna South (Sudanese Nubia) were examined using a variety of techniques. Electrophoresis and fluo- rescence microscopy indicated some oxidation of the cuticule and keratin pro- tein had taken place. However, the cuticular structure and the lack of fluores- cence of the cortex indicate that the low humidity and non-alkaline conditions preserved the physical and chemical properties of the hair well. Pigmentation, even allowing for oxidation of melanin, showed a higher proportion of lighter samples than is currently associated with the Nubian area. Hair form analysis showed medium diameter and scale count; the curling variables were inter- mediate between European and African samples. There was a high ratio of maximum to minimum curvature (a measure of irregularity), approached only by Melanesian samples. Meroitic and X-group burial types were not statistical- ly significantly different (largely due to sample sizes), but the X-group, espe- cially males, showed more African elements than the Meroitic in the curling variables. Principal components analysis showed the Semna sample to be sig- nificantly different from seven populations examined earlier.

&gt;Quote from text 1:

&gt;Qualitative grading of the samples on the Fischer-Saller scale is shown in table 1. Sam- ples that were graded on the red scale (I-VI) for degree of red pigmentation were also graded on the blond-brown-black scale (A-Y) for degree of black pigmentation. Twenty-six percent (29% of the Meroitic, 13% of the X- group) of the total sample had some red pig- mentation, and 10.5% (8.9 Meroitic, 13% X- group) had ""blond"" pigmentation (Fischer- Saller category G or less).

&gt;Quote from text 2:

&gt;As Brothwell and Spearman (‘63) point out, reddish-brown ancient hair is usually the re- sult of partial oxidation of the melanin pig- ment. This color was seen in a large proportion of the Semna sample, and also noted by Titlbachova and Titlbach (‘77) on Egyptian material, where it also may have resulted from the mummification process. However, the large number of blond hairs that are not associated with the cuticular damage that bleaching produces, probably points to a sig- nificantly lighter-haired population than is now present in the Nubian region. Brothwell and Spearman (’63) noted genuinely blond ancient Egyptian samples using reflectance spectrophotometry

I think what has happened is the transfer policies of clubs like Chelsea and City have changed, they didn't go for big players. City moved for Isco but being Spanish Madrid were more likely to win. Brazilian players seem to have become ridiculous deals because of the agents who are demanding higher fees for themselves. Lucas Moura was meant to be bad, Neymar was also a bad deal, apparently 40 million alone went to his agent and father as he partly owned him also but that is still crazy. 

I think what also has happened is the enormous increase of world class spanish midfielders and the obviously prefer spanish clubs along with south Americans and Portuguese. 

Bale was a rare one. But the countries attracted to the PL has not increased or decreased i believe. Still attractive to Brtian, Scandanavia, America, Asia, eastern and northern europe and some parts of the south. Bale may not like life at Madrid also, Ronaldo apparently doesn't like the way Madrid is run.

England have been doing so well in the CL for so long it was bound to happen that we would have a quiet season but they are always still about.

t5_2qhwp,,"I disagree with you on almost every point. Firaxis has an excellent record of bringing really substantial expansion packs, and this one looks to follow that tradition. Let me try to provide another point of view.

Firstly, based on the [information](http://xcom.wikia.com/wiki/XCOM:_Enemy_Within) we [have](http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=XCOM:_Enemy_Within_\(EU2012\)), it looks be adding substantial new content, in the vein of old school expansion packs, rather than just gimmicks. New enemies will provide a new challenge, forcing you to adapt your tried and true tactics, the new class, equipment and upgrade uptions will throw the balance up in the air, forcing you to start over on figuring out what an optimal squad should look like, and you will have to make some hard decisions since bringing the new class or some of the new equipment will force you to leave behind a class or some equipment that you used to rely on, and most of the gene modifications forces you to pick between two different upgrades, like when picking skills for your soldiers.

1) All enemies *do* in fact spawn on the map, when you first start the mission. The problem you are referring to is the issue of teleporting enemies, which they have already addressed in previous patches, and which should be eliminated completely in this expansion - and even the people who won't be getting the expansion shouldn't be worried, as Firaxis has a great precedent of adding bug fixes, balance and mechanical gameplay changes from an expansion to the un-expanded base game as well.

2) Yes, they could have allowed you to bind 10 or 14 soldiers along for a mission. However, not allowing you to do that was a concious design choice, and the game isn't designed or balanced around that. You can of course disagree with that design choice, but altering that now would either leave a really broken or unbalanced game, or a game that is hardly reminiscent of XCOM:EU. If they end up doing this, I hope that they will save it for a sequel, with mechanics designed for it.

As for having multiple squads - nothing is stopping you from, and on higher difficulties it is all but required that you are using and levelling more than a full squad of 6 soldiers. Indeed, if you're only relying on 6 guys, then the death of Major Tom *will* be a setback that's hard to move forward from. That's why you should be sure to bring along and train replacement soldiers, so that you can cope with such an eventual loss. I typically bring along at least one rookie, and one or two lower-ranked soldiers, just to keep up my roster, and I make sure that I never have any class with only only one high ranked soldier. I usually aim for having around three soldiers of each class, within one rank of each other, and that makes the eventual loss of Major Tom bearable.

3) I agree, though, that air combat is arguably the weakest point of the whole game. As it stands now it's nothing more than a very weak mini-game. I would prefer it if they either removed the mini-game with chance and consumables altogether, or actually expanded it into a fully fledged part of the game. How to do that, however, I couldn't say - though making a turn-based tactical sub-game, rather than making it into a real-time action-affair would probably be fitting for this game.

Lastly, besides adding all of this new content, they also seem to be tightening up a few mechanics, the most notable, in my opinion, being the new ""Aiming Angles"" Second Wave option, which alters the way that cover and flanking works from a binary ""covered or flanked"" system, into a softer system of gradual aim bonuses depending on the degree of flanking.

EDIT: Also, in regards to your complaints of being forced to play conservatively, I think the addition of the Meld will add a new exciting element which will make an incentive to play less conservatively, as you will need to move fast, if you want to collect the Meld, forcing you to prioritize additional resources versus a more conservative, safe play-style.

Some funny songs as well, I'm struggling to remember them all:  ""where's your monkey gone"", ""who's the wankers in the green"" (aimed at the Spud subs), the usual imitation of ""oh when the spurs"" but replaced by ""we won the league at the shithole"" ... And there was a new one about the money they've spent, ~~I can't remember it now.~~ \*edit - just remembered as I'm watching MOTD2, ""1-nil, and we spent fuck all"" ...

I love winning the derby, it's like a carnival atmosphere all over the place ... This one was definitely better than last year's 5-2 (and that one was great!), I think because of our contrasting transfer windows.  Having said that, this was a good time to play them.  They clearly haven't gelled as a team yet,  and have too many players still adapting to he English league.  

I think the fans' exuberant support of the team and celebrations are actually a reaction to a genuine worry that the Spuds are alarmingly increasing in strength.

This is a variation on that fallacy, in that you may draw the wrong conclusion if you only observe and consider the now unemployed store worker, while not considering what parliament32 describes.

That observation is independent of whether this machines reduces the amount of available jobs and my comment wasn't intended to argue anything concerning that question.

--- 

Now concerning that question: I think that low-skilled jobs are indeed lost to automation and that they are not replaced by any similar jobs. Nevertheless, the value that can be added to products increases, meaning our standards of living keep going up. In terms of production and living standards, this is a good thing.

However, for a long time to come more and more low-skilled jobs will be lost. I believe it is important to keep people feeling appreciated and satisfied, for two reasons. One: every human being simply deserves to feel appreciated, useful and wanted, also when they are not employed. Two: we'll soon have a major uprising on our hands if we don't keep them satisfied.

It is necessary to share the increase in standard of living with those that no longer have a job because there simply aren't any more low-skilled jobs. There is no reason to suppose that there ever was a demand for all available low-skilled human labor, nor that there could ever be a demand for all available low-skilled human labor, given our technological progress. Given that fact about our society, what needs to change is that people are mainly appreciated for the contribution they make to society through their labor.

I'm a Western European socialist democrat that doesn't mind paying taxes so we can provide those for which there are no longer jobs with a decent standard of living. I think we've got that part covered. The main problem is that those on benefits are being depicted as lazy and made to feel worthless. Solving that is the biggest challenge in the decades to come.

t5_2qh68,,"&gt;So what you're saying is because spectrum is government owned, we as Canadian citizens deserve to have what you call 'fair pricing'? Please tell me what your definition of fair pricing is and I can almost guarantee you the figures you give would be unreadable in the current market.

Fair pricing allows the company to deliver their service and turn a reasonable profit, satisfy their shareholders and stay competitive, without gouging Canadians.  Your tone suggests that this is a shocking suggestion, but it's not a new idea at all.  The government manages all public interests this way - heat, electricity, water, cable tv, and we managed telecom companies like this in the past.  It just makes sense: these company's make their bread and butter thanks to the use of a public asset; in turn we expect them to give us a reasonable bill.

Maybe international roaming charges really are fair, and if Robellus can demonstrate that to the CRTC then that's that.  But here's a few reasons a lot of us suspect they're unfair:

* domestic carriers within Canada and the US manage to work out roaming deals amongst themselves that cost little or often nothing to the consumer
* similarly, international roaming in Europe is very reasonably priced or often free
* Canadian carriers offer prepaid roaming plans that cost hundreds of percent less than the charges one incurs if roaming without a prepaid plan.  I would love to know what the real factors are that make that huge price differential necessary.  
* prepaid roaming plans often require you to buy chunks of data or talk time that are non-refundable.  Is there a real reason that robellus can't offer us UBB on roaming?
* when travelling in the US I can plug a T-mobile sim into my phone and get a very reasonably priced no-contract month-to-month prepaid plan that blows any robellus roaming plan out of the water.  It seems very questionable to me that Robellus, as a bulk purchaser, can't work out an even better deal with US carriers on my behalf.

&gt;The first step towards lower pricing is adopting a model like Europe where people buy their own phones instead of financing them through carriers. Once people compare the actual cost of their devices instead of seeing iPhones as free devices and see the impact that would have on overall plans they would start to see why everything was so damn expensive in the first place.

This has what to do with roaming fees?

Prior to the 1920's, we didn't have anything like modern immigration controls--pretty much the only rule was ""as long as you're not a murderer or got the syphilis or typhoid fever, you're in""--and even then these new rules mostly existed to keep South and East Asians out until the mid-1970s.

&gt;I think the environment has taken a beating the last few decades due to sprawl and over-consumption in this country and fewer people would help.

Population growth has very little to do with urban sprawl. Look at Detroit--a city whose population is less than 1/3 of its peak--where the economy went to shit because the city's corporate owners outsourced everything and basically sold out their economic base, and all the rich white people fled to suburbs to escape black people and get McMansions with yards. Now ""Grosse Pointe X"" and other Detroit suburbs are all among the richest towns in America while Detroit declares bankruptcy and has plans to demolish 1/4 of the city that it can't even afford to go through with due to said bankruptcy. Urban sprawl is more about white flight and rich people wanting their tax base only to go to benefit other rich people who ""deserve"" it more than what they perceive as inner-city niggers who don't deserve equal education or opportunity.

Are you asking why a rationalist movement founded in the late 19th century was successful? In Europe virtually everyone was abandoning Judaism altogether at that time.

The movement is probably most closely analogous with the Orthodox haskala, which, in Europe, ultimately manifested as the Mizrachi movement.)

The reason is that Nintendo/MONOLITHSOFT originally were not going to release it in the U.S. at all, so Gamestop stepped up and offered to be the sole publisher in the U.S. They did a limited run print of only 400,000 copies, believing the game would not be too popular in western markets. After the 400,000 in the U.S. were sold, no additional copies were printed. The game turned out to be a huge hit, and a pretty ""rare"" item since there were no new ones being printed.

Recently though, Gamestop has done a ""second run"" of prints, but they are selling them unsealed as  ""Used"" copies for $90 (the price for a used copy at Gamestop, since they price their used games based on supply/demand). This means the cheapest you can probably get it is $90 used, but if you hound eBay you might find it for $70-80 if you're lucky.

It seemed instead very much hoping to gain something from the war; just as it had gained from European wars throughout the 19th century. And there was considerable planning in advance; for example, in 1914, Antwerp discovered that a number of houses owned by Germans had been recently given poured concrete foundations.  When the houses were knocked aside by the German army, these turned out to be good placements for artillery. Perhaps they thought about defense, but they certainly planned a good offense.

The other point is that there is a fundamental problem with the Euro. Spain and Greece are not going to become the next Germany. None of the other European countries are but particularly not Spain and Greece. They are always going to be poorer but happier countries. Rather than try and survive in a currency that is stronger than your natural equilibrium it is better to find your natural balance and enjoy being poor and happy.

Cheap accommodation: hostelbookers.com or hostelworld.com. If you're into hotels, tripadvisor.com

Public transportation: you'd seriously have to be a bit slow if you can't figure it out yourself. also, Google Maps gives you directions by public transportation (at least in Western Europe they do). And when you're having a bad/stupid day, and can't figure anything out, there's always info desks/random residents who are more than willing to help you out

getting robbed: Don't be stupid with your money (don't wear Rolexs and stuff, obvious things), stay away from sketch areas (Google ""bad areas of (city name)"")

good food/guides: ask the local tourism information office or your hostel/hotel. They always have good ones.

t5_2vkao,,"&gt; Stalin did have many people executed because he witnessed bourgeois positions being taken by certain members inside the party, and since he knew these people had been ardent communists for a long time, the only conclusion that could be arrived at based on the understanding of marxism that existed at the time is that these people were consciously acting on behalf of outside (bourgeois) forces to subvert the party. 

The only conclusion? Really? How about:

A: My beliefs might be wrong
B: My perception of their beliefs might be wrong
C: They may have come to these conclusions independently
D: They may genuinely believe that for socialism to succeed, my policies need to be replaced

And that's a few seconds of thought of most. It's not a matter of philosophy- the notion that people are sometimes wrong isn't exactly difficult to grasp. 

Plus, I rather doubt Stalin managed to talk with hundreds of thousands of people about their political views.

&gt;No, you're presuming that class struggle had actually ended inside the Soviet Union, let alone outside of it. 

Well, if it was still present internally, who was perpetrating it? How did they get the power to do so? A capitalist without wealth or power isn't any sort of threat. 



&gt;since being a vegetarian means you have the privilege of living in the first world

Tell that to India. 

&gt;The country would be vulnerable to invasion

I didn't say the state should be dismantled. States are fine. Non-democratic states are not. 

&gt;Also, describing the Soviet Union as an autocracy is also hardly accurate. 

""An autocracy is a system of government in which a supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of coup d'état or mass insurrection).""

What about that doesn't describe at least the Soviet Union under Stalin? Being able to execute powerful people at will is pretty much the definition of no restraints. 

&gt;, or, as actually happened in reality, capitalist restoration.

As I recall, it was the state that did that. 

&gt;In our class society, we must always judge our ideas by whose interests they serve

Why? My views certainly don't serve my interests.

&gt; because our ideas will inevitably be tainted by the fact that the ruling ideas of an epoch are the ideas of the ruling class. 

All that tells me is that any sort of appeal to authority is meaningless. 

&gt;Completely separating the material basis of an idea from the idea itself is Idealist mistake number 1.

But the conditions that an idea originates in have no bearing on the content of the idea. Sure, certain ideas are far less likely to arise in certain circumstances. For example, the scientific method was simply not going to develop in 10th century Europe. That doesn't mean that if, through sheer chance, it did, it would be any less valid.

Riot does LCS for NA and EU where there ARE restrictions/rules based on age.

Garena/Chinese LPL/ and OGN are NOT run by Riot and they take place in regions where there AREN'T the same age restrictions and rules.

I assume one of the reasons why Riot can't implement such a rule (in regards to Worlds) is because such a restriction would essentially be a soft age restriction rule in regions where there are no rules.

Let's take a hypothetical situation with Faker. He started playing Professional League in OGN while he was only 16 (he turned 17 in May). What if his B-Day was in December or something? He wouldn't be able to play at Worlds this year.

Such a rule by Riot would essentially be saying to SK Telecom ""Well, you can pick up and play with this kid in Korea, but if you guys make it to Worlds and even if he's the BEST Mid Laner in the World, we aren't allowing you to use him."" 

As such, this situation could actually have forced SKT to NOT pick up Faker when they did--thus essentially creating a ''soft'' Age-restriction in a region where there wasn't one.

NOTE: I'm not saying whether or not such a situation is right. But that is probably one of the reasons this situation is happening.

t5_2rfxx,,"I disagree.  I'd say that the players themselves would be the ones needing to grow up.  There's a reason they've been 'singled out'.  Their attitudes aren't good examples for the community.

(Listing by order)
Regi gets flack from the community because he often appears to be instigating fights.  While this may not always be the case, he just appears to lack some empathy towards his teammates.  While he is TSM's owner, he also has to realize that at the end of the day, he's also a player and their shotcaller.  If he wants the team to listen, it's probably better that the rest of the team isn't uncomfortable with him.

Saintvicious gets flack from the community because of his attitude as well.  While I don't really have any specific examples (Mostly because I don't really pay attention to him much), his attitude is just really off-putting.

Doublelift being included confuses me a little.  For Doublelift exclusively I'd say his attitude is a large portion he has a fanbase.  However, that's simply because he does have the ability to back up his trashtalk.  Additionally, when he loses, he's at least humble and admits that the better team won.

I know nothing about Yellowpete, sorry.  I don't follow the European scene. :(

Zuna seems to be the next 'target' for the community because of his attitude.  He always seems to exude an elitist attitude, yet unlike Doublelift, doesn't seem to have the ability to back anything up.
