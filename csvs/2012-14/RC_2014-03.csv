The war in Georgia wasn't a PR disaster for Putin, it was a massive fucking boost. It showed the world that Russia would stand up and fight. The EU and the US could do NOTHING to help their ally.

The rest of the world can see what is happening. They're seeing the West supportng people who are murdering Christians and any Muslim who doesn't agree with them. They're seeing terrorists blowing up cars and beheading people. The Syrian war is a fucking disaster and this is why the US has been pushing for Geneva. They want to get out of it.

"I'm attacking your lack of citation or proof for anything you have said to me. I have backed up everything I said with quotes and links. You keep saying ""Americans will believe anything"", yet offer no proof to the contrary. You still haven't provided me with anything that the Soviets did in the Pacific theater, which was the whole point of this argument in the first place. 

As a side note, not one of the 10 or so websites I just look at disputes the leaflets, including two that are vehemently anti-US bomb dropping. I have never heard of anyone who disputes the leaflet dropping. Say, for sake of argument, that we didn't drop them. We still gave the Potsdam Declaration, telling Japan what we were going to do. So I'm not sure it really matters all that much anyway.

I'm not saying the US were the ""good guys"". I'm saying it was a war, and we made choices that had to be made to win that war. Japan did a sneak attack to drag us into the war, picked a fight with the wrong country, and lost. We would have killed millions more through a land invasion than we did with the bombs. That, in itself, is enough to justify the bomb. Yes, it killed civilians, but millions more civilians would have died as a result of invasion. I want you to honestly tell me that a million more deaths would have been preferable to losing thousands from the bombs. Answer that question. 


And another serious question, what exactly do you mean by ""half american""? half citizenship? Because ""American"" really isn't an ethnicity, so i'm not sure how you can be ""half"".

"Leif Ericsson is the most commonly named Norse explorer in regard to North America, however he has never been confirmed as the one who did visit the Americas. 

On the topic on what we do know about norse visits to the Americas we have established that Norsemen formed a settlement at L’anse aux Meadows in Northern Newfoundland. Ten or more building built in Norse style were built at the site and were first excavated in the 1960's. The site included housing for ships on dry land and a smithy that contained a working stone as well as traces of metals with vast quantities of slag iron material from working bogs. Both of these habits are not common to the work of local First Nations members and others who have inhabited the region. Radiocarbon dating has dated the site to about 1000 CE the same time as Leif Ericsson was believed to have sailed. The buildings themselves were built of timber and sod and were found with traces of iron nails further evidence that they were european in origin. For more information see the work of Ingstad and Wallace as they both were involved with the excavations of the site.

Both Wallace and Ingstad had competing explanations on what this site was:

* Ingstad felt that this site was the Vineland of Leif Ericsson as referenced in the Norse Sagas that spoke of a land filled with grapes, pastures and forests. 

* Wallace argued that the site was more of a temporary camp for exploration of the Eastern North America, citing the existence of butternut wood and nuts as evidence that L’anse aux Meadows's residents traveled south into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where they located the grapes and butternut which do not grow in Newfoundland. 

Additional locations have not been confirmed but investigation of a coin found in Maine and an expedition may have located a second site in [Baffin island](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121019-viking-outpost-second-new-canada-science-sutherland/). 

Many hoaxes or non-norse sites have been identified and claimed to be norse across the Northeastern Unitied states and Canada over the years including:

* The Kensington stone(hoax) - a fake rune stone with a journey of norsemen to Minnesota,

* Newport Tower (Colonial) - a stone tower in Rhode Island,

* Axe and sword in Port Arthur, Ontario (hoax) - the finders father claimed they were within his basement before they were ""discovered"",

* And many other rune stones and inscriptions.

"Hm, I should point out that I live in the US, and I probably shouldn't have compared it to those countries that I listed. It is no where as bad, so my fault on that. However, I wouldn't say the average person in the US is anywhere as close to the average person in Norway, Sweden, Belgium, etc. What happens when a person messes up their shoulder in the US and they have no insurance? They'll go bankrupt. I don't see that happening in these smaller countries with actual healthcare. 

Now, the US, I think is a special case, however. Each state has certain rights, and although they can't override federal law, sometimes they can bypass it. So, they do have some sovereignty to an extent, and each of their state government can try to govern to their best extent. Could this work if the USE did the same thing, with each current country becoming a state? I don't know, but the federal government of the USE would become more corrupt, and will slowly ruin those states.

"The Decline of Arianism falls into three parts, which I will call ‘Arianism Proper’, ‘Pseudo-Arianism’ and ‘Extra-Imperial Arianism’.

By ‘Arianism Proper’ I mean the set of beliefs associated with Arius and his followers. Arius very clearly considered Jesus to be a created being, a mediatorial figure between God and Creation, and like us in every way. It has been typical to consider Arius’ theological rationale the desire to preserve the uniqueness and soleness of God the Father, but Gregg and Groh make a good case that the main thrust of Arian doctrine was actually focused on salvation. The theology of Arius relating to Jesus was necessary so that we could become like him. Arius was condemned at the Council of Nicaea, in 325. This was the first ‘ecumenical’ council though most of the ecumenical councils were composed of a majority of Eastern bishops. This was the main purpose of the council. After the council Arius was exiled, and continued for some time to have a minor following. Constantine wanted to rehabilitate Arius, and in 335 the Synod of Jerusalem restored Arius to communion. However, Nicaea effectively ended Arianism proper as a theological option.

I call this Arianism proper, because what follows in the 4th century is no longer called ‘Arianism’ in the historical circles I read and write in. What you get is a large number of bishops and churches aren’t very happy with the Creed of Nicaea, and aren’t happy to call Jesus “of the same substance” with the Father. So I would rather call this phase ‘Pseudo-Arianism’. A lot of our history of this period has been influenced by Athanasius, who started a polemical practice of calling his opponents ‘Arians’ in order to taint them by association. Constantine dies in 337 and Constntius II becomes emperor in the East, and from 350 over the whole Empire. He is favourable to the anti-Nicene bishops, which at this time is most of the church of the Eastern Empire. Their views are not as extreme as Arius, though there are some theological similarities. You first get the emergence of a group who would rather say that the Son is “like the Father in substance” (Homoiousian), before you get a group from 357/359 saying that the Son is “like the Father” (Homoian), and refusing to talk about “substance” or “being” at all. And from the early 360s you have a radical group saying that the Son is “of a different substance” to the Father (Anomoian or Heteroousian). 
Both theological debate and changes in Emperors leads up to 380 and 381. On the one hand Theodosius I, (Emperor 379-395) is firmly in favour of the (now) Orthodox position, backing “of the same substance”. On the other, particularly the efforts of Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus, have managed to sway a majority to accept Nicaea and formulate Trinitarian theology along those lines. So the 2nd ecumenical council of Constantinople in 381 ends, *within the empire* all forms of so-called Arianism. They are no longer allowed to use church buildings, and not allowed to meet within the city. Their power is broken.

But there is a third strand. Ulfilas was a Goth, or possibly half-Goth, who was ordained by Eusebius of Nicomedia, a leading figure among the non-Nicenes. And Ulfilas went as a missionary back to the Goths. He devised the alphabet for the Gothic language, and translated the Bible into Gothic. His mission was successful, and so many Goths were converted to an ‘Arian’ version of Christianity. Conversion efforts among other Germanic tribes also followed along these Homoiousian lines.
In the case of the Goths, this kind of Arianism persists until the Third Council of Toledo in 589 where the Spanish Goths (i.e Visigoths) embraced the orthodox position. Those Goths left in Italy, the Ostrogoths, were displaced in the mid 6th century, settling in modern Austria. At this time it is really the Franks that emerge as the major power in central western Europe, and they are already in the Catholic fold.

"There is a strange sort of moral agenda in our popular culture in both Western Europe and America that dictates that the center of evil is the white, heterosexual, able-bodied cis male. The further you are distanced from that, the more virtuous you are by default. So for instance, a white, heterosexual, able-bodied cis woman is just barely less evil. The paragon of virtue is the unicorn-like black, lesbian, handicapped transgender female - otherwise known as ""he/she that can do no wrong"".

This manifests itself in the identity crisis people in the west have. They grow up learning to hate themselves if they fit the mold of the ""oppressor"", so they try and change to absolve themselves of guilt by association. Being gay is one way to do it, being in an interracial relationship is another. If you have mixed race children you can even downgrade your oppression rating by about 40% - enough to possibly be spared race-related violence aimed at whites (maybe).

"Great junglers benefit the most out of all the positions from preperation though. Bengi, for example, DESTROYS entire teams with his counter ganks, but if you're playing 2 teams in a weekend and none of the games really matter, why would you look at their preferred gank paths to draw up early game strats?

Remember when Diamond faced Meteos at IEM? They destroyed him. Made C9 look like a challenger team. Diamond has faced more 'next big thing' junglers than anyone else, and more often than not, when there's something on the line, after the game everyone is back to hyping up Diamond.

Rule? I would hope the model would be Athenian Democracy

"I'm done debating this with you. It sounds pretty clear that you've never been in the military or involved in any avionics or aerotech industry. If you had, you would understand that there is plenty of evidence freely available that shows that the FA/22 is the top dog. If you want it, it's out there. Go google it. 

It's been covered before, the EU/Israel made attempts to buy it after it's revelation and after the official close of it's long term development program. It is hands down the most capable air superiority fighter in existence. 

The fact that current policy dictates that engaging without visual confirmation is not allowed, it doesn't mean it's impossible. The fighter is still able to do it, still capable of outrunning it's enemies and outgunning them. 

Policy doesn't change Capability. And that's where your confused. Take a look at all the public information available. Almost nothing is classified about the typhoon, not it's top speed, it's radar, it's engine design, turbo fan induction, nothing. Almost everything about the Raptor is still classified, for a reason. It's radar is considered the most advanced in nose radar for any aircraft of it's size. 

This would make for a great debate if it wasn't already a globally accepted fact that the FA/22 is the current top dog. Regardless of the fact that it's a failed program due to budget over runs and political bickering. Nothing changes the voracity of the air craft and it's capability to stealthily and efficiently kill other fighters. It's a $500M aircraft for a reason. It's built of better materials, better technology, better everything. 

Look over the Red Flag Alaska Reports showing that although F/A-22's were ""downed"" in visual range combat, they were unbelievably overwhelming at Beyond Visual Range. (This is a more realistic combat situation). There were absolutely zero kills on the Eurofighters part, and with the radar cross section of a Cessna it's not surprising. 

Again, that's the last I have to say on the topic. Debating an already accepted fact is pointless. It's more or less just a hot button issue for people without any real military insight to debate about.

"**Ruling** ethnic minorities usually go through sinicization in order to ensure that their regime will be sustainable since the bureaucracy will always have a Han majority. Large numbers of Manchus followed the imperial court to cross the Great Wall into China. They were assimilated within a century and by the end of the dynasty, they were indistinguishable from Han except they were still registered as [Manchu bannermen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Banners). Preserving a language without using it in daily lives is doomed to fail. It's similar to the situation faced by modern day immigrants — the mother tongue is lost as soon as in the second generation.

Qing governed their empire using a mix of various systems. There was a significant difference between the [Eighteen Provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper#Historical_perspective) and other non-Han areas (Manchuria, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Mongolia). Government in the Eighteen Provinces inherited the same system used in the Ming dynasty. Manchuria was governed using the Eight Banners system, however remote areas such as north of Amur and Sakhalin Island still have hunter-gatherer tribes. [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Mongolia_during_Qing) was divided into Inner and Outer Mongolia with Outer Mongolia enjoying much greater autonomy. Xinjiang was governed by [Ambans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amban) and [Begs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baig#Etymology_and_history). Tibet had a mixed governance of Amban and the native [Kashag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashag). The non-uniform governing system created a lot of problems when Europeans arrived after the Industrial Revolution and brought the modern concept of a nation. Almost all of these areas except Manchuria had independence movements after Qing collapsed. Tibet and Outer Mongolia gained independence for a while before the new Republic of China attempted re-conquest. The reason why there are still independence movements in Xinjiang and Tibet was that they were never ruled as directly as the Eighteen Provinces by the central government in Beijing during Qing. They could not fit into a new, modern Republic without losing some of their old rights. Independence, on the other hand, means that they had to cut off ties with China and that would only hurt themselves more. The ethnic situation in Xinjiang is more complex than Tibet so I'm not gonna talk about that.

For Manchuria, the northernmost parts were sparsely populated with primitive tribes and thus had no chance fighting off the Russian invaders. Later on the old system in Manchuria and Xinjiang was abolished after facing invasion threats from Russia and new provinces were established while the mass-immigration of Hans were allowed in order to populated the area. History has proved that it was always easier to expel ""primitive"" tribes with loose social structures compared to tightly-knit communities with strong identities and complex governmental systems. Some Manchus might have resented becoming a minority in Manchuria after a few centuries of sinicization, they were pretty much the same people as Hans in every possible way.",1432605794,1393633740,t1_cfrdd0r,False,False,1,t3_1z3vpn,,,ssnistfajen,,1,t5_2si92,0,t1_cfr8sec,0,cfrdd0r,True,,MapPorn,0

"&gt;not even genuinely anti-Semitic

I hope that is a joke.

&gt;One of the “Big Three” political parties behind the protests is the ultra-nationalist Svoboda, whose leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, has called for the liberation of his country from the “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.” After the 2010 conviction of the Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk for his supporting role in the death of nearly 30,000 people at the Sobibor camp, Tyahnybok rushed to Germany to declare him a hero who was “fighting for truth.” In the Ukrainian parliament, where Svoboda holds an unprecedented 37 seats, Tyahnybok’s deputy Yuriy Mykhalchyshyn is fond of quoting Joseph Goebbels – he has even founded a think tank originally called “the Joseph Goebbels Political Research Center.” According to Per Anders Rudling, a leading academic expert on European neo-fascism, the self-described “socialist nationalist” Mykhalchyshyn is the main link between Svoboda’s official wing and neo-Nazi militias like Right Sector.

Not antisemite? 

&gt;Lviv has become the epicenter of neo-fascist activity in Ukraine, with elected Svoboda officials waging a campaign to rename its airport after Bandera and successfully changing the name of Peace Street to the name of the Nachtigall Battalion, an OUN-B wing that participated directly in the Holocaust.

To be exact the Nachtigall Battalion has butchered 8000 Jews in Lvov. More wise sayings of Tyahnybok:

&gt;""They were not afraid and we should not be afraid. They took their automatic guns on their necks and went into the woods, and fought against the Moskali, Germans, Kikes and other scum who wanted to take away our Ukrainian state.""

&gt;""When I went to army, my mom told me: if you bring home moskal wife or kike wife, or  if you become KGB agent -  I will disown you.""

[](/zecora) The African-American position was much more nuanced and complicated that I'm willing to get into in one of my posts, as the demand for rights goes much deeper into a discussion of cultural and national identity. Washington was calling for immediate integration, but Du Bois had a much more gradual view. He saw Washington's course of action as ultimately dangerous. As a whole, the negro was far less educated or literate as the white man. It was incumbent upon the higher achieving black folk to lead the way in, so blacks as a whole would not be relegated as a group to a low class when fully integrated. Du Bois' idea of the *double-consciousness* informed a lot of this approach. The idea of being ""African-American"" was an exceedingly complicated one, especially in the early 20th. They are, as a group, fully black and fully American. But the identity of ""American"" excludes blacks (as was demonstrated in many ways, such as not being allowed to play Major League Baseball - even though other European immigrant groups had their own Major League heroes)... so there was the dual identity of being both negro and American.

---

&gt;

&gt;Colt engraved less than one percent of its first generation production of the Single Action Army revolver, which makes these engraved models extremely rare and valuable with collectors.  Engraved pieces were often ordered by or for famous people of the day, including lawmen, heads of state, and captains of industry.  This tradition began with the founder, [Samuel Colt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Colt), who regularly gave such examples away as a means of publicity for Colt.

&gt;Colt employed a number of highly skilled engravers, many of whom were highly trained artisans who emigrated from Europe.  These artisans were known for inlaying gold, silver, and precious stones in their work. Many of these engraved pieces were adorned with stocks made of ivory or pearl with engraving and inlays as well.

&gt;About 400 of the Second Generation Colt Single Actions were factory engraved by Colt. The factory engravers of the period were Alvin Herbert, Earl Bieu, Dennis Kies, Robert Burt and Leonard Francolini. One of the most sought-after engravers who have worked on Colt revolvers was Alvin White and the shop of A. A. White Engravers.

"I really like Hammer of the Ancients in 2.0. Combine it with the Ground Stomp rune that pulls enemies in. Stack STR/Crit/CritDmg is what I've been doing. Passive that give Fury are great combined with the passive that heals on fury spent. This is my current build:

It's all about pulling enemies in and smashing the hammer. I go for high crits, and the fury dump heals you. Bloodthirst could be swapped out at high gear levels if you have better healing but it's **great** for starting out. Just keep spamming revenge for the crit bonus and pull lots of enemies! I find that this build works best with 2H or dual 1H, but a shield tends to reduce revenge procs.

One more note: Battle Rage could be swapped for some kind of long cooldown from ""Rage"", but I just prefer  buff, as personal preference.

Also, you can use boulder throw with this build, with small adjustments, and crit for millions, it takes a while to get ready since it dumps all fury every time. I don't prefer it, but it's fun!

Foreigners leave the incident, NATO included, Russia attempts to reason and handle the situation peacefully, and when that doesn't work, which it won't, it'll physically get involved and remind the ultra-nationalists and fascists that without Russia Ukraine would be nothing, which sounds like I'm saying something one sided but I'm not, really. I'd love to see the whole of eastern Ukraine annexed by Russia and have the radical Ukrainian minority be thoroughly beaten by sensible Ukrainians that understood what they did.

- A series of European Union (EU) discussion papers and meetings have made it clear that the European powers are pushing for a more assertive militarist policy.

- It notes that the European powers have worked through the United Nations, serving as the funder and regional subcontractor for United Nations missions.

- Once again, however, the European powers were unable to come to any substantive agreement.

- It added, “Basing European foreign and security policy in Asia on an alignment with US policy is misguided.

- With this “traditional multilateralism” no longer providing a reliable mechanism for advancing their commercial and political interests, the European powers have turned to other organizations, using various funding mechanisms.

Very few NATO members are meeting their obligations, and very few have for years. 

The Pentagon has recently recommended significant cuts to the defense budget, so I would not be surprised to see the US become more selective with where it spends its money. Considering almost none of the NATO members are committed enough to it to meet their obligations, it seems the US may be starting to feel the same way.

The [social-nationalist party called the *All-Ukrainian Union ""Svoboda"" (Freedom)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_(political_party%29) (had 8% of the seats pre-overthrow) also seem to want into Europe.

&gt; In the autumn of 2009, Svoboda joined the [Alliance of European National Movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_European_National_Movements) as the only organisation from outside the European Union.[2] That year the party claimed to have 15,000 members.

Remember as a side note that the far-right social-nationalists party Golden Dawn are part of the official opposition in Greece and still gaining in traction.

On Svoboda's wikipedia page note their use of the [Wolfsangel rune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfsangel), their logo from 1991 to 2003. Also take not the of three fingers logo, you will see it on a lot of flags.

Its current leader is [Oleh Tyahnybok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleh_Tyahnybok). Remember his face, we'll come back to him...

In some of the pictures you might have seen red and black flags and thought of anarchists. It would make sense since Ukraine was at a time one of the [largest anarchist ""experience""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Insurrectionary_Army_of_Ukraine) in the world. But you'd be wrong, note that the flags aren't on a 45 degree split like the anarcho-communist flag. Instead if you pay attention you will see that the red and black flags are divided horizontally. It is the symbol of the [Ukrainian Insurgent Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army), and while they fought the Nazi's and the Soviets, they are also on the far-right social-nationalist side (and have killed loads of people during WWII).

"Yea totally. World War III sounds like so much fun right now. 

Seriously, this is a country disintegrating on Russia's southwestern border, that used to be a client state of Russia. The entire eastern half of said country wants Russia to intervene and restore the ousted president. The western half of the country would prefer to enter the EU, but the ultimatum/""offer"" the EU proposed to  Ukraine's leadership, to be quite frank, was not good for Ukraine. So when Putin put up a better offer to remain in Russian economic orbit, the western half of the country, an apparent minority, lost their shit and began protesting. Those protests turned into riots, and after Ukrainian police found themselves **set on fire**, they began engaging protesters as they retreated. 

It's hugely complex, and not at all an easy task to sort ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" out.

"&gt;If Israel wants to govern the occupied territories

It doesn't and it's not.


&gt;You are just splitting hairs. Dont you know the White South Africans did the same things? The Whites split the country up into White areas and black areas called Bantustans, that way there was no apartheid. The Blacks had their own country and whites had their own country. No one fell for their excuse that ""seperate is equal.""


How are you grouping the two in the same category? If you're saying the apartheid is directed at palestinians how could you differentiate between those being oppressed and those who aren't? It's not as black and white as you seem to think it is.

&gt;In what way does Israeli land belong to Israel? Just because Palestinians dont have an Olympic team doesnt mean they dont own the land they live on. You are using the same tired excuses the European countries used when the colonized the rest of the world. ""We claim India for the British, screw the Indians who live there, they dont actually own the land they live on.""

Not really. It's that we live in a land with rules, and for any land to become legitimate it has to qualify certain criteria. I'm not talking about private property of land, I'm talking about grouping together and becoming an independent nation. Until then it would be irresponsible to break the occupation. The occupation isn't in place to govern the palestinians or try and introduce them into Israel in any way, it is to make sure it doesn't go to shits. 


&gt;When did I ever say that Palestinians have a right to go to Israel? If Israel wants to build a wall and keep out the Palestinians then they can do that on Israeli land. They dont have a right to impose checkpoints and exercise military justice on the Palestinians in Palestine. Have a reading comprehension problem, bro?

That would be true if the land on which the checkpoints are done were even privately owned by palestinians, but they are not, they are the disputed lands I explained to you.


&gt;Israel is occupying Palestine. They are not occupying Brazil or Switzerland. Brazilians and Swiss dont have to live under military occupation because they dont live in Palestine. The policies are therefore directed at Palestinians.

You're escaping my point, if they moved there they would be upheld to the same behaviors. The occupation isn't motivated by a will to annex it, therefore it can't be expected to apply Israeli law in the region. Therefore it isn't an apartheid state.

|**about artist**|Quintette du Hot Club de France was one of the early, and most significant, jazz groups in Europe. Its most famous members might be Stéphane Grappelli, Django Reinhardt, and Louis Vola, but the two rhythm guitarists were essential for the specific group sound. They also used their guitars for percussive sounds, as they had no true percussion section. The concept of &amp;quot;lead guitar&amp;quot; (Django) and backing &amp;quot;rhythm guitar&amp;quot; (Joseph Reinhardt/Roger Chaput or Pierre Ferret), applied by most bands, including virtually all rock and pop bands, was originally developed in the Quintette.

"The situation as it plays out is that Russia is still deciding what it wants to do.  It has effectively controlled Ukraine since it seceded, and its now wondering whether it should still gun to control the whole thing again, or to carve out a rump state in the South that lets it control strategic interests, particularly the Crimean peninsula.  

Russia isn't going to leave without one of these two things.  If NATO or the EU acts to push it, it would have the effect of backing Russia, a major world power, into a corner.  There is patriotism, regional politics, and all sorts of things that are being vested in Ukraine's crisis right now, and Russia *will* act.

To the question at hand, the issue of how these organizations respond is what they aim to accomplish.  Is the desire for a whole and independent Ukraine worth Russia potentially choking Western Europe's oil and gas supply for an indeterminate period of time (knowing that there is no way in hell that MENA or the US could fill in that kind of gap)?  Is the desire for a whole and independent Ukraine worth an armed confrontation with indeterminate possible casualties?  Knowing that the US has historically subscribed to domino theories, does the US believe that not taking a hard line on Ukraine, which has historically been seen as Russia's backyard, will affect the rest of its foreign policy elsewhere?  

If the EU/US or NATO affirms any of these, it would seem like a confrontation is inevitable.

"&gt;Again, I'm not sure if you're joking or trying to be insulting. This reads like the cliché stereotype of Americans on reddit. Seriously, this is such bullshit. Fuck off. Nothing is right about that.

Of course its not right, but that is what reddit americans believe usually.

&gt;Given this factor: does it significantly impact prices, or does reason X mean that it's not a big deal or ?. I took no stance from that.

But you did, you assumed that any tiny bit of regulations might cause prices to rise. Thats a stereotypical american thing to ask in the first place. There is absolutely no reason for it to affect prices and even if nobody would care because its just a fine levied on companies that don't hold up their part of a contract. Getting someone from A to B at time X, they agreed to that contractually. They shouldn't be expecting to not pay damages if they won't actually do that.

And you forgot about how often this actually happens, its not that often really. And if it does, so what? 200*250 is only €50k. Even 400*600 is only 240,000, thats certainly hurting, but its not much money in the grand scheme of things. Lufthansa alone has revenue of over 25 billion euros each year. 

Its actually somewhat socialising, Lufthansa is less affected by the fines because they pay more attention to the state of their planes, but this costs more in maintenance. Companies that more often have to ground their planes on short notice saved on that maintenance, but not have to pay more in fines.

&gt;What? Most flights are during the day. The airport doesn't necessarily close, but it's not like 4am is a busy time.

I mean its not a big deal if flights that are supposed to arrive at 2245 are delayed.

"There is a definite difference between ""In our best interest"" and ""Defending against an imminent threat"". Iran having nukes and Iran pointing a nuke at us are two different things.

Other countries with nukes include North Korea, China, and Russia. Some Russian nukes are rumored to be in the hands of private people/organizations with no loyalties. And yet here they are, *not* attacking us with them.

Also consider that if Iran were to nuke someone, it would probably be Israel.  Israel has 300 nukes of their own. If Iran attacked either country in a nuclear strike, Iran would not exist tomorrow.

Also consider we do have a nuclear defense shield. Any missile that comes in gets intercepted. Any nuclear materials that cross our borders is detected. 

Also consider all the countries who *we* have a history of attacking without provocation. Russia, Vietnam, Korea, much of Europe, pretty much everyone in the Middle East, the list goes on. Should they be allowed to tell *us* what weapons we're allowed to have?

Consider all the things we've done to these people. Hell, we overthrew Iran's democratically elected leader in 1953.  Perhaps our problem is not some lack of defense, but rather our absolute and total control over the entire planet.  They hate us for *that* reason alone.

"Originally the idea was with companies like CDN's. Your Cogent your level 3, the backbones. The problem is they get kickbacks for driving traffic. They have the best incentive to have a network that works in terms of pinging things. They have no incentive to make the network any faster than that bare minimum.

I think it should be a line held by a company that's a public/private partnership. Something where statistics are mainly upheld as benchmarks for how much profit they're allowed to make. The profit can come from a similar, ""every ISP has to buy X type of equipment at Y price to make their services work"" but it's the same playing field for each ISP regardless of their size. Either with those profits improve the network, based on how long it takes to reach certain amounts of cash, or since we have a very long and strong history of giving private companies boat loads of cash to build networks everyone's allowed to have access too (which happened semi-recently and the money was taken without any new infrastructure) why not just put that money into a company that we'd have part control over.

To follow the example through you could even have companies compete to offer ISP's the best CDN service possible even if they're all coming from the same equipment. That might over complicate things but, it would be technically possible from a competition at all costs kind of approach. Frankly as long as we no longer have this ""one single company that isn't publicly accountable in any way owns all the last mile connections"" I'd be happier off.

"I observe that potentially not too many are getting the reality. Russia has a major military base in this country. They are protecting their military interests. This should not be a surprise. If I where Ukraine I would do whatever I could to help find common ground with those in Russia. Not out of fear but out of common ground. They have been interwoven with one another far before the bolshevik revolution. The reality for Ukrainians is that they literally reside as the doorway between Russia and the E.U. The response of Russia is understandable &amp; albeit a bit insecure by going military first, a reality that must be faced. Ukraine must accept their role and deep connection with Russia because it is not going away. What's interesting is that Ukraine has a role as a nation between the E. U. and Russia. A kind of third way between the cold war NATO mentality &amp; a new less adversarial mentality. I do not envy their dilemma and position in this geographical &amp; geopolitical position they find themselves in but whether Ukraine likes it or not they really have a rather significant &amp; potentially healing role for Europe &amp; Russia. 

Ukraine as a nation must thread a path that is modern European &amp; modern Russia. As screwed up as Russia may seem for many outsiders it is still an ancient &amp; powerful nation. I would like to imagine a Ukraine that does something unexpected, thread a respectful &amp; peaceful connection between the juggernaut that is Russia with the interconnected nation states that are the E.U.. I do not envy the incredibly complicated situation Ukraine is in but that is the reality they are geographically born into. I hope they find a balance between accountable Democracy &amp; geopolitical realpolitik in the profoundly fragile situation they reside in. It will be a mark of a true Ukraine culture to thread this with the dignity presented with their first stage 3 month revolt against the overt corruption Ukraine successfully thwarted. I mean wow. What a story to watch unfold. I find their story far more complicated as an outsider than many do in the media readings I've read. And very beautiful in the sense of fellow western civilization folks. I honestly do not know much about the intricacies of Ukrainian cultural dynamic but as an outsider I can see they have to &amp; MUST thread a very conscious chess game of best outcome in order to retain any ability to be a unique city state called Ukraine between two major super power mentalities.

Wow I do not envy them but I am impressed by what they have done with minimal violence. This is something commendable.

"Accurate for Himmler but largely overblown and not widespread when it did exist. I'll outline three popular points on the connections between Nazism and the occult, and finish with some source links. Almost everything here can be found in the wiki article [Religious views of Adolf Hitler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler) but also in associated wikipedia articles. The key principle of any Nazi party actions is how everything they did was to support a strong ethnic state, and every institution was bent to serve that purpose.

The first thing I want to point out is why the Nazis would have given the time of day to anyone espousing occult beliefs. Nazi ideology was that ethnic Germans were the descendants of an Indian race called the Aryans, who in the past had left north out of India and conquered large swaths of territory (possibly all of Europe though I could find this claim made in explicit detail) with the strongest Aryans settling in Germany. Thus, while Germany was majority Christian, at least nominally, this was considered by Nazi leaders a deficit of the race. For example, Hitler called Christianity a ""religion for slaves"". Thus for some Nazis neo-pagan and occultic beliefs were seen as ways to go back to the pre-christian glory of the germanic people. Although as a matter of pragmatism Hitler also considered this occultism ""nonsense"". But for both religions Nazi ideologists created their own versions of it that bent their entire meaning towards the supremacy of the german people and their state. The neo-pagan movement that came out of this is called Wotanism, which still exists today among neo-nazis, though it is my understanding there are some neo-pagans that worship Wotan that are not related to neo-nazi groups either. You can even find discussions about this on reddit if you're interested, but that is quite a digression from the question for now. I'll talk about the new Christianity invented for this, Positive Christianity, and both of these are discussed a bit more in the third claim below. 


A second point is that is often suggested that the Nazi use of the Swastika came from tracts published by the Theosophic Society, an international occult organization that was popular from the late 1800's until the 1950's (it technically exists today, but is virtually defunct). Not that the Theosophic society endorsed Nazism but Theosophy was the most popular form of esotericism in Germany and Austria in the first half of the 20th century and any cosmopolitan (i.e. the higher up) officials in the nazi party would have been familiar with it. This may have been the introduction of the popularity of the Swastika for the Nazis although it's origins in Indian culture were well known to them, indeed the reason they adopted its use, in order to associate themselves with the Aryan race as discussed in the previous paragraph.

A third point is that occultism (worship of ancient germanic or norse gods) were influential to Nazism. This is not particularly true, Hitler called occultism ""nonsense"", but some of Hitler's inner circle, in particular Himmler but also Rudolf Hess and Alfred Rosenberg held these beliefs. On the other hand, Hitler saw Christianity as ""indelibly Jewish in origin and character"" and a ""prototype of Bolshevism"", which ""violated the law of natural selection"". As stated earlier Hitler personally and Nazi ideology in general was amoral and aimed to shape any institution including religion as much around Nazi ideology as possible. Hitler suppressed both Catholic and Protestant churches and replaced them with a state church (called the German Church) that taught a Nazi designed religion called ""Positive Christianity"". ""Positive Christianity"" posited that Jesus was an Aryan fighting the Jews, that the Bible had been edited by Paul (the Apostle) to hide this fact, and that Jesus' original message was one of combat and loyalty to one's race. Hitler made The German Church the only legally sanctioned church in 1937  as he considered  christianity proper to be a weakness, and a blight to the german state. He put neo-Pagan [Alfred Rosenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Rosenberg) in as official Nazi ideologist. Just to be clear he has no intention of replacing Christianity with occultism though, his state church was largely considered a temporary transitional measure until religion could be extinguished altogether.

That's about it for the extent of occultism in the Nazi regime proper. Neo-Nazis also largely follow either atheism, Positive Christianity-style churches or Neo-Pagan occultism.


Edit: If you're interested in learning a bit on Neo-Nazis in America, Louis Theroux did a documentary on survivalists, and the last part of it is on Neo-Nazi survivalists, and they visit a Positive Christianity based ""church"". [link](http://watchdocumentary.org/watch/louis-therouxs-weird-weekends-survivalists-video_d64b9abd5.html) (note, it's a little creepy)

"I'm also going to pass on the Maya, since the Post-Contact Maya is probably one of my weaker areas. I am not, however, aware of any notable occurrences.

As for the Aztecs though, I can saw that European weaponry was certainly adapted, or at the least captured and used. The roughly 8 month period between when the Spanish/Tlaxcalans returned to the Basin of Mexico (thus starting the actual war) and the surrender of Cuauhtemoc did not leave the same kind of time for more nuanced developments like the copper arrowheads /u/Qhapaqocha describes.

That being said, driving the Spanish out from Tenochtitlan and the Basin garnered at least some opportunities to use captured weapons. As there less than 1000 Spanish at the time, however, this meant that any sort of widescale re-armament was not practical. Nor was it required, since most Mexica forces were fighting against similarly armed Tlaxcalan (and later Texcocan, Chalcan, etc.) forces. 

Still, it did happen, just not with everything. There are are no recorded instances of the Mexica forces using captured harquebuses or cannons, even though they certainly had the opportunity. The Spanish lost all of their cannon during La Noche Triste, although it's not clear whether they were captured or simply sunk (intentionally or not) into Lake Texcoco. A clearer picture of what happened to enemy cannon happened much later, during the Siege of Tenochtitlan, when the Spanish had set up a cannon on top of the main temple. The Spanish/Tlaxacalan forces were routed in that battle and ""in their haste they left the gun upon the round stone of gladiatorial sacrifice. The brave warriors then seized it, forced it forward, went to drop it in the water."" (Sahagún, Historia General, Bk. 12)

The explanation for this is fairly simple, the Mesoamericans had nothing equivalent to those weapons, unless you want to make an tortured analogy about bows or slings. Moreover, matchlocks and cannons require gunpowder, something that was in constant short supply. The Spanish themselves, having run out during a point in the Siege, built a catapult (which was an amusing failure). Without powder, a harquebus is just an unwieldy club and a cannon is even less useful, even in the hands of someone familiar with its action.

Crossbows were a more familiar and intuitive technology, but again, there weren't that many Spanish, and crossbowmen were a minority among them. There is an incident following a major victory on the causeways by the Mexica, wherein dozens of Spanish were captured/killed (Cortés almost among them), Díaz del Castillo does mention that the Mexica used crossbows against them. The account is a little vague as to whether the shots were fired by Mexica taught to use the weapons by captured Spaniards, or were fired by the captives themselves, but regardless, the Mexica only had 5 crossbows to work with, which made any decisive role on their part moot.

In an interesting twist on the copper arrowheads /u/Qhapaqocha mentioned, the Spanish, running low on bolts, had to adapt themselves to Mesoamerican conditions. The ordered up from craftsmen in allied towns several thousand bolts tipped with copper heads made to spec.

More efficiently and (relatively) commonly used were Spanish swords. In the most direct adaption, higher ranking Mexica soldiers simple used them in place of their macuahuitls. This wasn't simply for practical reasons, but also served both to indicate status, as well as to intimidate the Spanish. Cortés, in his 3rd Letter, states that Mexica captains thus armed in one encounter ""[with] many insulting words, [were] threatening to kill us with very swords they had captured from us....""

Another use was attaching the swords to staves and using them, essentially, as spears or pikes. This was first seen by Díaz del Castillo during the attack on Xochimilco were he noted ""the lances which [the Mexica/Xochimilcan forces] carried [were] made from the swords captured from us during the great slaughter on the causeways at Mexico."" This can also be seen, like the more direct use of swords, as an easy analogue to a Mesoamerican weapon, the tepoztopilli, which had an edge used for slashing attacks.

Horses, like gunpowder weapons, were never used. It's not particularly clear whether any horses were captured alive, although the sources all agree that a few of them were ""sacrificed."" Like guns and crossbows, horses were a minority among the minority of Spanish, and were perhaps even better guarded against capture. In a counter-attack that drove a force commanded by Gonzalo de Sandoval back across the Tlacopan causeway, Díaz del Castillo specifically mentions that Sandoval ""ordered us to retreat little by little so that [the Mexica] should not kill the horses."" Given that there's no good indication that horses were taken alive -- the Mexica learned to target the Spanish mounts early on -- and the difficulty in learning several millennia of horsemanship in a few months, the horses actually served better as political tools. Sacrificed horse heads were arrayed, along with Spanish heads, on the skull-racks which displayed the remains of sacrifices, and a horse skull was sent, along with the flayed faces of several Spanish (beards and all!) to Mexica allies to prove the mortality of the Spanish, and thus the assurance of Mexica victory.

As for wheels, the Battle for Tenochtitlan was primarily a naval one, and the Spanish relied on the same logistic strategy as the Mexica: canoes and porters. There was innovation on the lakes as well, though it was more adaption to, rather than adoption of, Spanish tactics. The Spanish were lucky enough to have a shipwright among them, Martín López, and the manpower from Tlaxcala to cut enough lumber to make him useful. They assembled a dozen brigantines and launched them on the lakes from Texcoco. While initially tumbled (literally) by the larger ships, the Mexica retaliated by planting stakes below the surface of the water to catch the deeper draft brigantines, sinking at least one of them before the Spanish came up with techniques to efficiently break the stakes.

There was plenty of adaption on both sides, in other words. The paroxysm of violence that was the few months leading up to the fall of Tenochtitlan, however, only allowed limited ""technological"" adaption, and that mostly in line with already understood weaponry: swapping macuahuitls for swords, using indigenous resources to build bolts and ships. The whole war was a whirlwind of tactical innovation though, as both the Mexica and the Spanish learned to their enemy's weaknesses and strengths.

I will say that the advantage the Inca and the Aztecs had over the Maya in adapting Spanish arms was that they were single organized entities which had the time and opportunity to learn, and co-opt, the tactics and weaponry of their European opponents. While the Maya city of Tayasal did hold out until almost the 1700s and the Maya area did take decades to fully conquer, this action was carried out against disjointed opponents; the Maya were city-states, not empires. They could be conquered piecemeal, with each city having to relearn the mistakes of the one before it and with no chance to have months and months of active practice against, and with, Spanish weapons.

"Honestly, the rapid reaction forces on constant stand-by are no where near enough to effect the political goals desired. And if they were sent in alone or with just a fraction of the active duty forces available, it would be a disaster and major liability. The vast majority of the Russian military is in the region and they know that they are far more able to take casualties than the Europeans (politically, media-wise, population-wise, and due to the massively larger military). It reminds of the recent USMC analysis of putting small forces on islands alone; it's just a terrible idea. 

Part of what set this crisis off is that Putin has imaged himself as a tough guy, and a tough guy cannot lose without bringing their entire legitimacy into question. It is not just he won't back down, but that he may not even be able to politically speaking. The European nations, and the US for that matter, for all their rhetoric will not have taken the lessons of WWII to such heart that they will intervene so early in a conflict. There was no military action in retaliation for the Sudetenland and there won't be now.

What could and should be different this time around is economic and political sanctions, as well as better military and political ties through out the European nations to better ward off aggression in the future.

"Yeah right. Let's look at the major issues that feminist complain about.

School:

More women are going to college than men and yet feminist only care about forcing women to go into STEM fields.

Work:

Feminist lie and claim that women only get 70 cents for every dollar that men make. But when you actually control for differences in years of experience, hours worked, risks taken, and the actual job the difference drops to 3%. Yeah the original study didn't even control for different jobs. They bucketed them. They claimed that all doctors were doing the same job. Which is stupid. Some might be working in the ER while others are working at a free clinic. Furthermore men are more aggressive in negotiating salaries. So that might explain the 3% difference. 

Rape:

Feminist worry about under reported rapes due to the 1 in 4 lie. Even though the methodology used to get to get that ""fact"" is extremely suspect. They basically threw out a bunch of negative responses. And yet they don't talk about false rape reports. The FBI found that about 8% of rapes reported were false while other crimes had a false report rate of about 2%. And when men point this fact out by saying that just because you regret having sex that doesn't mean that it's rape, they get yelled at. 

Reproductive rights:

Feminist complain about abortion clinics getting shut down which is bad but they have no problem with the fact that men are sometimes forced to pay child support even when the women cheated and child isn't even his. In addition to this women have more contraceptive methods than men but abortion it the big issue for them. Unless that is it's men's right to legally abortion their responsibilities. Even though women have that right.
Oh and in some european countries men are not allowed to have parental test unless the mother allows it.


Look, do we need feminism? Absolutely. In the third world. The fact of the matter is women have more advantages than men in the first world. It's not sexism if they don't take advantage of those opportunities and advantages. Feminism in the first world basically won all their major battles and instead of turning to help the third world or disbanding they started looking for problems. The same thing happened with MADD. When MADD was asked about texting and driving they said they don't care. Their main goal now is to raise the tax on alcohol. They have moved from a pro safe driving and anti drunk driving movement into a neo-prohibition movement. As a result the fonder has broken off and distanced herself from the organisation she created after her daughter was killed in a drunk driving accident. The same thing happens with feminism. The old guard that actually cared about equality has has abandoned the movement. Now all that is left are female supremacist and people who liked the name and and the work they did in the past and didn't bother to look up the facts.

"international laws, first and foremost, are ambiguous due to the fact that it is decided by powerful countries (who can therefore easily overstep them). It basically falls down to whether the troops were sent by Russia and part of the military, and whether the troops represent a threat/invasion to Ukraine. As of now, the troops are supposedly without insignia and there has been no confirmation that Russia's military is behind the troop activity. In addition, there are reports that Russian airplanes/helicopters have actively crossed the border, but again this could be unreliable. 
The US/Europe and other nations will intervene if they believe the intents of Russia are to invade/see it as a serious threat to Ukraine (i know this is not descriptive, but that's part of the thing with international laws). And when I say intervene, I mean in the way they decide (so definitely not restricted to only militarily- for example, one threat the US has mentioned is cancelling some trade agreement)
In short, the rules are purposefully unclear, and Russia has already broken many international laws (for ex when they crossed Ukraine airspace with helicopters/planes), but it falls down to when/if they overstep what is allowed by the other nations (and this last statement pretty much sums up international law)

At one point all of Ireland's provinces converted but the government and colonies. They embraced the counter-reformation, even though the pope was already protestant, and everything went back to catholic. Irish Catholicism, eh?

Scotland took it a step forward and stuck with calvinism. they're too cool for mainstream protestantism.

I think the reformation was so successful because it began a little earlier and on the eastern edge of Bohemia. That in turn fucked up Poland, and the ""orthodox must be adjacent to convert"" kicked in in Lithuania, and followed that same process with the rest of eastern europe.

The protestant states in the new world are ""Irish Canada"" (Way to go ireland, finally colonizing), Portuguese thirteen colonies (i think that's the name), my territories in brazil, and wait for it

"Many reasons, but I'll try just one example. Though remember that 1 or 2 degrees is a fluctuation in **average** temperature.

If the average temperature gets 1 degree hotter, than the highest high and the lowest low will (not exactly, but let's say so) get 1 degree hotter. At the hot end, every degree is extremely important regarding effect on health, heat stroke deaths, etc. The increase in problems is sort of exponentially worse for each degree.

The difference between a 20C/68F day and a 25C/77F day is just wearing a different shirt. No problem.  The difference between a 35C/95F day and a 40C/104F day can be life and death for many people, as in the famous 2003 heat wave in Europe that killed about 10,000 people.

Really it's not quite so simple, you're more shifting a bell curve of temperatures to the hotter side, so the 35C days that used to come 3 times a year might come 10 times a year, and the 40C days that you never had before might come 3 times a year, etc. Many cities have been dealing with this already for decades due to a separate issue (urban heat island). Living in a big concrete city in summer...sucks!

This kind of thing applies to a lot of other areas. 1 or 2 degrees can make a difference. In the case of ice, if the whole world average temperature changes 2 degrees C, then there must be some regions in the Arctic where the average will go from from -1C to +1C, and ice melts when it shouldn't.  (Again, that's average, really it works out to the warm melting season being a bit longer and bit hotter over a bit larger area..though ""a bit"" can be millions of square km. The Earth is big.)

The films that preach and enforce political correctness are the dominant form of cinematic expression today.

They mostly deal with VICTIMS as heroes, and they use and manipulate them in order to activate the viewer’s empathy. They make a false, romanticized story about that victim and sell it as real life. That is real pornography and manipulation, and also spiritual violence – the cinematic fascism of political correctness."" in the words of the director Srđan Spasojević.

"This stuff is all explained in the EU, and it's better that way. The Clones were meant to be a secret even to the Jedi.

Sifo Dyas was a Jedi Master who stayed on the fringe of the Order, and was public and outspoken. Dooku and his pupil Qui Gon Jinn were friends of Sifo Dyas. These three men were called 'Grey' Jedi. They disapproved of the strict teachings of the order and often took up a solo lifestyle similar to a Buddhist monk. 

A Muun businessman and secret sith lord Darth Plagueis (who trained Palpatine in all he knows) confronted Sifo Dyas. He brought to his attention the cloners of Kamino and the idea of an army for the Republic. At this point in time (around 5 years before episode 1) the Republic was in a state of turmoil. Raiders were attacking colonies and planets and people were demanding peace. The Republic had no standing army, and prevented it's members from having one as well. This eventually led into the formation of the Trade Federation, exploiting a loophole that allowed them to cause blockades on planets like Naboo and others to exploit resources.

Sifo Dyas, convinced by Plagueis to go to Kamino in secret, lied to the Kaminoans that they would be funded by the Jedi Order. In fact, it was Plagueis himself funding the existence of the army.

The Clone Army was secretly created by the Sith for the Jedi in order to subvert the Jedi's power of defense to they could have an army completely under their control in order to cause strife against the Jedi (Who would have been revealed to have funded the army against Republic rule, making people believe they overstepped their bounds and are seeking power), and with the events where a group of Jedi led by Mace Windu seeked to illegally apprehend Chancellor Palpatine and brutally disfigured him, having him be saved by a rogue Jedi named Vader.

Well.. Everything was a part of Plagueis/Palpatine's plan and he succeeded pretty well.

ALSO :

Plagueis was obsessed with midichlorians. He was so afraid of death that her performed experiments on anything force sensitive. He found that he could control them with enough practice, forcing them to heal and extend their powers. He taught all these secrets to Palpatine, and this is possibly the reason Palpatine stayed alive as long as he did, and how powerful he became. 

This meddling with Midichlorians may have been the event that created Anakin from virgin mother as during one of his experimental escapes he went to Tattooine. When Plagueis witnessed Anakin's arrival on Coruscant he was hit with a vision of the future, seeing the fall of the Jedi and the success of the Sith via a black armored warrior.

He told Palpatine of this, who in turn killed his master as all Sith do. This is why Palpatine took such interest in Anakin, because he knew of what would happen.

"Historically, second tier Korean teams have proven to be just as strong if not stronger than our top tier teams. Unless NA/EU shows otherwise, I can't say that Frost is definitely inferior to these teams, despite their recent roster changes and struggles in KR.

If we were to implant Frost in the LCS, we would have a slight advantage, however. A best of one series would be to our advantage because it takes away some of their greatest strengths: analysis, strategy, adaptation.

Tactically, I think EU is just as good, though NA is behind second tier KR teams. This is coming from an amateur player though, so maybe my knowledge of in-game movement, vision control, map pressure, etc. is insufficient to judge. 

I do think their talent (as in mechanics, micro decision-making, champion pool, etc. ) as a region is immeasurable. When I see a tier 2 KR team play a team like SKT K I don't think of an insurmountable difference in talent (even despite Faker). I do see one team making FAR less mistakes, making correct calls with movement and jungle pressure, having great vision control, and simply possessing superior team coordination in fights. 

The NA scene has had little success against KR, so unless they start to prove otherwise, it's hard to believe facing even a tier 2 team like Frost will change that pattern. TSM has a terrible record though they have experience. It should be noted that they have only faced what were considered to be top tier KR teams at the time...which would place them at the best, tier 2 level? However, even lower tier KR teams have taken games from top tier teams, something TSM has failed to do. C9 has little international experience which is limited mainly to Fnatic and a little Gambit. CLG has no experience outside of Doublelift. EU has seen more success against Korea, though we did see a tier 2 Korean team beat Gambit at World's.

"**TL;DR: Russia wants oil and a warm water port but northern and western Ukrainians want a fair government and EU membership. Eastern and southern Ukrainians support Russia more. Possible solutions include Russian takeover of parts or all of Ukraine, Ukrainian autonomy from Russia and adoption of more western political values, and in between those two.**

I don't know everything about what's going on in the Ukraine. Heck, I barely know anything about it. But from what I do know Russia cares about the Ukraine for 4 main reasons:

1. Russia used the Ukraine for a warm water port.

2. The Ukraine is sort of a buffer to the rest of Europe, which isn't generally pro-Russia.

3. Oil and natural gas pipelines [map and article here] (http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-is-backtracking-on-black-sea-oil-exports-because-the-money-market-is-in-asia-2010-5) and [here] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456974/html/nn4page1.stm) are a huge factor in the Russian economy and are extremely important for the rest of Europe, which produces very little oil. Guess where some of the pipelines go before going to Central and Western Europe? Ukraine.

4. [Many Ukrainians want to join the EU.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93European_Union_relations#Popular_support_to_EU_integration_of_Ukraine_in_European_Union) Granted, the percentage who do has gone down considerably in the past year, but it's still a pretty good percentage. Russia, on the other hand, is [not part of the EU.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_member_states) Since the EU isn't exactly Russia's best friend, Russia has quite a bit to gain by preventing Ukraine from becoming an EU member state.

However, the Ukrainian government has sided with Russia over the EU. Many Ukrainians don't like that. [Here's an article from the BBC about it. It's informative and worth a read.] (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182823) From the article:

&gt;The protests broke out after President Yanukovych's government rejected a far-reaching accord with the European Union in November 2013 in favour of stronger ties with Russia. Thousands of people, outraged that a long-standing aspiration for integration with Europe had been ditched overnight, poured into central Kiev for peaceful protests. They have occupied Independence Square, known as Maidan, ever since.

&gt;Several developments - including police attacks on student protesters, severe new anti-protest laws, and the abduction and beating of opposition activists - caused the demonstrations to spread and intensify. For many people, they were less about Europe than about getting rid of a president who they believed was clinging to power and serving the interests of his own close circle and Moscow.

To summarize: **After the Ukrainian government rejected an agreement with the EU in favor of closer ties with Russia, protest erupted. Anti-protest laws in the Ukraine followed, as well as lots of violence, which only spread the protests. Many consider the now ousted Ukrainian President Yanukoyvych to be ""clinging to power"" and want him out.**

What makes this situation so different from others is that the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine are often pro-Russia, while people in the north and west are often pro-West and pro-EU. [This Washington Post article goes into further depth.] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/12/09/this-one-map-helps-explain-ukraines-protests/) The president's own party, whether from fear or acknowledgement of the dangerous situation, voted to oust him. Thus, Ukraine is in a sort of political limbo, and Russia has jumped on its opportunity. Seeing as Russia has much less interest in the parts of Ukraine that align with the west desire more autonomy, several results could arise from this situation.

1. Worst case scenarios: Russia takes over the Ukraine. This is unlikely as there would be lots of violence and this would concern the EU. It's possible, though unlikely, that Russia will annex Ukraine and fight for it. I consider this unlikely because of the violence, international outcry, and monetary loss to Russia.

2. Bad scenario, the former Ukrainian president is put back in power. This is also unlikely, since even the military wants his head on a plate, but it's a possibility that would really damage Ukraine.

3. Okay scenario: Russia takes over the southern and eastern parts of the Ukraine with little opposition. This is good in some ways, but pro-EU people in those areas would be quite upset and the economy of Ukraine might be hurt. However, the majority of people would probably be satisfied with this since it is a close political divide. It's also possible, though unlikely, that Russia will simply take over a warm water port (maybe a few) and put troops near the oil pipelines.

4. Best case scenarios: Russia can still use its oil pipelines and warm water port, but the Ukraine has more autonomy and a fair government. Another possibility is a vote by Ukrainians to split in 2, with one area being closer to Russia politically (maybe being a part of Russia) and another being closer to the west politically. The difference here is that another state may be formed, and less violence is always better. Alternatively, the Ukraine might split with little violence, which is similar to the okay scenario, except this would probably involve a unilateral withdrawal on the part of Russia. It's also possible, though unlikely, that Russia will simply take over a warm water port (maybe a few) and put troops near the oil pipelines.

"Both the territories that Russia annexed were part of Georgia that were attempting separation.  That the population was ethnic Russian just happened to help Putin make his offensive war seem slightly 'just', as he was 'defending Russians'.  Saakashvilli is a douche and a stooge of the West, but that doesn't make Russia's invasion legal or justified in any way.  Offering citizenship and passports to citizens of another country as a pretext to 'defend your citizens' is a transparent act of aggression and imperialism, just like the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and Germany into Poland and England into the Falklands or Africa or India or China or any other point in history, when it has happened.

Being an American has nothing to do with being able to identify an act of imperialism and, one would think, might make someone more apt to recognize such, with more than 200 out of 238 years existence spent in war.  Russia has invaded Crimea and undermined the legitimacy of Ukraine as a nation by subverting part of their population with offers of citizenship and passports, with absolutely no provocation toward the Kremlin, except the inept Right-Sector and other opposition leaders siding with Berlin, the EU, and the IMF over Moscow.  Putin helped install an illegitimate semi-dictator, like himself, in the same way by fudging the elections (again, Americans have a lot of experience in BS electoral practices) and got butt-hurt when his puppet got kicked out for a western one.  He installed Yanukovich, just like the US installed Pinochet in Chile.

In short, your anti-American bigotry (""You Americans couldn't be any more brainwashed"") will blind you more than being an American would blind someone else and your attitude that being an American would make one person automatically wrong is the same logic that says supporting universal health care or sensible gun control makes a person a Nazi.",1432607820,1393645188,t1_cfrhiqt,False,False,1,t3_1z6t9a,,,CopernicuSagaNeilDT,,1,t5_2qh13,0,t1_cfrgt7o,0,cfrhiqt,True,,worldnews,0

"Its not ""like a trick"", it was the entire idea.  After WWII, America wanted permanent trade status with all future liberated European countries.  In order to ensure this happened, international trade was built on the US dollar (which made sense for a _lot_ of reasons), Europe more or less unofficially agreed not to militarize (and thereby risk another war between the European states), and in return for the above demilitarization, and in order to ensure the necessity of a permanent alliance between the new western democratic countries, the US pledged to defend the interests of Europe militarily.  This was done unofficially, partly by the US' dedication to enforcing whatever the UN declared, both militarily and economically (not to mention footing the bill again economically and militarily for its creation, at first), as well as taking the role of the head military in NATO during the Cold war.  Even going so far as to spend 20 years fighting in Vietnam on behalf of the French, where there was absolutely no economic or political direct result from which the US would benefit (domino theory be damned).

As a result, the West hasn't fought another war since 1945, and our countries are now so economically tied that doing so would be nearly unthinkable.  This economic intermingling was allowed to happen, because, since Europe was demilitarized, economic powerhouses in each European country weren't able to exert lobbying pressure to use military power against their rivals, as they had for the previous few thousand years.  America has had to maintain a military that dwarfs the rest of the world, but in return we've been able to ignore our debt out indefinitely by devaluing the dollar (an ability few other countries have), and have forged an economic empire with all of the richest countries on the planet.",1432607874,1393645461,t1_cfrhmav,False,False,420,t3_1z7so1,,,ep1032,,420,t5_2qh13,0,t1_cfrgd39,0,cfrhmav,True,,worldnews,0

The UN can't do anything as Russia's on the security council. Obama has threatened to boycott a meeting. (Ain't that just terrifying, lol.) So he and the US by default obviously won't do anything. Europe won't do shit without the US or UN. And the rest of the world might send some harsh letters then go back to matters they care about.

"* Allen Edmonds

Touching on only the domestic models: There MSRP is rapidly approaching $400. The quality of the leather in the calfskin (which are suspected to really just be cowhide) is lacking at there current retail offering. They seem to have been trying to cheapen their core line with poron insoles but seem to have abandoned that change in the past 9 months or so. They also just disbanded their MTO program I believe (source SF). They make a lot of experimental models, and they seem to be more miss than hit. They also just cancelled their 2 for $250 on discontinued seconds event. Their single leather outsoles and standard rubber heels stink. Recently bought by a VC firm, so their future may be up in the air. Excellent customer service. Offers free shipping on everything.

If you can score a pair of firsts for below $200 you got a really good deal. There cordovan models are still really good, and they did make quite a few models in truffle, cappuccino, and walnut.

* Chippewa 

Just an entry level brand that is using average quality materials at best. I like their service boots. if you can get them around $150 for the service boots you got a good price (J Crew closeout price). The Katahdin in cordovan (color, not leather) is a solid boot coming in at ~$225 through LL Bean. LL Bean upcharges for the boot as they will replace the boot indefinitely as part of their lifetime guarantee policy. Other good boots like the GQ and homestead. Solid boots for the money and are domestically made as well (at least the ones I mentioned in this post). Not a brand to be looked down upon. Arguably more bang/buck than Red Wing at retail. Very good entry level boots for people looking to get into nicer boots.

* Church's

Massive drop off post Prada-acquisition. Garnered a lot of negative attention because of their use of ""polished cobbler"" leather. Well overpriced at retail. 

See here:

* Meermin

Welted in China, finished in Spain. That is just a fact, you can apply whatever notions, preconceived or otherwise. Cheapest hand welted shoes on the market. A ton of bang/buck. Some people consider Meermin to be the best value in the shoe world. Uses non-horween cordovan ( I believe comipel). Does MTO. Has lackluster customer service at times. Leathers are okay, lasts are pretty good. 

* Oak Street

GYW models Made by PW Minor in NY and handsewns made by Highland in ME. They are not transparent about this. Lackluster quality control out of PW Minor. Decent QC out of Highland. Quickly rose up within the shoe world within 2-3 years, mainly with the help of the Elston last which is used on their now infamous trench boot. Natty shell trench through Context has garnered a ton of attention (exclusivity, shell rarity) and people are waiting with bated breath at their debut. Uses fiberboard tucks in their handsewns. Handsewns are overpriced compared to Rancourt's offerings. Trench boot overpriced for the quality IMO but the last and the hype make it worth it to a lot of people. OSB uses pretty good materials (mostly Horween leathers). People really like the roughout trench. George Vlagos, the founder (not the owner) is a nice guy who put in a ton (a TON) of work to make OSB successful. 

* Rancourt

Good MTO program, on par with Highland, but offers direct to consumer at a lower price than Highland who only does private label. Kyle Rancourt can be an asshole. Has received a lot of negative attention for the blake/rapid construction because Rancourt uses fiberboard insoles. Hand dyes their own shells. Will make seemingly anything they are capable of if you are willing to pay them. Prices are generally good. Not much bad to say about Rancourt other than their B/R fiberboard construction and that Kyle can have his bad days. Pretty good QC and leathers. IMO best bang/buck of all the ME handsewers, especially through their Eastland MiM. Eastland MiM is not exclusively Rancourt however. (Anyone can PM me for an ID of any handsewn.)

* Red Wing

Good boots. Full leather insoles. Decent QC. One of the major downsides is that RW seems content to release their best models to Canada, Europe, and Japan. Perhaps a step up from Chipps in terms of leather quality. Has their own tannery, SB Foot that makes some really nice leathers IMO. I like their roughout and featherstone especially. Not as well regarded as Hoween but SB Foot has a great reputation. Just not a luxury bootmaker. Tough boots that won't quit on you. Good recrafting program and is willing to resole their own boots with non stock outsoles. Has some pretty nice outsole options IMO. Offers free replacement laces. Lasts can be blobby (looking at you munson last, but RW doesnt use it that much) a lot of people don't like the 8 last for it;s upturned toe.

* Wolverine

Plethora of QC problems. Probably the worst of the bunch followed by OSB, and then probably AE. Only models worth talking about are from the 1000 mile collection really. Their cxl quality can be poor at times. Clicking is often lacking. Poor quality single leather outsoles. When they make their boots right, they are pretty nice. Now that they are approaching $400, they are not worth that. Can often be found on sale for about $2-250 anyways. They have a lot of colors, cordovan, tan, black, rust, brown. Wingtip model is poorly proportioned. I like their waxed laces. A good gateway boot into the mid tier. Decent boots overall just not worth retail IMO.

"I definitely do understand his point more now, but I would still argue that his kick out against this is exaggerated due to his anger at the treatment of Eastern European cinema by mainstream influences, and his cries for change could arguable echo across all cinema - particularly with the emergence of so many sequels these days, dragging out franchises because they know they will make money. But I still think his treatment of this issue just fell slightly short, and in his eagerness to fight back, accidentally found his film being categorised by many in the same shock category as Human Centipede (which didnt even try to have a storyline).

If the message of the film was handled better then I would be agreeing with you, but I feel that if the explanations for the film must be made by the director AFTER the film has been finished, then he left something out of his film. This is, again, where I take issue with the comical aspect of ""death-by-dick,"" and the unrelenting ""shock"" aspect of the final scene, as I feel his point had already been made.

* Stoke have gone 14 matches without keeping a clean sheet in all competitions - conceding 26 goals in that period.
* Mark Hughes' side have scored in each of their last six league matches at home, with 12 goals in total. They have only lost one of those matches (W3, D2, L1).
* As manager of QPR, Fulham, Manchester City and Blackburn Rovers, Hughes is unbeaten in his last five home league matches against Arsenal.
* They have committed more fouls than any other team in the Premier League (360) and picked up the most cards (58 yellows, three reds).

**Arsenal**

* Arsenal have lost one of their last 11 matches in the Premier League - a 5-1 defeat away to Liverpool on 2 February.
* They have the best record in the league when facing opposition in the bottom half of the table - winning 13 of their 15 matches.
* Arsene Wenger's side have gone on to win all 11 league games in which they have been leading at half-time. That's the best record in the division.

"There are probably a few things but the first one that sprung to mind was a good strategic position on the black sea and a way to isolate Ukrainian trade.  


Sevastopol, already houses a Russian naval base which is home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet and is one of the most significant Ukrainian ports. 


In a grander strategic sense, if it were held long term by Russia it could act as a jumping off point for gas pipelines into Bulgaria, Romania or even Turkey, which would allow Russia to stop routing oil and gas via Ukraine in order to sell to Europe, which I imagine has been a priority for some time. 


I believe it also has a largely Russian speaking population, with many people sympathetic to Russia and upset with the current events in Kiev. That being the case Russia may also have a ""South Ossetia"" type argument of. ""We're defending the people of Crimea from Ukrainian anti-democratic revolutionaries."" 



and no, no the UK and US wont, at least not lightly. They don't have the money nor the appetite to escalate the situation and they didn't in South Ossetia. 

Edit: I thought you meant the NATO Partnership for Peace not the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. That may change things. But I don't think so.

"While not in the United States, Toussaint L’Ouverture is frequently referred to as the ""black Spartacus."" He organized and led a slave army which fought French control of Haiti in beginning in the early 1790s. 

After defeating the French and bringing abolition to the island, his army then faced British invaders in 1798, who were expecting to find a demoralized French force and instead found a highly organized **army of 55,000 slaves.** Keep in mind that George Washington never commanded more than 20,000 troops. 

He defeated the British in a series of seven battles, forcing them from the island. Two years later, he faced a Spanish invasion, and again successfully repelled a major European power. In 1801, Haiti declared independence. 

In 1804, Napoleon returned to power and sent a huge army to re-take the island. Toussaint sailed to a French consular ship to negotiate, but he was arrested instead. He died in a jail cell high in the French Alps.

"Quickest-possible version: 

The Ukrainian president was about to form a tighter association with the European Union, as per certain promises. At the last minute he reverses course and does so with Russia instead. The Ukrainian people, who *largely* favour Europe over Russia flipped out. Weeks of rioting followed, and the President ordered his police to start killing people in the streets. He was then forced to flee the country and was swiftly impeached by the parlaiment. 

Russia does not recognize the legitimacy of the current government, which many feel is because they liked having the old guy in charge because he was willing to be their puppet. They already had - legally - a port in the Crimea region in the southeast of the country, as a result of a long-standing agreement between the two countries. They now seem to be using this military port to stage an invasion of the Crimea region, presumably with the intent of putting their puppet back in power, or possibly claiming Crimea as part of Russia again. This last is made more likely by the fact that Crimea was actually part of Russia until the 1950s, and was gifted to Ukraine when it was part of the USSR. This may be Russia taking back by force what they gave away in good will 60 years ago.

"Except when one of the points is utter bullshit

&gt;We make sure your EU inductees (cough Georgia) get taken care of, when Russia starts shit with them (2008 ring any bells?)

Georgia started that war. They probably thought they could get away with it since the international community would side with them as the underdog and as an EU inductee. What did you expect Russia to do when you kill their peacekeepers, say you're backing off, then launching a full scale assault? Of course they retaliated. Since the Georgians weren't expecting that (because otherwise they would never have started the shelling in the first place), they obviously thought Russia was some backwater relic of the Soviet era without the gall to retaliate. They changed that impression with the war, if you can even call it that. You can be sure no one is going to try that shit again.

"I don't think Putin wants to expand Russia, to get more population, to keep up with China or India. Instead I suspect he is just not  the ruler he wants everyone to think he is. 

He wants people to think he is in total control. If that were true, there would have been much less corruption around the Sochi games. Corruption complete with intermarriage between the politicians and the wealthy. I forgot which Putin in-law was married to which oligarch.

He is not an all powerful dictator. A real absolute dictator would have executed a bunch of people for corruption, probably on live TV, before the games, and that would have fixed a lot corruption. Instead like most dictators, Putin has a complex relationship with the wealthy in Russia. And that's why he can't get rid of most high level corruption by just shooting a bunch of people. He needs many of those people to help keep him in power.

And that's why the evens in Ukraine, especially the IMF loans which demanded legal changes to fight corruption, are such a vital threat to him **personally**. 

Yanukovych, private pirate ship and all, was obviously part of the corrupt politics and wealth club. That's **a lot** of income from Ukraine that club could lose. 

And if things in the Ukraine improve much like things in the Baltics have, it's going to be hard to ignore that. The Baltic nations are tiny, Putin can pretend they don't exist, or that due to their size they can't be compared to Russia.

But you can't do that with Ukraine. Imagine Ukraine, as poor and huge as it is, starting to improve in an attempt to join the EU. Fighting corruption, and growing wealthier. 

**That's a direct attack on Putin and Co.** Sure Putin wants a strong Russia. But he **primarily** wants himself to stay in power and in wealth. And needs his supporters to stay wealthy. And not just stay wealthy, but he needs to make sure they continue tobe able to steal as much money as possible. And stay out of jail while doing it. 

That's not possible if Russians start clamoring for anti-corruption reforms like in the Ukraine. 

That's why Yanukovych is demanding he's still the president. Obviously Russia wants to take back the Crimea. But Yanukovych's demand are not just to help make that happen. They are also the sad and desperate attempts by a totally corrupt system to maintain its grip on an important source of income.


That's also why I think crushing economic sanctions could be effective against that regime. Sure most of his allies have their money in Russia. But Russia just does not produce very much that's not energy. If the OCDE gets serious about cutting him and his allies out of international finances, the the long run that would start to seriously hurt.

- These would have continued training local forces, pursued anti-terrorist missions, and in Afghanistan, conducted the drone war against the Taliban.

- The White House has warned Russia not to intervene, which they have not threatened, and has ordered U.S. military precautions.

- A new fraternal alignment of Ukraine with the European Union (a relationship more prudent than outright membership) is essential.

- From the start it has been difficult to interpret foreign policy as Barack Obama envisages it.

- The Presidents advisors include people who support the drone war on Islamic militants, a new means of war of which the administration is enamored because it kills at long distance and at no risk to the operator, other than moral.

Well A) one cannot be arrested for testing positive for drugs, because that is not proof of possession but only of use and B) If you hold your crack pipe in a way that i only need to use it then i did not possess the crack.

I could also pay the dealer to inject the heroin directly, again i did not possess anything.

"&gt;Russia did not instigate the revolution in Ukraine

No, they didn't, but that's not the point.

Russia has an obvious vested interest in maintaining *sympathetic* countries on its borders. This has been a foreign relations concern for them going back quite literally hundreds of years. Nothing changed. They need Russian-sympathy, either through diplomacy or through force, in all the neighboring regions. Maintaining this 'buffer zone', as it's so often called both by historians and foreign policy people, is the only reason why US does not have military bases right up Russia's ass all across its European borders. It's very silly to dismiss this concern of theirs with a ""So what?"" because contrary to popular belief, we don't actually live in a peaceful world and the possibility of a future full scale war between post-industrial nations is not even remotely close to zero.

And you can ask the residents of any of these countries about this. They would certainly confirm the persistent Russian meddling in their domestic affairs throughout the years. It's a somewhat toned down version of the Soviet control over the Eastern Bloc -- through military posturing, covert meddling in other countries' domestic affairs and using trade leverages. Lump it under ""diplomacy"" if you want, but that doesn't really change their clear interests of *control* in the region. ""Sovereignty"" of the Eastern Bloc certainly didn't stop the Soviets from doing their thing. It's not stopping Russia either today.

The problem is that, especially over the past decade or so, these former Eastern Bloc countries have increasingly turned towards the EU and shunned Russia in the process. The trade and travel benefits of EU inclusion is just too goddamn attractive in an increasingly globalized world, and perhaps even more so in a continent like Europe where different countries are living in such close proximity. Do you seriously believe that Russia has no issues with this trend? Former Eastern Bloc countries joining the EU implicitly opens the way for stronger military co-operation with the US. Russia is never going to let that happen on its front porch. Turkey is as close as US has gotten so far, and even that is a cause of serious concern. It's what primarily fuels their (aggressive) interest in Georgia, it's why Ukraine is now being subjected to military posturing, and it's why Russia remains such a staunch supporter of Iran (in order to threaten the US military presence in Anatolia through a southern proxy).

The point I'm trying to make here is that Russia is not beyond exerting outright physical/military pressure on its neighboring regions to protect its buffer zone. One of the very few things keeping them from doing this with reckless abandon is the US military presence all over Europe. If you take that away, EU sure as shit isn't going to be able to do anything against it, given the natural gas dependence looming over their head. Hence my entire argument: the foreign policy implications of US military spending has a very significant influence over the domestic spending preferences of EU in general.",1432608609,1393650027,t1_cfrj6k8,False,1393650419,7,t3_1z7so1,,,[deleted],,7,t5_2qh13,0,t1_cfrirji,0,cfrj6k8,True,,worldnews,0

"The European definition of freedoms parallels the American one quite closely in the case of speech: both prohibit speech that is considered harmful. 

In the the US, it is illegal to should ""Fire"" in a crowded theater because it is reasonable to expect that such speech would lead to consequent harm. Likewise, it is illegal to directly incite others to violence through speech. We accept these restrictions on speech in recognition of the fact that you personal freedoms end when they negatively affect others.

The only difference with Europe is that they also include certain forms of ideological speech--seen as benign or harmless in the US--in the groups of speech that perpetrate direct harm. This is rather understandable, given Europe's history with fascism and Nazism. It is much easier for us as Americans, who have never directly experienced the effects of unchecked hate speech so directly as Europeans during and after WWII, to believe that Europeans are stifling freedoms.

I realize this is an unpopular opinion here on Reddit, where the reigning philosophy with regards to harm appears to be ""If it's not physical violence, who cares,"" but the effects of hate speech are just as profound and leave psychological injuries just as lasting and hurtful as if the speaker had inflicted those wounds physically.

"Someone asked about evidence supporting piracy as a factor that keeps prices down and I compiled two quick sources on the matter.  But looking at them, I decided they're more of a general reply to this (or any piracy-related topic) than a direct reply to the question I started with.

While I'm not trying to excuse piracy, I think anyone who wants to truly have an intelligent discussion on the matter should take a look at the academic work out there on the topic, I picked two of my favorites below:

[Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, Faculty of Law:](http://www.thestar.com/business/2011/03/18/geist_canadianbacked_report_says_music_movie_and_software_piracy_is_a_market_failure_not_a_legal_one.html)
&gt; Following several years of independent investigation in six emerging economies, the report concludes that piracy is chiefly a product of a market failure, not a legal one...
&gt; 
&gt; ...In many developing countries, there are few meaningful legal distribution channels for media products. The report notes “the pirate market cannot be said to compete with legal sales or generate losses for industry. At the low end of the socioeconomic ladder where such distribution gaps are common, piracy often simply is the market.

&gt; Even in those jurisdictions where there are legal distribution channels, pricing renders many products unaffordable for the vast majority of the population. Foreign rights holders are often more concerned with preserving high prices in developed countries, rather than actively trying to engage the local population with reasonably-priced access. These strategies may maximize profits globally, but they also serve to facilitate pirate markets in many developed countries.

I'd also direct you to **Coda: A Short History of Book Piracy** by Bodó Balázs (PhD economics) which can be found [here](http://piracy.americanassembly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/MPEE-PDF-Coda-Books.pdf) or a quick google search away.  Balázs likens the current trend in music and movie piracy to the book monopolies in 14th century Europe.  I'll summarize his five ""laws"" of piracy in cultural markets:

1. Artificial gaps between supply and demand will be filled by pirates
1. When dealing with piracy, content owners will turn to the government to defend their business and only adapt to market conditions when no other option exists
1. Pirates operate at the edges of the influence of content owners and governments
1. Piracy has a historical role in distributing goods in these areas
1. Piracy provides a counter to centralized control of information

__The development of brain sex differences: a multisignaling process__


In order to account for the development of sex differences in the brain, we took, as an integrative model, the vomeronasal pathway, which is involved in the control of reproductive physiology and behavior. The fact that brain sex differences take place in complex neural networks will help to develop a motivational theory of sex differences in reproductive behaviors. We also address the classic genomic actions in which three agents (the hormone, the intracellular receptor, and the transcription function) play an important role in brain differentiation, but we also point out refinements that such a theory requires if we want to account of the existence of two morphological patterns of sex differences in the brain, one in which males show greater morphological measures (neuron numbers and/or volume) than females and the opposite. Moreover, we also consider very important processes closely related to neuronal afferent input and membrane excitability for the developing of sex differences. Neurotransmission associated to metabotropic and ionotropic receptors, neurotrophic factors, neuroactive steroids that alter membrane excitability, cross-talk (and/or by-pass) phenomena, and second messenger pathways appear to be involved in the development of brain sex differences. The sexual differentiation of the brain and reproductive behavior is regarded as a cellular multisignaling process.

__Transsexualism. Epidemiology, phenomenology, regret after surgery, aetiology, and public attitudes__

Transsexualism denotes a condition in which the gender identity-the personal sense of being a man or a woman-contradicts the bodily sex characteristics. This thesis is based on three independent surveys about transsexualism. FIRST, all 233 subjects applying for sex reassignment in Sweden during 1972-1992 were retrospectively examined through medical records. The incidence of applying for sex reassignment was 0.17/100,000 individuals over 15 years of age and per year. The male-to-female (M-F)/female-to-male (F-M) ratio was 1.4/1. With the exception of an incidence peak related to the legislation regulating sex reassignment in the early 1970s, the incidence has remained fairly stable since the first estimates in Sweden in the late 1960s. The M-F (n=134) and F-M (n=99) groups were phenomenologically compared. M-F transsexuals were older, and more often had a history of marriage and children than their F-M counterparts. M-F transsexuals also had more heterosexual experience. F-M transsexuals, on the other hand, more frequently reported cross-gender behaviour in childhood than did M-F transsexuals. It is concluded that transsexualism is manifested differently in males and females. The regret frequency (defined as applying for reversal to the original sex) was 3.8%. Prognostic factors for regret were, 'a poor support from the family', and 'belonging to the secondary group of transsexuals' (denotes people who develop transsexualism only after a significant period of transvestism or homosexuality). SECOND, 28 M-F transsexuals and 30 male controls were investigated. To test the hypothesis that genes coding for proteins involved in the sexual differentiation of the brain influence the susceptibility of transsexualism, we analysed (1) a tetra nucleotide polymorphism of the aromatase gene, (2) a CAG repeat sequence in the first exon of the gene coding for the androgen receptor, and (3) a CA repeat polymorphism of the estrogen receptor beta gene. Results support the notion that the gender identity is related to the sex steroid-driven sexual differentiation of the brain, and that certain genetic variants of three of the genes critically involved in this process, may enhance the susceptibility for transsexualism. THIRD, a questionnaire comprising questions about attitudes towards transsexualism and transsexuals was mailed to a random national sample (n=998) of Swedish residents, 18–75 years of age. The response rate was 67%. The results showed that a majority supports the possibility for transsexuals to undergo sex reassignment. However, 63% thought that the individual should bear the expenses for it. In addition, a majority supported the transsexuals' right to get married in their new sex, and their right to work with children. Transsexuals' right to adopt and raise children was supported by 43% whereas 41% opposed this. The results indicated that those who believed that transsexualism is caused by psychological factors had a more restrictive view on transsexualism than people who held a biological view.

__Cognitive ability and cerebral lateralisation in transsexuals__

It is still unclear to what extent cross-gender identity is due to pre- and perinatal organising effects of sex hormones on the brain. Empirical evidence for a relationship between prenatal hormonal influences and certain aspects of gender typical (cognitive) functioning comes from pre- and postpubertal clinical samples, such as women suffering from congenital adrenal hyperplasia and studies in normal children. In order to further investigate the hypothesis that cross-gender identity is influenced by prenatal exposure to (atypical) sex steroid levels we conducted a study with early onset, adult, male-to-female and female-to-male transsexuals, who were not yet hormonally treated, and nontranssexual adult female and male controls. The aim of the study was to find out whether early onset transsexuals performed in congruence with their biological sex or their gender identity. The results on different tests show that gender differences were pronounced, and that the two transsexual groups occupied a position in between these two groups, thus showing a pattern of performance away from their biological sex. The findings provide evidence that organisational hormonal influences may have an effect on the development of cross-gender identity.

"__Genetic and epigenetic effects on sexual brain organization mediated by sex hormones__


Alterations of sex hormone levels during pre- or perinatal sexual brain organization - responsible for long-term changes of gonadotropin secretion, sexual orientation, and gender role behavior - can be caused by: 1. Genetic effects, i.e. mutations or polymorphisms of a) 21-hydroxylase genes on chromosome 6, b) 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase genes in chromosome 1 or c) X-chromosomal genes, and 2. Epigenetic effects, such as a) stressful situations - especially in combination with mutations - and b) endocrine disrupters, e.g. the pesticide DDT and its metabolites, which display estrogenic, antiandrogenic, and inhibitory effects on the enzyme 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase leading to increased levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate as precursors of endogenous androgens and estrogens. In connection with the introduction and extensive use of the pesticide DDT, the following findings were obtained in subjects born before as compared to those born during this period: 1. The prevalence of patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO), idiopatic oligospermia (IO), and transsexualism (TS) increased significantly (about 3–4 fold). 2. Partial 21-hydroxylase deficiencies were observed in most patients with PCO and TS and some patients with IO born before this period. 3. In contrast, most patients with PCO and TS and several patients with IO born during the period of massive use of DDT displayed clearly increased plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and DHEA-S/cortisol ratios suggesting partial 3beta-hydroxsteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) deficiencies. Interestingly enough, geneticists could not find any mutations of 3beta-HSD genes in such subjects. However, o,p'-DDT and/or its metabolite o,p'-DDD are strong inhibitors of 3beta-HSD, indicating their possible co-responsibility for such life-long ontogenetic alterations. Finally, some data suggest that endocrine disrupters may also be able to affect the development of sexual orientation.

__Environment- and gene-dependent human ontogenesis, sociogenesis and phylogenesis (eco-geno-onto-socio-phylogenesis)__


Abstract: Prevention of environment- and gene-dependent, teratogenic malfunctions (“Functional Teratogenesis”) – caused by abnormal hormone, neurotransmitter and cytokine concentrations during organization of the neuro-endocrine-immune system (NEIS) should be considered as a global challenge of outstanding relevance. By optimizing the natural and social environment and correcting in time abnormal concentrations of hormones, neurotransmitters and cytokines during the critical perinatal (pre- and early postnatal) organization period of the NEIS (“Neuro-Endocrine-Immune Prophylaxis”) human ontogenesis and sociogenesis can be decisively improved (“Primary Prevention of Maldevelopments of Human Beings and their Societies”). Finally, phylogenesis is dependent on incessant sequencies of ontogenesis and sociogenesis (“Onto-Socio-Phylogenesis”). From the text: We could demonstrate by experimental, clinical and epidemiological data that genuine bi- and homosexuality as natural variants of sexual orientation can be based – as well as transsexuality – on a gene- or environment-dependent variability of prenatal sex hormone concentrations.

__Prenatal exposure to testosterone and functional cerebral lateralization: a study in same-sex and opposite-sex twin girls__


In animals it has been shown that exposure to sex hormones is influenced by intrauterine position. Thus fetuses located between two male fetuses are exposed to higher levels of testosterone (T) than fetuses situated between two female fetuses or one female and one male fetus. In a group of opposite-sex (OS) twin girls and same-sex (SS) twin girls a potential effect of prenatal exposure to testosterone (T) on functional cerebral lateralization was investigated. We hypothesized that prenatal exposure to T would result in a more masculine, i.e. a more lateralized pattern of cerebral lateralization in OS twin girls than in SS twin girls. An auditory-verbal dichotic listening task (DLT) was used as an indirect method to study hemispheric specialization. Firstly, we established a sex difference on the DLT. Compared with SS girls, OS twin boys showed a more lateralized pattern of processing verbal stimuli. Secondly, as predicted OS girls had a more masculine pattern of cerebral lateralization, than SS girls. These findings support the notion of an influence of prenatal T on early brain organization in girls.

__Sexual differentiation of the brain and behavior__

During the intrauterine period the human brain develops in the male direction via direct action of a boy's testosterone, and in the female direction through the absence of this hormone in a girl. During this time, gender identity (the feeling of being a man or a woman), sexual orientation, and other behaviors are programmed. As sexual differentiation of the genitals takes places in the first 2 months of pregnancy, and sexual differentiation of the brain starts during the second half of pregnancy, these two processes may be influenced independently of each other, resulting in transsexuality. This also means that in the case of an ambiguous gender at birth, the degree of masculinization of the genitals may not reflect the same degree of masculinization of the brain. Differences in brain structures and brain functions have been found that are related to sexual orientation and gender.

__Prenatal testosterone and gender-related behaviour__

Testosterone plays an important role in mammalian brain development. In neural regions with appropriate receptors testosterone, or its metabolites, influences patterns of cell death and survival, neural connectivity and neurochemical characterization. Consequently, testosterone exposure during critical periods of early development produces permanent behavioural changes. In humans, affected behaviours include childhood play behaviour, sexual orientation, core gender identity and other characteristics that show sex differences (i.e. differ on average between males and females). These influences have been demonstrated primarily in individuals who experienced marked prenatal hormone abnormalities and associated ambiguities of genital development (e.g. congenital adrenal hyperplasia). However, there is also evidence that testosterone works within the normal range to make some individuals within each sex more sex-typical than others. The size of testosterone-related influences, and perhaps even their existence, varies from one sex-typed characteristic to another. For instance: prenatal exposure to high levels of testosterone has a substantial influence on sex-typical play behaviour, including sex-typed toy preferences, whereas influences on core gender identify and sexual orientation are less dramatic. In addition: there appears to be little or no influence of prenatal testosterone on mental rotations ability, although mental rotations ability shows a marked sex difference. These findings have implications for basic understanding of the role of testosterone in normative gender development, as well as for the clinical management of individuals with disorders of sex development (formerly called intersex syndromes).

&gt;As Ukraine accused Russia of a ""military invasion and occupation"" on Friday, the United States warned Russia that intervention in Ukraine would be a ""grave mistake."" Ukraine said Russian troops had taken up positions around a coast guard base and two airports on its strategic Crimean Peninsula. The Kremlin kept silent on the accusations, as the crisis deepened between two of Europe's largest countries.

&gt;The UN Security Council met Friday afternoon to discuss the crisis. Ukraine's UN Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev said he told the UNSC that Russian military helicopters and transport planes are entering his country, and that Russian armed forces seized Ukraine's main airport. He told reporters outside the council that neither major airport in Ukraine is under national control and that the main airport was ""captured by Russian armed forces."" He said 11 Russian military helicopters had been brought in along with M-24 military transport helicopter. Sergeyev said Russian ""groupies"" in Crimea are challenging Ukraine's national authority.",1432609092,1393653552,t1_cfrk7x3,False,False,2,t3_1z8ubc,,,leelasavage,,2,t5_2qh13,0,t3_1z8ubc,0,cfrk7x3,True,,worldnews,0

"&gt; Well that is a sweeping statement and generalisation based on nothing other than your own bias. I doubt you have even been to Russia or even out of your little bubble in the US.

Good job, you generalize myself and the US by saying we live in a ""bubble"", and you automatically assume that I haven't been anywhere except in the US. You're wrong, I've been outside the US and have been to many European countries. Although I have never been to Russia, my relatives and family members have lived under Soviet occupied countries, and they all have very negative views based on their own experiences. 

Yes, Russia is definitely not as restrictive as the USSR was, but it certainly is nothing to brag about. Russia is ranked as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, and has a pretty bad track record when it comes to human rights.

Now once again, before you start throwing around the usual ""US invaded country x, or US over threw government x"", I am not saying the US perfect, and the US has had its fair share of atrocities, and like *every* country in the world, the US has its fair share of flaws/problems. However, you'd have to be blind to not see that the US being the world superpower is a much safer, and stable option over other countries taking that spot.

And assuming you live in a country that's apart of the ""west"" (US, Canada, most of Europe etc...), the US being the ""world police"" or what ever you want to call it, gives you many more benefits over a country like China or Russia calling the shots on the world stage. Whether you like it or not, the US and most of Europe have very similar ideological, economic, and cultural interests in the world, and benefit from each other on the world stage.

This is not based on bias or being stuck in a ""bubble"" (even though that's not true in the first place. I have the same access to media/new sources that people in Europe do). This is just based on observation and fact.

"All of this is true except all of your fancy equipment is sitting in the UK and/or consists of a lot of naval equipment which is marginally useful in a land war in Eastern Europe.

Europe spends more than Russia but because you are all separate nations and your armys are fragmented and woefully unprepared for a large scale long term shooting war.  Britain and France didn't have enough munitions to take on Libya without dipping into US supplies. How long do you think your stocks will last against Russia?  Hell, France couldn't even even support its recent small scale operations in Mali with out US logistical support, do you think they'll be able to support a full Army half a continent away?  Please understand I have nothing but respect for the armed forces of Britain and France, you guys are probably the only European nations that have your shit put together enough to face down the Russians.  But it would be hard, really really hard.

The US still has a presence in Germany and most of Europe but does it have enough there?  Yes we could probably blunt a Russian advance but the Ukraine is practically Russia's front yard and is nearly at the end of large scale logistical capabilities for the US.  I predict Russia would go wild for at least 3 maybe 4 months before the US could get enough manpower and equipment there to turn the tide.  Until then it would be up to Poland, Germany and other Eastern block NATO countries to take them on and none of them have been in a full scale shooting war since WWII (and most of them lost that one... to the Russians).

"From a contemporary standpoint with contemporary ethics yes I can see how you would. 
I however am looking at it historically. Looking to where it shown through. A seed of freedom in a world prominently ruled by Monarchs and Emperors. In terms of radical ideas about freedom and liberty Colonial America is the kind of government that those European countries said was unrealistic.
Just as today a Libertarian society is viewed as unrealistic.

It was a monumental step, in my eyes akin to the Renaissances.
Because while the world isn't as free as i'd like it. It was America in part the started the chain of events that turned the world into a world of Democracies. Capitalism flourished in the freedom of the people and brought about the most prosperous and intellectually enlightening period in all of human history. 

America is the big shining example of what freedom can do to society. And.....what destroying that freedom does to it as well. Hell if it weren't for Colonial America there is a good chance me and you wouldnt be able to argue from hundrends of miles away in real time.

- Figures collected by the Vote Watch website indicate that Britain is losing more votes in the European Council than at any point in recent history.

- In the end, Britain did join the European Economic Community but only in 1973, 15 years after the Treaty of Rome was signed.

- A new approach is desperately needed if Britain and Europe are to get out of their current predicament.

- But once it found its way to Belgium, Britain had an uncanny knack of winning the big strategic battles.

"With their entire cotton, rice, and tobacco supply (much more important back then) being threatened as well as their ability to export due to lowered port traffic, I can see why someone might justify it. Much of the Northern economy was built on industrial byproducts of Southern agriculture. The South depended on them as a customer and the North shifted their economy to industry. Fortunes would have been lost, people would have starved. The North only had 3 major ports at the time: Boston, Philly and New York. None of them were anywhere close to agriculture, at least not compared to the South. They had no Augusta cotton market, no ports of Savannah and Charleston to import sugar and export cotton. If the South had the ability to export to Europe it would have absolutely destroyed the Northern economy, no questions asked. The blockade by the federal government saved the United States of America.

"The politics of Crimea are very different from the US historically. Crimea was already mostly autonomous even before the civil war. It also shares its border with Russia. They are not on the other side of an ocean like the UK was to America. By land Crimea is not even that much more connected to the rest of Ukraine than it is to Russia.

The land of Crimea doesn't seem to be worth much. It doesn't have much in natural resources compared to the rest of the country. Its what the people of Crimea built on the land that makes it valuable. It has seaport tourism and Europe's largest solar park. But it doesn't have anything that Ukraine can't re-produce elsewhere. 

Regardless I truly believe a vote and respect of the vote is the most peaceful way forward. The alternative is possible civil war or a humanitarian crises if the people of crimea started moving en masse to russia. 

The philosophy of self-determination only became popular after WWI. So its hard to make it apply to US history and politics both past and present because since any hope for autonomy for individual states had died a half century earlier.

"Obama's response is by no means effective. I think when he says ""international community"" he really means UK, as the other western actor in this treaty. He also mentioned that Biden had spoken to the PM of Ukraine, and I would hope they are working on a more adequate response to the situation.

The situation is tricky in many perspectives. Russia has no right to be in Ukraine, so technically, Ukraine has the right to deploy its military. However, doing so would be an act of ""provocation"" from Russian POV and would give them a reason to retaliate. The Ukrainian military is by no means a match for Russia's. This is why the Ukrainian PM has not authorized any action thus far. However, Ukraine can't get out of this without direct action by the USA and UK. As I said, the military is no match, and the new government and divided country are too unstable. Crimean residents in favor of EU integration might take matters into their own hands and start a full out war. And if, on the other hand, Crimea is annexed by Russia, then that might not be the end of it -- other ""Russo-Ukrainian"" cities will be next. And on to other former Soviet Republics. Once Putin starts, he won't stop. 

So, to answer your question, Obama's threat is not effective, but it is still a response. Obama didn't announce to the world that he authorized the killing of Osama bin Laden as the events were taking place; he did so after bin Laden was killed. His response needs to be a surprise for the Russians, and I hope his goal with this initial response is to stall. As an avid Obama supporter (at least for now), I hope this is one of many responses and he, along with the UK, actually does something concrete within the next few days.

The best analogy for Adro is Switzerland. The Nine is like Europe. Fatrasta is a distant colonized continent which has just rebelled against Kez, much like the US from England.

From Adro they have to cross over Deliv, Novi, or Kez to reach the ocean (through Deliv is the closest).

"That's absurd simply on the face of it. Adolf Hitler's entire regime was supported by warfare. *His ideology* rested on warfare, and ""lebensraum"" in eastern Europe, which required the deportation or extermination of the people already living in those areas. To sustain his war, he needed Russian and Ukrainian oil, and so there was Operation Barbarossa. 

Putin supported South Ossetians in the 2008 Georgian conflict, which was limited, measured, and ended with the speedy withdrawal of troops. For all of **two months** after the Georgians called for withdrawal at the end of hostilities, the Russians occupied territory. And then they left. Sounds *totally* like Hitler.

What exactly do you think these troop movements did? Roll through Kiev on the way to the Crimean Peninsula? They took place within the Crimean Peninsula and near certain airports in the east, where Russia maintains substantial popular support.

Crimea's referendum in 1992, which was very close, and it nearly became an autonomous region, has little bearing today, when the population there welcomes Russian intervention.

Putin is acting both within Russia's *legitimate* national interest, in preventing a destabilizing civil war on its border, and in the interest of eastern Ukrainians, who welcome the Russian military's protection from the violence taking place in the country.

Otherwise you could probably quite easily find a pair of bracers with ""fire skills do x% more damage"" or ""poison skills do x% more damage"" which could give you higher effective dps.

What would the cost be of such a car?  There are intellectual property rights, engineering, management, banking, marketing costs, so what should the price be?  Wall Street isn't aggressive, its passive.  They don't set prices, it tries to predict them, and whoever guesses closest (or does their homework) wins.  And you, the inventor/entrepreneur are paid accordingly.

What you're struggling with is the belief in the power of Government coupled with the condition of the world.  You believe that Wall Street is as dictatorial as Government and does nothing but reap benefits from manipulating the free market.

If you believe in evolution you understand the harsh reality of survival.  People lose their jobs, start-ups fail, companies go out of business, corporations lay off thousands of people at a time, and enormous employers like Circuit City and Blockbuster go bankrupt.  

That's the cycle of life in the private sector.  Waste is discarded and new life grows, like Amazon and Netflix.  And that reality reaches all the way to the top.  Lehman Brothers was a 651 **BILLION** dollar bankruptcy.  Bang, gone, overnight.

Name one teacher's union that has ever gone out of business.  Name a single Federal Government Agency that has ever shrank and disappeared anywhere close to the turnover that happens in the private sector.  You can't.  Government only expands, it never contracts.  It is permanent.  

And think about it, somehow, some way, some economist, who was probably paid in tax dollars, has convinced you that futures trading is a bad thing.  Guess where the money to pay that professor's pension comes from.

"Extremely hard. I'm a contractor for railroads, so I can speak to this. 

To keep it short: proper high speed rail like you're probably thinking (ie - bullet trains) would require completely new rail, as those trains can't run on the existing freight mainline. You're talking millions of dollars just to build that in Jax. 

So what about upgrading the existing rail and having moderately high speed rail, say 100-150 MPH? That would still cost millions of dollars, but more importantly, would totally disrupt the local freight railroads.

See, the US ships something like 50% of our freight via rail, while all of Europe combined only does around 7%. We're the only country in the world that does freight rail efficiently and at a profit (simplifying it here.) You start putting passenger on top of the existing freight service, and you completely destroy the freight system by slowing it to a halt.

So basically...you want high speed, you have to shell out millions to build a new system. Florida East Coast Railway is upgrading their mainline to allow high speed (only 80 MPH or so) between Miami and Orlando. To do that will cost them $1 billion dollars - see All Aboard Florida. 

And an another point...CSX does NOT own all of the rail in the city. FEC has mainline that runs from roughly downtown south, all the way down to Miami. NS has a mainline that comes in and branches off around downtown. Talleyrand Terminal is a class III off of Talleyrand Ave. First Coast Railroad is out at Fernandina Beach. CSX is the big one, but not the only one. And again...it's freight line, not passenger.

"The focus on European characters and culture. 

The first game was great for this. The conflict and setting simply served as backdrops: the main character was detached from the conflict and didn't care about the sides. There was also a nice balance of the political views on both sides, you can get a tangible sense of this clash of cultures and religions. That all ended sometime around ACR. We had such a great opportunity to explore culture shock with distinctly European Ezio being thrust into an exotic place. But nope, Ezio adapts to a brand new city within minutes, and on top of that he conveniently meets another Italian woman so he never has to experience culture shock. 

As for ACIII, it should've been much more overt about the cultural destruction and genocide that was occurring. When your main character is Mohawk, I expect him to really reflect a side of history that is rarely told. The developers really tried to get Connor's uncertainty of the Americans across, but he always seems to conveniently end up at every major battle of the Revolution, and on top of that he was going out of his way to win battles for the Americans. The thought that the Americans were demonstrably no different from the British was rarely communicated, despite the major plot twist with Washington, and the ending of the game hinging upon this idea. I guess that was perhaps the aim, showing the players that the major forces at play during the American Revolution didn't give two shits about what the Native Americans wanted, but the execution of this was just so...flawed",1432609763,1393659563,t1_cfrlnab,False,False,16,t3_1z8g7h,,,Parabellum25,,16,t5_2s6v6,0,t3_1z8g7h,0,cfrlnab,True,ps4,assassinscreed,0

"You've missed the point entirely.

No one differentiates ""white"" Americans according to their heritage or what country they immigrated from (all those many years ago) because ""white"" people are just assumed to be... Americans.

When you're a hyphenated American there is an immediate association with another part of the world that no ""white"" American has really experienced.

Now, this is just a function of time. I know that when other northern Europeans were immigrating, those already established through English colonialism formed the majority and they definitely were racist with their Irish or Italian or Norwegian counterparts. Over time, newer immigrants came along and now those more established and ""white"" Americans took it upon themselves to have the shit flow down to the Hispanic and Asian immigrants.

This is happening now with the influx of Arabian &amp; Indian immigration currently happening with a lot of racist things being thrown around by Hispanic, African, Asian &amp; ""white"" Americans.

BTW, I write ""white"" Americans because I can tell the difference between someone from London or Dublin or someone from Oslo. I'm just lumping you all in to a generic label so we can all be equal.

Luckily we have people like ""GayLubeOil"" anonymously posting politically incorrect but nevertheless factual comments on the internet. He makes some pretty compelling arguments, and does impressively well when it comes to not generalizing or stereotyping. Some examples:

&gt;Women are more selective about sex then men. That's why gay dudes have way more sex than straight dudes.

and

&gt;Lol Lesbians have some of the worst relationships ever. Having two women in the house who never compromise on anything or take the high road is a recipe for disaster. Gay marriage is going to do way better than lesbian marriage.

and

&gt;This sounds like a cesspool of STD's, especially AIDS since there are homosexual men involved. [In response to someone merely mentioning that he has two bisexual roommates, mind you]

and

&gt;Does she do barbell and dumbbell squats with a substantial weight or does she pump five pound weights in the air like most women? Wouldn't be supervised [sic] if she thinks barbells are too phalic and only uses medicine balls.

and

&gt;Feminists don't debate, they label. Which brings me to my next point women are terrible at intellectual debate.

and

&gt;Women always talk about suicide because what happens afterwords is that everyone rushes in to protect her and she gets validation.

and

&gt;Well if I was going for african tribal women I would have to jump over cattle.

and, as if that racism was too subtle, let's follow it up with this:

&gt;As a white guy one of the most fun things to do with Asian girls is to troll them by intentionally confusing them with other Asians. The other fun thing to do is to shame Koreans/Philippenas for looking at dogs. Hey I know your hungry but you dont need to be looking at dogs like that.

And how anyone could read this description of himself and not be immediately smitten is beyond me:

&gt;I consider myself in the top 10% in looks. Im in unnatural great shape and European. Which is to say foreign enough to be interesting, but tall and white enough to have access to all kinds of women....

And after uttering such seductive things:

&gt;Our love will be consensual and real. Our bodies will collide and join in to one. After getting vigorously pumped by the king of Alphas, only our love will feel real. Everything else will feel like a meaningless joke.

"I've never heard of it referred to as ""Donair"" but it seems like he's talking about döner kebabs, which are really similar to gyros and shawarma. Döner is Turkish, gyros are Greek, and shawarma comes from the Arab world. They differ in spices/ingredients depending on where you get it but they're all fairly similar - pita, meat, and usually some vegetables (onions, lettuce, tomato) and some kind of sauce. Coming from California, I feel like it's the European version of Mexican food - you can buy them from a cart/truck, they're both relatively cheap, and they're kinda bad for you but fucking amazing when you're drunk.

There's one kebab place in the town where I did my undergrad, but I had the pleasure of sampling a lot of kebab when I lived in Copenhagen and traveled around western Europe. In my experience it's like 90% meat in Copenhagen, in Berlin it's a good mix of meat, fried vegetables, and fried potato, and it's kinda meh in Paris. 

There are kebab places wherever there is a sizable Arab or Turkish immigrant population, which is most major European cities, especially in north and western Europe. Ugh fuck, this whole post is reminding me of this cart Ørestad Kebab that was always set up right outside my main metro station in Copenhagen... they had 15 DKK (U$2.78) kebabs and it was basically just a wad of greasy shaved beef(?) with a tiny bit of lettuce, some raw red onion, a chili sauce and a yogurt sauce.

"Which is why you specialize! 

No one person is *the* expert in all of history. Not even in European history. Or British history, per say. 

In fact, one can find as many fields, and even more I may say, as science as a whole. But the difference is that while history isn't out to solve problems like the airspeed velocity of a laden swallow, it does attempt to answer the question of why the swallow was out, who put it out, and for what reason.

You gain a better understanding of people as a whole from this. Science is all numbers and what not. This is good, but going on to apply this to things like human intentions and circumstances is both futile and out of its field. 

I'd say, find a book that explores the occupation of South Africa during the Boer Wars. You can find a lot of interesting details on the matter. As a rule, I'd stay away from books that explore the entire history of countries and places, since the context tends to get muddled in the process.

"So you're saying that the reason Americans don't have passports is not their lack of vacation time (either in general or as large blocks), but instead American's complete disinterest for learning about and experiencing any other culture but their own?     

I find this explanation very hard to believe. Many Americans seem to be borderline obsessed with where their ancestors originated from, and many want to go visit [Ireland, Scotland, England, Spain, France, etc] to further that. I've had tons of conversations with Americans which essentially boil down to ""I'd love to visit Europe.""      

The two most cited reasons in my anecdotal experience is either lack of money or lack of vacation time. They get several ""long weekends"" off a year, and they will travel inter-US on those holidays to visit family, to travel further afield where the flight alone is going to be $1K+ in economy, you need at least ten days worth of holiday out of it.        

I guess what our perspectives boil down to is: You have a lower opinion of Americans than I do.

It was also a strategic move in regards to the fear of Communism by the US during the close of WWII.

But largely, computers were in the hands of relatively few people, they cost quite a bit, and weren't all networked together all the time via the internet. This was a less fertile landscape for malware than we've known since.

The internet was a factor that encouraged things to evolve, but even in the mid to late 90s, it wasn't terribly bad. an antivirus was a pretty important thing to have, but not everybody did. Firewalls weren't terribly common back in the days of dialup either. The high degree of interconnectedness and the low threshhold of security was fertile ground for malicious software, but it remained largely the domain of people doing it out of joy for the misfortune of others, desire to prove themselves (both to themselves and to others) and just because they could.

Somewhere along the line, it caught the eye of people who decded to monetize it. I remember in my later days of college, right around the time I went into business fixing computers, ""Browser Hijackers"" were all the rage, taking over your browsing experience and inserting ads into every image that tried to load. Real Subtle.

In a way, both the software designed to fight malware, and the malware itsself behave remarkably similarly to biological systems. If your immune system is never exposed to threats, it never develops the ability to respond to those threats. In response to immune systems and modern medicine, the diseases that threaten us become more complex. I have tools designed to fight certain types of malware, intended for use on Windows XP, that never got updated to work with Vista and 7, because some of the threats they were intended to fight have changed near completely. 

There's a concept known as Herd Immunity, where if 90% of a population is vaccinated against something, the remaining 10% are generally safe, because there's not a very large reservoir of that disease from which it can infect those 10%. So it goes with Free Antivirus Products. Its harder for some of the traditional viruses to exist today, because antivirus software is both effective and plentiful. It may not stop attacks immediately, but it forces the attacks to keep evolving in order to have any impact.

In the same way, you can think of the resources that go into creating malware as part of a natural system. the presence of for-profit malware displaces the not-for-profit malware. Who's going to write a virus to prank someone when they can use the same skills to make money? 

For awhile, everything was trending towards ""Scareware"" infections that claimed to be a utility program telling you you had 600 viruses, or that your harddrive was failing, but if you paid $50 for the full version, they'd fix it. The funny thing about that was that thanks to the above factors, we weren't really seeing systems with 600 different viruses on them (8-12 was more common even at the peak of the ""teenager houseparty"" era of virsues) because the scareware had displaced them from that ecological niche. Much like a ecological system, though, homogeneity was the downfall of this first generation scareware. Pretty much everybody was using the same credit card processor for it, and when that avenue got shut down and nobody was making money, the scareware evaporated over night. I went from 10 infections a week for most of the year prior to that shutdown, to 10 infections in the entire year following.

Since then, they've gotten worse about it. Instead of claiming you have 600 viruses, or a dying harddrive, and scamming you for $50, they claim to be with the FBI or DOJ and ask for $200, or $300, or even in one case, 300 Euros. (Yes, the ""american FBI"" was supposedly asking for *euros*) OR they encrypt your drive and hold you for ransom. At the other end of the scale, there's Rootkits and state-sponsored malware whose jobs are to stay as stealthy as possible and serve as a secret minion of the software's originator. It can be very stealthy at times, and sometimes the only way it gets noticed is that something gets broken by it, or your ISP detects malicious traffic.

TL;DR: Viruses are remarkably like living things, and evolved due to pressures on them. Also, Organized Crime, especially in eastern europe, discovered there was money in these computer things.",1432610389,1393666132,t1_cfrmtzu,False,False,3,t3_1z8wtz,,,[deleted],,3,t5_2qh1i,0,t3_1z8wtz,0,cfrmtzu,True,,AskReddit,0

"I think the entire world is becoming less religious, more humanitarian, less nationalistic, and more accepting of differences. The normalization of Europe from 1930 to 2000 is indicative of what will happen globally. The idea that countries could fight will seem strange.

Early death in the 3rd world will plummet as disease prevention and famine become largely solved problems. These changes will trigger profound social changes for the better in those countries (political accountability, educational attainment, the position of women).

The world will grow ever more meritocratic. Gone will be the idea that you are automatically well-off if you are born in the US or Europe, or without opportunity if you are born in Africa. Everyone will have access to the important knowledge of mankind, and it will be within everyone's grasp to succeed or fail. This growing meritocracy will put profound social stress on the developed countries.

National identities will weaken, and increasingly be thought of like city or state governments are today: Providing local services (education, infrastructure, legal administration, etc.) in exchange for taxes. Few will be willing to die for their country. Expectations of transparency and accountability for local administrators and service providers (police, educators, ...) will grow due to ubiquitous monitoring and communication. Corrupt or dishonest people will have no place to hide.

As national identities weaken, non-geographically defined groups will continue to grow in power. Both positive (internet communities) and negative (terrorist organizations). Much of the social affinity that people once held for their race or country will transfer onto these affiliations.

Acceptance of LGBT rights will become universal, Uganda notwithstanding.

Animal rights and environmental protection will continue to advance quickly. That said, CO2 emission will continue unabated and the world will gradually warm. There will be no crisis and the world will cope.

Marriage will become seen as optional, and distinct from having children or cohabitating.

EDIT:
In the developed world, boredom will come to be an increasing problem. Every book, magazine, movie, song, TV show, videogame, web site, and Wikipedia entry will be instantly available to anyone -- and we will rapidly become bored. Our physical and cultural worlds will be charted to the centimeter. No unexplored areas will remain, and the feeling of serendipitous discovery and true novelty will become ever more elusive.

In response to boredom, some people will turn outward to the frontiers. Science, engineering, and the arts will flourish. These people will alleviate boredom through acts of discovery, invention, and creativity. These creative endeavors will be pursued by vastly more people do than today.

The media and tourism industries will flourish in response to the demand for new experiences. Movies, games, pornography will become ever more diverse and intense. Novelty will be the coin of the realm. Adventure sports like climbing, mountaineering, diving and so on will explode as people seek out vital experiences and genuine risk.

Increasing numbers of people will habitually seek out novelty in a downward spiral. They will become addicted to porn, or videogames, or drugs, or the web as they search for nuggets of novelty and genuinely new experience.

"&gt; The black people that were brought to America were intended to be slaves though.

So were the Irish and English and Germans. The only difference was the term 'indentured servant' vs 'slave', but it was the same thing. White people were brought over to become slaves just as black people were. Here's the difference: The white people knew the language of the white people. The Africans were of an entirely different culture. White people were 'indentured' which meant they sort of agreed to the terms of a contract, but the reality of the situation was awful and often deadly, and the the wealthy Masters didn't generally honor the terms of the contract. They knew the language but they had no power over it. With Africans who didn't know the language, they were just taken without the bullshit promises.

And [Africans sold their own people as slaves](http://africa.unc.edu/outreach/ASA/slavery_and_trade.pdf). And Africans were already slaves in their own country, so selling ""human resources"" to someone else wasn't too odd.

Sign of the times.

Slavery was the norm back then. It's how the world worked. People were animals. We've evolved quite a bit, but before industry and science, we were savages. It was normal for certain classes of people to be considered animals or property.

&gt; Poor people in America weren't property.

Hell, women, of any race, were considered property at that time. In the US, 1920 was the year women were finally considered human enough to vote. I have a grandmother who was 11 when that happened, just to add perspective. Women were property. A father used to have to give a man livestock and money to accept ownership, as a husband, of his daughter. Shit was fucked up. We were savages.

And poor people absolutely were property. Indentured servitude. Look it up.

&gt; It didn't matter if they had money or the ability to make money because they had no rights.

Here's where people just fail to get it. The economy that exists today didn't exist then. The wealthy ruled. It took Lincoln and the Civil War to create a national economy. There was a time when each state had it's own currency. And you couldn't just apply for a job and work and get money. Wealth was for the wealthy. Only the wealthy had money. You had to own shit to have money. The money you had was based on the property you owned/claimed, the number of people you owned, the products your slaves produced and so on.  There was a time that you couldn't clock into a job and get money. If you had the power to make people build a castle for you, that was wealth. And the wealthy didn't give people money to do it. They had slaves. It's just how it was. No one needs to cry about it.

&gt; The black people that were brought to America were intended to be slaves though.

And so were the Slavic people brought to Northern Europe. And the Irish and Germans and other white people who were brought to America.

&gt;  It didn't matter if they had money or the ability to make money because they had no rights.

They were slaves in their own countries. The point is that this was a social norm at the time. It doesn't make it right, but everyone was already doing it for thousands of years.

An interesting thing to look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_slavery_timeline

Times were different. We, as the human race, have evolved morally and technologically a lot. I'm sure 150 years from now people will look back and find something to call us savages over.
 


Edit: And this is a good read, too. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery

I just can't stand the way the history of slavery in the US is taught as a one sided and racist anomaly. Slavery is a reality of humanity where the powerful exploit the weak. It still happens. And the black/African slavery in American has been done with for 150 years+ and their history as slaves is nothing at all in the big picture. In the past, if you were poor, you were probably a slave. And there was no 'first world' shit then, so most people didn't have a pot to piss in.

"Peut-être que la première bonne chose à faire ce serait d'écouter ceux qui disent depuis des années qu'en effet, vous êtes des abrutis à faire confiance à des technos qui sont optimisées pour la surveillance de masse. 

Le grand public semble le découvrir, mais ça fait des années si ce n'est des décennies que les experts en sécurité **crient** que vous bradez votre vie privée.

Oui, je suis aigri. Des années à me balader entre le parti pirate, l'open source, les hackerspace et à constater l'indifférence du grand public sur ces problèmes de sécurité nationale et de droits de l'homme ont eu cet effet, alors désolé, et bienvenue quand même, mais tu prendras un peu pour les autres :-)

&gt; Alors, qu'est ce qu'on fait? C'est foutu? La vie privée n'existe plus? 

Déjà, non. La NSA n'est pas Dieu, Google n'est pas surpuissant. A moins que l'affaire Snowden soit une opération d'intox des US (ce que je n'exclue franchement pas, vu l'inutilité de ses révélations) elle montre que la NSA a un amateurisme assez incroyable. Donc tout ce qui est possible, ils l'ont tenté mais ils ne l'ont pas forcément réussi.

Google a énormément d'infos mais, pour l'instant, agit d'une façon plutôt éthique, car ils savent que leur valeur tient énormément à leur réputation. Je peux me tromper, mais je pense que tant que Serge Brin pourra peser dans les décisions de Google, c'est une entreprise qui restera un minimum éthique. Quand il sera parti, c'est une autre histoire, mais ça nous laisse quelques années.

&gt; Sur quel(s) terrains faut il mener un combat, et cela en vaut il la peine? Quels sont les solutions alternatives?

Il y a typiquement deux réponses, deux terrains. Le terrain technique, et le terrain politique. Personnellement je les pense complémentaires, je ne pense pas qu'on puisse gagner avec un seul de ces deux tableaux. 

Techniquement, aujourd'hui, les défenseurs de la vie privée sont au point. Pour les choses essentielles, comme échanger des infos ou des fichiers, aller lire des articles ou même des vidéos sur le net de façon anonyme, les solutions existent, on connait leurs risques et leurs possibilités, les outils sont assez bons et gratuits. Et, bonus: ils sont encore légaux.

Ce qui nous amène au deuxième terrain. Politiquement, on pourrait tout à fait voire les solutions techniques devenir illégales. Il n'y a encore pas si longtemps il fallait une autorisation de la DGA pour utiliser des algos de crypto solides. HADOPI criminalise (en théorie) les passerelles TOR. La Chine a montré que même quand des solutions techniques existent, on peut leur faire la guerre.

A mon sens, la solution passe par une approche double:

- Techniquement, l'utilisation, dés que c'est possible, de techniques qui rendent très difficiles voire impossibles la censure et l'espionnage.

- Politiquement, la transparence à tous les étages sauf excellente raison et un appui (au lieu de la méfiance actuelle) envers les technos sus-mentionnées.

Il n'y a pas à se demander si il vaut mieux rendre l'espionnage des citoyens illégal ou techniquement difficile. Il faut faire les deux. La loi doit l'interdire et violer la loi doit être dur. 

Si tu n'es pas sur de quoi faire techniquement, va au hackerspace le plus proche de chez toi, et ils devraient te donner des pistes:
http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/France

Si tu n'es pas sur de quoi faire politiquement, rejoins un groupe politique qui considère ça important. A une époque j'aurais recommandé le parti pirate, mais aujourd'hui je n'en suis plus si sur. Dans le doute, la Quadrature du Net est un lobby citoyen qui fait un excellent travail en France et en Europe. Aux US, l'EFF a également un rôle très positif.

"They're a food quality health concern if food is badly contaminated.

Major coffee producers will respond to inquiries about mycotoxin levels since they're tested regularly.

For some science, see [Mycotoxins: Occurrence, toxicology, and exposure assessment](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691513005024) for a good review, which includes a decent non-exhaustive list of types, toxicity and some monitoring information for their occurrence. 

The review shows their presence in nuts, dried food, cereals, spices, baby foods, coffee, beer, wine, cocoa, meat, pasta, bread, vegetable oil, juice, cider.  Pretty damn near unavoidable, but it looks like lesser developed countries have higher amounts of contamination.

As for harm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified different Mycotoxins into the following classes:

* 1	The mycotoxin is carcinogenic to humans	AFs  (Aflatoxins)

* 2A	The mycotoxin is probably carcinogenic to humans	–

* 2B	The mycotoxin is possibly carcinogenic to humans	AFM1, FBs, OTA, sterigmatocystin

* 3	The mycotoxin is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans	DON, NIV, PAT, T-2/HT-2, ZEN, citrinin, fusarenon-X

* 4	The mycotoxin is probably not carcinogenic to humans	

Some excerpts from the review:

&gt; Toxicity of AFs must be distinguished between acute and chronic. Currently, there is very low incidence of acute AF toxicity in humans. Acute poisoning occurs when the food is contaminated with high concentrations of AFs. This occurs sporadically in developing countries, as happened during the severe acute human aflatoxicosis outbreak in Kenya in 2004, where 317 cases and 125 deaths (39.4% mortality) were reported (Lewis et al., 2005 and Probst et al., 2007). In this case, corn for human consumption was contaminated with AFs levels ranging from 20 to 8000 μg/kg. Acute human poisoning is characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, pulmonary or cerebral oedema, necrosis, and fatty liver. Other symptoms include anorexia, depression, jaundice, diarrhoea, and photosensitivity. Occurrence of acute aflatoxicosis in animals is more common, as highly contaminated feed is more frequent and susceptibility of livestock species varies.

&gt; In human beings, chronic consumption of AF-contaminated foods has been linked to various diseases:

&gt; Liver cancer. There is evidence that hepatitis B and/or C viruses and AFs act synergistically in the aetiology of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Palliyaguru and Wu, in press and Wu and Santella, 2012). Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Middle and Western Africa are regions of high HCC incidence. Geographic variations in HCC incidence might be due to geographic differences in the prevalence of various etiological factors, particularly chronic infection with hepatitis viruses, and dietary exposure to AFs.

&gt; Effects on the reproductive system. AFs exert negative reproductive effects in human males, causing delayed testicular development, testicular degeneration, decreased reproductive potential, morphological changes, reduced size and weight of the testes, meiotic index decrease, decline in the percentage of live sperm, sperm with increased abnormalities, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium, and reduced plasma concentration of testosterone, among others (CAST, 2003).

&gt; Effects on the immune system. AFs act as immunomodulators, causing a decrease in resistance to secondary infections by fungi, bacteria, and parasites. The cellular response is particularly sensitive to AFs, as evidenced by decreased T or B lymphocyte activity, impaired macrophage/neutrophil effector functions, modified synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, suppressed NK cell-mediated cytolysis, induced reactivation of chronic infection, decreased immunity to vaccination, and impaired immune function in developing animals (Jiang et al., 2008).

&gt; Encephalopathy with fatty degeneration of viscera, resembling Reye’s syndrome (Dvorácková et al., 1977). The role of AFs in the development of Reye’s syndrome, which produces fatty degeneration, pale and enlarged liver and kidneys, oedema and stroke has never been unequivocally proved, despite the frequent detection of AFs in the liver of children who have died of this disease and, therefore, is still under discussion.

&gt; Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. In this case, a possible occupational risk of AF exposure via the respiratory tract is suggested (Dvorácková and Píchová, 1986).


On Ochratoxin A:

&gt; Regarding OTA, to date there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans, but there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals. Therefore, OTA has been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) (IARC, 1993). The latest provisional tolerable daily intakes (PTDIs) of this toxin set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2006a) and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 2007) were 17 and 14 ng/kg bw/day, respectively.

&gt; The kidney is the major target organ for OTA, recognized as a potent nephrotoxin. In humans, OTA has been identified as the causative agent of nephropathies, often related with urothelial cancer of the upper urinary tract. In animals, OTA intake has also been correlated with an increase in the incidence of testicular cancer. Furthermore, OTA is recognized as teratogenic, genotoxic, carcinogenic, and immunotoxic, but its neurotoxic effect remains unconfirmed.


&gt; Chronic effects of OTA are of more concern. In animals, it has been shown that after a prolonged OTA intake, a nephropathy linked to the degeneration of the convoluted tubule of the nephron and renal interstitial fibrosis occurs, followed by a decrease in the thickness of the basal membrane and glomerular hyalinization. Renal lesions observed in birds, pigs, and rodents are very similar. In humans, OTA has been associated with a kidney disease typical of the Balkans, the so-called Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN), mainly present in rural areas of countries like Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria (Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al., 2002). 

&gt; Besides renal symptoms, OTA may affect other body systems. It can cross the placenta and has been found to be embryotoxic in rats and mice. animal studies have shown that OTA is immunotoxic; the immunosuppressant activity of OTA in animals is characterized by size reduction of the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, depression of antibody responses, changes in immune cells number and function, and modulation of cytokine production. Besides, it has been shown that OTA is associated with cerebellar, hippocampal, and other adverse neurological effects. Finally, OTA has been found in breast milk, which could represent a significant source of exposure for infants (Hope and Hope, 2012).

On  Fumonisins

&gt; Acute and chronic toxicity by FBs has been largely demonstrated in several animal species, including carcinogenicity and cardiovascular toxic effects (Gelderblom et al., 1988 and Gelderblom et al., 1991). FB1 is a cancer promoter, but a poor cancer initiator.

&gt; Currently, there is no direct evidence that FBs cause adverse health effects to humans. Available studies have only shown inconclusive associations between FBs and human cancer. Thus, human exposure to FBs has been associated with oesophageal cancer in South Africa (Sydenham et al., 1990) and liver cancer in China (Yoshizawa et al., 1994).

&gt; FBs have also been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in the Mexico–Texas border (Missmer et al., 2006). In this case, FBs exposure increased NTDs risk, proportionate to dose, up to a threshold level, at which point foetal death may be more likely to occur. Interestingly, administration of folate may reverse the FBs toxic effect. Thus, FBs-contaminated corn represents a potential risk for human NTD occurrence, especially in populations with inadequate folate intake who rely on corn-based foods (Suarez et al., 2012).

This is getting a bit long, and there are a few others the review mentions: **Zearalenone** -- some remarks about breast cancer.  **Trichothecenes (T-2/HT-2, DON)** - pneumonia and lung bleeding often followed by death.  ** Patulin** - gastrointestinal ulcers, haemorrhages, kidney damage.

I really recommend reading the rest of the review if interested in more details.

What gives me some hope is that the amount of detected mycotoxins seem to be decreasing in developed places, such as the EU, but as the review notes there is more work to do to determine combined exposures from food stuffs that are under individual limits and effects of chronic exposure.",1432610712,1393670797,t1_cfrnioc,False,1425762756,3,t3_1z7rcn,,,shrillthrill,,3,t5_2qhn7,0,t3_1z7rcn,0,cfrnioc,True,,biology,0

"Russia would lose a conventional war with the US really quickly. All their troops are poorly trained conscripts with aging equipment. Pilots with low flight time and aging equipment.

When the Russians invaded Georgia we shut off the GPS. The Russians had no GPS for their bombs. Their communications were complete garbage. Air force pilots had to be called from retirement. The main highway was littered with broken down Russian tanks.

&gt;Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide a hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone, as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions (imported from Europe at considerable cost) for hunting.  As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands. Sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the Force Publique, sometimes by the villages themselves. There were even small wars where villages attacked neighbouring villages to gather hands, since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill.

&gt;One junior white officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested. The white officer in command 'ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades ... and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross.'  After seeing a Congolese person killed for the first time, a Danish missionary wrote: 'The soldier said ""Don't take this to heart so much. They kill us if we don't bring the rubber. The Commissioner has promised us if we have plenty of hands he will shorten our service.""'  In Forbath's words:

&gt;When he returned to Germany, Schmeling was now shunned by the Nazis. He managed to win both the German and European heavyweight championships on the same night, with a first round knockout of Adolf Heuser. During the Nazi purge of Jews from Berlin, he personally saved the lives of two Jewish children by hiding them in his apartment. It was not the first time that Max defied the Nazi regime's hatred for Jews. As the story goes, Hitler let it be known through the Reich Ministry of Sports that he was very displeased at Max's relationship with Joe Jacobs, his Jewish fight promoter and wanted it terminated, but Max courageously refused to bow even to Hitler. During the war, Schmeling participated in the 1941 [Battle of Crete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete), where he was wounded and after recovery was dismissed from active service. He later visited American P.O.W. camps and occasionally tried to help conditions for the prisoners. After the war, strapped for money, he embarked upon a moderately successful comeback in boxing, winning three of his five bouts with two-point defeats before re-entering retirement in 1948. Had his own statues in Hollenstedt.

"The social aspect of the story in my opinion is negligible, its just for the resources, most gas and oil that goes in western Europe passes comes through the Ukraine from Russia. 

Russia can and probably does consider that the piping that passes over Russian controller territory is worth more because they had to do the infrastructure themselves, and will charge a lot more for the 1000-2000-5000km's of piping and materials management of gas lines passing through Ukraine and makes a decent buck out of it. So its in their best interest to keep the money and also show dominance by still holding an iron grip over a russian speaking country. 

On the other hand Europe is interested in making the EU bigger and specifically for Russia to 'manage' the resources passing through that country, remember, Ukraine is a pretty big part of Europe, so if they'd control that area too, they would get resources cheaper and pay less to Russia. 

Don't kid yourself about the social aspect of 'democracy' or some shit, its like 1000 years ago, he who controls more territory and resources has the upper hand, the only difference is that its on TV.

In that same paragraph talking about the heroes and villains you might also mention the Central Banks of various nations issuing their warnings and proclamations, and exerting their power to write a nations laws.

You sound inspired and willing to explore and express this new paradigm so here's some food for thought for a future article.

Consider how the mathematical and scientific development of units of measurement have changed our society.

For measuring distance we've progressed from cubits, which measure the length of a persons forearm, to using a standardised piece of iridium or tungsten. In 1983 the international community adopted a standard unit of measurement for the metre as the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a fraction (1/299 792 458^ths) of a second. Twenty years later this mathematical precision enabled us to send a buggy to *another planet*, and to know where it would land.

The reliable measurement of time has it's own fascinating story which had a profound historical influence in navigation and cartography using astronomy. Today the time stamp of a satellite has to be calibrated to allow for it's high speed relativistic movement across the heavens in comparison to our time here on Earth.

Now here's Cryptocurrency. It's a mathematically proven unit of measurement of value, that isn't subject to external forces. It will always be known exactly how many bitcoins there are in existence, emerging from a protocol that is unilaterally accepted by those that adopt it.

There was a reference on /r/bitcoin to the scepticism that Marco Polo faced when he introduced paper currency to the court of Venice. Bitcoin has some similarities, as it also takes some serious mental gymnastics to get your head around.

I see the volatility in price as a measure of adoption and acceptance. It's not a measure of the number of bitcoin, but a measure of the acceptance of the protocol and the interaction with the economy.

Meanwhile bitcoins are working their way into the consciousness and economies all over the world. Not just the US, but the EU, in Germany, Netherlands and Sweden. In Asia, such as Singapore and Hong Kong. In the Mediterranean in Cyprus, Israel and Turkey. Wait until Africa, South America, and India really begin to wake up.

"The difference is the level of cognition at which the stories were created.  The Scientology stories were made up by a guy with a pencil in his teeth going ""hmmm."" Older religions evolved from vernacular traditions with relevance to people's lives, over thousands of years.  They are *crowdsourced*.

It's like the difference between the culturally or linguistically determined borders in the Middle East  or Africa 500 years ago and the ones arbitrarily dropped onto ancient cultures by colonial Europeans (guys saying hmmmm). Look how well that has turned out.

Or the difference between vernacular local architecture which naturally cools a house with porches, versus dropping a corporate-designed Burger King which must be cooled by electric AC and wastes electricity.

The point being, religion comes from a tradition that has, at least at some point had, adaptive utility for a group. Cults exist to enrich an individual or a small group.

(One thoughtful, smart person can engineer a good dam or plan a complex budget or something,  but providing *meaning* to a culture, which is what religion does, requires more than one guy with a plan. The culture has to do it for itself or bad things happen.)

"I have a bachelor's in history, and obtained a Master's in Teaching, and then focused on teaching mathematics rather than history. 

There's actually a lot of really good reasons, not so much the 'effects before cause', but because everyone who is born suffers from a necessary 'flattening' - the world that I was born into simply 'is' the world, another way of saying 'presentism'. 

So by teaching history from the present backwards, we can constantly reference the world that the students know, and build up a backstory that explains the world they can see. 

The reason this doesn't happen a lot more often is because state standards call for state history to be taught often in the 9th grade, and American history to be taught often to Juniors. There's this idea that we want citizenry and civics to be taught to the strongest reasoners. 

The approach that you take has a certain beautiful symmetry to it - we could teach citizenry and civics to 7th and 8th graders, contextualizing the world they are in, and the move backwards to American history in the 8th and 9th, move backwards through America's foundation and European expansionism, and then finally land in the ancient world. 

Another problem with this approach is that you're asking students to understand local history - but it's not as if you're really going to get into any solid international politics. So when you get to the part of the ancient world which is relevant to modern politics, you don't really have the time and scope to have covered enough of the arab or chinese world to make ancient history's explanatory power relevant.

"&gt; I don't mean to sound greedy ot anything, but it just seems like Sony is ignoring some markets.

Publishers, not Sony.

The reason why you see more new releases and special offers in the US than in Europe is because it costs less to publish a game in North America than in Europe, plus games usually sell more copies there as well (FIFA is usually an exception).

After a game is developed, publishers will have to pay the costs for content rating/classification, licensing, royalties, localisation, marketing, and distribution.

North America only has 1 rating system (ESRB), which costs nothing if your game is digitally distributed (you can also self-rate your game as well, saving time). Compare this with Europe which has PEGI, and rating systems for Finland, Germany, and Russia (also Australia and New Zealand). This means the cost to rate/classify a game will likely be several times higher in Europe than in North America.

The US has the biggest video game market in the world, which is double the size of 2nd-placed Japan, and is 3-4 times bigger than the 5th-placed UK (China and South Korea are 3rd and 4th). This means that usually around 3 times as many copies of games are sold in North America than in Europe (Looking at regional sales data for Persona 4 Golden seems to corroborate this).

As /u/DrMartinSweden said below, Europe is a bit too fragmented. Think of how expensive it will be to localise, market and distribute games to countries in that region (marketing is usually the biggest cost).

Given the above, it is no wonder why some publishers refuse to publish their games in Europe, or if they do, you can expect the game to be priced higher, released later, go on sale later or any combination of the three.

For example, Atlus USA publishes Persona 4 Golden in North America, while NIS America publishes the game in Europe. The game is a lot cheaper in the US, was released there a few months earlier, and goes on sale more frequently than Europe.

This is because the US publisher will break-even a lot sooner than the European publisher, and they can afford to put the game on sale earlier and at a lower price.

"How Naive, you really think that the Russia, seeing an opportunity to expand its territories and obtain a strategically important region that is also economically important will not? You are looking at the russian leadership as if they were Europeans or Canadians, and had at least some concern for other nation's sovereignty; where in fact the Russians know their position is favorable to obtain crimea now... and the modern Russian leadership is a neo-imperialistic one. What they will try to do is to shuttle troops around ambiguously to make any aggressive move on the part of ukraine incite and justify a much larger counterattack while suppressing any tatar and ukrainian opposition... until the crimean regional government holds a referendum and either a new independent puppet state is created, or crimea joins the russian federation outright. They just have to sit tight until that happens.

&gt;From the very beginning of the Second World War, the Soviet government had no illusions that the USSR would be involved in the world conflict. The major problem of the Red Army was outdated equipment and all the efforts of the Soviet leaders were focussed to give the up to date or correct vehicles to the army. New Soviet fighters had to compete against modern fighters, like the Messerschmitt Bf.109, the Curtiss P-40 and Spitfires, but also had to be cheap and simple in production to make to allow mass production. One of the projects of the new red-starred fighters became the LaGG-3, named after the names of it's creators - the Soviet engineers Lavochkin, Gorbunov and Gudkov. The main feature of this plane was the intense use of composite plywood, or delta-wood(Stalin wood), this was tough enough to protect the pilot and the internal equipments, but allow the Soviets to save metal that was expensive and not easy to produce.

&gt;When the war started in the Eastern Front, the main competitors for the LaGG was the German Bf.109's of the ""F"" series. This was the further development of the ""E"" series, ""Fridrich"" which had absorbed the experience of the intense combat operations in Spain, blitzkriegs in Europe and, of course, the Battle of Britain. Even after the more advanced models of the Messerschmitt appeared, the ""Friedrich"" was considered by many German aces as the perfect fighter aircraft. Fast, agile and very well armed, the Bf.109F became a symbol of Luftwaffe superiority.",1432611011,1393675763,t1_cfro5lg,False,False,4,t3_1z9bth,, spogooter,brocollocalypse,,4,t5_2uc6j,0,t3_1z9bth,0,cfro5lg,True,SB-air,Warthunder,0

"No, your source is a single person's blog that is taking a quote out of context. 

He's basing ""oh, we're funding the protests"" on this quote by Victoria Nuland:

""Since the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1991, the United States supported the Ukrainians in the development of democratic institutions and skills in promoting civil society and a good form of government - all that is necessary to achieve the objectives of Ukraine’s European. We have invested more than 5 billion dollars to help Ukraine to achieve these and other goals.""

All she's saying is that the US has invested 5 Billion in the Ukraine since 1991.

This article is from February 12 and a lot of the claims of the protestors about their old government have since been proven correct. Ukraine's coffers were raided completely and there's 70 Billion missing - complaints about corruption weren't fabricated.

"For Bulgaria at least there were no known descendants of the old Bulgarian nobility from the Middle ages. And in order to be recognized as a ruler one would have to come from a noble family - of which there were plenty in Europe and Russia. Alexander Batenberg was a pretty good choice - he had close ties with the Russian tsar, was not very important, and most importantly - was not Russian. This eased the concerns of the Great Powers that Russia might gain too much influence in the area, and at the same time ensured that the tsar had a relative on the throne of the fledgling nation... of course things rarely go as you plan them, and Alexander decided to do his own thing - most notably he united the independent Bulgarian Principality with the autonomous East Rumelia, beat some serbs along the way, managed to piss of the russians and the pro-russian party and so on... On a semi-related note - the ""pro-russian vs. anti-russian""  thing continues to shape politics in the area even now",1432611101,1393677098,t1_cfrocgr,False,False,4,t3_1z99eb,,,cybelechild,,4,t5_2ssp3,0,t3_1z99eb,0,cfrocgr,True,,AskHistorians,0
"Remember that the [French revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_revolution) was followed by the Reign of Terror that killed tens of thousands of people, and then by Napoléon who brought war and destruction to great parts of Europe, who was in term followed by the [Congress of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Congress) that sought to reverse the liberal changes made by the French revolution and its ideals (historians: please don't decapitate me over this stark simplification). My point? The transition from authoritarian to democratic *takes time*, Europe took well over one or two hundred years (depends on how you look at it) and was now only really stable for a couple decades.

The Arab Spring swept away a common enemy - e.g. Mubarak in Egypt - but the opposition was/is very heterogenous. There are liberal, democratically minded and well educated parts, but also the radical Islamist Muslim Brotherhood and a wide range of others. How could they possibly suddenly agree to a well-functioning democratic system according to Western standards? Certainly not in a few years. Culture is an important part as well, democracy needs a *cultural* shift towards these kinds of positive developments.

Now, in Ukraine, the problem is slightly different. The fall of the Soviet Union did not directly remove all impediments to prosperity and happiness in the country, but rather left it with a range of problems and divisions. The most important in this regard, in my opinion, is the divide between more pro-Western and anti-Russian populations in the West of the country whereas the East has a strong Russian minority and is much less inclined towards more integration with the West. These are very opposite view points, and very hard (in fact, apparently impossible) to consolidate forever, as is evidenced by the recent unrests. This is a historic legacy of the Soviet Union - and the same is true for the current Crimea crisis where the Russian black sea fleet is stationed and large parts of the population are Russian and loyal to Russia. In addition, there are also significant Tartar populations that are neither very pro-Russian nor pro-Ukraine, further complicating the issue. 

Lastly, you say that ""Afirca is just as bad as it's ever been"", and I have to disagree. The continent is not all just one shithole, there are countries with significant growth, for example Nigeria. See articles for example [here](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139109/shantayanan-devarajan-and-wolfgang-fengler/africas-economic-boom), [here](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/12/30/africas_powerhouse#sthash.GrtcoBEG.dpbs), [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22847118) or [here](http://www.ibtimes.com/africa-poised-unprecedented-long-term-economic-growth-seven-drivers-could-transform-africa-worlds). Nevertheless, there are of course also a range of severe problems, but again, progress takes time, shifts in culture, and a lot of effort.

I hope this answers some of your questions.

"&gt;gives us on the left a bad name.

I'm not especially left-leaning, I just a Europhile. I appreciate that the reality is that people will dislike an argument because of the way it's phrased, but if people want to vote us out of the EU because they don't like the tone, hey, it's their children they're shitting all over. I'll apply for a Canadian/Australian visa, or see if I can scrape into a Scandinavian country.

&gt;The fact is that immigration into the UK is substantial. 

I never said it was insubstantial. I said that it was hardly innundated compared to other Western European countries, which I stand by (87% White, compared with Germany's 88% ""European"" and France's 85% White). A lot of Eurosceptics seem to believe, from endlessly seeing their comments, that France and Germany somehow have ""greater control of their borders"", which we can safely say is a euphamism for a greater % of their population being of native ethnicity. 

Moreover, they refuse to accept the fact that we are entirely to blame (if indeed you view Eastern European immigration as a bad thing) for the wave of EU8 migration because Britian was one of only three countries to fully open the border. Every other country imposed restrictions, so no shit we got a lot of Poles coming here, because they had either Ireland (hello tanking economy) or Sweden as their only other choices. Cue the waves of hysteria over Romano-Bulgarian migration when the fact of the matter is, despite what the BBC would have us believe, there aren't bus loads of Transylvanians marching over here to take our jobs, since they can go to all the other EU countries and actually get some decent jobs.

&gt;but at the same time people have a perfect right to debate this issue and resorting to name-calling just isn't good enough anymore.

Why, though? I do not and will not waste the time of day trying to convince people who are racists in all but name, who are xenophobic to the point of lunacy that their views are pathetic. The argument for immigration always has been and continues to be compelling economically, and frankly since I believe in a meritocracy I'd rather my services be done by people who are good at what they do regardless of their accent. So long as they speak English I really do not care.

&gt; You actually have to come up with an argument why you think immigration is a good thing and understand that not everyone who thinks a figure of 11.3% might be too high is a fascist/racist/insert your own slur.

Do you seriously think I don't know this? I am well aware that they have a right to debate the issue, I just don't think they have a leg to stand on. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck but claims ""I'm not racist, I just think we have a right to take control of our own borders"" then hey, guess what, it's a fucking Little Englander duck.

There are certainly some argument against immigration, against the EU, against open borders etc that have merit.

I rarely, if ever, see them being wheeled out.

"I want to believe that. But given the unfolding of events... Germany is the country that most profited from post war economic effort and the forming of the EU. It got it's massive debt pardoned, it reindustrialized massively on cheap cash and did so with great merit I have to say. Iit also reunified with the Eastern half while it's deficit exploded and skidded many times and was always duly supported by an understanding EU/IMF/US who always granted her exceptional treatment. Unlike other countries.

Now with the sovereign debt crisis, it demands banks be bailed out successively. It allows, along with the EU, that countries become indebted well above their means. It allows German banks to loan those ailing countries and buy CDS. These reap sometimes 25% on the market. And they are profitable because of being backed by bailout money/IMF/ECB/German checks, even despite massive haircuts, they're profitable. It's as if they're kept lingering so as to make sure all is scooped up, like vultures to a corpse. It prevents Eurobonds and QE (I agree to this) but is silent when the US does it on steroids.

Germany also dictates EU policy for the past decade. It demands privatization, when only German companies have access to cheap credit and native ones don't even get credit, let alone reasonable rates. And even in Germany privatization is a controlled issue. It isn't bothered by the many different fiscal policies across Europe that cannibalize and prevent normalization of ailing states.

Zionism is just an ideological poster to assist the destructive assertions of wealthy corporate entities ultimately serving the economic (power) interests of the Rothschilds and their associates. Christian Evangelicalism and Radical Islam are used in the same fashion, especially in resource rich regions such as africa, middle east etc. 'Zionists', are really just another branch in the Rchild's money hoarding network, they are discreet and downgrade there existence as a driving political force, unlike the Vatican, one of their compliant rivals (money hoarding network). Most of the world's economies are dominated by the Rchilds and countries that aren't, tend to have violent replacement of government until they do; Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Ukraine, incoming Venezuela.

North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Russia are independent, China, India, Brazil and their allies have significant independence but are still influenced. A global economic unification is imminent, though no king rules forever and the Rchilds will lose power as new industries (New forms of energy, advanced internet and space technology) and a new corporate elite will emerge to overthrow them. 

It will gradually occur but it will happen, the institute that is the Vatican has been operating since Augustus, though they may have changed their face and creed, thrived for thousands of years due to the delay of civil progression, but because our society has rapidly accelerating civil progression, they won't be able to last too long. This is why conservatives and fascists exist to purposely degenerate the progress of civilisation so the feudalistic oligarchies and monarchies can maximise the time of rule.

Essentially, the group of Money hoarding networks such as the Rchilds (and banker/corporate associates, Rockerfellers, Morgans etc.), Vatican, House of Saxe-Coburg/European Monarchies, Saudi/Islamic Monarchies etc. are currently in a loose alliance (not exactly loyal to each other) to dominate the world and snuff out other Money hoarding networks such as the Russian Oligarchy, Iranian Shia Islam, Chinese Oligarchy etc.

Money hoarding networks = Nobility
Nobility = Top of the Food chain

Part of the basic principles of Feudalism. We are not a democracy, we just democratically elect representatives who all serve the same feudal nobility, which barely changes.

Edit: We cannot break this system, we have been living in it since the dawn of civilization, it is how society functions and will remain like this until trans-humanism, we need a dominant minority to command the masses.

If you've ever played WoW, this is the basic concept of the Lich King, and when Arthas died this is why Bolvar Fordragon had to replace him, because the mindless scourge (zombie army) will be too destructive and rampant without a selfish ruler to manipulate and direct them in order to achieve a purpose.

I would also like to state in the War of 1812, we had our capital burned to the ground. 

In the American Civil War, Grant used total war and burned a good portion of Georgia to the ground and a ton of cities were leveled.

In World War 2, American forces at Pearl Harbor were attacked resulting in heavy damage to the base and to the Pacific Fleet. Additionally, American shipping was attacked by German u-boats constantly, and even German forces were surfacing near coastal cities in Florida. ""German U-Boats sank over twenty-four ships off of Florida's Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Many ships could be seen burning from areas along the coast by Floridians and tourists. In late February 1942, German submarines attacked four merchant ships right off the east coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral. German spies were able to come on shore at Ponte Vedra (near Jacksonville). They were captured before they could blow up Florida's railroad lines and stop the shipment of war supplies.""

So while we haven't experienced war on our own doorstep in over a decade, you can not say we have not experienced war.  We can thank our geographic position in between two oceans for assisting us in that part, as most countries do not have the military or logistical ability to invade us over water.

We did quite well with the leftovers from Pep Team the last two years, but this team has an expiry date and brave decisions must be taken. There will be a before and after the day Xavi leaves the team and we must be prepared for that sooner than later. And we should start now, even if this means taking hard and painfull decisions, like to renounce fighting for the league next season in order to build a team for the future.

To start, we should build a strong defense. Not just a strong defense, but the strongest defense in Europe. And this means spending money. I would buy two experienced centre backs. Enough with the experiments. Let's buy defenders who are already good. I would go for Kompany and Dante (or Hummels if we can't get Dante), and keep Piqué and Bartra. I would buy also a left winger, being David Alaba my preference. For the right wing, Montoya needs to take a step forward, but it is impossible if Dani Alves is there. Solution: I'd sell Dani Alves. It is a painfull decision, I know. But it has to be done if we want Montoya to progress. I'd keep Adriano to play in the right wing too.

For the midfield, we don't need much changes. I'd return Mascherano to his original position, and be Busquets substitute. I'd sell Song. Xavi is still in the team but somebody must start taking his role. I see Iniesta more than Fabregas doing that. And Cesc taking Iniesta's role. I'd start giving quality minutes to Sergi Roberto as well, together with Rafinha. If we have to buy a midfielder, I have wet dreams with Rakitic. I really love how he plays.

For the attack, we have Messi and Neymar, and that's more than most of the teams of the world have. I really like Alexis' progression as well. I'd sell the rest: Tello and Pedro. If we want Deulofeu and Halilovic to have any significance in the team they can't have these players stopping their progression, and I'm sure we can get good money for Tello and (mainly) Pedro. I'd also buy a big &amp; strong striker to play against the teams who build walls in front of the goal. Someone who can win high balls and be a good header and, most important, someone who would accept sitting in the bench most of the season. The role that Larsson had back in the days. I'd sign Mario Gomez (or someone like Mario Gomez).",1432611227,1393678805,t1_cfrom27,False,False,2,t3_1z8ua7,,,amodelmon,,2,t5_2s561,0,t3_1z8ua7,0,cfrom27,True,,Barca,1
"You're going to be downvoted, but you're correct that the pro-European Tories are good candidates. Of course, for a long time the Conservatives were the only major pro-European party, and there are many in the party who still hold those views, and have done a lot of good, sensible, constructive work at a European level.

The problem is that the pro-European Tories are utterly marginalized within their party, and in fact have been removed by dubious means from the electoral list for my region. And the person in charge of the ECR grouping is Daniel Hannan, who is, in my judgement, a first class shit. He doesn't represent my views on Europe, and his general and domestic ideology is hard-right.

Bullshit, the healthcare is subsidized by a working tax system. Also the US could absolutely spend less money on the military and still be the most powerful country in the world. It doesn't matter if you drop 1000 or 10000 nukes onto Moscow, the result is the exact same. The military spending of the US is absurdly over the top, even considering the ""weakness"" of Europe. And then again Europe is not actually weak at all. France and the UK have nukes. Their one weakness is that their press is relatively void of propaganda which makes war look much less like an option.

"* I do not fucking care whether pro players or any player flame, this sub should just grow the fuck up and deal with it. I want to see good players, I do not care about their attitude or whether they elo boost. Incarnati0n and Apdo should be allowed to play regardless of their soloqueue behavior. 

* This subreddit has actually no clue about the game and in every postmatch threads repeats what some unknowledgable caster said.

* Players can be amazing even when they do not pull of heavy 1v1 outplays, and not just ""solid"".

* Deficio is a good caster and I do not care about his accent.

* No region is actually way superior than the others, all regions are really close, and setting up a ranking is just a symptom of this society that needs to rank everything.

* SKT T1 K could be beaten by any world class team if they play their A game. 

* Gambit have the players with the highest raw skill in the game.

* CLG.EU featured the most boring playstyle of any pro team, and I think they were only good because of the metagame that allowed them to stall. Their 30k gold comeback was not a sign of good play, but rather of a flawed game and M5 playing bad. 

* In Korea, only SKT T1 K stands out as super good, the rest is just normal, with some better teams like KTB. Ozone got fucking wrecked at Worlds, but as soon as they are back in Korea and get to OGN final it was just a fluke in performance. 

* I find Fnatics playstyle to be extremely annoying to watch. 

* Cloud9 is a great team that can have international success, but people are dismissing them for losing to Fnatic at worlds. 

* Bjergsen can win lane against Faker, so can any World class mid. 

* I am still butthurt about M5 losing to TPA in S2WC and I think M5 would have won a BO5. If S3WC semifinals would have been BO3 NJBS would have won and people would be praising different teams. 

* Riot did a terrible job with S3WC format, IPL5 was a lot better. 

* LCS format gets boring very fast and does not help to evaluate teams strength, since BO1s do not mean shit. 

* NaJin Sword was stronger than Shield for the most time, they just got unlucky in the group drawings. 

* To the people saying that EU players have ""less personality"" than NA players: maybe thats because they actually focus on the game, instead of drama on the personal life, which is none of the publics business? It is called being professional. 

* InSec is a less than overwhelming toplaner and was a lot better in the jungle.

* Riot could make this game a lot better with the money and resources they have, they just are really bad at managing the game. 

* Wickd is mentally a 10-year-old that should grow up instead of whine about opinions on him. 

* I think Darien is a better Irelia than Wickd. 

* Splitpush, poke and disengage compositions are boring to watch. 

* I am disgusted as to how Sjokz is treated by the community, must be hard to be her. 

* I downvote all those dumb jokes that are not funny, because they add nothing to the discussion, instead of downvoting opinions I dislike.

* Dragonslayer Vayne is the ugliest skin in the game.

* Toxic is the most overused and retarded word that is used in this game, and I cannot hear it anymore. 

* Twitch Chat is often more entertaining than watching the streams, and people that complain about it are boring. 

* It is more annoying to play against Nidalee than against Teemo. 

* The only two champions in the game that require a bit of skill are Lee Sin and Vayne. 

* Climbing the ladder does not happen through some secret tips, but just because of game intelligence. 

* With enough time, almost anybody can go to Diamond. 

* You can be stuck in low elo, despite being a better player than most people there, because it can take a high number of games to get out. 

* Pushing mid when the inhibitor there is down is the most retarded thing people do in soloqueue.

* I think the whole spoiler policy is retarded, and should be dropped, like it is in any other sport.

* I do not give a fuck about lore and fanart.

* Riot should stop making so much generic humanoid champs that are all the same and that are uninteresting. 

* People make assessments on teams strength on a way too low number of games. On a pro level a game is won or lost by a single moment, that makes it easy to lose games. Consistency is what makes great teams great. (See SKT T1 K)

* Criticizing someone in game gets impossible due to everyone being oversensitive and calling it flaming.

* It is incredibly dumb to make oneself a one-trick-pony by playing only one champion to get higher elo. It is better to be versatile.

"&gt;  So how many men do you approach per night when you go out?

Well now it's ""How many did I *used* to approach?"".  I'm not going to like every dude I see, so back when I used to approach, I had conversations with/danced with around 1-4.  Never got anywhere with them so I just started waiting for them to approach.  That works, every time.

&gt; What do you mean by the first move? You go say hello or do you mean you kiss them?

First move would be initiating dancing on the dancefloor, saying hi, leading the conversation, asking for number etc.  I would personally never count kissing as a first move.

&gt;  By gone, do you mean they leave the bar?

This one is difficult to define but it's more of an attitude shift.  With guys who pursue, they are relentless and sort of bask in your attention which is great (but occasionally invasive or pushy).  When I pursued, they acted uninterested, ""too cool"" or just plain avoided me.  I asked other women about this, since I can be socially awkward sometimes, and turns out it happens to them too.  It sucks because waiting for a guy you know you'd like to dance with/talk to is so unpredictable (and time consuming) and you can't control the situation at all.  Feels unbalanced in the end :(

&gt;  Recently on a beach a really good looking Swedish woman walked up to me, danced very briefly, then kissed me. I can recall another woman doing the same and it worked out for her.

I'm Australian and this rarely happens here.  I know Swedish/European people are much more sexually assertive and the women are allowed to be assertive in more ways too.  We get a lot of international people at my university, and the Europeans are always stunned at how conservative Australia is in overall attitude.  Men lurch from being these silent, stoic types to all out sleazy drunkards.

&gt; I also recall this same thing happening where I didn't like the woman, but I kissed her for a few minutes (because I'm a man that has been rejected 1,000 times and I get that it sucks), then ditched her because I had a prettier option.

Never done that, would stay away from a guy who thought that was OK.  Maybe you don't do it anymore but that's quite the red flag.  I would never lead a guy on like that if there was one I was more interested in, ever.",1432611248,1393679072,t1_cfronni,False,False,1,t3_1z7p8t,,,[deleted],,1,t5_2rxrw,0,t1_cfroc5b,0,cfronni,True,,AskWomen,0

"I think the main problem to remember here is that liberals and opportunists will denounce Russian imperialism while completely ignoring US and EU imperialism, because that's what the Western bourgeois media does. You can see pretty much the same thing with regards to LGBT rights in Russia - speaking to liberals you would think the rest of the world is a gay rights paradise. 

Russia serves as a scapegoat for the Western ruling class, to keep everyone distracted from problems at home. It's pretty ironic that the white house attacks this event while it does the same thing to the rest of the world.

So it's not surprising that Marxists will point out the bullshit of the bourgeois media and liberals who don't do anything to fight for national self-determination in their own countries, focused instead on being self-righteous by repeating what Obama told them about big bad Putin.

That being said, I think there's a tendency for communists to become too fixated on this and even defend Russia as some sort of progressive force.

"First, they imported a LOT of food from other parts of the empire. Rome is now built on the remains of Roman food packaging material: broken up pottery. Romans mainly lived on what is know as the mediterranean triangle: Wheat, wine and olive oil. Bread made up 70 to 80% of most of the Romans diet. Three kinds of food that are pretty easy to transport over longer distances. 
There were *huge* imports of grain from north Africa and Egypt. Rome lived on that grain. Wine and olive oil came from almost everywhere. 

But that wasn't all. Not many people know this, but Rome imported many fresh fruits and vegetables as well. There are many amphorae found that had stones of fruits in it. Also huge amounts of animals were herded to the city every year, especially from the lower half of the Italian peninsula. 

And now the second part. Romans were amazingly good at growing food. The efficiency of agricultural land and labour that the Romans had at the end of the republican era was only surpassed in the 19th century western Europe. 

The level of agronomic knowledge was quite high. There are a few Roman agronomic handbooks left and they are very good. Romans discovered 'new' plants in the east and spread them all over their empire. Roman farmers actively cultivated bigger and tastier vegetables. In horticulture especially they were very good at managing the humidity of the soil by digging canals, using rural aquaducts or burying layers of potteryshards to facilitate drainage. Also the variety of different cultivars of plants within the species was so large that Romans had the luxury of choosing which cultivar was suited best to the climate and soil.

Also the Romans had excellent systems of crop rotation: alternating two or three crops of cereals one of legumes and one with fallow or green manuring (the mixture of plants sowed for green manuring being chosen for the type of soil, the crops of the cycles before and the usefullness as animal fodder).

Romans also had a lot of lifestock. Roman cattle were twice as heavy as those in the periods before and after the Roman golden age. Most Roman farmers had some livestock *kept stabled* for use as source of power, milk, meat and leather but most importantly, for poop. Without poop there is no civilization and the Romans knew it (so much even that it was forbidden by law to sell a farm and its manure heap apart from each other). When land is so intensively farmed as it was around Rome. You think everybody living in Rome was just shitting in the Tiber? Nope, poop is worth money. That shit was carted out of the city to fertilize arable land  for miles upon miles around Rome.

"A meaningful conflict between two nuclear armed states can never exist without eventual escalation. Which is why this would never happen.

Lets say NATO sends troops to fight Russia, a few skirmishes take place both on the ground and in the air.
Casualties would mount on both sides, that is the  nature of fighting a modernized military instead of a third world state.
To stop the meat grinder and make meaningful progress NATO will have to bomb Russian assets to establish dominance, as per US doctrine.

So they bomb Russian air bases bordering Ukraine, Russia subs retaliate by sinking a carrier group somewhere in Europe, evening the score. Before you know it tens of thousands are dead on both sides and strategic bombers are taking of because both states are at maximum alert.

"I posted this on another thread in response to a post addressing Zionism but it is related to anything.

Zionism is just an ideological poster to assist the destructive assertions of wealthy corporate entities ultimately serving the economic (power) interests of the Rothschilds and their associates. Christian Evangelicalism and Radical Islam are used in the same fashion, especially in resource rich regions such as africa, middle east etc. 'Zionists', are really just another branch in the Rchild's money hoarding network, they are discreet and downgrade there existence as a driving political force, unlike the Vatican, one of their compliant rivals (money hoarding network). Most of the world's economies are dominated by the Rchilds and countries that aren't, tend to have violent replacement of government until they do; Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Ukraine, incoming Venezuela.
North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Russia are independent, China, India, Brazil and their allies have significant independence but are still influenced. A global economic unification is imminent, though no king rules forever and the Rchilds will lose power as new industries (New forms of energy, advanced internet and space technology) and a new corporate elite will emerge to overthrow them.
It will gradually occur but it will happen, the institute that is the Vatican has been operating since Augustus, though they may have changed their face and creed, thrived for thousands of years due to the delay of civil progression, but because our society has rapidly accelerating civil progression, they won't be able to last too long. This is why conservatives and fascists exist to purposely degenerate the progress of civilisation so the feudalistic oligarchies and monarchies can maximise the time of rule.
Essentially, the group of Money hoarding networks such as the Rchilds (and banker/corporate associates, Rockerfellers, Morgans etc.), Vatican, House of Saxe-Coburg/European Monarchies, Saudi/Islamic Monarchies etc. are currently in a loose alliance (not exactly loyal to each other) to dominate the world and snuff out other Money hoarding networks such as the Russian Oligarchy, Iranian Shia Islam, Chinese Oligarchy etc.
Money hoarding networks = Nobility, Nobility = Top of the Food chain
Part of the basic principles of Feudalism. We are not a democracy, we just democratically elect representatives who all serve the same feudal nobility, which barely changes.
Edit: We cannot break this system, we have been living in it since the dawn of civilization, it is how society functions and will remain like this until trans-humanism, we need a dominant minority to command the masses.
If you've ever played WoW, this is the basic concept of the Lich King, and when Arthas died this is why Bolvar Fordragon had to replace him, because the mindless scourge (zombie army) will be too destructive and rampant without a selfish ruler to manipulate and direct them in order to achieve a purpose. The only thing we can do is try to maintain a Lich King that is less evil malevolent and psychopathic, replacing Lich Kings that refuse to accept their time is over and retain power for an extended period.

This is why we are experiencing censorship and such, it is the circle of life, kings don't want to allow their children to replace them, thus seeking the fountain of youth.",1432611311,1393679881,t1_cfroshp,False,False,3,t3_1yug45,,,xXZoroasterXx,,3,t5_2qh4r,0,t3_1yug45,0,cfroshp,True,,conspiracy,0

"Academics in general, and philosophy in particular, is often full of the long and tedious :(  (Note that this is a good thing, but it does make it discouraging in many ways.)

It sounds like what we are really saying is that it is the specific conclusions we are now finding fault with, not the methodology itself.  Fast-forward to Descartes, like Aristotle he was rather wrong in his scientific conclusions, but given the tools he had to work with (or lack thereof) he didn't do that bad.  From the Greeks to a bit beyond Descartes, observations were rather difficult to rely upon.  Standards of knowledge were grounded within the ""certainty"" of mathematics during this time.  Hence, reason was superior to observation as it took reason to work out the errors of observation.  

Since Descartes' great works in mathematics, science has gone much farther in it's tools, most notably statistical reasoning.  This does make a nice blend of observation and reason.  

Modern people may very well believe that emotion and intuition are equally important, yet we still see how horribly wrong relying upon these can be when it comes to gaining knowledge.  In this the Greeks were still correct, if the goal is a methodology which is, more often correct than not, we need other tools for knowledge that correct for emotional errors or intuitive faults.  

You are correct, that few would follow Plato's second city to be ruled by philosopher-kings.  Yet many institutions still follow his model of education.  Case in point, military instruction often follows both the positive and negative methods (not value judgments, but techniques).  I don't know what the current state of education is in the European side, but at one time testing was frequently used to filter people into the ""best fit"" tracks for jobs, with little chance of changing ones path -- much like Plato ascribed in the second city.  

For that matter, in the US (at least around the Bible Belt parts), there is tremendous push to include censorship and ""noble lies"" within the curriculum to unsure the students develop into ""proper"" citizens believing the lies of the state.  Again, this is almost straight out of what Plato concluded we ought to do, methodologically, to insure correct thought in the people.  

There is no ""the modern scientific method.""  As such, you are certainly correct that we could not credit pretty much anyone pre-Descartes to be called a ""father"" of such.  However, they did make a crucial jump into ascribing order to the world, without the worry of capricious influence from the gods. This is rather significant in itself and still applicable.  

Many would agree with you that science, philosophy, art, etc. do not make life worth living.  Eventually we all have to pick our poison.

"The fighting would mt be by citizens of the country for their benefit. It never is.

The fight would probably be to maintain control over the things that always made the controllers the most money.

That is an important thing to consider when running scenarios.

As a peacetime example, the US didn't bailout ""the financial system"" for the benefit of its citizens. It did it rather to maintain control pf the financial system in the hands of those who had always controlled it and that was decidedly AGAINST the interests of its citizens.
The citizens would have been much better off if thry hadnt been bailed out like what happened in iceland where the bankers went broke, the citizens kept theor money, and they alone are in a great economic boom unlike all the other countries who are saddled with debt and being robbed by bankers after bailing out their bankers like greece.


Another example was invading Iraq to prevent Saddam from pumping his oil and taking contrkl of the oil markets away from the saudis who were and probably still are the leading business partners with the Bush's. It would have greatly benefited the citizens of the usa to have Saddam Hussein pump his oil which would have dropped prices to $50 a barrel or less (it was $20 before Bush the first imvaded iraq.) But of it would have destroyed the saudi monopoly pricing and actually caused the downfall of the saudi royal family which at $20  a barrel had books being written about its bankruptcy. And being the largest business partner with the saudis and their oil money, the bushs and their caryle group investors who were uso g that money to buy up computer chip manufacturers around the world and miltary defense contrators couldnt let their cash cow be bankrupted by lower oil prices.

So iraq hasnt pumped its vast reserves of oil for more than 20 yrs and the bushcs personally ordered the iraq invasion twice to ensure that oil stays in the ground (which is why even when the usa had troops all over iraq the oil never started pumping again.
Just another example.

So look now at venezuala being overthrow  becuase like iraq , venezuela has been pumping oil and lowering prices and funding bric.

First the venezuala leader gets cancer very young and dies. Then his successor suddenly has insurections by outside funded candidates who want to shut down what chavez did.

On and on it goes.

Just like in the 50's in iran when that leader was killed to stop him pumping oil.

And all the eastern block countires have been taken over by the same western bankers who indebted the cou ntries and now use them as dividend payments while keeping their labor prices low for cheap labor around europe.

&gt;**Pole to Pole** is an eight-part [television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television) [documentary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film) travel series made for the [BBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) and released in 1992. The presenter is [Michael Palin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Palin), this being the second of Palin's major journeys for the BBC. The trip from the [North Pole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole) to the [South Pole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole) went via [Scandinavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia), the [Soviet Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union), parts of [Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), and through the heart of [Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa). The intention was to follow the [30 degree east](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_meridian_east) line of longitude, which would cover the most land. A last-minute diversion to [Chile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile) included [South America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America) in the series. Using [aircraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft) as little as possible, the whole trip lasted 5½ months.

&gt;And now the second part. Romans were amazingly good at growing food. The efficiency of agricultural land and labour that the Romans had at the end of the republican era was only surpassed in the 19th century western Europe. 

If that's true, it's really jaw dropping. I have some questions:

1. Doesn't this imply that agricultural productivity actually declined in the imperial period? If so, was this because of slavery?

2. Why did agricultural productivity decline in the post-Roman period? Did the Byzantines maintain high levels of food production into the middle ages?

3. I am always hearing about the mouldboard plow that was invented in the early middle ages. It was supposed to have revolutionized agricultural in northern Europe. Were the Romans able to outproduce post-mouldboard northern European societies?

FTA:

&amp;gt;Last September, NED’s longtime president, [Carl Gershman](http://thepassionateattachment.com/2011/03/26/the-adl-and-the-middle-east-uprisings/), took to the op-ed page of the neocon-flagship Washington Post to urge the U.S. government to push European “free trade” agreements on Ukraine and other former Soviet states and thus counter Moscow’s efforts to maintain close relations with those countries. The ultimate goal, according to Gershman, was isolating and [**possibly toppling Putin in Russia**](http://en.ria.ru/russia/20111206/169389247.html) with Ukraine the key piece on this [**global chessboard**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Chessboard).

And more about [Gershman](http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Gershman_Carl).  

&amp;gt;Gershman became head of SD-USA shortly after the Socialist Party-USA split into two factions in the early 1970s: a left wing led by Michael Harrington, and a right wing led by Gershman, Tom Kahn, and Rachelle Horowitz. The right faction morphed into SD-USA, which in the early 1970s rallied around Sen. Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson, the hawkish Democrat from Washington State whose staff was made up of several future key neoconservative figures, including **Richard Perle, Frank Gaffney, and Elliott Abrams**.

"Short, but incomplete summary

**Main enemy  is Iran.** Saudi Arabia and Iran both view themselves as leaders of Islamic world and both have ambitions in the region. Shia minorities in many Sunni Arab countries (including Saudi Arabia) are considered threat. Saudis fight proxy wars with Iran in Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, etc. Main Saudi weapon is money. 

**Closest ally: Pakistan.** This can't be emphasized enough. Very close and friendly relationship and military alliance with Pakistan. Pakistan is politically, culturally and ideologically closest ally to Saudi Arabia.  Pakistan provides training, support and arms to Saudis, and is ready to provide manpower if needed. Pakistani Air Force  pilots have been previously flying in Royal Saudi Air force and Pakistan had 15,000 troops in Saudi Arabia from late 60's to 70's.  Hot issue: Pakistan is nuclear power and could theoretically provide nukes to Saudis. 

**US and Israel** Close allies of convenience. US and Israel have common enemy in Iran and oil business and military aid from US helps to keep Saudi Royals in power. 

**Terrorism** Saudis don't directly support terrorism, but they are the major supporters fundamentalist Islam. Saudi money funds 80% of new madrassas, books and education of new Muslim scholars around the world (EU, US, Iraq, Sudan, Pakistan, Chechnya, Indonesia, ...).

"the coment is obviously ""slightly"" dramatic, but the situation in Ukraine with what is now officially a Russian military presence on Ukrainian soil is very serious. in /r/CredibleDefense a user made the, in my opinion quite succinct, comparison to the annexation of the Sudetenland. (yeah I know, Godwin's law, but it is appropriate, this time). Putin has willingly escalated and utilized the inner-ukrainian tensions, but this does not take away from the fact that Russia has commited an act of war against a Nation that holds treaties with the UK and US, guaranteing its independence and territorial integrity. If the US and UK honor this treaty (which - from a political/geostrategic pov - they almost *have to*) and decide to answer with a strong response, this conflict could very well spiral out of control to become the biggest war, at least in europe, since the end of WW2. (if it would be a ""world war"" is another thing). the West is certainly not interested in letting that happen, but at the same time a weak or no response could be - in the long run - even more devastating, as was seen in WW2 with the Sudetenland and tchechoslovakia, as it would send the signal to Putin that an aggressive foreign policy would not be condemned, encouraging him to continue the policy until a point is reached where the west **has** to act, for example when attacking a NATO member.

Edit: I'll have to revise my comment in parts: there is no ""treaty"" in the usual sense of the word between Ukrain and the US/UK, but a Memorandum of understanding, that includes support of ukrainian independence but apparently doesn't include that actions be taken if the independence is threatened. Also , I've obviously played out the worst course this story could take, Putin could be ""finished"" with his aggressive foreign policy when he has incorporated the Crimea into Russia, however, I doubt it.

"[Apparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_protests#27.E2.80.9328_February):

&gt; On 27 February at 4:20 local time, a group of 60 Russian-speaking gunmen seized Crimea's parliament building and Council of Ministers building. They are said to be professionals and heavily armed. 30 broke into the building initially, with a bus carrying another 30 people and additional firearms arriving later. The gunmen were unmarked but raised Russian flags.

&gt; Soon after the occupation of parliament began the Supreme Council of Crimea (Crimea's parliament) voted at gunpoint to hold a referendum on the status of Crimea on 25 May 2014. They also fired the present Council of Ministers of the region. On February 27, 2014, the Supreme Council of Crimea approved the new Chairman of Council of Minister Sergey Aksyonov, a leader of the Russian Unity party. Interfax-Ukraine reported ""it is impossible to find out whether all the 64 members of the 100-member legislature who were registered as present at when the two decisions were voted on or whether someone else used the plastic voting cards of some of them"" because due to the armed occupation of parliament it was unclear how many MPs were present. The head of parliament's information and analysis department, Olha Sulnikova, had phoned from inside the parliamentary building to journalists and had told them 61 of the registered 64 deputies had voted for the referendum resolution and 55 for the resolution to dismiss the government. According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the Prime Minister of Crimea is appointed by the Supreme Council of Crimea in consultation with the President of Ukraine.

As with the other (pseudo-)military action in Crimea this could be spun as being armed citizens taking measures to ensure the Council votes freely, without inside interference from the rioters who stormed the Kiev Parliament buildings (or EU agents). Or it can be spun as a Russian military-led coup.

"I saw it opening night.  Never would have done such a thing on my own (woulda waited) but a group of friends wanted to do it as a group activity.

There's nothing about this movie that is terribly heretical.  Goofy maybe.  But it's sorta in the middle of the pack as these sorts of movies go.

The reviewer and related comments are fairly spot on.  I/we noticed all those things.  It's REALLY hard to miss how all the power roles are white/European while all the slave/servant roles are black/African.  I mean ALL.  Romans need a ""slave"" to carry Jesus' cross so they grab the black guy.  Yes.  It's THAT bad.

Yes.  Jesus is ""hot"".  Incredible stylist the Holy Spirit was...

The casting was weird in other ways.  Mary at the time of Jesus' crucifixion looked to be in her 20s, not 40s/50s.

And one of our group did inform us this was essentially just all that History Channel stuff wrapped up.

The only really goofy thing that may rise to level of heresy is that this movie seemed to portray Jesus as magician/soothsayer.  Seriously.  They keep showing Jesus as if he gets visions along the way.  Peter proclaims he'll never deny Jesus.  Jesus response?  Incredible joy.  He hugs Peter... then SNAP gets a vision and whispers in Peter's ear that he'll deny him three times before dawn.  Stuff like this all throughout.

What this movie did better at than many other recent movies was the historical/political surroundings.  Ignoring the casting, they did a fairly good job describing the tension between Caeser/Pilate/Sanhedrin/Zealots.  But for some incredibly bizarre reason, Herod was completely absent.

"I do believe I'm factoring in the most important things.

First of all, our bodies are extremely complicated. No one person can know and understand everything, unless we get an AI or at least a super advanced computer first.

There would have to be several breakthroughs in order to make our limbs replaceable by electromechanical ones. At the very least the above mentioned AI/SC (to design and maintain the replacements), high density energy storage AND/OR advances in efficient power usage (power for a long enough time), micro/nano tech (for small yet powerful enough replacements and their ability to self-repair), biotech (in order to properly fit organic and electromechanical tech, we'll need at least a modified skin that grows around and into the replacement limbs, to create a closed system, plus it would be great if nanorobots could travel freely to/from the organic parts).

That's for the tech. Tech is easy. But we'll need changes to society and culture, which is the biggest obstacle.

Might I remind you that a lot of countries banned useful stem cell research and animal experiments because they were unethical - without them we would not have what we have now, shit even WW2 experiments helped a lot. 

But first we'll need to change the education system since it takes YEARS to train a doctor and now we'll need people who are both doctors and engineers. As I said, how long would that take to certify? Sure, they could technically learn in a few years, but fucking government won't give them a license unless they have say, 10 years education, 5 years practice and an unsurmountable amount of debt.

Drugs that could be useful for organic/electromech replacements will likely be unavailalble or banned (approval takes years, they're likely to be addictive, etc.) - how long would it take to make them available to everyone? It's not only the approval, it's also the establishing of manufacturers. If you only have Pfizer and UCB producing them, they'll be expensive and limited. 

Modafinil has just been approved in the EU, Adderall is still not heard of (most use Methylphenidate, which is kinda shitty for a lot of people). I mention them because they make our brain/body better when used properly, but because meds are supposed to heal not improve, they're considered unnecesary/unwanted. You think they'll like that you want to replace your aging hands with new electromech prosthetics?

3D printing would help with production, yes, but you still need the raw materials to make that powder for your laser 3D printers, which is gonna be expensive at least at first due to limited demand. For example, Panasonic developed 4000 mAh 18650 cells (the ones used in laptops and even the Tesla batteries) in 2007 - They only entered production in 2013, and are only available for large companies like Tesla, Dell, HP, etc. You can't get them for your 3D printed tablet for which you want the longest battery life possible - you'll have to make do with 3100 mAh cells (also available since ~2012, and rare - most likely you'd go for the 2800 mAh units, which are used in most laptops today).

Not to mention the stupidity of keeping back tech because the current one hasn't been fully mined for money - I'm looking at Hynix and their memristor tech, which won't be used until 2015 at least, because it's not cost competitive. Well, no shit it's not cost competitive. 
But if you bring it out now, you'll be leading the new industry and will have a headstart on the competition - people and enterprises would pay for ReRAM SSD's. EMC is still raking in cash from their enterprise SSDs, as is Micron with their NAND flash. Consumer SSDs have had an explosive growth since they were released - few people expected that from a limited storage, even if fast, hard drive replacement.

This is turning into a ramble and I lost track of what I was saying because of the small box :-) - the point is, I'm 95% certain we won't see mass scale electromech replacements for our organic components in our lifetime - maybe, *maybe* one or a few people will get some as an experiment. 

I hope I'm wrong though, and if I am, find me and I'll base jump off a tall building (I'm really afraid of standing on tall buildings).",1432611918,1393685990,t1_cfrq2gl,False,False,-1,t3_1z71pa,,,randomlex,,-1,t5_2qh1i,0,t1_cfrj2k2,0,cfrq2gl,True,,AskReddit,0

"Sure. Made a list of all the countries and places I wanted to see on each continent and then wrote down some rough trip plans (i.e. which countries are doable in one trip) and a timetable; started with Europe - more frequent trips but easier for me (closer to home, similar to what I'm used to); continued with Asia and a bit of Northern Africa, and then planning to see the Southern Hemishpere a bit.

My idea was to start with what's easier and then go to progressively farther away and more difficult places. So far, everything is going according to plan: [this](http://imgur.com/a/WlijA) is an album of my 2012 travels (traveled extensively around Europe) and [this](http://imgur.com/a/zJXto) is the 2013 album (some Europe and Morocco, Kazakhstan, Maldives and Sri Lanka). It's been really cool so far. 

I'm doing a short trip to Israel this month; three more trips planned for this year: (i) Tokyo, Hong Kong, Macau; (ii) Cairo - weekend trip and (iii) Florida and Bahamas. For next year I want to go to Svalbard and then to Australia, New Zealand and some pacific Islands, while in 2016 I want to check out South America and hopefully Antarctica. 

I used to have the same problem as OP before 2012: trapped in indecision and without giving it much thought, I'd just hit some random places each year with limited satisfaction.

"It drives costs up, both in taxes and the price of goods/services, for the consumer and for the business and people are particularly financially sensitive these days...and rightly so, because we're getting less for our $ than ever before. 

I live in Ireland and we've social healthcare (everyone can access medical help if they need it), we've cheap education (€2k in fees per year per student), we've a very generous welfare system, so generous in fact that for a lot of people they can enjoy a higher standard of living on welfare than going and working an entry level job, and more.

I'm not in favour of it. What is has lead to is extremely high taxes (effective rate of 52% on income), an extremely high cost of living with wages that do not meet it (massive rent/mortgages, the cost of running a vehicle is extremely high (from purchasing to motor tax to having one of the highest costs of petrol per litre in Europe) and mediocrity in our public systems. Our schools are mediocre, our third level education is poor (look how many colleges we have in the top 500 in the world, I believe it was 1 at the last count), our healthcare system is extremely poor with shit tons of people sitting on, and many dying on, trolleys in corridors in hospitals every day because they're so jammed up. 

We've people going to work every day to cover the rent/mortgage to provide a roof over their head for their families, while people getting welfare are given houses right next door to them for free/little cost and are being handed cash every week (about €200 per week per person) to live on.

Those working in the public systems - including lecturers in college - do not recognise those using the services (including students) as customers. They treat them like a burden to be dealt with. They (public system workers) also enjoy higher than average wages and benefits. 

It's not a good scenario and I can totally understand why people fight against these things being introduced. I'm hoping to move to the US so I can escape this, as we're simply too far gone now to remove it. Once you give people ""entitlements"" such as €200 per week, free housing, cheap or free education and more, when the economy goes down and the tax revenue to the government drops it becomes almost impossible to curb or remove these entitlements...so the taxpayer gets further burdened. 

The only socially provided ""entitlement"" I'm in favour of is access to education.

"There's no such thing as the *European system"", things vary greatly across countries and not sure what you mean by ""depending on a single test"". We have the SATs which has repeatedly been proven not to test intelligence but we use it as our main metric. 

Personally I can only speak for Germany as I studied abroad for a semester in Berlin and after extensive research applied and was admitted to a masters in econ program there which I ended up turning down to pay off my student loans here. In addition I dated for 3 years a girl who was born and raised in Germany, finished both her BA and MA in Berlin and currently pursuing a PhD at NYU. So both through her and personal experience I am very familiar with the German system and have to argue that its far superior to ours. 

But let me start by admitting their faults. The biggest weakness is probably that the college selection starts extremely early there and you are tested and admitted into a certain middle and high school such that if you fall behind and get locked out of the university path, there's basically 0 chance you'll get a BA. The problem is that this process starts as young as 9 and I'd argue that's way too young to fairly assess their potential to attend college. 

However, there are huge upsides to their system. For one, university rankings matter much less there, rather the focus is on the BA itself. So if you have a BA it actually means something and it is difficult to get vs in the U.S. some BAs are regardly more highly than others and grade inflation is rampant such that the value of the degree itself is greatly diluted. 

The most significant positive about their system arises from the fact that U.S. employers expect students to enter the work force as fully prepared workers ready to be plugged into the system. They refuse to take on any of the costs of training students essentially transferring the enormous cost of education completely on to the public balance sheets which helps fuel the enormous cost of college here. 

This kind of inflation is mitigated in Germany in that many companies have training programs and offer technical degrees for hs students and offer them a full time job upon completion. So as I said before, for students not on the ""college path"", many of them end up at these training programs where they get a 2 yr degree and a comfy middle class job/salary waiting for them at the end with no student loans. Siemans, Daimler Chrysler, related manufacturing and engineering firms do this but also law firms and accounting firms. It is highly preferable to the American system where we insist on sending everyone to college to get degrees that aren't highly valued and take on enormous loans and have no job prospects waiting for them. 

For those that do go to college, it is almost 100% free. This is partly due to the fact that again rankings matter less and universities aren't in a arms race with each other for funding and endowment (but still nurtures a competitive academic environment). 

This was most apparent to me when I was studying abroad at Humboldt university. You get a great education albeit the facilities are modest and a studrmt meal is usually potatoes/salad or rice and beans and sides, and costs less than 3 euros. 

I studied at NYU and it is crazy how much money is wasted on pointless expansion, student activities, and facilities. The dining hall is amazing and has a bazillion different choices but its so expensive I actually never could even afford the meal plan. Why do we need all that? Why does every college need a ridiculously extravagant sprawling campus? Its a fueled by an unsustainable student loan bubble and is little to offer in terms of real social mobility. 

So there are faults to the German system but they have an infrastructure for training and a steady jobs for the below avg student and a free university education for those who are qualified and a system that's focused on the value of the degree, not the ranking of the university. 

Oh and that applies to international students too. If I pursued a masters at NYU it would of been $50k a yr vs in Germany when I was accepted they asked for a 200 euro check covering administrative costs and said that would be all for the entire year. 

So idk, I would have to say you are misinformed about the superiority of the american education system ",1432612005,1393686713,t1_cfrq9fk,False,1393686916,1,t3_1z6mae,,,minitree,,1,t5_2qh1s,0,t1_cfrf9hp,0,cfrq9fk,True,,Economics,0

Paul Craig Roberts' capitalist credentials are impeccable. He was Ronald Reagan's Assistant Secretary to the US Treasury for fuck's sake. 

His point is that US policy in Ukraine is being driven by fantasy, and has delivered on a silver platter a gift to Russia that Putin could never have imagined accomplishing on his own in his wildest dreams: the riches of the Crimea.

With a Western backed anti-Russian dictatorship intalled in Kiev banning the use of the Russian language and threatening to kill Crimea's elected representatives, the majority ethnic Russian Crimeans were practically forced back into the Russian fold.

Now the pro-Western technocrat politicians like Yatseniuk will soon be killed or driven into exile by the fascist Pravy Sector who have total control over the people. 

Because of EuroMaidan, Russia re-gains Crimea and Western Ukraine becomes a xenophobic pariah state hostile to European values that they see as homosexual and degenerate.

"I'm a motion graphic designer at a company that started by providing custom music playlists for their clients but has since started to provide video and mobile solutions as well. We provide the music that is playing overhead. We install the video screens in the locations. And finally, we shoot and edit the video that plays on these monitors. I design and animate the graphics that accompany these videos.

**Pros:**

* Laid back work environment with flexible work schedule. There are four members in our department and we can cover each other if the other has to take a few days off. Hell, when I first started I took a month off to travel Europe. They filled my spot with a freelancer. Not to mention a 401K match by the employer and health and dental benefits...although not the greatest.

* A good variety of clients and styles to work with. It definitely keeps things fresh and interesting and adds variety to my reel.

* The team I work with are great. I work in an office of 25 people and I really do like everyone in the office. That's rare. Most of us are in our mid 20's - mid 30's and share a lot of things in common. Like I said before it's a music driven company and I'm very plugged in to the current music scene attending dozens of shows a year and multiple major festivals. Personally for me its a great fit.

**Cons:**

* Our sales people really do bend us over more often than not. These people have been selling music for years and do not know the first thing about video or gfx. It's not all their fault because they haven't been properly trained. But when I see a client giving us $330,000 for a package and then figuring out after breaking down man hours that we'll only profit around 20,000. That breaks my heart. We've also had a salesperson fail to tell us a video format was Vertical until the last 12 hours before the content went live. After that mess up and few others we lost the client. No idea how this man still has a job.

* We don't work with enough video footage. Usually the entire graphics package is designed from scratch (with client provided assets: Logo, Colors, Fonts) but we're never compositing with any video. It weakens my reel.

* We don't have a true Creative Director and upper management doesn't see the need for one. We have a director that leads our department, but I use ""lead"" very loosely. To be nice about it, a lot of puzzling and questionable decisions come from above that definitely makes me question my future with the company. There's also no path (junior &gt; mid &gt; senior &gt; art director &gt; creative director). So there's no where for me to go. That's depressing after giving so much time to the company.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutka#India

He's only banned it for consumption, not export, so farmers not affected adversely *inside* Gujarat. In context of the larger good, is it OK? You could go back to the gun rights argument. Is gun banning good or not? US given their armed freedom struggle and the wild west history, disagree esp. people of Repub origin. Europe, Australia think otherwise.

Is gutkha smoking harmful to people, especially uneducated people. For educated people, it's an informed choice. For others, its effects may not be easily reversible once consumed and addicted to. Other than tarnishing public spaces. I'd say let's give him the benefit of doubt seeing that India has a huge 'uneducated' population. And by that, I mean self-awareness, consciousness of individual responsibility to society. This as you know is missing in our society. We take severe restrictions to our freedom when survival is under threat. Why not here? In any case, the ban may only be temporary. As the populace gets self-aware, the ban will be organically reversed.

&gt;  Let's see more deregulation, instead of banning, then I might buy the idea of Modi.

He intends to do it. Let's see if it happens. And let's give him a chance. I've rarely seen public consciousness about politics ever activated to this level of information before. Modi has played a role in this.

&gt; This charade of nationalism and unity is another thing that bothers me.

See, the problem is this isn't as much about a forceful brainwash. It's more of a think about fellow society people. This seems stupid for people of our background, educated people who've had good upbringings. This isn't true for people from the north, UP and Bihar, who make the bulk of the electorate. They're shamelessly unethical and materialistic and they're finally realizing that they can't migrate to other places avoiding problems of their own place without causing problem to the receiving locale.

Modi's statement is take care of your own place, think of people around yourself. I think this is a very urgent need inside the country. Bangalore and the South is different. I'd say the South is easily the best developed place in the country. With outstandingly loyal, united peoples. This message isn't for them. It's for the northies.

"&gt; How would someone who's prefferred community type does not exist, or is too expensive to get to... Get to it?

The thing about that is this: communities are groups of people. If no one else wants to form the kind of community you want, you don't have the right to force them into it. Anarcho-capitalism is a form of individualist anarchism. We believe in the individual as the moral unit. Each person is sovereign unto themselves, rather than the community being sovereign. If other people don't want to do what you want, then too bad. You don't have to do what others want, but they don't have to do what you want either.

&gt;Is this not just a problem we have with states, just revamped up in private enterprise? 

There are two groups of ancaps. The Rothbardians, who come at this from an ethical view, and the consequentialists, who come at this from a, well, consequentialist view. As a Rothbardian, I believe violations of property are immoral. Not because of the consequences of doing so, but because they violate the moral rules I believe in.

A consequentialist would respond to your argument by talking about the benefits of anarcho-capitalism in comparison to states, but I'm not going to do that. I don't find that line of argument persuasive. A moral communist won't find an anarcho-capitalist society better. They would rather live in a cave and eat bugs as part of a communist society than live in an anarcho-capitalist society with all the modern conveniences.

Different people have different preferences. There are conflicts over scarce resources. That's why I believe in property rights as the moral rule: they give us a way to resolve these conflicts. We can know who has legitimate control and who doesn't. The rightful owner of any given physical good can refuse to use it whenever he pleases. He can refuse to trade it, he can refuse to use it, and he can destroy it. All as he sees fit. 

&gt;More than that, what we dont really realize yet, is that we have a private country here. That is, it actively seeks profit, money, and, due to private property rights, can exercise profitable laws without any input from a civilian body, just like modern states do.

I think you're equivocating here. It's not a ""private country"" as an ancap would prefer, since the state exercises control over resources it didn't homestead or gain control over in a voluntary exchange. The state gained control of its resources in a MASSIVE expropriation from Native Americans and from settlers who had homesteaded land that was abandoned due to the unfortunate plagues that were brought to the new world by Europeans. The state didn't acquire that land legitimately. It doesn't have a rightful claim over that land according to ancap thinking. It's not a ""private country."" It's a stolen country. All the state has is the result of theft.

&gt;Moreover, profitable policies most likely harmful to the public

If they violate private property, then they're not allowed. Ancaps believe that, as part of the ancap legal order, violations of private property won't be profitable.

&gt;What we have effectively created is crony cronyism with a trivial little label of ""voluntary"" since everything is private.

We want everything to be private. That's the goal. Inviolable control of scarce resources by their rightful owners. No slavery. No theft. No murder. This isn't a bug or even a feature. It's the entire point.

I'm sure you can find some consequentialists around here who will explain why an anarcho-capitalist society would be so great, and why you should want to live in it, but I'm not going to do that. I think slavery is immoral, so I want to live in a world without slavery. I think violations of private property are immoral, so I want to live in a world without violations of private property. I don't care what the consequences are. I don't care how high the price of cotton gets if you free the slaves. I don't care what happens to the economy of the south. I just want the slaves freed.

(And please keep in mind here that when we use the term 'private property,' we're not using that in the Marxist sense; to use, private property refers to ANY scarce resource. Your body is private property, your shoes are private property, your car is private property, the dirt at the farm is private property, and the machines they use to make potato chips are private property.)",1432612160,1393687875,t1_cfrqla0,False,False,2,t3_1z67uk,,Bastiat,BastiatFan,,2,t5_2qorf,0,t1_cfrq3u3,0,cfrqla0,True,bastiat,Anarcho_Capitalism,0

"UKIP have made similar arguments in the past, when the Greens got rather better coverage than they did.  See for example [this Commentator article](http://www.thecommentator.com/article/1125/bbc_green_with_envy_over_ukip_s_rise),
&gt; Then there's the interesting subplot of the London Mayoral and Assembly race. LBC radio, the London Evening Standard and the BBC have all looked to set the narrative: the race to win is between Boris and Livingstone, with the LibDems and Greens as a bit of fringe fun. Yet every single London poll carried out has had UKIP leading the Greens in the London race, indeed the Greens are on course to lose both of their Assembly seats and UKIP are on course to gain one or two. In a pretty shocking scene, Andrew Neil on the Daily Politics show noted that UKIP are outpolling the Green Party's Mayoral candidate Jenny Jones in London - before saying that he was looking forward to seeing her in Sunday's debate which, yup, excludes UKIP.  

Or [this Daniel Hannan column](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100004661/anti-ukip-and-pro-green-the-bbc-at-its-most-blatantly-biased/).
&gt; Several weeks ago, the BBC decided to start running stories about how well the Green Party would do at the Norwich North by-election. It is far from clear whether programme editors thought that this would happen anyway, or whether they hoped to make it happen. After all, what minority candidates most crave is airtime: to be treated as mainstream, and so to anticipate the ""wasted vote"" argument.

&gt; The BBC obliged. Lord, how it obliged. Throughout the campaign, it ran programmes with Conservative, Labour, LibDem and Green spokesmen. Now don't get me wrong: I rather like the Greens. But there was no basis to the claim that they were the fourth party, either nationally or locally. The last test of electoral feeling was June's European election. The United Kingdom Independence Party won 13 seats and came second; the Greens won two seats and came fifth. In local elections on the same day, UKIP beat the Greens in most Norwich North wards.",1432612202,1393688180,t1_cfrqoil,False,False,9,t3_1z9ac4,,,ieya404,,9,t5_2qhcv,0,t1_cfrorng,0,cfrqoil,True,,ukpolitics,0

It didn;t matter if we had mis-calculated or not, you still had a duty to protect other people who were innocent.

"Russia-China relations date back to the 17th century, after the conquest of Siberia by the Russian Empire gave them a border with the Qing Dynasty. Initially the Chinese were [hostile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian%E2%80%93Manchu_border_conflicts) to the Russian settlers, but eventually they made peace and established trade agreements.

Around the mid-1800s, what is known in China as the ""[Century of Humiliation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_humiliation)"" began, where China lost a number of wars against European powers, including Russia, and was forced to concede trading posts and spheres of influence to the Western Europeans, as well as land to Russia. Russia also participated in the crushing of the [Boxer Rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion) in 1899-1901, well-known for being the only war where all the great powers of the day fought on the same side (in this case, against China).

After the Russian Civil War, the Soviet Union supported the Chinese Communist Party in the [Chinese Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War), even helping establish the [Chinese Soviet Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Soviet_Republic), which was eventually destroyed by the nationalist Kuomintang. The USSR continued giving aid to the CCP throughout the war against Japan and the rest of the Civil War, however, including [destroying the Japanese army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria) in Manchuria in 1945 and ceding Manchuria to the CCP, which ultimately resulted in a Communist victory under the leadership of Mao Zedong, who was friendly with Stalin and based his ideology on Stalinist principles.

China and the Soviet Union were fairly friendly at first, and during the [Korean War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) the Soviets provided material and air support to China and North Korea. The USSR also helped China with their [nuclear weapons program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction). However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev's heavy anti-Stalinist stance drove a wedge between him and Mao, resulting in the [Sino-Soviet Split](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split), in which Sino-Soviet relations deteriorated to the point that the USSR actually considered a nuclear first strike against China to destroy its nuclear program, but the US threatened worldwide nuclear war if this occurred. After this, most of the Communist world aligned itself with either the USSR or China, most staying with the USSR, but others, notably Albania and Somalia, aligning with China.

China then pursued relations with the West instead, famously formalizing relations with the US in 1972 after Nixon's visit, opening up trade with the West, and pursuing [economic reforms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform) in 1978, which eventually led to it becoming the economic juggernaut it is today. Funnily enough, Soviet support of India in the [Sino-Indian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War) and the US's relations with Pakistan led to India establishing ties with the Soviet Union, leading to the amusing situation of the world's two most populous countries being a communist-aligned capitalist country and a capitalist-aligned communist country.

After the fall of the USSR and establishment of the Russian Federation, relations between the countries have significantly improved, and they are now quite close, with Putin even remarking last year that the countries were developing a ""special relationship"" (this term is often applied to the US-UK relationship). Russia is a large supplier of arms to China, as the EU and US have arms embargoes on China. Both countries are also members of the [Shanghai Cooperation Organisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation), a political, economic and military organization composed of China, Russia, and some former-Soviet Asian states. The two countries are known for being by far the two most powerful states that aren't aligned with the West, which often gives them common anti-Western geopolitical interests. So once again the countries have very close relations a la early Cold War - this time, however, China is the top dog rather than Russia.

In summary, China-Russia relations have been something of a seesaw throughout history, but for now they are very strong and continuing to grow stronger.
