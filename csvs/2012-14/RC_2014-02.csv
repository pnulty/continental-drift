&gt; 7 år. Så lång tid tar det från det att en invandrare får uppehållstillstånd tills dess att densamme har ett arbete, om man tar mediantiden som riktmärke.

&gt; Hälften av männen har jobb efter fem år. För kvinnorna är bilden ännu dystrare. Efter fem år i Sverige står nästan två av tre invandrarkvinnor fortfarande utan arbete. Och för en stor del tycks arbetslivet aldrig komma närmare hur lång tid som än går. Omkring var fjärde invandrare har efter nio år i Sverige fortfarande inte hittat sitt första jobb. -(SvD 27/11 2009)

Det går *framåt* inom vissa områden vad gäller att få ut folk i arbete, se t.ex [""Rekordmånga utlandsfödda får jobb""](http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/fler-jobb-gar-till-utrikes-fodda_7884918.svd) - SvD 4/2 2013), men läget är  fortfarande långt ifrån bra och det finns problem.

&gt; Sju av tio jobb går till utrikes födda, visar färsk statistik från SCB. Starkast är utvecklingen inom vården och restaurangsektorn. Samtidigt ökar klyftorna och facken får allt svårare att hävda kollektivavtal. 

&gt; /.../

&gt; Också LO ser positivt på att allt fler utlandsfödda etablerar sig på den svenska arbetsmarknaden. Men Thord Ingesson, organisationens migrationspolitiske expert, poängterar att integrationen är långt ifrån problemfri:

&gt; – Vi vet att fattigdomen i Sverige har en etnisk dimension, där en majoritet av dem som betraktas som fattiga och har försörjningsstöd en längre tid är personer som är födda utomlands.

&gt; Dessutom ökar klyftorna, även i gruppen invandrare, menar han:

&gt; – Mörka och icke kristna personer har svårare att få jobb. Om du kommer från Afrika och Mellanöstern löper du stor risk att bli diskriminerad.

---

Från din länk:

&gt; – ""Alla utrikes födda som kommer till Sverige lever på bidrag""

&gt; Det stämmer inte. Majoriteten av dem som fick uppehållstillstånd under 2012 lever inte på bidrag. De är t.ex. arbetskraftsinvandrare, studenter, EES/EU-medborgare och deras anhöriga som oftast har en försörjning när de kommer till Sverige. Under 2012 var över 700 000 utrikes födda personer sysselsatta. Men det tar fortfarande alltför lång tid för nyanlända flyktingar att komma in på arbetsmarknaden.

Klart som fan att det inte är sant att ""alla"" är arbetslösa, det finns det väl ingen frisk människa som påstår; men det är också lite fusk att ta med regelrätta arbetskraftsinvandrare, utbytesstudenter, samt o.s.v i beräkningen för att försköna siffrorna. Om man granskar påståendet här så påstås att 700.000 utlandsfödda var sysselsatta 2012. Det *låter* ju bra, men då bör man också nämna att vi har över 1.400.000 utlandsfödda i landet, vilket innebär att varannan är utan sysselsättning, och det är INKLUSIVE regelrätta arbetskraftsinvandrare, utbytesstudenter, och även danskar, norrmänn, finnar som helt enkelt bosatt sig på andra sidan gränsen, o.s.v.

""Sysselsättning"" behöver heller inte ens betyda arbete. Även om alliansregeringen själva försökt göra statistiken mer transparent efter att ha anklagat den tidigare regeringen för att fuska med arbetslöshetsstatistik genom att gömma folk i arbetsmarknadspolitiska åtgärder o.s.v så tycker jag personligen inte att sidan du länkar till är helt ärlig.

You go around plundering ships and upgrading your ship and doing quests and exploring the world, eventually getting an island base, recruiting a full crew, and building your own armada.

[Eternal Darkness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Darkness:_Sanity%27s_Requiem) + [LA Noire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Noire). You're a detective in early 20th century London, with a twist - you're part of a secret order that investigates supernatural crimes. Interrogate witnesses, collect clues, and do research on what type of Lovecraftian horror you're tracking down, and ultimately defeat it in combat. Along with health and magic power, you also have a sanity meter that rises as you investigate and come in contact with enemies. You have to make use of both magic and food/medical items to keep yourself healthy, and use artifacts and modern weapons to kill enemies. Go insane and you won't necessarily die right away, but weird shit will happen and you might end up getting your mind devoured.

[Splinter Cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell) + [Mass Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_%28series%29). You're a Spectre in the Mass Effect universe and your mission is to infiltrate high-danger areas and capture/assassinate high-value targets. You're not a commando like Shepard and your goal isn't to just murder everyone you see - if you do your job right, no one should ever know you were there at all. Play as an asari commando, a turian soldier, a human infiltrator, etc. and use biotics, tech powers, and all kinds of high-tech weapons at your disposal to get the job done.

Instead of magnetic capes and spikes on your gauntlets, you have an Iron Man-esque suit with tons of gadgets at your disposal. Instead of Alfred, you have an elderly Bruce Wayne. Instead of normal human goons on the streets, you have to deal with Splicers and Jokerz. Explore Gotham (as in, the whole city, not just an area like Arkham City), upgrade your suit and gadgets, and fight crime in a world where super advanced technology means any random asshole can be a supervillain. Also, the language has evolved and now includes words like ""schway"" and ""twip"".

Your fully customizable character discovers that they can do magic... so off you go to wizard school! Go to class, learn magic spells, explore the university grounds, get weapons, armor, and equipment, slay monsters, and of course, go to school events, find a girlfriend/boyfriend, and improve your character's skills. Pay attention in class and get good grades, or cut class entirely and join school factions or play magic sports. Ultimately your goal is to graduate, but of course it's all about the journey.

Travel back and forth through time and try to prevent future murders from ever taking place. Your actions in the past change events in all future timelines and create an intricate branching tree of possible timelines where all but one possible outcome is totally fucked. Like in Majora's Mask, complete quests that make characters like you and give you valuable information that you can use in alternate timelines. With your knowledge of shit that has never happened (in this reality, anyways), you can be in the right place at the right time, all the time. And if you fuck up, you can just go back and reset everything.

You're an up-and-coming vampire in a city of clans. At the start you've just turned and you're weak and ignorant in the world of vampire politics, but because you're a fucking badass you start killing your way to the top. Your enemies include not just supernatural threats like werewolves, sorcerers, and rival vampire clans, but also law enforcement, government agencies, and of course, superpowered vampire hunters like Buffy. Explore an open-world where you do crimes to get money to buy guns and upgrade your vampire dwelling, but also kill high-power targets and drain their blood to upgrade your vampire powers. Build up your own vampire clan and eventually take over the city, Saint's Row style.

[King of Dragon Pass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Dragon_Pass) + [Alpha Centauri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Alpha_Centauri). You're the leader of a new colony on some distant planet. The planet's definitely livable, but it'll take a bit of work. In addition to maintaining the basics of your city like food production, keeping your citizens entertained, and dealing with political groups that can't stop being pissed off at you, you also have to deal with the dangers of the planet: hostile wildlife, natural catastrophes, and constant raids by the indigenous aliens. And of course, there will always be random events beyond your control: Eobard the biologist found a glowing plant that a nearby alien tribe believes is sacred, but he says can have medicinal properties! Do you A: take it back to base for research, B: give the plant to the aliens, or whatever else?! Just pretend you're the company leader dude from Avatar!

You're the commander on an Imperial planet that trains Space Marine recruits and some serious shit goes down: your planet gets attacked by motherfucking Tyranids. You have to use your newly-recruited, barely-trained Space Marines in combat to defend the colonies on the planet, use funding to build up your base, research new weapons and vehicles, and take the fight to the hive fleet. As your Space Marines grow in experience and level up, they become specialized as Assault Marines, Devastator Marines, Librarians, etc and gain new abilities. You are limited in resources: do you want to use your 40 units of whatever to unlock the cloaking upgrade for your Scout Marines, or do you want to unlock the expensive but awesome Dreadnought?! Over time the Tyranids deploy more and more powerful units: remember the first time you saw a Sectopod in XCOM: EU and replace that with a Carnifex. Of course, as time goes on and the invasion ramps up, all kinds of shit gets fucked up: you start having to fend off Ork and Dark Eldar raids, unroot and kill Chaos traitors within your ranks, and even investigate a hidden Eldar plot. See it turns out, your planet is a Necron tomb world. Become the most badass Space Marine commander ever and secure the safety of your planet by killing everyone who dares to oppose you.

It was a highly controversial instance of the Atlantic Revolutions of the era. Historian François Aulard writes:
From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.""[1]
Popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy, aristocracy and the King's court at Versailles combined with an economic crisis following the expenses of the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War and years of bad harvests motivated demands for change, which were couched in terms of Enlightenment ideals and caused the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789. The first year of the Revolution saw members of the Third Estate proclaiming the Tennis Court Oath in June, the assault on the Bastille in July, the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August, and an epic march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. The next few years were dominated by struggles between various liberal assemblies and right-wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. A republic was proclaimed in September 1792 and King Louis XVI was executed the next year.
External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars began in 1792 and ultimately featured spectacular French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine – achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalized the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins. The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 until 1794, caused up to 40,000 deaths inside France,[2] abolished slavery in the colonies, and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies. The Reign of Terror ended with the overthrow and execution of Robespierre and the other leading Jacobins in the Thermidorian Reaction. The Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 and held power until 1799. In that year, conventionally seen as the conclusion of the Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the Directory in the coup of 18 Brumaire and established the Consulate. The First Empire under Napoleon emerged in 1804 and spread French revolutionary principles all over Europe during the Napoleonic Wars. The First Empire was militarily defeated by an anti-Napoleonic coalition that in 1815 brought about the restoration of the Bourbons, albeit under a constitutional monarchy, and the reversion to France's traditional frontiers.
The modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. French society itself underwent an epic transformation as feudal, aristocratic, and religious privileges were overthrown. Old ideas about tradition and hierarchy were abruptly overthrown under the mantra of ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité,"" although opponents fought furiously against this for more than a century. Globally, the Revolution accelerated the rise of republics and democracies, the spread of liberalism, nationalism, socialism and secularism, the development of modern political ideologies, and the practice of total war.[3] Some of its central documents, like the Declaration of the Rights of Man, expanded the arena of human rights to include women and slaves.[4] The fallout from the Revolution had permanent consequences for human history: the Latin American independence wars, the Louisiana Purchase by the United States, and the Revolutions of 1848 are just a few of the numerous events that ultimately depended upon the eruption of 1789.

While ""home schooling"" is illegal and schooling is compulsory, the parents still have every chance to fuck up their offsprings' future - intentionally and unintentionally.

Oh, wow.  Well Germany still is better, because I don't represent the worst case scenario in the US, as I had friends growing up who were homeless kids.  

&gt;Germany generally has no school lunches or afternoon schooling either (school starts early ~8am and ends early ~2pm), so that would have caused even worse problems for you and your mother, making it even harder for her to earn a living.

Runs around the same time our grade schools do, if I remember correctly, and again I think I gave a false impression.  My mom never had a job when I was growing up, she was a total mooch.  Now there's no public assistance really to mooch off of here, and bizarrely she never even took advantage of things like SNAP when I was a kid, but she'd find men to suck money out of.  I know I sound like a shitty person, but my mom was just not fit for parenting.

School lunches tasted like dogshit, but it was sometimes the only thing I had to eat, so I am kind of grateful they existed.

&gt;The amount even increases with every child. Assuming that you and all of your siblings are under 25 years of age and still receiving an education that would currently amount to: 184€+184€+190€+215€+215€+215€+215€=1418€ per month (in 2013), that's roughly $1910 per month in addition to your mother's income and/or welfare.

Okay, now I'm jealous.  I'm only 24 and I could really use that money, especially given how expensive college is here.  You guys really have extensive cash assistance like that?

&gt; While that may sound like a lot, realistically it costs a whole lot more than $250 to feed and properly raise a child per month. I honestly don't see how it would be possible for a single mother to properly raise seven children in the US or Germany without her and her children drifting into poverty, even with additional financial support.

Well, to be fair, a few were taken by the state, and one was raised most of the time by her dad (my half sister) so she was usually just raising three kids on her own.  Still managed to get us all into a dire financial situation.

&gt;Jobs don't necessarily pay more, some do, some pay even less than in the US. Up until now Germany doesn't even have any minimum wage laws, that's going to change soon, however (with a proposed minimum of 8.50€/~$11.50 and several exceptions). Taxes are significantly higher as well, so at the end of the month you'd probably get less in you bank than for comparable work in the US as well (although this is much less notable in the lower income brackets).

Interesting, because here in the US there's a big fight about raising the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour, especially up in Seattle where the newly Socialist party members are heavily pushing for it.  I'm kind of surprised Germany isn't ahead of us in that regard, usually the stereotype is Western Europe is.

&gt;But you would receive significant benefits that would reduce your cost of living so massively that you would generally end up with more disposable income for the same amount of low income work.

The only assistance I receive is some financial aid that gets gobbled up by expensive textbooks and transportation costs, so I guess I was born in the wrong country.

&gt;The German school system isn't all that terribly great at it either, at least for anything other than academia. Remember, there is even less of a focus on ""practical"" and ""vocational"" classes on any level during secondary schooling. The skills acquired on a Hauptschule are nearly worthless on the current job market.
And while less and less children are ""streamed"" towards such a school every year, I think we're still failing a significant amount of children.

It seems to no longer understand that in order to have freedom, some freedom must be given up (e.g., I can't murder you, you can't murder me - we give up some freedom here, but ultimately it's a gain).

I do agree with what you said about the Force being really powerful, but what I'm saying is that the Force does not ""grant"" it's power onto any old Force user. And Force users shouldn't just be blessed with unspeakable powers either (Skywalkers being an exception). 

Like Qui-Gon said, a Jedi needs to learn to communicate with the living Force; in order to harness it's power, you have to give something back to the Force. That's the Jedi philosophy anyway. On the other hand, the Sith are all about controlling the Force, breaking it, and commanding it to do their bidding. While the Force may allow them to use any power that they may gain for a time, after a while, the Force will balance things out by destroying that Sith. The Force is all about balance.

The key question is - In what way have you invented something?
To get patent protection in AU you need to have produced a program. It also needs to be novel, involve an inventive step and have some form of application for business or industry.

Generally speaking, computer generated code (as I assume, again with limited knowledge) that your site will run on is classed as a literary work and therefore only protected by copyright. Which is automatic so you don't really need to *do* anything except exert your rights if something comes up.  

So the short answer is that no-one can tell you unless you divulge a little more about how what you're talking about actually operates and what manner of thing it is. If you're serious about monetising it I would advise that you seek professional council. 

Also worth considering - patents are pretty fucking expensive, there's a lengthy process and then you have to pay (I think yearly) fees. They also only protect your invention in the jurisdiction you register it in. This is a big problem for online things because they are available in many other jurisdictions.

Rugby is played in Aviva Stadium (bigger matches) or the RDS in Donnybrook.

*Here's the linked section [Viking and Middle Ages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark#Viking and Middle Ages) from Wikipedia article [Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark)* : 

---

&gt;From the 8th to the 10th century, the Danes, which included Norwegians and Swedes, were known as Vikings. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. Viking explorers first discovered Iceland by accident in the 9th century, on the way towards the Faroe Islands and eventually came across ""Vinland"" (Land of wine), also known today as Newfoundland, a province in Canada. The Danish Vikings were most active in the British Isles and Western Europe. They conquered and settled parts of England (known as the Danelaw) under King Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013, Ireland, and France where they founded Normandy. More Anglo-Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.

&gt;As attested by the Jelling stones, the Danes were united and Christianised about 965 by Harald Bluetooth. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising Christian power in Europe, Germania, which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke. In the early 11th century, Canute the Great won and united Denmark, England, and Norway for almost 30 years.

&gt;Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, Denmark also included Skåneland (Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge) and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia, as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Most of the latter two now form the state of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany.

-- It's a well settled matter of law that any European Citizen may receive any satellite signal from any Europe an provider and watch any content provided over that signal. There are numerous examples in the case law of both the European Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice which provide the evidence for this.

-- The Premier League's claim to copyright has to be balanced against the rights of European Citizens above. At best, their argument that a copyright claim should be held above those rights is **at best** ambitious - although it'll probably have to go to the ECJ for a decision in the next couple of years in the absence of primary legislation.

-- Means: it is absolutely currently legal for a pub, using a satellite dish and having an appropriate regard to any relevant subscription for the services, to transmit EPL matches in their venues. If you don't believe me, you're welcome to search for the relevant case law here: http://curia.europa.eu/juris/recherche.jsf

-- Even if it were not legal, copyright infringement is usually dealt with as a civil matter and even where there is criminal liability (you'd require 'willful infringement for a commercial purpose'), prosecutions are generally taken by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) and investigations aren't usually taken by Police and certainly the CPS don't prosecute them.  You can see an example of a prosecution taken by FACT against a Newcastle Landlord (for a dodgy sky box) here: http://www.fact-uk.org.uk/newcastle-licensee-ordered-to-pay-over-9500-for-illegal-sky-use/

-- So the police are supposedly investigating a legal activity, where, even if it were illegal, is usually investigated and prosecuted by another body entirely. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions about that, but it is absolutely possible that the Police are using their oversight role in licensing law to pressure pubs into not showing the match in an attempt to have fewer drinkers and therefore fewer instances of disorder.

-- As I'll come to later, reducing disorder is an admirable aim, but it's worth noting that the worst disorder in years occurred last year with an early kickoff and it is at least debatable that having early kickoffs reduces or minimizes disorder.

-- If reducing disorder is their legitimate aim, why not work with pubs and partners to do something about disorder, rather than making thinly veiled threats of unnamed consequences. Landlords and 99.99999% of the drinkers in any given pub don't want disorder either.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The Police can move the timing of fixtures. Well, actually they can't, they can only make representations to all the parties about the time.

-- However, when that representation basically says 'move the game, or we will not police the match', the Clubs always comply. Every. Single. Time.

-- There is no specific power for the police to insist that a match is not televised, although I imagine if they really wanted to, there might be a general power they could make use of - but this isn't what happened in this case.

-- There are specific times at which it is agreed between the broadcasters and the EPL games can be shown. It's why, for example, you never see a 3pm kickoff on a Saturday. Thus there are only so many slots you can have. You'll also note that there are never two competing games being shown (final day of the season an exception).

-- In January 2013, Northumbria Police wrote to the FA informing them that they would not support a derby kick off later than 1:30pm. Means: even though the clubs **pay handsomely** for the police support, they will not police a derby game later than time, severly restricting the 'slots' the game can fit into for live television broadcast in the UK.

-- This particular slot already had another game (scheduled by BTSports) assigned to it when the fixture was, once again, moved.

-- Northumbria Police also insisted on making the match a 'bubble' match, making it hard for SAFC supporters to get to SJP to enjoy one of the best football matches of the year for both sides.

-- Fans were, as you might imagine, up in arms about the game not being on TV because of the timing and the difficult travel arrangements, sought clarification from Northumbria Police.

-- Assistant chief constable Jo Farrell then said on Northumbria Police's website:

&gt; ""As we have said previously Northumbria Police cannot direct changes to kick-off times or control the issue of tickets and how supporters travel to matches.""

-- The clubs then released a joint statement which basically demonstrated that this statement was nothing like the reality of planning for a derby day fixture in recent years. You can read that statement on several news sources, I like the Guardian, so I'll link to that one here, but there are several others:  http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/07/newcastle-sunderland-police-kick-off-times

-- In that statement, they also informed Northumbria Police that in light of their position on kick off times and other issues, the clubs will inform the authorities that all games are now available at times to benefit the clubs, the league and the broadcasters. 

-- Time will tell whether that is indeed the case, but I do rather suspect that Northumbria Police will once again announce a restriction for next season. They seem to be the only force in the country incapable of policing a derby day game at any reasonable time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- I understand that Northumbria Police want to reduce the risk and number of instances of football related disorder before, during and after the full time whistle in the derby.

-- This is especially important for them in the light of the problems last year - again, completely understandable.

-- Why wouldn't they just say that? Instead, they tried to pass the buck to the clubs, league and broadcasters when fans had legitimate concerns about the kickoff time and method of transport being imposed. They went to tell a small lie and expected the clubs to roll over. In this case, the clubs didn't, and went on the offensive, standing up for the fans. This caught Northumbria Police offguard and left them with a PR disaster, so they did what every public body does in a PR disaster. Nothing. No apology, clarification follow up on or retraction of Asst CC Farrell's comments. Nothing.

True, but this is neglecting the trans-Saharan trade that the triangular relationship replaced.  For many centuries, desert caravans traveled to cities such as Timbuktu, to the empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai, and later, to the kingdoms of the Igbo and Ashante.  The widespread use in medieval western Africa of Cowrie shells (which come from the Indian Ocean) show that they were in frequent contact with eastern tradegoods.  There was a rich exchange of cultures and goods between sub-saharan Africa and eastern kingdoms -- we just kinda ignore it most of the time, because we care more about Europe.

&gt;And even in terms of amount of people displaced and its effects were relatively minor compared to what the Mongols did through force what ever caused all the tribes to start migrating at the end of the Roman era 

The transatlantic slave trade sent about 10 million Africans across the atlantic, and displaced about 30 million people within Africa.  To put that in context, the Huns (to whom you are actually referring if your ""roman era"" remark was intentional) raided an area containing a total of about 15 million people (this would have been much higher had they not been halted at Constantinople -- the peninsula held almost 10 million people by itself).  The total displacement of people was far less significant than the cultural impact thereof.  Note that the huns were also but one of many nomadic groups moving at the time -- the conquering confederacy of the Sakae in India which grew into its own empire, for instance.  Or the Kingdom of Khotan, which grew up along the silk road.  Many central asian peoples floated about in that time, some of them just as influential as the huns (but again, affecting non-European countries, so no history books).

&gt;or how the Han Chinese displaced/replaced massive amounts of people relatively peacefully over the course of 2000 years in China (eg the Thai people originally lived in Southern China).

If we're going to look at millennia, we ought to look at comparable movements -- for instance, the spread of Bantu culture out of the Niger river basin to reach the southernmost tip of Africa - three times that journey (3000 mi) over the same period.

---

Even if your examples were better, what you're proving with references to other cultures moving huge amounts of people over great distances is that it can be done.  The Chinese traded with the Romans.  Early Islamic powers conquered Indonesia.  That shit is crazypants.

While river and shallow sea navigation was much, much faster than land or open ocean until about the 18th century, there's no reason to suggest that overland travel didn't happen, nor that, when faced with a world in which navigable seas like the mediterranean and indian ocean do not facilitate trade, people wouldn't ""find a way.""",1391217924,4,4,0,AskReddit

I can barely figure out what the fuck you are trying to say in the last two paragraphs. The industrial revolution wasn't influenced in any way by the relative freeing of markets? Really?

&gt;You know whose quality of life improved 1500-2000% between the 19th and 20th Centuries? The citizens of the United Soviet States of Russia.

Wait, ""between"" the 19th and 20th centuries when there was still a czar and private capital?

If that was a mistake and you meant the 20th century alone, then no, the USSR lied about their GDP numbers and couldn't even make tractors with working engines. People still starved even with aid from the West.

&gt;Hell, half the time the Soviets were actually beating us to the R&amp;D punch.

That's easy when you have control over an entire economy and can just funnel foreign aid toward R&amp;D rather than, you know, feeding people.

&gt;Everything from interchangeable parts to railroad constructions to electrification to nuclear power to satellite technology was pioneered first and foremost by government-employed engineers and scientists. 

And the vast majority of things weren't. Most of what the government developed was to fulfill spying and destruction needs. Satellites and nuclear power come to mind. No real market application there. The market *was* able to figure out how to make actual productive uses of these destructive devices, however. With that in mind, I'm far more impressed with the market's creativity here.",1391218498,0,0,0,Libertarian

At first occupied and later as a sovereign state and allied there was still a lot of distrust in the western world. While being economically and military dependent on the NATO western Germany opposed the Eastern Bloc but when things (almost) escalated in the late 50s and early 60s it was time for a change in foreign policies.

The new introduced [Ostpolitik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostpolitik)	was a balancing act between NATO interests and befriending the eastern states especially Poland.

A GCHQ (British) program stores every single bit of data that moves through the country for 3 days to be sifted through. Sweden legally is allowed to access any data that crosses its borders. This might not sound like a big deal for you in Germany, but many companies have their servers in Northern Sweden to save on cooling costs. So you could be accessing a .de website, but it could very well be hosted in Sweden. Even if European programs are mostly focused on their own countries, it seems like sharing is commonplace. 

Good things are happening regarding the NSA program. A federal judge called it ""likely unconstitutional"" (several lawsuits were filed), a White House Panel tasked with evaluating their activities also called it ""likely unconstitutional"". So hopefully things are going in the right direction. All of these programs need to be tackled though if we truly want to stop it. If the NSA stops, but most of the same information is available from another source, like the GCHQ, it wont be very effective.

&gt;There are questions as to whether Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century, two centuries before Captain James Cook's first documented visit in 1778. Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 bound for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports seemed to describe the discovery of Hawaii or the Marshall Islands.[58] If it was Hawaii, Gaetano would have been the first European to find the islands. Some scholars have dismissed these claims as lacking credibility.[59][60] However, Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands in the latitude of Hawaii but with the longitude ten degrees east of the Islands. In this manuscript, the Island of Maui is named ""La Desgraciada"" (the unfortunate), and what appears to be the Island of Hawaii is named ""La Mesa"" (the table). Islands resembling Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai are named ""Los Monjes"" (the monks).[61] For two and a half centuries Spanish galleons crossed the Pacific along a route that passed south of Hawaii on their way to Manila. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers.

In winning the old Division One title, we achieved the most consecutive league victories from the start of a season, winning 11 games - starting with a 2-0 triumph over Everton at White Hart Lane on August 20, 1960, through to a 4-0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on October 1, 1960. It is a top flight record that still stands to this day.

**Most League Wins in a Season**

The Double-winning season of 1960-61 saw Spurs rack up 31 wins in 42 league matches, which remains a record number of victories for a club in one top-flight season.

**Scorers of the Fastest Premier League Goal**

Our former club skipper Ledley King managed a remarkable feat in a Premier League game at Bradford City’s Valley Parade on December 9, 2000. Picking up on a loose ball, King’s shot from around 30 yards deflected past Bantams keeper Matthew Clarke. Crossing the line on 9.7 seconds, Ledley’s goal remains the fastest scored in Premier League history. 

**Fire Success**

We lay claim to scoring the most goals in fastest succession in Premier League history. Strikes from Darren Anderton, Nick Barmby and a brace from Teddy Sheringham were all scored inside a period of four minutes and 44 seconds during the second half of our home match against Southampton on February 7, 1993, setting us on our way to a 4-2 win.

**European Trailblazers**

Our long and illustrious history in European competitions is well known. In 1963, our 5-1 Cup Winners’ Cup Final victory over Atletico Madrid in Rotterdam saw us become the first British team to win a major European trophy. In 1972, we became the first club to win the UEFA Cup (now UEFA Europa League) with a 3-2 aggregate win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. This also made us the first British team to win two different European competitions.

**Played Most Games in the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europe League**

We have played more matches in the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League than any other British club, appearing in 106 matches of which we have won 59 games, drawn 29 and lost 18. We have won the tournament in 1972 and 1984 and reached the final in 1974. 
 
**Most Consecutive European Victories**
We hold the record of most consecutive matches won by a British team in a European competition. This achievement was made as we won eight matches in a row in the UEFA Cup in season 2006-07 starting with our 1-0 win away to Slavia Prague on September 14, 2006, through to our 3-2 triumph at home to SC Braga on March 8, 2007.*(this might actually be broken this season)*
  
**Top Scorers in Europe**

We are the most prolific goal scorers of any English club in Europe, finding the back of the net 2.1 times on average in each European game. In a total of 163 European matches played to date, we have scored a total of 329 goals. During our UEFA Champion League campaign of 2010-11, we also became the first ever club from any country to score two or more goals in every group game as we topped Group A.

**Only Non-League Winners of the FA Cup**

We were the first and remain the only non-league side ever to win the FA Cup, lifting the famous trophy after a 3-1 final replay victory over Sheffield United on April 27, 1901. Our team, featuring players like John Cameron, Sandy Brown and Tom Smith, was a Southern League side at the time.

**Most England Goals**

We boast the highest number of goals scored by our players representing England than any club in the country. The likes of Jimmy Greaves, Gary Lineker, Teddy Sheringham and Jermain Defoe have contributed to a grand total of 171 goals scored for the Three Lions by Tottenham players over the years. Greaves has scored more goals for England than any of our other players, with 28 of his 44 goals for his country coming while he also wore the white shirt of Spurs.

&gt; Even the United States government has admitted that some of its elements took part in ""ethnic cleansing"".

Of course. History has proven that no occupation lasts forever. However, if you wipe out the indigenous population. You are no longer occupying. 

Lets not kid ourselves...

- Long before there was ever an intentional spread of disease by America, settlers landing on the East Coast of America 200 years prior spread it by simple contact. People who landed in the 1500s were shocked when they returned and 80% of the population of native Americans had disappeared from what is now the new england states. So yes they came to America met the natives, returned to europe to report their finds, came back and everyone was gone. So why not settle and claim the empty lands? 

- Western/Asian/European civilization was coming to the American continents one way or another. No civilization was going to let two continents stand virtually untouched because it was the sparsely populated tribe land. It just so happens that the discovery of the Americas happened during the Spanish/English Empires Reign instead of say the Chinese (before isolationism) or the pursian, romans or egyptians. Any one of those peoples can and would have done the same thing. So lets not pretend euorpeans are some type of special evil

-  Native Americans were warring, slaving, and robbing each other for 50,000 years before a white man ever set foot on America. Warring tribes was the very reason the Anasazi /Pueblo People built cliff dwellings so far away from ariable land. Raiding was a way of life in America South West and was exasperated by the immigration of Utes, Shoshone, , Pauite out of California onto Pueblo Land. And all of this over stressed the environment and the people resorted to cannabalism.....so lets drop the noble savage myth...especially with the mayans, inca, and aztecs...and that dances with wolves bullshit....the lakota/souix were one of the biggest land grabbing/warring tribes that existed

- The only reason American push west seems worse than what native americans were doing to each other is because it was done at once by a single monolithic civilization within the time span of 200 years instead of piece mail by 1,000 different tribes over 10,000 years.

- And people often take the treatment by the spanish of Caribbean indigenous people as indicative of english and french treatment of native americans and this simply isn't true. The spanish rolled into south america and wiped out everyone. The english and french regularly traded and lived side by side with indians. In fact at one point in the southern colonies it was made illegal upon pain of death to leave the english way of life and go native. During the fledgling beginning of the united states was formed a city of approximately 10,000 native americans, run away slaves, and free english settlers in the ohio valley was wiped out to the last man woman and child for having the audactiy to coexist peacefully. So we can also quit pretending that europeans were a barbarian horde who started cutting down native americans as soon as the ramp dropped on their ships. Let's also throw away the idea that europeans came to America for the sole purpose of killing others and taking their land. Most were fleeing destitution, oppression and prosecution and were dying along the way. 

- Hatred for the Native American was institutionalized through propaganda and law. Whites would be punished for trading with them, villages would be burned to the ground for housing runaway slaves, etc. And this was all exasperated by the native americans who thought they could fight back. But many tribes didn't differentiate/understand the government and settlers. They went after everyone. 


- Hunter/Gather is the least effective use of land save no use what so ever. Lamenting the loss of the hunter/gather is like lamenting the loss of the buggy whip to the motor vehicle. The Native Americans biggest sin was learning nothing about the new American way of life and not replicating that industry on their holdings. Instead they rejected attempts at integration/acclimatization, they rejected changing their way of life to a more western style, and chose to remain hunter gathers. And if there is one rule on planet earth it is, adapt or die, they chose to die, fighting....and that is exactly what happened. 

- Lets also quit applying 21st century morals on  a 16th-19th century world. We have grown as a planet more in the last 100 years than we did in the previous 1,000. The two are not comparable. The amount of violence, war, and blood shed of the time is unfathomable to any one living today.

* If you find yourself in Allentown (you'll know if you find yourself surrounded by hipsters) check out Fat Bob's Smoke House, Coulter Bay, or my personal favorite: Allen Street Hardware Cafe.

* Downtown you have Pearl Street Grill and Brewery, and Pan American Grill and Brewery. Personally I prefer Pan American, but either are pretty nice places with great ambiance.

In Buffalo Southerntier and Flying Bison are king.

If you find anything from Community Beer works, its a must try (look them up!), their brewing capacity is small and it goes fast.

What you failed to mention of the scalability of the respective sports. First off, the future of the NFL is in trouble, IMO. It is the most dangerous sport, yet not a heck of a lot of players have guaranteed money. Players are an injury away of having to hang it up forever. Every sport has injuries, but not every sport has the injuries the NFL has. Current and former players are trying to sue the league for gods sake. 

These guys are like human weapons and they can only change the rules so much before it degrades the game. More and more parents are not allowing their kids to play football at a young age. The average NFL career has to be the lowest in any sport. I enjoy watching specific players in sports. One day, your favorite player could be playing well, the next day he could have gone down with a career ending injury or he could be just cut.

Every sport has prima donnas and some generally immoral people, but the NFL seems to have the most. I may have selective memory, but it seems like the NFL has the most off field bullshit going on. It seems like every season, some high profile NFL player is in the news for something horrible. It seems like it is perfectly okay to purposely injure players, until the media finds out. Also, some of the rules are so fuckin' hazy. Holding isn't allowed, but it essentially happens on every play. Also, some of the fans are just fuckin ridiculous. There are crazy fans in most sports, but the testosterone laced NFL seems to have the most.

A football game has like 15 minutes of actual football. Lots and lots of waiting around. Soccer reins supreme in Europe because the action is constantly happening. 45 mins of action, a break, then 45 more minutes. I was listening to a european sports podcast and they were talking about the stop and go nature of the sport. I just don't see Football sticking anywhere but here. Basketball, on the other hand, is turning into a global sport. The talent level around the world keeps increasing. Look at the influx of players from all over the world. As long as the refs keep the whistles in their mouths, basketball flows so well and awesome plays happen so often. The NFL doesn't seem to have as many highlight plays, IMO.

I'm not going to stop watching the NFL, because I'm a huge sports fan, but every season I always find myself questioning why I watch. I absolutely love the NBA and it grows every day. The NBA has wayyyy better marketing than the NFL. There are a few things the NBA can clean up, but I have very little to complain about with the NBA product. I honestly think the NBA will continue to grow and I also think soccer will eventually get more popular in the US.",1391224139,16,16,0,nba

*Here's the linked section [Changelings in other countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling#Changelings in other countries) from Wikipedia article [Changeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling)* :

&gt;The ogbanje (pronounced similar to ""oh-BWAN-jeh"") is a term meaning ""child who comes and goes"" among the Igbo people of eastern Nigeria. When a woman would have numerous children either stillborn or die early in infancy, the traditional belief was that it was a malicious spirit that was being reincarnated over and over again to torment the afflicted mother. One of the most commonly prescribed methods for ridding one's self of an ogbanje was to find its iyi-uwa, a buried object that ties the evil spirit to the mortal world, and destroy it.

&gt;Many scholars now believe that ogbanje stories were attempting to explain children with sickle-cell anemia, which is endemic to West Africa and afflicts around one-quarter of the population. Even today, and especially in areas of Africa lacking medical resources, infant death is common for children born with severe sickle-cell anemia.

&gt;The similarity between the European changeling and the Igbo ogbanje is striking enough that Igbos themselves often translate the word into English as ""changeling"".

&gt;Aswangs, a kind of ghoul from Filipino folklore, are also sometimes said to leave behind duplicates of their victims made of plant matter. Like the stocks of European fairy folklore, the Aswang's plant duplicates soon appear to sicken and die.

To draw out a few more:

* Trade would've started at the same time and would occur *along rivers and bodies of water* just as in OTL. Except in ridiculously expensive and exotic luxury items, extensive trade does not occur *over land* before the development of the internal combustion engine because it's ridiculously overpriced. (Each camel/donkey has to carry its cargo plus food for its minders plus food for its defensive staff plus&amp;mdash;given harsh interior terrain&amp;mdash;food for itself. In settled areas with forage, the caravan simply can't pass and has to sell its wares to local merchants to pass it on with a mark up.)

* If the map could be taken at face value, the major civilizations would have grown up along the major waterways between the ""continental"" bodies, especially at temperate-zone choke points like Mogadishu and New Constantinople where there's an isthmus between two water networks. Since they kept the current broken boundaries, Europe, Central America, and southern India all look likely. The civs wouldn't've been any more short-lived than OTL, but the steppelands of Canada and Brazil would be the new source of barbarian horsemen (assuming we're keeping our fauna).

* The map can't be taken at face value: it shows modern river systems (e.g. in China) that are dependent for their existence on yet-non-existant mountain systems (e.g. the Himalayas). The continental boundaries are generally done as lakes and rivers between our modern borders but that's almost nonsensical: even timing things for just when things were starting to break up, the borders wouldn't've been this neat. To take a small example, the Chinese plains east (here, north) of Xi'an have been created since the time of Pangaea by the deposit of sediment from the Loess Plateau and (to a lesser extent) Sichuan. Bangladesh &amp;c. &amp;c. didn't exist.

* We actually **do** have the information on what the coastlines and borders *really* looked like during ancient times. No one (except the NSA?) has access to all the data, though, because it's in the form of proprietary and incredibly valuable geologic/seismic surveys needful for finding oil and minerals.

* Columbus would've run out of food attempting to cross the entire Pacific. *This* Ocean is much larger. The map is misleading: circular maps tend to be from the viewpoint of the poles and include the appropriate distortion around the edges. This seems to just be a circle where someone moved the pieces of land around, centered on Pangaea's 0° 0° and omitting the actual rest of the oceans. (Wiki isn't helpful on this one, but [basically *everything* on the other 180° of this globe is water](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Pangea_animation_03.gif))

* The biggest single difference? No isolated Americas and no super-diseases able to wipe out huge numbers of techless aborigines. No noble savages to fetishize, but a lot more equitable development of genetic, religious, and cultural patterns.

You should take that back.

[This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15110110/)...that you couldn't even link...uses the same number of rats to generate data.

You didn't even read the Monsanto study. Nor the criticisms and replies to the criticism by Seralini.

Monsanto had a group of 20 rats, yeah. But they only measured 10 rats from the group. And they only performed the experiment for 90 days. 

Not to mention, the journal FCT hired a Monsanto employee to the review committee and months later, the Seralini paper is retracted.

Lastly, the Seralini study was so impactful that the European Commission is funding another one for 3 million euro, 2yr, using 50 or more rats this time and measuring carcinogenicity.

The Wilson cycle essentially goes like this:

* Most or all of the continental crust on the Earth merges together.
* Due to the weight of the continent above, the continental crust thins in spots.
* Rifting occurs - the continental crust tears apart (powered by convection cells in the mantle), new oceanic crust forms at this tear.
* The continents drift apart as new oceans form.
* Subduction begins on one or both edges of the ocean, pulling the continents back together.
* Eventually, most or all of the continental crust on Earth merges together.
* Lather, rinse, repeat.

We're actually in the middle of the Wilson cycle. That means it's a really cool time to be alive, because we can observe all of the parts in the cycle in action!

* The Great Rift Valley and the Red Sea is an example of an ocean basin in its infancy. The crust of Africa is tearing apart, and eventually, we'll probably have a new ocean, and Somalia/Ethiopia will drift off to the east.
* The Atlantic Ocean is a young ocean basin that's still spreading. Subduction hasn't yet started along the Atlantic basin. We might eventually see the Appalachians become active yet again, if the Atlantic oceanic crust starts to subduct beneath the North American Plate.
* The Pacific Ocean is a mature ocean basin. The Pacific Plate is subducting beneath both the South American Plate and the Eurasian Plate, causing arc volcanism - volcanoes tend to form in an arc along subduction zones.
* The Himalayas are a young mountain range born of continent-continent collision. Because continents are buoyant, neither India nor Eurasia can really subduct (sink down) beneath the other, which means the crust kind of scrunches up between the two and forms awe-inspiring mountains.
* The Mediterranean is an old ocean basin that's almost closed. For unknown reasons, Africa has slowed to a near standstill, and that's caused all sorts of crazy stuff to happen in the Mediterranean region.

Use your connection to bring in allies to your wars (it's your job to get in with people who are actually close enough to help). Keep your enemies allies from accepting calls.

Flatter the best stewards of Europe to your court. Or, in general, just lose out less by having vassals since they will be more loyal. Make them happy, ask for a bit more tax than usual.

The British eventually controlled the island.  In 1999 the British relinquished their authority and it (and the smaller nearby Portuguese island of Macau) reverted to Chinese control.

Under terms worked out before this handoff, Hong Kong would be allowed to operate as a ""special administrative region"" of China.  China would set many of its laws and appoint its governor but it would retain much of the basic law it had operated with under British control.  It would also continue to use the Hong Kong Dollar instead of the Chinese Yuan as its primary currency.  These rules gradually sunset over the next fifty years.

China was willing to negotiate these terms because Hong Kong is wildly successful and is a major financial center in Asia.  Keeping it that way is a long-term asset to China as the mainland opens its economy and eventually makes its currency convertible and allows its companies to become partly owned by foreigners and traded on trusted stock indexes like that in Hong Kong.  It also demonstrates to the Taiwanese that reunification with China doesn't have to be all bad.

Plus the people who lived on Hong Kong didn't want to have the Chinese mainland Communist Party overwrite their legal freedoms of assembly and speech.

There only was ever 2 Sith at one time in all the Star Wars movies. 

Palpatine is a Sith in all of them. He is the Master.
Dooku is his apprentice until the Clone Wars prequels are over with him dying at the hands of Anakin, who then became the new apprentice. 

Maul was a Dark assasin, at least at the time of the first prequel. He was like a Dark Jedi, except he was never a Jedi. Later he became more of a Sith in the EU but thats EU. 

Grevious was just a General. 

Ventress was NOT a Sith, and Dooku points that out quite clearly. Later she trains to be one secretly under Dooku so that Dooku might defeat his master. 

Savage was like an Aprentice to Maul later when he started to become more Sith like. 

Sorra was a Dark Jedi. 

Tol was also a Dark Jedi, but Dooku might have wanted to also train him to be an apprentice to take out Palpatine. 

The whole point of the rule of two is that if there are only two Sith then the Sith will forever become stronger. 
In the past often times several weaker Lords would kill a stronger lord, then turn on each other. 
Or worse several apprentices would get together and defeat a master.
(Which is why Palpatine didn't want Dooku to train his Assassins to well.) 

This created constant power vacuums in their Empires and more than once led to their downfall. 

I'll admit I like seeing the Sith as an Empire more than just some shadowy guys lurking about. But the Rule of Two is an interesting point that shows how the Sith overcame their weakness.

To add to that, I'm fairly certain that most Russians would not in any way support a war against Europe because Russia would be the aggressor in any scenario, as it would take something serious on Russia's part to get Germany's pacifist government to go along with military action, and I suspect even France would be reluctant to go to war.",1391226254,3,3,0,polandball

I need some context to that question for it to make sense.

Here is what you need to balance it. Going from information I have for SWTOR the balancing point for sustainability lies in the area of 200k to 250k subscribers for that game (this was before it went f2p so this information may not be accurate). So if we go with the 15$ sub fee x 250k then the estimation point of sustainability lies around 3,75 million (again this is highly speculative, but it is the information I have to work with). That is a significantly lower number than your 71 million.

Now for the real question . ""Where are the money going?"". This question is a lot more complicated. From my experience working with servers it is expensive maintaining servers and serverrooms (you are not just paying for power to the server. There is a massive power bill from the cooling and building rental as well), but it is still not ""Millions a month expensive"" (that depends on the amount of servers, but still if you increase the amount of servers you increase the amount of users thus increasing the 250k estimate). Either way the real cost monthly cost of having a server up and running is having a guy a similar lvl of education as me around to make sure it keeps running. Going with the average wage of my local area that would be 5000$ to 5500$ a month. But there needs to be a guy there 24 so you will need a team. Depending on how many servers you need to keep 200 -250k users (with sporadic user patterns) it becomes difficult to determine how big a team you need. 

And we havn't gotten into the cost of maintaining a support center for billing and other account related things. 

As well as running ads in order to keep a steady stream of customers on as others leave the game.

Or the development cost for new content (rule of thumb for development for american based studios is 10 million per year of development time. Eastern EU studios are significantly lower).",1391230810,2,2,0,gaming

One small point of contention, however:  ""In terms of the hurricanes, there would only really be one side of the super-continent hit by them. Have you ever noticed how the east coast of the US is getting hit by hurricanes every year, and yet us Brits and Europeans on the other side of the Atlantic never get them. It is because of the direction the earth rotates, they naturally move westwards. The east coast of Asia tends to get them a lot as well for the same reason.""

This is misleading.  The Earth turns from west to east.  Because of this normal weather patterns follow this flow from west to east, generally speaking.  The hurricane defies this model.  It travels from the Ivory Coast in the southeastern Atlantic waters on a west-northwesterly course until it collides with the warmer, higher pressure air of the Gulf of Mexico, determining its ultimate path.  

The point here is that weather patterns are filled with far too many variables to state that hurricanes would only hit one coast.

Actually the irony is more than that -- because with the exception of a few loons who buy completely into Hanson's ""Venus theory"" (i.e. that elevated CO2 will become ""runaway CO2"" and cook the entire planet ending not only human life but literally ""cooking away"" the entire biosphere) -- the vast majority of the warmists are not really concerned with ""saving the planet"", but rather with saving what they apparently think is the ""ideal/optimum"" climate arrangement (i.e. which they uncritically believe to be the status quo); and presumably they are chiefly concerned with keeping it at that because they believe it to be ideal for humanity.

Yet at the same time, ~~the vast majority~~ *a significant percentage* of them are entirely misanthropic (literally ""haters of mankind"") -- I've heard/read multiple instances of warmistas regurgitate what is essentially the Matrix's character Agent Smith's line about [""humans are a disease""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM1-DQ2Wo_w) -- and they say it in a way that is obvious that they sincerely believe it (however hypocritically).

---

&gt;I know the hoax is to use ANYTHING to control human behavior (underlying feature of all watermelon actions) but they always argue that they are trying to save the earth, as realists we know the earth will always be here (unlike humans)

Well, not just all watermelon actions, but rather the entire principle of population control underlying the majority of forms of government. Fear-mongering is an ancient technique.

---

&gt;So your premise, sure a CAPSM may destroy the actual earth, 

I doubt that even a CAAT/CAPSM accident would destroy the Earth itself (or even ""life"" on Earth) ... but it could certainly alter the environment in any number of ways -- ways that could for instance alter/disrupt the moon's orbit which would change tides, possibly alter the planet's Axial tilt and induce a new ice-age -- would be catastrophic to humanity (or at least the majority of it and the current iteration of civilization -- i.e. TEOTWAWKI).

---

&gt;but for the end of humans I will go with the tried and true mass murder -infectious disease. Now I concede it is entirely possible that it will be a human created disease, but nature is already hard at work trying to eliminate we pesky humans.

Well... it's a constant ""battle"" so to speak, most life forms end up becoming food for other life forms -- our position at the ""peak"" of the multi-celled predatory lifeforms may not be challenged -- but on the opposite end of the spectrum... we're just the food/landscape for a whole array of microbial life (some of it symbiotic and without which we wouldn't be who/what we are).

And I doubt that any major epidemic will have to be ""human created"" (at least not in the ""crafted purposefully/diabolically in a laboratory"" sense) -- the ""window"" of antibiotic effectiveness is already starting to close, and may not, probably will not, last much beyond the century mark. After all, the first antibiotics only really came into *widespread* civilian use in the mid 1950's -- a scant 6 decades ago -- and resistant MRSA strains had already begun spreading in UK hospitals by the late 1950's, hitting European hospitals in the 1960's and we know it started to be seen ""out in the wild"" as early as the late 1970's (BTW, long before antibiotics came into widespread use in the animal industry -- the medical profession's scapegoating of that as a cause of antibiotic resistance is wholly disingenuous: the most threatening resistant microbes {C. Diff, MRSA, VRE, etc} are all iatrogenic/nosocomial, and chiefly due to medical arrogance/sloppiness -- AFAIK no ""new"" bacteria has {at least not yet} really ""jumped"" the species barrier {note: the scare about H1N1 -- aka ""bird flu"" -- is a virus, not a bacteria}).

**Plus of course we have prior examples of an ""unintended/unexpected"" epidemic** the main/first being that of polio. Prior to modern sanitary sewers, polio viruses had apparently evolved to be an endemic and essentially mild (only rarely-debilitating) infant/toddler disease -- one that was readily overcome by the immune system which then obtained lifelong immunity -- it only evolved to take on it's crippling paralytic form when there was a sufficient population of older individuals who had *never* been exposed (i.e. in the late 1800's, decades after the advent of sanitary sewer/water systems), and then moreover it didn't become an ""epidemic"" until there was a subsequent mechanism of widespread fecal-oral transmission (the building of public bathhouses and swimming pools -- sans proper chlorination or filtration\*). And that new, more virulent &amp; debilitating form pf polio then got transmitted back out into other less developed countries (i.e. much like MRSA etc -- it was ""bred"" in the more developed west and then ""spread"" down and out throughout the third world countries -- which while they had immunity to the previous mild form, had no immunity to the more virulent variety, and of course lacked sanitary/medical systems to compensate).

Unfortunately, we've pretty much set ourselves up for a whole host of NEW epidemics... not only because we've become overdependent on the use of antibiotics (especially the medical industry); but because we've become ridiculously overconfident in their effectiveness and have gotten (both in medicine AND out in the community) woefully ""sloppy"" in our understanding of epidemiological risks (especially in regards to things like sexual/intimate-contact transmitted viruses -- despite what the post-modern psychobabble promotes -- the old societal constraints on sexual promiscuity were *not* just a form of ""ignorant religious oppression"": hedonism has a very *real* price tag in terms of disease propagation {a lesson that SHOULD have been learned with the AIDS virus, but due to various political pressures has been squelched}).

Alas... the mid to late 21st century is likely to NOT be the ""ultimate triumph of modern technological medicine"" that people want to believe it will be -- instead I think we're (alas, more's the pity) in store for a return of epidemic disease: a blowback/backlash if you will.  And it is entirely predictable (indeed it WAS predicted -- Penicillin's discoverer, Fleming, repeatedly *warned* everyone about resistant strains {even *again* in his Nobel acceptance speech} but to little avail).

---

\* Even though various types of chlorination *were* in use in many ""public swimming pools"" in the 1920's and 1930's, it was almost never maintained at a steady/adequate PPM level -- that requires a combination of nearly continual free/combined chlorine PPM testing, as well as pH testing and a load-adjusting dispensing system as well as robust continuous filtration and a full understanding of the chlorine/chloramine equation (which they didn't have an inkling of at the time) -- the ""crystal clear"" swimming pool water is a post WWII (and arguably even a post 1960's) thing, the water in pools &amp; bathhouses of prior decades/century were generally rather ""murky""\*\* (more like what we would call dirty pond water) and even the pools that did have some chlorination/filtration systems were routinely drained and refilled. In terms of fecal-oral and other microbes they (especially the *heated* facilities, or likewise many ""warm springs"") were essentially just huge ""petri"" dishes.

\*\* If you ever have the opportunity to examine old photos of pre-WWII era pools -- even deep diving pools from things like the Olympics -- one thing that few people initially notice (but which sticks out like a sore thumb when you point it out to them) is that the water is always dark, you can virtually never ""see"" to bottom of the pools, and seldom will anything even be visible below the waterline; the pool water of the era was just NOT our modern ""crystal clear"" variety (the few exceptions I have encountered where you can see slightly below the surface [are invariably salt water pools that were near oceans](http://the17thman.typepad.com/my_weblog/2013/07/swimming-wins-gold-for-fitness.html) and which had apparently been frequently/recently ""refreshed"" with new water).  

BTW [testimony from people who remember swimming in the typical pools  (along with photos) of the era](http://www.tonbridgepool.co.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=1670) is not hard to find:

&gt;Retired schoolmaster Reg Philpott, of Welland Road, a keen swimmer** in the murky green of the old pool in the 1920s**, questions whether the 1910 pool was ever heated.  It actually was - pipes under the adjacent Baths Field carried surplus heat from the municipal electricity works.

One other little ironic footnote is that prior to the 1960's, most pool basins were white plaster or gray concrete -- until pools started to have ""crystal clear"" water (and you could see to the bottom) there was no point in different colors, since no one could really tell the difference, the water itself being generally a greenish-murky hue -- then, in the post WWII years in addition to having clear water, people had gotten used to seeing full color pictures (National Geographic &amp; Life magazines, and then later color television, etc) of the [light aqua-blue waters of the beaches &amp; bays in the Bahamas, etc](http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/028/cache/bahamas_2836_600x450.jpg) ... so they wanted their swimming pools to have that ""light aqua-blue water"" too. But of course water is colorless, the ""blue"" is just the paint/surface color of the basin.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Data Retention Directive***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%20Retention%20Directive) : 

---

&gt;The **Data Retention Directive**, more formally ""Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC"" is a Directive issued by the European Union and relates to Telecommunications data retention. According to the directive, member states will have to store citizens' telecommunications data for 6-24 months stipulating a maximum time period. Under the directive the police and security agencies will be able to request access to details such as IP address and time of use of every email, phone call and text message sent or received. A permission to access the information will be granted only by a court.

How did a CIA plane not notice a jet? Do they not have radar? 

What was the point of having one of Bane's men go down with the ship?

Does Wayne Enterprises not do any background checks? 

How did Bruce heal his leg after the cyber leg was trashed? He never had a limp again in the movie.

How did Bane know exactly where Lucius Fox hid the Wayne Enterprises Batman tech warehouse? Lucius spent an inordinate amount of time explaining that nobody would know where it was.

Why did Commissioner Gordon go to the bust that Catwoman rigged with the phone swap? 

Why did they send that many cops? Were they in the bar across the street? 

Why is the aging Commissioner of Police going into the sewers to chase a criminal? 

How did Robin know exactly what hole Gordon would come out, even though he has no knowledge of the sewers, while the team of people who have been living there for weeks had no idea? 

Why were the sewers so clean?

Why did nobody believe Commissioner Gordon about Bane? Does Gotham forget each crazy super-villain seconds after it happens?  

Why did nobody freeze trading in the ten minutes between the start of the attack and when Bane executed the trade? Does nobody notice that Bruce isn't there? 

Why didn't Bruce have any assets that weren't stocks?

Had Bruce not paid his Gotham Power bill in months? They turned his power off the next day. PG&amp;E isn't that brutal. 

Why did Bane/Talia start executing their plan and gather Bruce's fingerprints before Bruce showed Talia the nuclear engine? 

Why did Bane kidnap a nuclear scientist and go to the trouble of destabilizing Gotham City without any knowledge of the nuclear engine?

Wouldn't stealing the engine (or buying a bomb) have been a whole lot easier then stealing Bruce's fortune? 

Why did every cop in Gotham go into the sewers? 

Why were they clean when they came out weeks later? 

Why did they suicide charge Bane's troops with pistols?

Why did Bane's troops not just kill them all?

Who painted the gasoline Bat-symbol?

Is everyone in Gotham deaf? Nobody in the GCPD noticed the Batplane during the escape earlier in the movie, and it's a fucking VTOL, painted black. At noon. Catwoman drives a motorcycle up a flight of stairs and nobody notices.

How does one heal a severely broken back through punches and exercises? 

Why is there a cable TV in a prison hole in the mountains? Is there a camel on a giant treadmill to get power? And why did everyone speak English?

Who kept the city clean during Bane's anarchy?

Why did the citizens believe Bane? Joker spent the whole last movie lying to everyone. Or did they forget that ever happened? 

How did Bruce get back into the city with no resources? 

Neither Bane nor Talia had the common sense to have anyone guard Wayne Manor? 

Why did Bruce leave anything, especially the Batcave to John Blake? As far as I know, he met him during the final fight with Bane, when they were rescuing the cops. Assuming Bruce had that will printed before the fight (because they said that), he left his most important legacy to a stranger. 

How is Blake going to be Batman? He's virtually penniless. 

Why wait months to blow up the city? Why did Bane and Talia want to die in the city? Why didn't they want Batman to die in the city? Couldn't they have found some secure place to leave Bruce? He had a broken back. 

A 30 foot fall + hemp rope harness + slammed into stone wall + recovering from a broken back = no damage. 

Does Chris Nolan not know how complicated sexual revenge works? Miranda slept with Bruce once and danced once. They didn't have a long courtship - certainly not long enough to feel massive betrayal. Maybe she just wanted some Bat-dick, but this seems silly. 

Why was Batman perturbed at the thought of killing Bane - basically forcing Catwoman to do it, but killed the fuck out of Talia? 

Bruce Wayne used no disguise at all in Europe. Selina Kyle is a wanted jewel thief. Again, no disguise. Are you telling me nobody in the world would recognize Bill Gates? Or Richard Branson?

Tintin, which you may be familiar with from the recent film, is about an investigative journalist, his dog, and his curmudgeonly best friend.  They travel the world (in search of journalism, ostensibly) and get mixed up in organized crime, drug smuggling, jewel heists, ancient cults, and all sorts of crazy stuff.  Although it sounds dark(ish?), Herge's art keeps everything bright, and while it may seem a bit static and flat at first, there's a great style at work. The adventures make for some pretty great reading, and certain story arcs run for multiple books.  Pick up the big individual books if you can, as the Collected Editions (3-4 books to a volume) squeeze the size way down and make it more difficult to read.

Asterix is probably my favourite non-superhero book.  It's a historical comedy about a small village in ancient Gaul (France) during the Roman occupation which remains independent thanks to a super-strength potion their druid brews.  Asterix (the small, cunning warrior archetype) and his bumbling and overpowered best friend Obelix make their way through Europe, Asia, and even North America at one point, usually on some variety of errand or quest.  It plays a lot (like, A LOT) with cultural stereotypes, and has some of the best pun-ridden writing in comics, even when translated from the original language.

It's like you've been in a coma since 2008.

&gt;But it does. You don't understand historical significance of language. That's fine. Just keep your ignorance to yourself.

It doesn't, otherwise it would STILL have no negative application. It would STILL not be referring to homosexuals. It didn't START as a slur for homosexuals, and it was a slur for hundreds of years less than it has _not_ been one. You can't have your cake and eat it too, if you want to stick to ""historical significance"" then to you the word refers to sticks. Further, it's a widely used phrase in Europe, to date in reference to cigarettes. I assumed you knew all of this, but clearly you're being intentionally (ironically, perhaps?) ignorant.

&gt;According to consensus. The term is used in literature, journalism, film, and every form of media you could mention, and very rarely (if ever) with negative connotations. If you can, feel free to give me wnough examples of 'like-minded' used with negative connotations to offset the wealth of uses in with neutral connotations. Otherwise you can go away.

 I can certainly (and have) give more examples of fag being used, and defined without negative connotations.

&gt;Yes. Otherwise, as you said, we wouldn't be able to say anything. That you think it has to be all-or-nothing tells me a lot about your maturity.

&gt;Now go away or I'm blocking you.

Please do honestly, you refuse to follow your own rules. You say ""consider how your language effects other people"" then decide to change your own rules ""that only matters if it effects an arbitrary number of people."" If somebody was offended by something that you said, according to you, you've been inconsiderate because you failed to account for how your language would affect them.

Another issue is that you can't crucify a person hanging by nails through hand palms and feet, the muscle tissue won't bear the weight of the upper body (sorry to mess up your lore Christians), the only way to support it with nails is by going through the wrist and then you bleed to death or use additional means to attach him to a cross and support the weight like straps around the arms or chest.

Later in the video you can also see him walk normally... he forgot the holes in his feet I suppose?

Your accent is almost certainly going to sound more foreigner than anything else; and Taiwanese people are well aware that most people learning Chinese start with materials made for the mainland, or have been to the mainland before. I've had plenty of people get nearly standoffish with me for *not* going to the mainland to learn Chinese. 

I've had friends with accents all along the spectrum, ranging from ""Actually from the mainland"", ""other Taiwanese people think they're from the mainland"", ""other Taiwanese people think they're from Hong Kong"" (or bizarrely, Japan/Korea), to ""so deeply Taiwanese you're near amazed they speak Mandarin at all."". There is always good natured ribbing, but that happens between minor usage differences between regions in Taiwan.

There's a significant number of immigrants, from Latin America, North America, Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as South East Asia, there's a huge diaspora of ethnic Chinese who have grown up or lived all over and come back to Taiwan, so while there is the ""standard"" guoyu accent you'll hear on the news, and various ""taiwanese mandarin"" accents you'll hear on TV, practically speaking, simply speaking Chinese will be good enough for most people. Yes, you might be made fun of. No, they're not going to hate you.

Not that I don't recommend learning some about how the language is used in Taiwan; even if you don't change your own speaking habits, it will help to understand those around you. Definitely try to drop erhua and speak a bit more 'softly', but be more worried about people not understanding what you mean (for example, mixed up vocabulary, where a word may be totally foreign to Taiwanese ears) than your accent in general.

The thing a lot of people fail to realise about these latitudes is that the days of constant darkness in winter and sunlight in summer don´t last for very long. Because of how far north we are, the difference in length from one day to the next is quite more pronounced than in more southerly locations, and before you know it you´re right back to more or less normal daytime hours. 

As for dealing with the weird hours when they´re happening, you just get used to it. I´ve lived most of my life in Iceland and have never lived any further south than Copenhagen, Denmark, so I don´t know much else. We have solariums all over the place as a sort of ersatz sun for that vitamin D, and we keep normal working hours so we´re inside during a lot of the day anyway (although it must be said that Icelanders work on average far fewer hours than other Europeans because we´re lazy). The cold never sets anyone back, but we do tend to drink quite a lot both in the winter dark and the constant summer light.

Every person seems convinced that their interpretation of Christianity is correct, which is fair, but it becomes much less so when they're also convinced that the 'fact' that their one is the only right one should be obvious to everyone else - while ignoring that those with different interpretations also think *their* interpretation should be obviously correct. This point can of course be expanded outside mere sects of Christianity and applied to those with different religions entirely.

It seems more to me that the different interpretations of Christianity are more about conforming to, and reinforcing, local political and cultural norms - that's why Christianity is still virulently anti-gay in Africa, somewhat so in the US, and much less so in Europe. Similar parallels between local values and the local interpretations of their religions can be drawn along lines of sexism; attitudes to wealth, charity and suffering; sexual liberty; and even things like curse words.

It's no great surprise that the Christian mainstream has lagged years - if not decades - behind every major advances in moral values. It acts to reinforce those that exist, not break down barriers and aid in the progress of morality. See: Women's liberation, birth control, gay rights, even the civil rights movement (though that one was muddier because of how strongly Christian much of the black population was). Christianity only catches up years later, once the moral progress has become well and truly mainstream - and then sometimes acts as if they'd been on the side of moral progress all along, pointing to some outliers at the time, so as to continue upholding mainstream values (which now include the object of the social progress).",1391238016,1,1,0,TrueFilm

Your life, experinces, environment and so on creates your mindset. Babys and children are extremely rarely depressed and rates of depression are higher the older you get. Other example is if you change your life your mindset changes automatically with you. 

I myself was depressed for many many years, like you, until i had finally enough and i was travelling across Europe just to attend to this festival. I have only watched videos about it and i knew this is where i wanna be before i die. I organized some people and traveled there. The festival itself was only for 5 days, but it was worth more than i could have ever imagined. For the first day i realized i am in paradise and i am depressed and i was asking myself why i couldn't enjoy this place. It was truly magical, it was absolute paradise. Non-materialistic, eco-friendly, artistic and intelligent community with incredible people. Everyone was just smiling and it was like nothing i had ever witnessed before. I met so many different people from all over the world. 

I'm from Germany and at this place i met a Jewish theoretical physicist from Tel Aviv and we talked about nuclear fission, i met an wise buddhist teacher, i met real gypsis that live in the forests of Hungary, i met a cool guy from New fucking York, i met an Asian from the US that was making back flips on the dance floor, i met people from at least 20 different countries, i met so many different, interesting, beautiful and lovely people, i made so many valuable and incredible experiences and friends from all over the world that gathered at this place. I was running around naked, i bathed in the lake and helped the organizers after the festival was over, because i lost my money and missed my ride, because i never wanted to leave this place again, but had to manage to get back home for over 700km. My feet soles where open and i could barely walk from all the dancing. I slept on the streets of Budapest, found a Goa street artist which invited me and gave me food and a place to sleep, for free. My view on people changed monumental. And i found my way back home. I was a glowing, radiating new person for months after that. All these experiences created an in a way entirely new way of looking at life. I was truly happy and nothing bothered me, i was a new person for a while..

But as the months went by found myself back into my old habits my old place and my old life and slowly but surely i forgot everything. My failure was that i didn't change my circumstances. I still have memories, but the joy and mindset is gone, because i didn't change my life. And that's why i understand that only the life you are living and the decisions you make define your mindset. Drugs don't fucking work, at all. They change you for a couple of hours or a couple of days. If you take heavy stuff like high doses of Psychedelics like Ayahuasca, LSD or Psilocybin they will elevate you probably for a couple of month into a state where your depression is gone, but they will not cure it. The same goes with official anti-depressants. Only the life you live is what defines you, if your life sucks, your mindset sucks and you are depressed. Depression is a reflection of the life your living, and the life you live is dependant on your circumstances like the system you live **under**, your family, your friends, region, climate, weather, social structures, work, hobbies, education, knowledge and everything that defines you and your life.

Go travel around the world with a backpack, leave everything behind and take only with you what is really neccessary, jump into the world and live, because you are already dead anyways, so even if you die and you have only been happy for a couple of weeks it was still worth everything. Test yourself and test the world, because after all we are out of this world and part of it. And this world is our world and we should be able to live in it unconditionally. But we have too much fear and are too comfortable.

I'm now dead again, but at least i understand how it works and i have the option to change it again if i find a way.

Depression is mostly lack of life and new experences. Your explanation has no substance and doesn't make logical sense. The fucking anti-depressants aren't a solution no matter how perfect they are engineered. To say body chemistry is the cause of depression is like saying the root cause of your shivering is because of fast and repetetive muscle contraction after you swam in the cold ocean. Your explanation is circulus in probando.

&gt; Which might help Chad, but does little to alleviate the problems the CAR will have.

I guess you aren't paying attention. CAR has rebels which are slaughtering people. They wouldn't be anti-CAR rebels, they'd be Chadian citizens, if this region switched countries.

&gt;&gt; Your citation of the Austro-Hungarian carve up is poor, indeed. Lots of people were poor during the interwar years, including the Germans, and they were not carved up.

&gt; Which just shows that you did not bother looking into this at all. The Germans had economic problems because of reparations and a loss of industry. Former A-H had different problems for different reasons. And other nations in the world had other problems for other reasons at the same time. Nations don't always go through the same economic difficulties for the same reasons.

First, thank you so much for giving the completely uncontroversial, and unquestioned by any economist, reasons for A-H and German economic troubles. As you clearly know, nobody would disagree with you. Losing territory is bad for a country's economy. How profound you are!

&gt;&gt; I disagree that it is a good way to ensure future conflict. The border towns should be polled about which side they want to be on, for example, and so, naturally, if a town chooses country AAA, they will resent heavily if country BBB tries to invade. Now, the opposite situation exists, because the town, stuck in country BBB, might welcome the invasion of country AAA.

&gt; Once again, you need to look at history - this has happened numerous times in the past and almost never goes as smoothly as you seem to think it will. What happens in towns with a significant minority that suddenly find themselves in a new country? Or what about territories on one group, that would like to join country A, but are completely surrounded by territory that elects to stay with country B?

First, this has _never_ happened based on language, by election. I would be against any non-border regions switching sides, honestly. I also don't know what a good threshold would be, but you seem to be saying that if 99.9999999% of a population want to move, you are against it, because you just don't give a shit what the people want.

No one can know all of history. I know Nagorno-Karabakh some and the Georgian War very well (the only two near-contemporary examples), the Greco-Turkish war and post-WWII German expulsions less so, but I can read quickly. I will cover your examples:

&gt; Greco-Turkish War 1919-22

Well, a secret deal from Lloyd George is _just about the same damn thing_ as a national referendum, eh? Not one community on Asia Minor seems to have had a Greek majority, so not one community would have voted to join Greece. I am using Wikipedia for my population statistics, it says it is using the 1910 Ottoman statistics. Even if, in just the Vilayet of Smyrna, the Greek population was larger, I don't support shifting political borders base on 51%. That would be insane.

I would fight for Turkey in repelling the Greeks, in that war.

If the greedy Europeans hadn't backed Greece in the first place, it would have been less of a problem. If the Turks hadn't been genocidal, same again.

Apparently ""The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path[.]"" Now, you really think a population exchange is going to work well under those circumstances? I have TWO bridges in Brooklyn to sell you.

&gt; Germany after WWII

Again, you've got post-war retribution going on. That's not what I'm talking about. Those were forced by (effectively) ethnically cleansing governments who had recently been near extermination themselves.

I can never find this quote, but I believe Montesquieu wrote that there is no people so vindictive than those who recently been oppressed, themselves.

&gt; Nagorno-Karabakh.

You've got a Soviet effort to Azerify the region (an ethnic cleansing), and a non-contiguous region. Actually, a good chunk of the region between N-K and Armenia is majority Armenian-speaking, so, OF COURSE, Azerbaijan doesn't want to lose one acre of territory, but, by referendum, I don't see how they could win, except by threats of force.

&gt; Russia-Georgia War

The Ossetians speak an Iranian dialect, were once (almost certainly) known as the Alans, and straddle the Russian-Georgian border. For whatever reason (because Iranian is closer to Slavic than to Georgian?) the Ossetians in Georgia would rather be in Russia. Georgia won't let them go, and fake-started a war to cement their control. They failed. I'm happy they failed. 

&gt;&gt;I don't know where you get the idea this is being done lightly. Thousands of people are dying under the system you are defending.

&gt; No. The vast majority of borders in the world are peaceful (or at least, peaceful enough that people don't die because of them). The solution is to build up countries like the CAR so that these issues can be solved in a non-violent way. Not run in with a scalpel and sticky tape and think you can fix all the problems with a border change.

I am talking about the liberation of the people to choose their own government, if a choice if available. You are against that liberty. I understand. It's a pretty radical idea, in the first place, and even if you aren't a reactionary stooge I could see why it would strike people as wrong, at first, since I can't possibly explain everything I'm thinking in an instant, so, of course, the first part sounds definitely wrong (even to me) unless you hear the rest.

The borders in Europe are nearly all linguistic, and they have a lot of peace. The borders in Africa and Southern Asia are all imperialistic, and have much less.

By the way, thousands of people _are_ dying, even if you say ""No.""",1391240412,0,0,0,IAmA

between isolated tribes.

Cagayan Valley and Bicol acts like their own islands, they're separated from the rest of Luzon by huge mountains. Even the Cordilleras acts like a separate island. Even if there are no geologic boundaries which separates several homelands, language would become the barrier. Filipinos speaking one tounge used to despise a visiting Filipino (a ""dayo"") who speaks another tongue.

&gt; The Philippine tribes, on the other hand had easy access to the sea, and thus formed
large trading networks with each other and with India and China.

Trade routes are largely not immigration routes. Our seas would still prevent significant population movements that we saw during the Spanish and American periods. Both Spain and the US did their own homestead programs in our nation.

&gt;  I disagree that there
would be no mixing - my family, for example, originated in Luzon but several branches
migrated to Mindanao, Antique and Negros.

When did this happen? Most immigration which happened in the past, especially Northern to Southern immigrations were sponsored by the government (Spanish colonial, American colonial, Commonwealth, and 3rd Republic). Ilocanos in southern Zambales were relocated there by Spain for example because my Sambali ancestors were rebelious against Spain from the very beginning. I'm sure most relocations from Luzon into the Visayas and Mindanao were done similarly or through homestead programs.

&gt; People go where the jobs are

Animistic people didn't care about jobs. The only farm, fish, eat, and sleep. This is one reason why Spaniards thought were lazy. Our animistic ancestors were never ambitious. One Spanish conquistador who went here was puzzled why our ancestors don't produce more than what they need. Modern jobs and economic practices were copcepts introduced to us by Western colonizers. Again, look at PNG on the type of jobs they all have there.

&gt; True, the population would still be ruled by the elites - we would probably be closer to
Malaysia, Indonesia or as /u/rcas mentions below, Thailand (Thailand had a strong central monarchy and military though, which prevented it from being fully colonized). We would probably be split into two or three separate countries by now though (or at
the very least organized as a set of states or city-states).

Agreed. PNG became united in the first place because of its European masters in the past. But whether some elites would advocate for the statehood of their own ethno-region here in the Philippines is unknown. Even if they had, a loose federation may exist between these ""states"", but people won't still care about these political arrangements.",1391241624,1,1,0,Philippines

I would recommend using the long flight as an opportunity to catch up on some beauty sleep, those little neck pillows are beyond comfortable and small and perfect for plane rides. And depending on your little one's age, maybe a coloring book or just a book to keep her busy. My biggest tip regarding being in hot weather, especially if you're going to be outside is to remember to wear sunscreen! You definitely don't want to damage your skin :) Maybe you can use a light foundation or powder foundation with sunscreen in it already .. and I'd go light on the eyeshadows and liners.. they tend to get smudged in the humid air. 

Take lots of pictures! After a few weeks of traveling in Europe my biggest regret was not taking more pictures :) it's fun to look back on the places you went, the food you ate, and the people you spent time with! :) 

have a safe and fun trip!

**TL;DR: Unfortunately, I can't provide a good SR2 moda seller recommendation.** (I am so disappointed in myself right now. I HAD ONE JOB!) Details and alternatives below.

*Choose your own adventure:*

* If you want to hear about the best way to order moda on clearnet, a little about the history of moda on Reddit, as well as various informational subreddits where you can read more about moda and the range of clearnet vendors, start at the top.

* If you think clearnet can go to hell and you are definitely ordering off SR2, skip to the last paragraph. (Caveat: it could still be a good idea to LOOK at the clearnet vendors mentioned below just to compare pricing to SR2 and figure out if you're getting screwed or how badly. Cost in India for the pill OTC is very cheap, under $1, I want to say even under $0.50/pill, but I forget the exact price.)

I started ordering moda before I got on the darknets, actually off of Reddit - I got into it through /r/nootropics. There used to be a Reddit guy, /u/wisard, who sold it (subreddit /r/medsforbitcoin - still active). His website to place orders is www.medsforbitcoin.com. He was great, inexpensive, reliable, and used stealthy packaging, but in retrospect it was pretty damn dangerous for me to order on the clearnet at all. At the time I didn't know any better, and a LOT of people were ordering and seemed fine. So I took the risk. Based on all reports it doesn't seem like law enforcement or customs give much of a shit about moda. I was incredibly paranoid - I searched high and low on the internet and could find 0 cases of people being arrested for moda shipments that didn't involve some kind of other infraction or drug as well. So the risk is currently very low, but better safe than sorry if law enforcement attitudes should suddenly change. I don't want to be the ""example"". 

About ~3 months ago, wisard (of MedsForBitcoin) sort of faded out, but not in a scammy way, more in a 'got too busy with life' way. He handed his website and orders off to another known/trusted clearnet vendor, modup.net. No buyers got screwed, although there was some concern when he started logging on less, the website got updated, and some seemingly random Reddit user started responding to questions and orders. Then they announced the switch officially and everyone calmed down a little since Modup.net was a known, respected vendor. It's been a few months, and everyone still seems to be happy on those subreddits from briefly scanning them just now, so I assume that's still the case. Modup.net also had historically good reviews, a history on Reddit of at least a year (may be longer, but I remember it went back at least that long), and a very responsive customer service person on Reddit, /u/SophieK7. She also responds to more general moda/armoda questions and to modup.net questions on /r/afinil, as well as providing customer service to /r/medsforbitcoin now.

Would I order from Medsforbitcoin.com (run by modup.net) again? I personally have no reservations about Modup as a trustworthy vendor. My only concerns are about security (because it's clearnet) and because they send it express, so you have to sign for it, which always freaks me out a little. It was never a problem though, and to be fair is standard practice for all the legit clearnet moda vendors I looked at back in the day (there are a lot, largely based in India - I just haven't actually used any of the others. Some of them are scams in that they just don't send you any pills - which is still cheaper than sending really cheap legit pills, I guess, but seems stupidly shortsighted since you get no repeat business and have terrible word of mouth...unless they're not really in India and don't have access to the pills. Who knows. I'm just guessing.) Back on topic - the upside of the express shipping, is you do get a tracking number so you can see where it is and when it gets out of Customs. Delivery times range from less than a week to a couple weeks depending on time of year and mostly Customs clearance times. They seem to ship within about 48 hours. If it doesn't, Sophie will look into it and get it on it's way if you ping her. They also offer a reship option from a country other than India, for those buyers who live in particularly prickly Customs countries and filter everything from India. I believe the UK and Canada and maybe Australia required that, while other European countries and the US did not.

Modup's stealth is... somewhat *unusual* but appeared to be sufficient based on delivery rate. They very oddly actually label the package in the customs declaration as something like ""medicine for personal use"" (see note below), which scared the crap out of me at first. When Modup was asked about it (as a lot of buyers didn't love this approach), they said it's easier to get through Customs if you're honest, because if they open it and see a few moda pills (only enough for a single user, could be a legit prescription), and it doesn't look like you're trying to be sneaky with your packaging, they usually don't bother to confiscate it or even check up on it - they just seal it back up and send it. A combo of the ""hiding in plain sight"" tactic, and Customs not currently having moda as a priority, I guess. This seemed to sometimes be true from various buyer Reddit reports of opened packages with green Customs tape that were received intact with pills still inside, and sometimes not, when Customs did take out the pills and enclosed the infamous ""love letter"". But it did overall seem to be very rare that anything was intercepted or opened at all, based on the subreddit posts, and none of my orders were ever opened, green-taped, or love lettered.

**Edited to add:** I debated removing some of the above paragraph as it talks about the package stealth more specifically than I am usually comfortable with. I've decided to leave it intact however because the discussion about the packaging choices of Modup occurred on Reddit with Sophie, and she did not seem concerned about having that information posted, or try to delete it later. Also, the language is not accurate in wording, only in spirit (I don't remember exactly what the label said, just the general idea), so I don't believe it's specific enough to actually identify any packages. However, if someone does have concerns, I'm happy to remove it - it just seemed an important packaging detail that many people would NOT be ok receiving at their homes, especially if someone else may see the package, so I feel it has a fair bit of value in remaining. **End Edit.**

Modup's customer service is absolutely fantastic - Sophie always got back to me within 24 hours on Reddit. And after all the weird shit about their shipping methods I just got done explaining (which now that I've written it all out is making me cringe even more - I want to love them for their service, but damn), I feel I must give them some props by saying price of clearnet ordering seems to be quite a bit cheaper than SR2 from my very limited comparisons. About half as much per pill. Usually $1-$2 and change per, price varying depending on amount ordered. Also, the prices on medsforbitcoin.com are a lot better per pill than most other clearnet vendors (or used to be; I haven't compared them recently). I don't know why, but ordering through medsforbitcoin.com was also cheaper than ordering directly from modup.net last I checked, even though the orders go to the same place. Possibly because Modup appears to operate based on UK pounds/prices converted to BTC, and MedsForBitcoin is in USD($)? Or maybe they just kept wisard's lower prices so they didn't lose his fairly sizable customer base. I have no idea, but you're better off ordering from medsforbitcoin.com than modup.net directly.

So in a nutshell - if you are comfortable using clearnet, go to medsforbitcoin.com and order your heart out (though maybe compare per pill prices to Modup.net first in case they've changed wildly). Talk to /u/SophieK7 if you have any questions.

If you're not comfortable ordering via clearnet (which I get, as I'm not even sure I would/will do it again), I'd look on the SR2 forums for vendor feedback per usual, and find someone who has a ton of it. I tend to favor ordering from India, in part because I have in the past and know what I'm getting and what it looks like, and in part because it's OTC and cheap as hell, so there's almost no reason for a vendor to cheat you, if they're going to send you any pills at all. It's easier for them to go buy it legitimately for pennies on the dollar than try to make up some fake ones. No business case for a scam = win/win. (FYI - the India moda brand is called Modalert.)

Never started at the United States.  Quite the contrary, my primary example involved the Spanish, not the Americans.

&gt;However, if you wipe out the indigenous population. You are no longer occupying. 

The indigenous population of the Americans was not wiped out.  By your logic, that makes Europeans occupiers.  Regardless of whether or not that is true, it is irrelevant.  We are evaluating whether or not Europeans committed genocide in the Americas, not whether or their genocidal campaign was so successful they can now call themselves the true owners of the land they stole.

&gt; People who landed in the 1500s were shocked when they returned and 80% of the population of native Americans had disappeared from what is now the new england states. So yes they came to America met the natives, returned to europe to report their finds, came back and everyone was gone. So why not settle and claim the empty lands? 

That is a gross misrepresentation of what actually occur.  Spanish expeditions into what would later be the United States did indeed note a dramatic drop in the population, yet there effort to colonize North America was completely detached from the occupancy of the land.  Furthermore, the reduction of population is not equal to ""everyone"" being ""gone.""  Land on the east coast was a source of continuous competition among native peoples before settlers began to colonize the land and the destruction of multiple European settlements during the early colonial history of the north attests to the fact that people were there, were defending their claims to the land, and were pushing Europeans out.

&gt;Western/Asian/European civilization was coming to the American continents one way or another. No civilization was going to let two continents stand virtually untouched because it was the sparsely populated tribe land.

Uh, no.  While an exchange between both sides of the world would have eventually happened, the conquest of the region was by no means a foregone conclusion.  Quite the contrary, the original explorers of the Americas after Columbus were tasked primarily with establishing trade ties with native peoples, not out right conquest.  

That said, your whole line of thinking is counterfactual.  You are retroactively projecting your knowledge of the Americas backwards onto the Old World.  European civilizations did NOT know anything about the size of populations in the Americas.  It was precisely for that reason that they continued to send expeditions into the heart of the mainlands in search of cities and kingdoms.  Information about the Americas was contradictory and frequently fictional, while the success of native peoples at pushing European settlers coupled with the cost of maintaining colonies dramatically slowed the progress of European colonies.  This is why even after Europe was aware of the Americans for more than a century and even after the Spanish and Portuguese built significant Empires in Central and South America, colonization of the north would not even begin to any meaningful degree until the the 17th Century.


&gt; It just so happens that the discovery of the Americas happened during the Spanish/English Empires Reign instead of say the Chinese (before isolationism) or the pursian, romans or egyptians.

Wrong.  The Spanish and English Empires existed solely because of the discovery of the Americas.  Imperial politics had been largely absent from Europe since the decline of the Romans, partly because European states lacked the resources necessary to capture and maintain large holdings abroad.  If it were not for Cortes bumbling his way into victory, the material wealth necessary to foster imperial states would not have been present in Europe.

That said, your distinction of China ""before isolationism"" betrays the inaccuracy and simplicity of your point.  Imperialism is not something that just magically happens.  Rather it is a particular cultural attitude that develops in response to internal and external pressures and is limited by both economic and geographic factors.  China's military and technological capacity far exceeded that of Europe prior to immediate discovery of the Americas yet China never even discovered the Americas not because they ""just so happened"" not to but rather because Chinese society was not geared towards that particular kind of venture.  Likewise, the assertion that ""Pursian"", (not sure what the hell that is, I'll assume you mean Persian) Roman, or Egyptians would have expanded into the Americas is downright absurd.   Setting aside the technological concerns, the reality of the matter is that maintaining direct imperial holdings across the seas is an incredibly expensive and complex venture which rarely succeeds.

&gt;So lets not pretend euorpeans are some type of special evil

Again, wrong.  What you are neglecting to mention whether through dishonesty or ignorance is that many of the states you are referencing did in fact come in contact with semi-agrarian and/or hunter-gather peoples.  The conquest of regions occupied by these people never resulted in the development of complex racial hierarchies, chattel slavery, or the entire liquidation of cultures.  Instead, these people were incorporated into the framework of the dominate culture.  Egyptians borrowed from and tolerated the Canaanites they subjugated.  Romans eagerly adapted their religion to accommodate the beliefs of the barbarian they encountered, and the Chinese peacefully interacted with the Japanese even when their ancestors were just beginning to adopted settled living patterns.   While not all of these interactions were peaceful, while there are plenty of historic interactions where we can point to brutal relations between larger states and less complex societies, there are no historic analogs to what the Europeans did in the Americas.

&gt;Native Americans were warring, slaving, and robbing each other for 50,000 years before a white man ever set foot on America

Not in question.  The difference is a matter of scale and scope.  When the Aztecs expanded their way across Mexico and subjugated their neighbors, they certainly engaged in slavery and other acts of brutality.  But they didn't burn down all of the settlements, destroy all existing religious practices, execute the leadership of a community, and force everyone to speak in Nahuatl.  Nearly 500 years later and Mexico is *still* trying to pick up the pieces from what the Europeans did upon arrival.  There are no native groups anywhere in the Americas where this is not the case.

&gt; Warring tribes was the very reason the Anasazi /Pueblo People built cliff dwellings so far away from ariable land.

Nope.  Warring was the reason why the Ancient Pueblo Complex declined.  Archaeological research into most Southwestern monumental architecture has revealed that the bulk of it served religious purposes tied to celestial movements, which lead to their unique placements.  That said, the Southwest is a perfect example of how your argument is inherently flawed.  Despite a turbulent history and incursions from the surrounding regions, even after the collapse of the Ancient Pueblo as a society, the culture of the region continued to thrive and was adopted by later groups.  Thousands of years of cultural evolution which was never brought to an abrupt end by native peoples themselves.  Only with the arrival of the Europeans and the subjugation of the region was the culture of Southwestern peoples largely brought to an end.

Whites would be punished for trading with them, villages would be burned to the ground for housing runaway slaves, etc. And this was all exasperated by the native americans who thought they could fight back. But many tribes didn't differentiate/understand the government and settlers. They went after everyone. 

Again, an oversimplification and a fairly pitiful one at that.  The United States government was just as much a recipient of pressure to instigate genocidal laws as it was a source of that mentality.  Countless private and religious groups put pressure on the United States government not only to send the army out to decimate native groups but also to assist them in ""civilizing"" native groups too.  Frontier cities routinely committed murderous acts which were far worse than anything the government did, so much so that during the Indian Wars the US Army was actually deployed on several occasions to protect *natives* from settlers.

You are wrong to suggest that natives didn't understand the difference between settlers or government and to imply that their acts were worse simply because they went after everyone.  You are again the most relevant details in the name of defending genocide: whether it the government or settlers, all of them were invaders.  If an foreign nation, regardless of the support of its government, began sending waves after waves of people into the United States to the point where Americans began starving and were routinely killed and raped by these foreigners, we wouldn't say ""Oh geez, they're just civilians, better not do anything.""  We would defend our homes and our lives with deadly force.  

&gt;Hunter/Gather is the least effective use of land save no use what so ever

No, it actually isn't.  For the vast bulk of human history (IE - right up to the industrial era) a hunter-gather lifestyle resulted in a more nutritious and stable diet while simultaneously requiring far less work than an agrarian lifestyle.  One of the greatest mysteries in Physical Anthropology is why we even became agrarians in the first place. 

&gt;The Native Americans biggest sin was learning nothing about the new American way of life and not replicating that industry on their holdings.

Again, patently false.  Countless technologies and lifeways did enter the through exposure to European societies.  New animals, means of plants, weaponry, clothing, and other materials were quickly adopted by the Native peoples.  Natives did learn a great deal about Americans and they failed to fully adopt American practices precisely because they saw how terrible they were.  The inequality and misery of life in Americans cities was well known to not just Natives but also Americans themselves.  A huge problem for the early colonial governments was actually the number of people who kept running away from their lives in the colonial world and trying to incorporate themselves among the natives.

&gt;Instead they rejected attempts at integration/acclimatization, they rejected changing their way of life to a more western style, and chose to remain hunter gathers.

A cute story but again not accurate.  What you've again chosen to omit that many Native peoples WERE agrarian long before and up to the arrival of the Europeans.  You have consistently whined about the myths that surround Natives and yet you make zero effort to dispel the myths that don't ""justify"" their genocide.  Even more glaring is your omission of the fact that even after some of these people did become farmers, did become Christians, did completely Westernize, they still were killed in great numbers, shoved onto reservations, and treated like second class citizens.  Even after their ""empty"" land had been taken, even after their ""unevolved"" lifestyles had been changed, they were oppressed and murdered.  Why? Because at the heart of colonial-era European culture, it was never really about how they lived or what lands they had.  It was about a fundamental contempt for non-whites which continues today and is hidden in the subtext of how they view their past - as your own post exquisitely demonstrates.

&gt; And if there is one rule on planet earth it is, adapt or die, they chose to die, fighting....and that is exactly what happened. 

Uh, no Mr Goebbels, that is not how life works on planet Earth.  In the real world, all societies have a limited degree of flexibility that determines their capacity to respond to circumstantial changes.  No society can simply toss aside their existing ways of living and magically adopt a new one.  The 20th century was one of the most bloody periods in world history because a handful of ignorant people like you adopted that corrupted Darwinistic credo and attempted to rebuild societies in the image of their definition of ""progress"".  Hundreds of millions of people starved to death, were executed, or died in war because societies don't just modernize at the snap of a finger and people can't just abandon their identifies in favor of what handful of callous and backwards individuals like you think is ideal.

&gt;Lets also quit applying 21st century morals on a 16th-19th century world.

Charming.  What you fail to note again is that none of the critiques I have made are totally recent inventions.  When word of the Conquistadors' behaviors in the Americas reached the Spanish Crown, a commission composed of Spain's foremost thinkers was called forth to determine how to treat native peoples.  In this commission, one of Spain's most famous theologians argued that colonialism and the mass-extermination of native peoples and their culture was fundamentally immoral.  He warned that one day Spain would incur the wrath of God for their treatment of Native Americans.  Though his viewpoint is not identical to how we see things today, it does underline a truth which people like you try to obscure precisely because it further demonstrates how terrible Europe's conquest of the Americas was.  Many Europeans did know it was wrong, from the very beginning.  Many Europeans called for reforms, called for its cessation.  They fought, they died, but it continued.  

&gt;We have grown as a planet more in the last 100 years than we did in the previous 1,000.

No, the Western World has grown more than it did int he last 1,000 years.  For those who didn't spend nearly 500 years butchering their way across the planet, there continues to be mass poverty, suffering, exploitation, and death - all of which are unnecessary and all of which continue solely because as hard as people like you may try, the consequences of Imperialism cannot be hidden away in a textbook.  We are dealing with them right now.  

With that said, I am going to offer my final thoughts to you.  Whether through ignorance or racism, your entire post has been nothing but a gigantic misrepresentation of the complexity of the conquest of the Americas, one with a transparent message that does nothing but trivialize one of the worst crimes in our history.  For that I find you utterly repulsive.  I have answered your post only because I think other readers deserve an alternate reading of things.  If it were just you and I at a coffee shop, I would have walked away from you because I believe that anyone deluded enough to write that load of crap must be too far gone to help.

But what the Habsburg court hails as the greatest innovation of the century is really nothing more than a brilliant illusion. The chess machine is secretly operated from inside by the Italian dwarf Tibor, a God-fearing social outcast whose chess-playing abilities and diminutive size make him the perfect accomplice in this grand hoax.

The crowds all across Europe adore the Turk, and the success of Baron von Kempelen seems assured. But when a beautiful and seductive countess dies under mysterious circumstances in the presence of the automaton, the Mechanical Turk falls under a cloud of suspicion, and the machine and his inventor become the targets of espionage, persecution, and aristocratic intrigue.

Specific instances where race or something similar crops up that I can think of:  Ethiopia was known of in Greek myth, even before they started colonizing the Mediterranean. They thought that Ethiopians lived both to the far east and to the far west, closest to where the sun met the horizon, which explained why they were so dark.  In the Trojan cycle, Troy doesn't fall immediately after the events of the Iliad- after Hektor dies, Memnon, an Ethiopian hero/king, shows up to protect Troy from the Greeks. (Memnon is the son of Eos, goddess of the dawn- again the link between Ethiopia and the sun).  Memnon is almost as good as Achilles, but is killed by Achilles in revenge for a fallen comrade (identical to Hektor's death) and is granted immortality.  In some accounts, Memnon is in fact the progenitor of all Africans (a much more noble line than the Bible's account of Ham, the bastard!)  Andromeda and Cassiopeia are also Ethiopian royalty, though I believe they are explicitly white, not just in depictions, but in written accounts as well.  I don't remember why that is, possibly descent from the gods.

The Greeks and Phoenicians conquered and colonized much or all of North Africa.  Carthage was a Phoenician settlement (which is why the wars against them were Punic).  The legend of them buying the land from the native Berbers reads almost like Europeans in the Americas- they tricked them by buying as much land as could be covered by a cow (?) skin, and then cutting the skin into an incredibly fine single loop large enough to encompass the city.  This was very much a Phoenician city- they had to have interaction with the local tribes, but they weren't part of the government of this nascent empire in any way.

In Egypt, Alexander had conquered in 332 BC, and nearly 300 years later, Cleopatra was being praised for being the first (and therefore only) in her dynasty to learn to speak like the natives did.  This is strong evidence that the conquering Greeks did not do much mingling with the native Egyptians.  400 years after that, Augustine of Hippo was raised as a Roman citizen living in what's now Algeria, and was notable for learning the language of the natives of the town where he was Bishop.  So there wasn't much mingling of peoples over the nearly 1000 years of southern Europe's ancient control of northern Africa.

There are several other points that might be worth commenting on by someone more qualified than I, notably the Jugurthine War and the late Roman Empire's problems with Berber raids in north Africa.

So I guess my point is that they certainly didn't have the pseudoscientific views of race that have been such a problem for us in the last few centuries, and it's true that slavery tended to be an economic or martial thing, and wasn't at all like the chattel ownership of an entire people.  But that doesn't mean that the conquered people got along all hunky-dory with their subjects.  I hope that's enough to give you a good idea.",1391243683,2,2,0,AskHistorians

---

&gt;

&gt;The term North America maintains various definitions in accordance with location and context. In English, North America may be used to refer to the United States and Canada together. Alternatively, usage sometimes includes Greenland and Mexico (as in the [North American Free Trade Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement)), as well as offshore islands.

&gt;In [Ibero-America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibero-America) and other parts of Europe,[which?] North America usually designates a subcontinent of the Americas containing Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and often Greenland, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, and Bermuda.

&gt;North America has been historically referred to by other names. Spanish North America ([New Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain)) was often referred to as Northern America, and this was the [first official name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solemn_Act_of_the_Declaration_of_Independence_of_Northern_America) given to Mexico.

Our son looks more white with blue eyes and auburn hair, though he shares my husband's chin and mouth and doesn't burn easily in the sun, unlike his super white mama. I'm hoping my daughter lucks out with thick Indian hair.

I really want my children to feel connected to their whole heritage. We get twice as many holidays, for instance, because we celebrate cultural Christian and Hindu holidays, though my husband is agnostic and I practice Buddhism as an athiest. It helps that both of our families mainly live nearby in the San Francisco Bay Area, though we still have close family in India. Living where we do also helps because it is a pretty diverse place with lots of cultures represented. Many of my friends are in biracial relationships.

I think of my husband and myself more as internationalist types than being tied to a specific way of doing things. We pick and choose the traditions that work for our family. We both love history and science and try to look at the big picture when figuring out our approach to parenting, rather than just going with how we were raised. I joke that with feeding our kids, for instance, we are just cross-cultural enough that we make both sets of grandparents slightly uncomfortable.  We put my son in a booster chair and let him feed himself (not Indian) but also let him run around a bit and eat from our plate (not my culture) when he was younger.

In an ideal world, I would want our kids to feel like they can build from both cultures. I'm guessing that they'll have an easier time in our part of the US because India is less open, but who knows where things will lie in the future.

Louis XX is a claimant to the throne of France as he is the head of the house of Bourbon and publicly claims himself to be the rightful King of France. His claim has the most support because of the legitimacy of his position within the royal family - if the throne was restored to the Bourbons he would be the King as the eldest male head of the family. Things get a little confusing (and very controversial amongst French royalists and imperialists) when you factor in the supporters of the descendants of Napoleon who claim that the Bourbons lost the throne of France with the death (and later abdications) of the last Bourbon rulers. 

Virtually all thrones of Europe have pretenders.

Edited to say: this is probably a little off-topic but you might be interested to know that there is a group of people who claim that Queen Elizabeth is not the rightful Queen of England as the English law only allowed for Catholic Monarchs and the Henry VIII divorce and laws regarding bastards means that the throne of England has been occupied by frauds since the 1500s.  There is a Catholic pretender to the throne of England who (if their arguments are right) is the actual monarch of England as the head of the non-bastard side of the family.

Seriously!

I know people like to point at population pressures, food shortages, and such as the drive behind colonization and empire-building, but the thing is, there ARE other ways of accomplishing those goals.  The Dutch, for example, were doing quite well with a lot more trading and a lot less warfare, until the rest of Europe decided piracy (oh, I'm sorry, *privateering*) was more fun.

But then the Renaissance goes and digs up old Rome, discovers all their writings, and they go absolutely cuckoo for anything the Romans said or did.  Everyone's building Greco-Roman complexes and adorning their walls with mythological figures and basically trying to rebuild old Rome.

So I honestly don't think it's too far-fetched to suggest that this 16th-17th Century Romamania prompted a lot of rich people to decide that the perfect thing to accompany all their marble columns and arches was an empire to go with it... and nevermind that it didn't actually work out for old Rome, in the end.

I mean, after all, they pretty much repeated Roman propaganda word-for-word when justifying their treatment of the locals.  Barbarians!  BARBARIANS EVERYWHERE!

As such they rely on petrodollars and European money to build whatever they have. That, combined with rapid globalization, means that these states are scrambling to save face in a globalized context that paints their region and religion as misogynist. In these days, where a number of international rankings make it a point to include women and progress as a critical component of national development (as they should), the Gulf countries come up short and thus are painted badly.

At the same time, these countries feel like the huge numbers of migrant workers and globalized intersections of economy and culture are tearing at the fabric of their Arab essence. If you come to Dubai it's primarily glitz and glamor, shopping malls and boutiques, but there are monuments and areas marked as heritage sites. Abu Dhabi has a string of oyster statues that invoke the major occupation of the past - pearl diving. Sharjah has a roundabout with a massive Qur'an, an Islamic Monument, a vast Heritage Museum, and more. The government is working very, very hard to preserve their culture, and women - as the assumed ""natural reproducers"" of the nation - find themselves as a weapon in this battle.

Some very interesting literature to read on this (besides the Krause article I mentioned, and Mervat Hatem's 'state feminism' in the MENA region) is Suad Joseph's concept of the relational self, with Hisham Sharabi's term 'neopatriarchy'. Both these terms explain how, in a Middle Eastern context, the family is the basic unit of the state (as per constitutions), so an individual operating within the state thus brings with them all their family loyalties into the state. Here in the UAE, the sheikhs have massive families, and even third or fourth cousins of a minor sheikh wield a lot of power. When women are appointed to state positions, they are usually sheikhas who may have their own agendas for change, but often have to bow to family and state loyalties because of how they were given power - through membership to an elite family, not public elections. 

Women's organizations here in the UAE are all headed by sheikhas - one for each emirate, so seven in total. The appointment of sheikhas, their route to power, and family loyalties (with the embededness in the state) thus inform the strategies they use to ""empower"" women, which includes teaching them office skills BUT also to be good mothers. This move to make breastfeeding required by law is a strategy used to ""empower"" women as mothers of the nation - mothers who will build their sons and daughters to lead the minority population of the locals in a setting where migrants far outnumber the locals, and where Islamic fundamentalism threatens to topple the government.

As for the reporting...yeah, red tape sucks ass. Also, the case of that poor Norwegian woman who reported being raped and then was locked up for ""drunk sex"" has put a lot of women here on edge. Most doctors here are not Emarati and as such don't want to deal with the police. And LBR, reporting a woman for using Cerelac isn't high on their priority list.

&gt;

&gt;**Pennsylvania German** (Deitsch, Pennsylvania Deitsch, Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch, usually referred to as **Pennsylvania Dutch** is a [variety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics\)) of [West Central German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Central_German) spoken by possibly more than 250,000 people in [North America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America).

&gt;It has traditionally been the language of the [Pennsylvania Dutch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch), descendants of late 17th and early 18th century immigrants to the US states of [Pennsylvania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania), [Maryland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland), [Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia) and [North Carolina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina) from southern Germany, eastern France ([Alsace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace) and [Lorraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_(region\))) and Switzerland. Although for many, the term 'Pennsylvania Dutch' is often taken to refer to the [Old Order Amish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish) and related groups exclusively, the term should not imply a connection to any particular religious group. The Amish and Mennonites originally made up only a small percentage of the Pennsylvania German population.

&gt;In this context, the word ""Dutch"" does not refer to the [Dutch people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people) or their descendants. Instead it is probably left over from an archaic sense of the [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) word ""Dutch""; compare German Deutsch ('German'), Dutch Duits ('German'), Diets ('Dutch'), which once referred to any people speaking a non-peripheral continental [West Germanic language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germanic_languages) on the European mainland. Alternatively, some sources give the origin of ""Dutch"" in this case as a corruption or a ""folk-rendering"" of the Pennsylvania German [endonym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endonym) ""Deitsch"".

C'est propre, calme, grand mais pas trop, sûr, touristique mais pas trop, vraiment très *très* beau, et pas excessivement cher (~10 eu/m2 en location). Les transports en commun sont super, pas chers si tu prends l'abonnement ou que tu fraudes comme je l'ai fait quand j'étais étudiant. C'est très 'vélo-friendly': tu peux traverser la ville en 30 minutes en pédalant mollement.

Côté météo, les saisons sont 'franches': en été il fait super chaud (les recors de températures les plus élevées sur l'année y sont fréquents), et en hiver super froid (pareil pour les records). Le reste du temps il fait très beau, ou très moche.

L'Allemagne est à 5 minutes, ça permet de diversifier un peu ses courses. Ils ont des charcuteries sympa. 

Je ne sais pas trop quoi rajouter que Chrissoubibi n'a pas déjà dit. Je ne peux rien dire sur la bière, n'en consommant pas.

Je vais quand même balancer quelques trucs négatifs, histoire de pas avoir l'air trop chauvin:

- Il est difficile de posséder une voiture (stationnement, circulation, etc) à proximité du centre ville. Je n'en ai jamais eu besoin ceci dit.

- J'évite la place de l'homme de fer (centre ville) comme la peste. Un monde dingue, du bruit partout, des relou qui te demandent si t'as pas l'heure ou du feu tous les 2 mètres. C'est insupportable.

- En tant qu'ingénieur en informatique, il y a assez peu de job intéressant pour moi. Il y en a hein, mais peu. C'est pour ça que je suis parti d'ailleurs, mais un peu à contre coeur.

- Je me suis fait voler mon vélo 3 fois !

Et ... c'est tout. Punaise, c'est fou ce que cette ville est géniale en fait.

J'ajouterais également que y'a des petits avantages administratifs: meilleure sécurité sociale, des jours fériés en plus  ([à cause du concordat](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordat_en_Alsace-Moselle)), la ville a sa propre compagnie d'électricité, ce genre de chose.

Je ne peux que te conseiller d'aller faire un tour sur /r/strasbourg !

Pourquoi envisage-tu d'aller vivre à Strasbourg ? Si tu cherches quelque chose de précis, je peux peut-être aider. Ce dont tu peux être sûr(e) c'est que cette ville a très peu d'inconvénients. Je connais des gens qui n'en sont pas particulièrement fan (c'est un peu mort le dimanche), mais je n'ai jamais entendu quelqu'un dire qu'il déteste.",1391252082,9,9,0,france

There doesn't seem to be any meta thinking about it, if that's what you mean. This is stuff that people - common or not - honestly believed in.

&gt; Additionally, how devout was the average layman.

The average layman after 1215 would be expected to attend church yearly and tithe. He would also be very invested in his church as a sign of local pride. 

&gt; how faithfully did people follow strict religious tenants

This is always a question which can't firmly be answered. ""More or less"" is about as much as I'd be willing to say.

&gt; Was there a genuine fear of hell?

You know the stock phrase ""sure as hell""? As in ""I sure as hell don't want to do that""? When people came up with it, you can be confident they thought hell was for sure.

(China has more people but less buying power; Europe has more people and buying power but not really a single market due to localization needed for each country as well as variance in demand from country to country.) With economy of scale, cars, commodities, soda, textile, produces, are all cheaper than elsewhere, even compared to less developed countries. it doesn't mean American are necessarily richer....we do pay a lot more for things like rent, airfare, health care, etc.

for example, a 3 bedroom condo in the nice area of taipei city starts around $600k to $1.5m. the same condo in America in downtown SF or Bellevue would be about the same. However, the rent for a such condo in Taiwan is about $1200 a month top whereas in America it would be around $4k.

a BMW 335i in Taiwan is about $120k; in US it's about $55k
a Toyota Camry made in Taiwan is about $30k whereas in US it's about $25k

if you buy an airfare from the same airlines, flights departing from Asia (round trip) to US will be significantly cheaper than flight departing from US to Asia (same round trip city pair). Also, you don't need to pay for the ticket, you can reserve it and pay just few weeks before departure (for all fares). In US, you have to pay right away.

Southwest airlines ticket is about average in America. A round trip ticket between LA/SF, or SF/SEA, or SF/MDW are around $200/$250/$400. Air Asia tickets fly you from Malaysia to any country in Asia as little as from $40~$200.",1391253179,13,13,0,funny

This looks thorny, until you look at the numbers: in Europe at least, the only people who genuinely don't want to cooperate (I mean, pay decent taxes), are generally insanely rich (as in top 5% at least). That's not a lot of people to coerce, and forcing them to give up part of their revenue or property, wouldn't make them poor either.

I reckon we shouldn't overdo it either, or investments may plummet, and that would hurt long term, technological growth, which is badly needed to solve Death.

They would be allowed all the benefits of parenthood such as visiting the child and spending time with them and knowing they have passed on their genetic material - but without any of the responsibilty? 
And if this 'financial abortion' didn't allow for the parent to see the child they have absolved themselves of financial responsibility for then that means the child gets no say in whether or not they have contact with their parent - adoptions are challenged all the time when parents change their minds so this nonsense would never stand up in court. In Europe the Human Rights Act would surely make any such paperwork meaningless - an individual has a right to a family life and the child or anyone acting on behalf of the child would be able to challenge any paperwork that seemed to block them from seeing their parent. Also the parent would be able to use that same legislation to say that no one has the right to keep them from their child whether they pay for it or not.

The answer, it seems, is ""not perfect, but better than the eurozone.""

Here are a few comments:

1. I was disappointed it said nothing about having a banking union. The US has an almost completely integrated banking system now, with regard to supervision, resolution, etc. (This is relatively new. Compare the situation with the degree of fragmentation that prevailed as recently as 1980.) The lack of a banking union in Europe is, in my view, one of the big weaknesses of the EZ

2. ""Similarity of exposure to external shocks"" is important, but the article puts too much weight on correlation of business cycles as a measure. The presence of a single central bank is going to guarantee some degree of correlation. I would put more emphasis on correlation of exposure to external shocks, especially terms-of-trade shocks. The post only mentions these in passing, for example, when it mentions resource-rich vs. manufacturing regions. Exposure to t-o-t shocks is not highly correlated in the US but is made up for by greater internal labor mobility.

3. The post underrates the importance of fiscal transfers. The difference is night and day between the EU and US. It is probably the biggest single difference. Florida would have done as badly as Greece during the crisis if it had been responsible for covering its own bills for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, and unemployment benefits.

4. The post says no data is available for ""shock absorbers,"" e.g., labor market flexibility. How about trying right-to-work legislation as an indicator? And does anyone put out some kind of ""index of economic freedom"" for states, including indicators like prevalence of regulatory barriers to business formation, construction, etc? There are several such indexes for countries. ",1391255000,13,13,0,Economics

Farmers favoured European style cultivation methods that were more profitable in a time of skyrocketing prices due to massive exports to Russia and Europ. They favoured short term profits over long term durability mixed with a pure lack of knowledge that they even were doing something wrong. Cotton farmers left their fields bare over the months and burned the stubble because it was more convienent than other methods thus further speeding up the 	corrosion process. 

This didn't address what I said. 

So you think people would still choose to starve themselves and destroy their business given this information? You just stated they lacked knowledge... Well given this knowledge would people choose to ruin their lives again?

You're also still avoiding the role that the federal government played in encouraging poor management of the land. Even the USDA acknowledged this.

The Gallinago snipes have a nearly worldwide distribution, the Lymnocryptes Jack Snipe is restricted to [Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) and [Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and the Coenocorypha snipes are found only in the [Outlying Islands of New Zealand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Outlying_Islands). The three species of [painted snipe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_snipe) are not closely related to the typical snipes, and are placed in their own family, the Rostratulidae.

We would spend a lot of time with these families and got to know them all really well, and frankly, I can't think of a single example in which the children had difficulty adjusting. They all went to American schools, all learned the language quickly and easily made friends at school. Granted, all of the children were fairly young when they first arrived (the oldest was 6 or 7 -- this French family stayed for 5 or 6 years then they moved to Spain and their children still adjusted very well to the new country... The oldest is now a senior and wants to go to university in Canada, if that tells you anything...). 

  Now, I'm sure ease of adjustment varies depending on the country and the support network you can expect to have upon arriving, but from what I've seen, children are resilient and adjust rather easily to these sorts of new situations and environments, as long as you maintain a sense of normalcy and stability at home wherever home might be. I think it could truly be a great and hugely beneficial experience for the kids, and I'd strongly consider giving it a shot. ",1391256225,9,9,0,Parenting

Murder rates in America have been declining steadily for well over 20 years, and is still falling, despite the fact that there are more legally carried concealed firearms on the streets than at any time in the last 100 years and the number of CCW permits has been growing pretty steadily since the mid 1980's, while at the same time other nations are experiencing the same general decline in rates until they reach a bottoming point at around 2 and level out.

So in other words, people of the sort she wishes to be. But now she has to convince them to help her, out of the goodness of their heart, for the sake of her father and her people. Well, let's see what's up.

**Shorter Asides / Notes:**

1. ""Are you afraid?"" - ""Of course not,"" ""Well, it was your idea coming here, so it's only natural."" - He doesn't need her confirmation or denial. Crusty knows Lennesia.

1. Yeah, ""She smiled!"", ""She ate it!"" - I can see why Lenessia is so darn *tired* and cynical all the time. It's as if she's an animal in a zoo people come to stare at.

1. This princess, the event that tops the list of her ""sins"" [is giving a speech dressed like this](http://i.imgur.com/grQAx8N.jpg) :P Yeah, she's a bit vain. Guess living as a noble your whole life does that to you.

1. [""Peek and get sent to the cathedral.""](http://i.imgur.com/FmQ0aHE.jpg) - You know a world is alive and breathing when its humor and insults progress ;-) Makes perfect sense within the show.

1. I, er, I don't know how much time passed, [but *this* ship is not what I expected](http://i.imgur.com/uXaUa10.jpg) O.O

1. So we just have the kids go back? We're not seeing any big fights? Then again, that was the whole point, small skirmishes to sap away the goblins' strength so the unwalled city would be safe, but still :(

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Captivating the Crowds - On Players and Motivation:**

1. [I had the same thought as Lenessia here](http://i.imgur.com/NAGUNJ8.jpg). As soon as Shiroe began giving out the details, players are already strategizing, and planning. We've all watched endless speeches by game companies, and we know to tune out to useless marketing after we get out the important data. Furthermore, it pays to get to the lucrative areas as early as possible, so players are *very* good at immediately moving to the practical stage, to try and not be outdone by others. No wiki while you're in the game though, so people have to pool their mental resources, and they had to sharpen their skills anew.

1. [Well, dress to impress!](http://i.imgur.com/toGTIwb.jpg) MMORPGs sure know how to make [good looking clothes](http://i.imgur.com/EJg5Kgh.jpg), practicality of design aside. But Shiroe had *really* made things tough, before stepping off, ""We don't really have any reason to help, and with that said, here is someone who would like to speak to you.""  - He did say, ""If we only care about ourselves"", and he knows players don't just care about themselves. Shiroe certainly doesn't, for combating that turn inwardness, and not caring about your fellow players is the reason he started the Round Table in the first place.

1. ""I am cowardly and lazy, I cannot do anything, but I am going to fight!"" - [That just might be the perfect thing to say](http://i.imgur.com/l3C14v9.jpg). The players are *players*. We all are a bit lazy, most of us do not wish to fight. That's part of the reason we're players to begin with. And to let someone who can die go forth while we stay behind? We're cynical, or at least profess to be, but that does not sit well with the ego of players, does it now? And then she tops it off by giving a whole ""damsel in distress"" message. A message combining strength and weakness, the goal to be strong even though you are weak.

1. That first cry after the speech is the other big part of it - ""I've been waiting for a big event like this!"" - Why do MMORPGs keep patching new content out, why do they keep releasing expansions? Why do Playstation trophies and Steam achievements work as well as they do? Players need *goals*, and they want someone else to set them for them. Since the Apocalypse, the people of the land stopped giving players quests. This is a return to normality, a return to the order of things. Even within a game, most quests aren't ""mandatory"", the NPCs *ask* you to fulfill them. So what if there's no gold reward here, there's renown, and we all play games for fun anyway :P

**2) Meanwhile, *Politics*:**

1. [Poor Lord Cowen](http://i.imgur.com/gVDpUpR.jpg), such a headache, dealing with nobles who are akin to small children, squabbling over rights. This is exactly the sort of headache Shiroe did not want to get tangled with. Everyone thinks the other might be making a bid for power, and no one thinks about poor Maihama that's about to get run over.

 Good thing Henrietta is here. In case you don't follow what just happened:

 1. Lord Cowen says he has a problem, that the lords think the Cowen family is trying to make an alliance with Akihabara.
 1. The adventurers say that wasn't the goal, surely.
 1. The point that it could create a new force to rival the Eastal Leagues, or influence it is made.
 1. Henrietta asks, ""So, what do *you* think? We need to know that before we accept.""

 Accept what? You ask, and this is where we see that Lord Cowen is an old hand at this game of subterfuge and diplomacy. He wasn't just telling them what the other lords feared, he came to see if they would actually be interested in making that fear a reality. He came to them to speak of a hypothetical that wasn't meant to be, originally, in order to gauge whether they'd like to turn it into reality.

1. Hm, that's unexpected, after I wrote all the above, he's just suggesting a non-aggression pact and a peace treaty? Guess he knows they can't truly force the adventurers to do anything, or best them in combat, and this is his best way of maintaining the current status in his alliance.

**3) On Humanity:**

1. ""The more games you've played, the harder it is to accept, that NPCs, flags, quests… they're humans, just like us."" - You all should read the first book in Terry Pratchett's Johnny Maxwell trilogy (each book stands on its own) - [Only You Can Save Mankind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_You_Can_Save_Mankind). They even renewed it a bit so people who don't remember old creaky modems and games on floppy disks could follow :P

1. [See this? I've said it before. People don't realize how inured we are to violence](http://i.imgur.com/g5IKMPZ.jpg), how in RPGs, including tabletop ones, any high level character had essentially killed many thousands of humanoids, all because they were ""Evil"". We shy away from anything having to do with sex, but this violence is background noise. Didn't we learn that the demi humans have souls as well? And yet, they're going to annihilate them. It was hard for Marielle, Naotsogu and the rest to accept the ""NPCs"" as real people, but it'll be even harder to accept humanoid monsters as such, because then how can you handle all the many thousands of them you've killed?

Next episode's preview, so we're going to focus on the kids, and we're going to focus on Rudy? Man, I can feel something at the corner of my eye already :&lt;

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

This episode sort of hit me in the feels. I like speeches, I like speeches that feel like they come from the heart (nothing tops the Maoyu speech though, *nothing*). I too have been a roleplayer for many years, I too played WoW as soon as it hit Europe, back in 2005. I could get these things.

Lenessia is the best non-moeblob moeblob. Crusty is the best non-big brother big brother. This show lives and dies by its cast, much more than the world, it had spent time making us care for the cast, and to let us spend time with them, and now it moves them, and in so doing moves us. I enjoyed the episode, it definitely was a ""feel"" based episode, one designed to make us go ""Yeah!"" or even ""Cool!"" without any action, or real plot progress, and it worked.

But, the inroads made between the nobles and the adventurers, both by Lenessia and her grandfather, they are the plot progression we've had this week. The realization by Lord Cowen? That was showing respect to the players - to think that giving them noble titles is respecting them is to say that you have something to offer them, that being a noble is better than what they are. Combined with Lenessia's realization, ""If these are adventurers, then what are nobles?"" seeks to say - the adventurers are already much more than the nobles are. They are free, and yet they can speak their mind, and bring forth change. They are not just more powerful, but admirable as *people*. They are, quite literally, *noble*.

Scandanavians as a population aren't immune. However, they do have a particular gene which seems to make them much less prone to infection than the general human population. 

A quick run down on viruses is that they require certain proteins to be on the cell surface, and this allows them to get into the cell. Once inside a cell, they use the cell ""machinery"" to build thousands of copies of themselves, which then spread throughout the body. The particular receptor in early stage infection is CCR5 ▵32.

In European populations (particularly in North-Western, but also the wider population) a particular mutation is present which removes one of these proteins from the cell surface. This makes it much harder for the HIV virus to infect individuals, as the virus is unable to get into their cells. Interestingly, the mutation seems to have spread through the population well **before** the HIV epidemic; there is still debate on what other evolutionary advantages explain that.

Having said that though, there are [reported cases](http://dobzhanskycenter.bio.spbu.ru/pdf/sjop/MS347_O%27Brien_Lancet.pdf) of people who are **homozygous** for mutated CCR5 ▵32 (having only the mutated version of the gene) being infected with HIV. The case study in that article received huge numbers of blood transfusions, so there are definitely other factors in his case.

So yes, there are genes which confer resistance (and potentially immunity in most cases) to HIV. They are also more prevalent in Europe and North-Western Europe in particular. However, only individuals who are homozygous for the gene would experience the full benefits, so it isn't something to bet on.",1391260467,2,2,0,explainlikeimfive

&gt;The oft-reprinted assertion that male homosexuals were called faggots because they were burned at the stake as punishment is an etymological urban legend.

&gt;Burning was sometimes a punishment meted out to homosexuals in Christian Europe (on the suggestion of the Biblical fate of Sodom and Gomorrah), but in England, where parliament had made homosexuality a capital offense in 1533, hanging was the method prescribed.

&gt;**Any use of faggot in connection with public executions had long become an English historical obscurity by the time the word began to be used for ""male homosexual""** in 20th century American slang, whereas the contemptuous slang word for ""woman"" (and the other possible sources or influences listed here) was in active use. It was used in this sense in early 20c. by D.H. Lawrence and James Joyce, among others.

&gt;By contrast, Mr Rohani has promised that none of Iran’s existing nuclear facilities will be destroyed; that Arak (which, once online, gives Iran an alternative plutonium path to a bomb) will be kept only to supply medical isotopes; and that Iran has the right to what he calls “industrial-scale” enrichment, which could mean at least 50,000 centrifuges. It is thought that he envisages a deal that freezes the programme for three years, after which, having shown good faith and signed the additional protocol, Iran would be allowed to expand enrichment to an industrial scale.

That, folks, is the great ""breakthrough"" peace deal. So of course some Israelis are going to be worried. Reddit doesn't know or care about history but every decade has seen some big conflict, 4 major wars in the past provoked by the Arabs, it is a tough situation to be forced to put your trust in America, who used to hate Israel and love the Arabs, and trust in Iran who wants to take control of OPEC from Saudi Arabia. That could also be harmful to America and the world economy in general, the more powerful a radical Iran becomes.

This whole peace process is being done in secret, with Kerry not having the dialog the Israelis want, at least according to a few news reports. Funny how reddit decries the TPP trade deal for being secret but this is ok?

Imagine, America. And instead of Al Qaeda being in Afghanistan, they worked in Mexico and committed 9/11. Then they took over the government and now control a powerful military.

I'm living in perhaps the most Americanized part of London right now, St. John's Wood. There is an American school nearby, a Starbucks on the corner, the Beatles Abbey Road crossing down the way, and narry a British accent to be heard anywhere up the high street. 

The Americans can get quite annoying here indeed. But I don't think I've heard anyone curse one out for not speaking proper British english. There's no outright hostility, just a mild annoyance and people making fun. 250 years ago, these two countries fought a war, but they've reconciled.

Spending some time in Europe, you'll get a sense of how ridiculous Quebec's introversion and linguistic preoccupation truly is. Most of Europe fought a war only 70 years ago, but are now in a tight union. And this, despite countries like Belgium, caught in a tripartite chaos between French, Flemish, and German, where the only neutral language in Brussels is English. Integration is nevertheless tight, ignoring the politics. If London were French, it would be the 6th largest French city by population of Francophones:

With all this in mind, sorry to say, and you can file this under Unpopular Opinions for this sub, but Quebec politics are navel-gazing, full of small people with small minds and small issues, and they often ignore the international perspective entirely.

&gt;

&gt;In the 1960s, controversial [Burnley F.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.) Chairman [Bob Lord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lord_(football_chairman\)) successfully convinced fellow [Football League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) Chairmen that televised matches on a Saturday afternoon would have a negative effect on the attendances of other football league games that were not being televised and as a result reduce their financial income.

&gt;As a result [The FA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_FA), [Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) and [Football League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) do not want English matches to be televised live between 2:45pm and 5:15pm on a Saturday within the [United Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). Until recently, the FA Cup Final was an exception and had been broadcast on 3pm on a Saturday in May; however, in 2012, the FA Cup Final was moved to 5pm.

&gt;In February 2011, [Advocate General Kokott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliane_Kokott) of the [European Court of Justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice) opined that the ""closed periods"" did not encourage match attendance at other league games.

What? Labor is the only thing that actually matters. Labor is the only thing that produces value.

&gt;Capital by itself is virtually worthless

This is correct.

&gt;You can find the concept of ""leisure"" in Wealth of Nations. I am not obligated to work 7 days per week, 24 hours per day.

But whose saying you have to? You're confusing Socialism with a Command economy again. The idea of having leisure is not something unique to Capitalism. Plenty of serfs in Feudal Europe enjoyed downtime of their own choosing. You have to go into a slavery system to find an example where that doesn't exist, but even then, most of them featured leisure.

&gt;According to ""capitalist"" authors, 

&gt;By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he (an investor) intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was not part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. 

Look, even Adam Smith disagrees with you. 

Now claiming that the goal has been increased utility **all along** is disingenuous because, if you really thought that, you'd jettison the economic mode.

&gt;And if you read 

The whole scenario you present here only works in a regulated market with low unemployment. Remove government welfare, introduce a surplus of labor, and people will work for whatever you want them to work for, because the alternative is to starve. 

Again, this is the problem with Capitalism. It relies too heavily on models and ignores real-world economics. 

We can use today as an example. Look at how many workers get paid below the poverty line. From a market perspective, that doesn't make sense. Revenue is rising, so the labor being produced by these employees **must** be valuable. So, where's the compensation? Based on the pay lots of low-skilled workers get, they would starve and freeze without government assistance.

The poor bastard was crying, whimpering ""I didn't do it. I swear to God I didn't do it.""

No one in the room, not even the priest administering the rites, showed any remorse on their faces.  Executions don't occur as frequently as they did twenty years ago but everyone here has heard the same thing many, many times.

Unlike what the movies portray, very few people ever accept their deaths willingly.  Most people go kicking and screaming until the last moment; asking for mercy, pleading their innocence.

Except this time, Jamal, this poor sucker, was telling the truth.  He knew it, and I knew it.  Nobody else did.

But it wasn't like as though Jamal Williams was a model citizen.  This guy was as dirty as they come.  Committed his first murder when he was 11; and was tried as a juvenile.  Multiple counts of grand theft auto, B and Es, and for selling crack.

No one was going to miss another gangbanger.  Forget that he's going to die.  He was replaced by at least three more wannabe Tony Montanas the moment he got arrested.

Jamal was a convenient fall guy.  No one, not even his own crack-addicted mother, came to his defense.  That's why I picked him.

Why did I do it?  I'm cleaning up the streets.

The streets are full of drug dealers, hookers, pimps, human traffickers, rapists, pedophiles, gangs, thugs, lawyers, and of course, dirty cops.

The law is useless against them.  The pimp that I killed, a Bosnian ""entrepreneur,"" as he liked to call himself, by the name of Zlatan, was smuggling in Eastern European women into the city to be used as rape toys before they ended up dead in two or three months.  But no one could pin anything on this guy.

People love to say that forced prostitution ought to be eliminated.  But to those people, ""forced prostitution"" is just an abstract term that they've read about.  They've never seen the bodies.  They've never seen what people are capable of doing to each other.  And they've never seen how incapable the law is to stop that.

So I finally did what any man with a sense of morals in my position would have done.  When I knew his security was the lowest, I killed his guard and his two sons first, and then I killed the son-of-a-bitch, but not before shooting off his pecker first.

Jamal was an easy scapegoat.  It was easy to convince others that it was just another business deal that went bad.

Jamal was pronounced dead at 12:02am.

I walked out of the prison building.  I lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.  I felt satisfied.  Two birds with one stone!

It is based on the astonishing simple notion that freeway space is limited, so if the demand for a particular space (i.e. the space your car is on) goes up then the price should go up.

The idea is that if it costs more to drive the downtown connector at 7 AM than at 10 AM or 4 AM, people will adjust their lives and schedules accordingly. This would even out traffic patterns and make everyone's lives so much better.

It's so easy to rubberstamp everything that isn't ideal as ""statist"" and therefore identically dangerous and useless.

In reality, many intelligent and reasonable people have worked on the system we have now. Sure, probably just as many selfish men have, but that doesn't mean that the current system doesn't have its advantages. Just compare liberal democracies with all the half-functioning ones or the outright dictatorships in the world. In which is the individual more protected? Why is that?

I'll tell you this, it's not because you have the right to bear arms. There's plenty of countries where individual rights are trampled on, but where it's very easy to get your hands on a weapon. Western europe is one of the places where the individual is most free, but where one may not carry a weapon.

So what is it that's keeping our society relatively stable and free? (Yeah, relatively, compared to the rest of the world, not to our ideal society). What else can it be than a more-or-less functioning system keeping violence and abuse of power in control? The personal ethics that come with it? The honestly enforced rights of man that persist through it?

Honestly, if Atlantis rose from the seas right now, all an-caps moved there and tried to set up their society, I'd sure as hell look to join a judicial system with oversight from the bottom-up, perhaps even a democratic system, rather than one were the owner of the company picks whatever employees he likes as judges.

Forgetting that there's real differences to be made even within the small spectrum of modern democracy isn't only not helping ourselves achieve small victories, but it's also making us unable to have reasonable discussions with reasonable people who work within the system.

Especially the bit about the heater (all models I've seen have used one. It depends entirely on the room and the model). And high heels are solely stripper shoes?

And even if they *are*, let's see your first figure drawings.

Maybe the drawings are on the floor because there are people sitting there, on either side. They're not necessarily discarded. And of course everyone is on the same side of the room for this pose; you don't want to draw the back of a head and the back of a chair. You only spread around the model when the pose supports it.

You're seeing evidence where the alternate explanation is more plausible. The stuff about ""no model would be cold because I was warm under the lights they used in one room"" is just grasping at straws.

Again, I ask you to state the alternative and contest this false reasoning: 'There is no model that would pose for figure drawing wearing high heels while spreading her legs. This means it's obviously a staged photograph with a model who wishes to pose for a photograph by wearing high heels and spreading her legs.'

Both castles you mentioned are beautiful, but some others that are very nicely preserved are Ljubljana castle (basically in the center of the city), Celje castle and Otočec castle (a popular wedding location in Otočec near Novo mesto - Lower Carniola, Anže Kopitar, a Slovene hockey player got married there).

Along with Postojna cave, a very beautiful system of caves is Škocjan caves (quite close to Postojna cave) which are also on UNESCO list of world heritage.

If you like hiking, you might want to visit TNP (Triglavski narodni park - Triglav national park) and the lakes that are located there. I was there about a year ago and it was beautiful. I do recommend going there in the Summer/early Autumn because it can get very cold up there :).

Lastly I will comment on your ""Dos and Don'ts""
&gt; #1. Greeting strangers is not uncommon, especially outside big cities. ""Dober Dan!"" or simply ""Dan!"", which literally means ""Good day!"", is appropriate. If you're hiking in a trail and passing someone from the other direction, you are required to greet. 

It is fairly common for people to greet each other on the streets in smaller towns/villages, but if you're staying in for example Ljubljana, it is not common/required. It is polite though, as you have said, that you greet hikers while hiking (it's a custom).


&gt; #2. Though not as common as it was, hitchhiking is still popular and quite safe. Remember when I say how infrequent the public transport is? There's one of your solution.

Hitchhiking is not really common, but as you have said, it is usually safe to hitchhike. It's particularly common amongst the students that aren't living in Ljubljana, but study there.


&gt; #3. Be punctual. Slovenians easily lose respect to you if you are late on your first meeting with them. 

I disagree with this one personally. It really depends on the person, but it's not typical for Slovenes to resent you for being late (though they might be a bit annoyed).

&gt; #4. Slovenians like to plan ahead, stick to their plans and keep their promises. Slovenians pay their debts. 

Again, depends on the person. I like to plan ahead, but some people don't. Also Slovenes don't pay their debts, that's why our banks are on the verge of bankruptcy :).

&gt; #5. Ask the bill and pay directly to the waiter. Leaving money on the table is impolite. Tipping is not required and not practiced, but still welcomed. 

Not sure whether leaving money on the table is impolite. In a restaurant definitely pay to the waiter, but if you're in a bar just for a coffee, you can leave the money on the table (I do sometimes, if I'm in a hurry).

&gt; #6. Handshake is the norm when you meet someone for the first time. Kissing is only when you really know the person. 

Yep, don't kiss people when you first meet them (doesn't matter whether you're a man or a woman).

&gt; #7. Remove shoes when you enter people's house. Sometime the host will equip you with a pair of slippers. 

Taking off your shoes is customary unless your host asks you to leave them on (in case it's cold inside and they don't have spare slippers for example). If you visit a friend though, they will usually insist you keep your shoes on (but I usually take them off regardless).

&gt; #8. People usually don't like it when you say that Slovenia is Eastern Europe. Central or Southeastern Europe is generally more acceptable.

Calling Slovenia an Eastern Europe/Balkan country usually has a negative tone to it in Slovenia. I don't really get it. It's probably a case of our imaginary superiority (in that we want to distance ourselves from our ex-Yugoslav neighbours).

&gt; #9. Communism and socialist pass times are not really a good conversation topic, unless you already familiar with the person. Try to avoid it. 

The only reason to abstain from making comments about communism/socialism/old regime is that the person you're talking to didn't like the system. Otherwise, it's not a taboo.

&gt; #10. Slovenians are really easily impressed if you speak a bit of their language. It's the ultimate ice breaker! So.. Ladies..

Of course we are impressed. Our language is damn hard (you know with duality and all the exceptions and stuff).

Hve you ever tried to work without tools or knowledge (both of those fall under capital). 

&gt;But whose saying you have to? You're confusing Socialism with a Command economy again. The idea of having leisure is not something unique to Capitalism.

I wasn't saying that about socialism, I was responding to your comment about capitalism, or at least what I thought you were saying. 

&gt;Now claiming that the goal has been increased utility all along is disingenuous because, if you really thought that, you'd jettison the economic mode.

Not at all. 

&gt;The whole scenario you present here only works in a regulated market with low unemployment.

While I am in favour of regulation, one feature of loosely regulated economies is that you get very little unemployment except in temporary busts and in pure labour monopsonies, but in those busts wages never fall to near zero, so your argument doesn't really hold except in a theoretical sense. 

&gt;Again, this is the problem with Capitalism. It relies too heavily on models and ignores real-world economics.

Thanks for the laugh. Capitalism has been tested, albeit with regulation, over and over again. We know what it does well and we know what it does badly. We have economic theories based on models and others based on data. 

Socialism, on the other hand, has never been given a fair shake. We can say that certain elements of it work (cooperatives) and certain elements don't (completely leaderless communities) in the real world, but even that wouldn't quite be fair because they've never been tried altogether on a large scale, and we know that the dynamics of small communities (like the utopian ones set up in Europe and America in the 19th century) are very different to large society dynamics. 

&gt;Revenue is rising, so the labor being produced by these employees must be valuable.

Profit, not revenue is the right measure, but that too is rising. What models predict is that in a crisis, wages don't drop much because they are stick (people don't just accept 50% pay cuts across the board). This stickiness of wages is a big reason why crises cause unemployment. In the recovery, the first thing to improve is the unemployment level and as that reaches full employment levels, raises start to rise. It actually rises before that because subsets of the workforce, engineers, carpenters, accountants, etc, might reach full employment before the general economy. 

As for government assistance, I am very much in favour of social safety nets. When I say that pure socialism wouldn't work, I am not suggesting the alternative of pure capitalism. My preference is for a capitalistic structure with the most efficient and effective socialistic and environmental ideas laid over top. It's hard to get the balancing act right, but I admire countries like Sweden and Costa Rica in their efforts. 

&gt;reddits being weird and wont let me post more than this :/

The two big things that decrease it are disease and malnutrition. European height began dropping during the High Middle Ages, when a swelling population and rapid urbanization (the city of Paris increased from less than 20,000 to 200,000 people in less than 200 years) put increased pressure on society, and it reached its nadir right around the time of the American Revolution. One can find ample proof of this by consulting British and French Army documents, which display the heights of men brought into service; even as late as the 1860s the average seems to have been about 5'5"". It should be noted that the European upper classes were not significantly affected, and were probably nearly as tall as we are today.

Europe itself was never one of ethnic nations until very recently. The number of peoples that have moved around in Europe is considerable just in the last thousand years. Note that I'm talking about *entire* peoples not simply of individuals. The very idea wasn't even invented until quite recently in the grand scheme of things. 

To suddenly define ourselves along ethnic lines is not really logical either due to the nature of DNA and our present knowledge. 

That being said, there is more to a nation than its ethnicity. There is something far more important in my mind; culture, ideas and identity. 

The homogenous nature of my country was a source of identity, belonging and not least trust. The mutual trust that grew out of belonging gave us a great democracy.

Also, notice how Monsanto used the same **exact** rat species.)

[Now consider the formal reasons given for the retraction.](http://gmoseralini.org/professor-seralini-replies-to-fct-journal-over-study-retraction/)

""We, authors of the paper published in FCT more than one year ago on the effects of Roundup and a Roundup-tolerant GMO (Séralini et al., 2012), and having answered to critics in the same journal (Séralini et al., 2013), do not accept as scientifically sound the debate on the fact that these papers are inconclusive because of the rat strain or the number of rats.""



[According to this interview with a senior scientist at Consumer's Union](http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=13-P13-00049&amp;segmentID=2)

""Well, basically what Dr. Séralini did was he did the same feeding study that Monsanto did and published in the same journal eight years prior, and in that study, they used the same number of rats, and the same strain of rats, and came to a conclusion there was no problem. So all of a sudden, eight years later, when somebody does that same experiment, only runs it for two years rather than just 90 days, and their data suggests there are problems, that all of a sudden the number of rats is too small? Well, if it’s too small to show that there’s a problem, wouldn’t it be too small to show there’s no problem?""

""When you look at their guidelines, they say there’s only three reasons to retract a paper. One, clear evidence that the findings are unreliable due to misconduct, that is, data fabrication or honest error. Two, plagiarism or redundant publication. Three, unethical research. In the letter that the editor of Food and Chemical Toxicology, Dr. Wallace Hayes sent to Dr. Séralini, they admitted that they found no problem with plagiarism, unethical research or data fabrication. There was no problem there. They just said they were going to withdraw it because there was some data that was “inconclusive,” particularly the number of animals used and the strain of rat used.""

Continuing with the interview...

""it turns out the European Commission is spending 3 million Euros to actually do that Séralini study again, run it for two years, use 50 or more rats and look at the carcinogenicity. So they’re actually going to do the full-blown cancer study, which suggests that Séralini’s work was important, because you wouldn’t follow it up with a 3 million Euro study if it was a completely worthless study.""

Lastly, here's Seralini's reponse,


""A factual comparative analysis of the rat feeding trial by the Séralini’s group and the Monsanto trials clearly reveals that if the Séralini experiments are considered to be insufficient to demonstrate harm, logically, it must be the same for those carried out by Monsanto to prove safety. Basically, all previous studies finding adverse effects of GE crops have been treated by regulators with the attitude: only those studies showing adverse effects receive a rigorous evaluation of their experimental and statistical methods, while those that claim proof of safety are taken at face value. All studies that reported no adverse effects were accepted as proof of safety regardless of these manifest (but deemed irrelevant) deficiencies of their methods.""",1391273671,1,1,0,conspiracy

&gt;What about protecting against the government, could civilians with guns really hold out against the US military, should it ever come to that?

Today? Absolutely not. That's pure folly. But the American Revolution was more or less exactly that: civilians taking the musket off their mantle and joining their local militia. The second amendment specifically refers to militia as its justification.

You also have to keep in mind that America had a massive frontier where deadly confrontations with natives were unfortunately all too common. The frontier also provided for pockets of lawlessness. For example, the piney woods of East Texas is a perfectly civilized place today, but 100-150 years ago, it was a hotspot for fugitives and wanted men to escape to to avoid law enforcement back home. Such environments necessitated arms.

Then there's also ranchers out west that needed rifles to protect their livestock from wolves or other predators. And even today if you're out walking in rural Colorado, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a gun at hand should you have a chance encounter with a mountain lion.

Due to the frontier figuring so heavily in American history, we simply have a culture of gun ownership and violence that is only starting to wind down. If America hadn't had this frontier and had been more urban with more dependable law enforcement, I'm sure we'd share more European sensibilities in regards to guns.

(Personally, I don't care much about guns one way or another. It's mostly a wedge issue here that I'd rather avoid.)

Someone posted a really illuminating link about it back when talking about the name was against the rules, so it got downvoted and lost, but it was a native american explaining the politics of some very very white tribe who has a LOT of lobbyist money, meanwhile the actual rez indians use redskins gear for their high school teams because they like the logo as it is a respectful depiction of native americans, and they really don't mind the name, because they never had a jim crow so their color was never really made out to be a huge deal.

In fact if you look through the history of the US the race of natives was never an issue.  The only real discrimination they faced that was racial was that someone who was half native and part of the ""englishman's tribe"" would often be refused whiskey in saloons because it was believed that alcohol caused ""indian madness""

Years later we find out that livers are actually racist and Asian descendant people don't have an enzyme that European descendant people have that breaks down alcohol so they use different enzymes.  

So it's never been a color issue for them, it's been a cultural issue.  White people and Natives have been intermarrying since the beginning with no problems.

Korea was an interesting situation because we didn't necessarily put our best men forward (if you look at the pacific, it was Nimitz who made the leapfrog campaign, not Macarthur who wanted to go after island fortresses). When we did put a great military mind forward in the top chair, the war quickly de-escalated after nuclear threats were seriously made. It stopped China from providing aid and made N.Korea's war effort hit a screeching hault. 


I understand the sentiment, top civilians do do a good job at times. However, you also have to consider that Vietnam was unique in that the commander-in-chief had an ability to run the war at a tactical level like never before. It was a shame they took it. An example of a good civilian war time leader in my mind would be FDR who set a strategic priority on ""Europe First"".

**Location:** Czech Republic, Europe  

**Age:** 17  

**Hobbies:** Playing games, recording myself doing so and watching other people play stuff. I also enjoy playing the guitar and attempting to make my own music (and failing at it, but I don't really like that part).  

**Minecraft IGN:** 123456rpm  

**How long have you been playing?:** I can't really remember. I know I started on the browser version, and soon after that I tried the (1.3 I think?) Beta.

**What do you enjoy most about the game?:** You can play it in any way you want - you can choose your own rules and regulations to make it interesting, but nobody's forcing you to do so. You could build a self-sustaining floating ship on one of your worlds, and then go on and become a poor fisherman or a king of your own castle - pretty much anything is possible, the only limitation is your imagination.  

**What is your style of play?:** I'm very much into automation, redstone, and figuring out different ways of using it. That unfortunately means form comes after function, which doesn't really enhance the surroundings of my base and it is the number one thing I'll have to work on. I used to just go down into a cave and make that my home, but not anymore. I plan on forcing myself to make good looking stuff before I pack it full of redstone, so that's something to look forward to.  

**What makes you a good Minecrafter:** I'd say I'm pretty ambitious. My projects are never small, they always take tons of time and work to finish, and I try my best to keep them original. I'm also pretty proud of my knowledge of the game mechanics.    

**Do you think the new Zombies are annoying? Why/Why not?:** I don't think they are. They're challenging early on but don't bother you later, mainly because you can get rid of them with a swing or two of your sword.   

**What will you bring to Donkey Kraft that no one else can?:** I'm a fairly funny guy, and I'm happy to help out whenever I can. I'm active and friendly and all that, and I can guarantee I won't leave as long as the server stays vanilla.  

**How often do you play?:** I'm on the computer pretty much every day, so it is entirely possible you'll see me online daily (unless my computer breaks down or there's a class trip).  

**Do you agree to the rules as currently posted?:** Yes.  

**Do you agree to NOT SHARE the IP of Donkey Kraft server?:** Yep.  

**Do you understand that snapshots we will use (and are currently playing on) are experimental and may cause issues with gameplay?:** Yes.  

**Do you have access to a Skype account?:** I do, I'll have it on whenever I'm in the game.  

**Are you interested in playing mini-games or custom maps on occasion?:** I'm all for that.  

**Is there anything else you would like to mention?:** Ignore any mistakes concerning commas, Czech is really crazy with them. If there aren't any mistakes, ignore the part about ignoring them. Oh, also, I have loads of experience with multiplayer servers - I started on a small server called Goldminer, moderated the server for a while and I was even named one of the admins for a period of time before the server owner decided to pack it full of plugins. I built their world hub before leaving, and they are still using that as far as I know.  
My second server was called Purecraft, again an almost-vanilla server, I eventually started moderating that as well. Same as the first, they added more plugins, but I stayed all the way until a dispute with the owner who decided to kick me for finding a way to open doors in his plugin-protected area, and then ban me after I complained.  
Third server was Lunation/Solarite, the same one Kamaran came from. No moderating there, but it didn't really need it as it was a whitelisted server. It was fun while it lasted, but inactivity killed it - that's also why I took a break, I was going through the servers, trying to pick one that isn't going to get filled with plugins or die of inactivity. A fresh start is fun, but you get sick of it eventually.

Using the Khorne dogs to scout and distract the most dangerous ranged enemies is a very important part.  You can use their speed and scout to do this very effectively.  While you tie up your opponents most dangerous units, you can safely get your other units into the battle, and even get them to charge the enemy first, which is the most important part for a Khorne army.  Once you have your army in your opponents face, it's all over from there.  I've seen Khorne dogs mess up grey knights and cause a lot of chaos in general, they are very much worth it.  While I DO NOT recommend spending $50 for 5 old gross looking GW Khorne dogs, this site has much better looking ones for a much better price http://puppetswar.eu/product.php?id_product=260.

Though without oil reserves, the moribund United Kingdom economy may struggle to support itself. The English leadership may not be ready to relinquish its grip on the Scottish homelands just yet.

A hundred years of continuous rule is bloody long for any country, and the success of Scottish and Welsh integration into what was in effect an extended English polity is remarkable, with the failures of Irish integration based in large part on racism and religious strife, neither of which Africa is short of. Indeed comparisons between the Scottish Independence movement and any comparable movement in Africa underline the stability of our region – no violence, no legal tomfoolery as we see in Spain in Catalonia, and no government suppression of debate. The British state has long been ahead of its time when it comes to stable reform, whatever its iniquities. ",1391277028,23,23,0,unitedkingdom

I guess all we can do is look at the facts:

The summer transfer window was a disgrace. 

The winter transfer window was better, but we still only managed to sign one player, who was completely rejected by a rival. 

The only achievement Moyes has managed this season, is to allow opposition to break many long standing records against us. 

We've lost 8 league games and still have 14 games to go.

We're effectively out of title chase, out of all other competitions bar the Champions League, but it's not expected at all that we'll progress much further.

4th place and European football is currently looking beyond us. 

It's a world cup year and competition for top players this summer will be high, along with the transfer fees.

The football we've played this season has been awful at best, and there are no signs of improvement. 

Now, if you could give me some good points I'm sure me and other fans here would greatly appreciate something to look forward to because right now things are looking good very grim for the future.

The dispute wasn't over ""a few hundred square miles"", either. While the battle that began the war occurred in the disputed [Nueces Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueces_Strip), more fundamentally Mexico refused to admit that Texas was no longer its territory despite losing the Texan War of Independence and Santa Anna signing a treaty acknowledging this. Mexico didn't give up; an 1842 invasion failed at [Salado Creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salado_Creek_\(1842\)). When the US agreed to annex Texas Mexico objected again, leading to the attack on American troops in the Nueces Strip.

As for the results ... that's how wars work. The US could easily have kept all of Mexico (Mexico City itself was occupied); Mexicans should be grateful that they were left with as much territory as they were, especially since they lost only 1% of their population.

 The U.S.A seems pretty unique in using this kind of comment primarily for their soldiers, and it seems systematic of a deeper level of aggression routed in culture. 

You see it in the way the police go about their everyday job, with their hand close to their gun and their aggressive stance for a simple traffic stop. You see it in the U.S A. movie industry, that glorifies aggression and violence to a far greater extent than the European or Antipodean movie industries. How many times have you had 'that scene' in a USA movie, where the male character smashes up things, or rooms, or people because he is angry or frustrated?

 You could argue that this aggression extends to the 'small government' obsession that the USA seems to have, and the brutal sense of self reliance and self responsibly that is prepared to watch the poor or less capable die of curable illnesses. It's like there is no sense of a common society that pulls together and looks after each other, like you get in other western developed countries.

Saying the NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are to do with counter terrorism is an obvious and blatant complete pack of lies

The NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are extremely ineffective at stopping terrorist plots - see Boston.

They are VERY effective at building a surveillance dossier on EVERY American to suppress any future political dissent - see Stasi.


The terrorists and Islamic Extremists have known for many years that the US is monitoring and collecting all phone traffic.

In places like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen the Islamists have switched to using walkie-talkies - NOT mobile phones.

If for any reason they do have to make a phone call about operations, like Bin Laden they will use a courier to make the call at least 100 miles away from their base of operations and be careful to avoid the code words that might alert the NSA.
Lists of code words the NSA monitors for, are widely available on the net.

Similarly the Islamic Extremists in America or Europe use anonymous Pay as You Go phones and change them every 2 or 3 months, to avoid detection and any history being collected by the NSA.

All of the Islamists know that all regular internet communications are being monitored - so they don't use them if they don't want the NSA to find out.
They use specialist sites that are not indexed by Google etc.

ALL of the data collection and phone monitoring performed by the NSA is totally ineffective against terrorists and Islamic Extremists. They already knew about the Mass Surveillance programs - at least from 2005/2006. See 1

The only thing the NSA Mass Surveillance programs are effective for is to build a surveillance dossier on all LAW ABIDING citizens.
The NSA are collecting as much data on everyone as possible.
The purpose of which is for future blackmail and intimidation on political dissidents or people the government wants to control. See 2


The NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are an existential threat to democracy in America.
See 3

Together with the other abuses of civil rights all the infrastructure is now in place for an authoritarian Fascist Police State in America.
Whether you think this President or some future President will abuse these powers is immaterial.
See 4.

All law abiding citizens are also being monitored in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well - so it's a threat to democracy in those countries too.
These five countries all share the spy data collected with each other, to get around any privacy rules on spying on their own citizens.
The program is called Five Eyes. See 5

Germany and France are also spying on their own law abiding citizens, but to a lesser extent.

N.B. Organized criminals also know about all the Mass Surveillance programs too and will take steps to avoid them, so the authorities are not going to pick up anything useful on them either, by using dragnet surveillance programs.


John Roberts is the unaccountable chief justice of the surveillance state.
He appoints all of the FISA judges with no oversight from Congress - see 6

Everything You Wanted to Know about NSA Spying … But Were Afraid to Ask 

Spying: The Big Picture

If you’ve been too busy to keep up with the spying scandal, here’s an overview:
The government is spying on virtually everything we do
The government’s mass spying doesn’t keep us safe
NSA spying did not prevent a terror attack on Wall Street
There is no meaningful oversight of the spying programs by either Congress or the courts
We can keep everyone safe without violating the Constitution … more cheaply and efficiently than the current system
The top counter-terrorism Czar under Clinton and Bush says that revealing NSA spying programs does not harm national security
Whistleblowers on illegal spying have no “legal” way to get the information out
A high-level intelligence source says “we hack everyone everywhere”
Some people make a lot of money off of mass spying
Spying started before 9/11 … and may have stemmed from an emergency program only meant to be activated in the case of a nuclear war
Governments and big corporations are doing everything they can to destroy anonymity
Mass spying creates an easy mark for hackers
Polls show that the public doesn’t believe the NSA
Surveillance can be used to frame you if someone in government happens to take a dislike to you
An NSA whistleblower says that the NSA is spying on – and blackmailing – top government officials and military officers (and see this)

Appendices

1. U.S. Surveillance Is NOT Aimed at Terrorists | Bloomberg 
The debate over the U.S. government’s monitoring of digital communications suggests that Americans are willing to allow it as long as it is genuinely targeted at terrorists. What they fail to realize is that the surveillance systems are best suited for gathering information on law-abiding citizens. (emphasis mine)

People concerned with online privacy tend to calm down when told that the government can record their calls or read their e-mail only under special circumstances and with proper court orders. The assumption is that they have nothing to worry about unless they are terrorists or correspond with the wrong people.

The infrastructure set up by the National Security Agency, however, may only be good for gathering information on the stupidest, lowest-ranking of terrorists. The Prism surveillance program focuses on access to the servers of America’s largest Internet companies, which support such popular services as Skype, Gmail and iCloud. These are not the services that truly dangerous elements typically use.

......

In a January 2012 report titled “Jihadism on the Web: A Breeding Ground for Jihad in the Modern Age,” the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service drew a convincing picture of an Islamist Web underground centered around “core forums.” These websites are part of the Deep Web, or Undernet, the multitude of online resources not indexed by commonly used search engines.

2. The dirty little secret about NSA Mass Surveillance - it's not about counter terror 

Edward Snowden presents hard evidence of the extent and scope of the NSA's Mass Surveillance.
It is reported in the Guardian on June 6th.
Little that is new is revealed by Snowden in this and subsequent articles, except that the NSA's mass internet data collection program is called Prism.
Every potential terrorist and just about every foreign government knew that the NSA was spying on EVERY American and millions more around the world.
Lots of other people knew too.

Glenn Greenwald's first and subsequent articles report that the NSA is indiscriminately collecting phone call data and massive amounts of internet activity on EVERY American.

The only thing that is new is that the world (and Congress) sits up and takes notice.
The scandal causes major embarrassment to members of the US government.

Predictably the US government and the US media try to attack the messenger not the message.
They fail and the scandal grows as more and more people sit up and take notice.

Previous NSA whistle blowers, William Binney, Thomas Drake and J Kirk Wiebe are completely vindicated. They confirm what Snowden is saying.

James Clapper and Dianne Feinstein are caught lying big time.
Clapper's perjury under oath to Congress carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in jail.
See 7.

The NSA Director, General Keith Alexander, is caught lying under oath to Congress 14 times by Hank Johnson.
Each count of perjury carries a maximum sentence of 5 years - 70 years in total. See 8

James Bamford's previous article on the NSA's massive data center, just completed in Utah, is used by Hank Johnson as evidence.

The reason the Utah data center is so massive and has the capacity to store the entire contents of the internet thousands of times over is obvious.
It is required to store massive amounts of surveillance data on EVERY American and millions more around the world.

Interesting. Firm ties with the French/European military industrial complex. Experience with explosives and nanotechnology. It's reasonable to assume Ms. Pileni is familiar with nano-explosives. So Ms. Pileni's contention that ""the topic lies outside my field of expertise"" is false. Why would a nanotechnology expert and former consultant for the SNPE not want to comment on a paper discussing nano-thermitic explosives? A paper which caused her to resign? Puzzling.

(Credit goes to DHS for first bringing this resignation to my attention in a comment on 911blogger. It's being discussed at Randi** as well.)

Update:
The phrase ""powders and explosives"" and ""powdered explosives"" I used previously may have caused some confusion. I decided to investigate further. What I found with some simple googling was disconcerting to say the least. Let's clear up the confusion first. The French word ""la poudre"" may mean several things. Normally, it means ""powder"". However, it can also mean ""gunpowder"", or something along the lines of ""solid propellant"". I invite French readers of 911blogger to comment further, since my French isn't stellar. The SNPE appears to be a French corporation manufacturing propellants and explosives. This can involve, for example, the charges that set off to open and deploy air bags in a car accident. They were preceded by the ""Service des poudres de l'Armée"", which I would translate as ""Army Gunpowder Service"". Without going into the history of France' gunpowder supply too much, this should put it into context for you what is probably meant by ""Poudres et Explosifs"". Again, I invite French 911bloggers to elaborate.

I visited SNPE's website, and eventually found the English version. There, under the banner ""Energetic Materials"", I found the following explanation: ""SNPE Matériaux Energétique manufactures propellant charges and energetic equipment, primarily for the defense and automotive industries, and also makes propellants and explosives for military applications""

Wow. Ok, well that leaves little room for interpretation. Clicking leads me to some other sites, explaining further the activities of the ""Powders and Explosives"" division:

http://www.materiaux-energetiques.com/fr/activites-poudresExplosifs.shtml

This site's in French. The first paragraph reads:
""The only European company offering the full range of energy products for the civil and defense, EURENCO has strengthened its production capacity in Europe to better meet market needs. Increasingly involved in new programs, EURENCO has reorganized into two units, one for powder and another for explosives, to improve its flexibility and responsiveness and focus on its customers and programs""

The ""Powders"" division seems to be more involved with ammunition, while the ""Explosives"" division seems to be preoccupied with developing ""insensitive munitions"". That rings a bell. Insensitive munitions probably refer mostly to stability, in the sense that it's much safer to have munitions that are less prone to become instable due to e.g. heat, shock, damage or general degradation. I can't help but think about Jim Hoffman's FAQ entry: How could charges have been pre-positioned in the Towers in such a way that the plane crashes and fires wouldn't have set them off? (I want to strongly emphasize I'm not implying any sort of connection between the two; I merely find mentioning Hoffman's theoretical scenario relevant to the subject at hand.)

I proceed to visit the site of EURENCO. Interesting. EURENCO is apparently involved in such joyous things as high explosives, explosives for oil and gas, cast PBX charges, and, get this: explosives for demolition purposes.

But...it gets better. Would you believe it if I told you EURENCO likes to toy around with new energetic molecules as well?

Then..it got a little strange. I stumbled upon the Dutch International Institute for Social History, which brought something back to light which I have long since forgotten:

""Documents regarding the explosion of the AZF factory at the chemical site of the Sociéteé Nationale de Poudre et d'Explosifs (SNPE) in Toulouse 21 September 2001 and the events afterwards 2001-2002.""

Wikipedia documents it here, and I find the last paragraph especially interesting:

""On October 4, 2001, France's then Environment Minister Yves Cochet announced that the explosion ""may have been a terrorist attack"" and identified Hassan Jandoubi, a plant sub-contractor killed in the blast, as a person under investigation. French anti terrorist authorities were prohibited by the Toulouse prosecutor from searching Jandoubi's house for five days after the incident. Police declared that Jandoubi had ""possible Islamic fundamentalist sympathies"", yet by the time the search was finally conducted, Jandoubi's girlfriend had disposed of all traces of his clothes or photos. French authorities described the delay as damaging to the investigation.""

Contrary to Ms. Pileni's remarkably insincere comments, the nano-thermite paper fits exactly in her area of expertise. I have this strange feeling I might have opened Pandora's box, and I encourage contributors to 911blogger to follow up on this interesting story.""


&gt;What do you mean that resigning over the matter doesn't make sense? (please at least answer this one)

It doesn't. Why would she resign? By the way, the paper is still published in the journal. Explain how it does make sense.


&gt;Are you just completely ignoring the whole standards of reviewing predicament we're in here? A biased associate CANNOT review a paper and that be valid. Not even my assertion, common (and only) practice. With a bunch of people whose reputation within the truth community depended on thermite being found, I'll take my chances with outside sources.

Peer reviewed **and** published. Unlike any refutations you can come up with.


&gt;Why didn't they go to a reputable journal for publication?

They did. Unless you're trying to say, ""Why did they go to Bentham?"" In which case: 

""a. Ability to publish color photographs and graphs, at no extra page charge

 b. Allow at least 25 published pages, in order to accommodate the large amount of data we had obtained

 c. Be available ON-LINE at NO Expense to readers throughout the world

 d. Subject the paper to peer-review

 e. Be an established refereed journal""

&gt;The centers will be opened in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, allowing third parties to confirm there are no back doors in Microsoft’s software source code.

And they did this because those governments buy a lot of Microsoft's products, so the business is important to them. I think they'd have a lot more to lose if it came out they were facilitating the NSA in spying on international governments. MS exists to make money and they'd lose a lot if they put backdoors in Windows.

It'd also be possible to Wireshark a Windows install and see what data is going to and from it, look at what the processes on the system is doing, and reverse engineer the code.

Technically, euphoria is an [affect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology\)), but the term is often colloquially used to define emotion and an intense state of [transcendent](http://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transcendent) happiness combined with an overwhelming sense of [contentment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contentment). It has also been defined as an ""affective state of exaggerated well-being or elation."" The word derives from [Greek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) εὐφορία, ""power of enduring easily, fertility"".

I was writing a reply last night that explained all the flaws in particular relation to Easter island and my computer crashed, but these ""studies"" are all being done by unqualified people who clearly have no idea about geology or history. I'm on my phone so I can't get to far in depth but two assumptions that stood out as particularly biased from that video where that, because you can't date rock there is no way to date the statues in Easter island, which is partially true in that you can't date rock. But you can (and people have) tested the coral that was used in the eyes, as well as animal bones, plant remains and charcoal in the soils nearby, which allows us to know where and when the first settlers landed and how they spread throughout the island.  The second was that they said the most commonly accepted idea about how they moved the statues was by using log roads, which the video says has never been proven possible, even though that method has been proven possible, as has the much more likely method of using canoe ladders, as every other Polynesian society throughout history and into modern times has done to move their statues.  The dates on all these things are just so wildly off and there is much ignorance of the facts and speculation in that video, it was really rather bad and unacademic.

EDIT: this is a quote from the article you just sent me "" Evidence clearly shows that the pyramids were built as ancient energy machines aligned with the earth’s energy grid, providing energy for healing as well as power.""  that is not scientific language, how can there be clear evidence for it being an ""energy machine""? What does that even mean?  And if you look at every other writing on the pyramid, including the official website, it says the pyrmid is most likely 12,000 years old (which would throw some wrinkles into common ideas of early European history, but nothing too crazy) and that there has literally been ONE single piece of organic material from the site, a leaf, that has been tested to be 28,000 years old (+/- 200 years).  And trust me, archeologists and Historians would love for this thing to be 26,000 years old, it would make them so much money in grants and research and they love nothing more than having to unfold some new mystery, but the facts just are not there to support that speculation

It depends on whether you are part of the rich elite -in Kuwait the Kuwaiti themselves often have a lot of money thanks to the oil present, but they depend on European, American and some Asian companies to pump it out of the ground-, European workers, poor migrants from other Arab countries as well as South Asia and the Philipines. Those who can afford proper healthcare receive state of the art treatments often not even practiced in the west, those who cannot however, often do not receive any healthcare at all. This of course are things that differ greatly per country due to policy decisions and the sorts. It is often expected that women quit their jobs when they have children and almost all do, so that sort of enables the existence of this law. There will certainly be groups of women who are negatively affected by it, I'm quite sure of that, but this is not so much the case for most of the autochthonous population and skilled workers -engineers, doctors and the like- from the west.

&gt;**Einsatzgruppen** (German for ""task forces"", ""deployment groups""; singular Einsatzgruppe; official full name **Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD**) were Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary [death squads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_squad) of [Nazi Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) that were responsible for mass killings, primarily by shooting, during World War II. The Einsatzgruppen had a leading role in the implementation of the [Final Solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution) of the [Jewish question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_question) (Die Endlösung der Judenfrage) in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the Polish [intelligentsia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligentsia) and swiftly progressing to Soviet [political commissars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_commissar), [Jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew), and [Gypsies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) throughout Eastern Europe.

 [**Maidenhead Locator System**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead%20Locator%20System): 

---

&gt;

&gt;The **Maidenhead Locator System** is a [geographic co-ordinate system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) used by [amateur radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) operators. Dr. John Morris, [G4ANB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio#Call_signs), originally devised the system, and a group of [VHF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF) managers, meeting in [Maidenhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead), England in 1980, adopted it. The Maidenhead Locator System replaces the older [QRA locator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRA_locator) system with one that is usable outside Europe.

&gt;Maidenhead locators are also commonly referred to as QTH Locator, grid locators or grid squares, despite having a non-square shape on any non-[equirectangular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection) [cartographic projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographic_projection). Use of the terms QTH locator and QRA locator was initially discouraged, as it caused confusion with the older QRA locator system. The only abbreviation recommended to indicate a Maidenhead reference in Morse code and radio teleprinter transmission was ""LOC"", as in ""LOC KN28LH"".

&gt; Bra minne. Du påstod att majoriteten av den svenska befolkningen var emot vapenexport när jag försökte få dig att FATTA att Sverige har en fot i omvärldens krig (WTF, liksom?).

Var inte dum nu. Det är enkilda aktörer som går med vinst av exporten och befolkningen tycker att det är fulspel. Sveriges regering har varit med och gett tillstånd, men det betyder inte att de själva gör vapenexporten.

&gt; Sverige är även inblandat i krigen genom att man stöttar USA och EU:s operationer.

Sverige skapar inte krigen utan det är USA. Vårat mål är att få fram freden. Varför skylla **just** på Sverige när det är halva jordklotet som stödjer USA med detta? Dessutom är det inte USA eller EU som skapar krig som Israel mot palestina, syriens inbördeskrig eller Iraq mot Iran, inbördeskrig i sydsudan etc.

&gt; Hur djävla svårt kan det vara att förstå att Sverige och resten av världen som har sugit u-världen på resurser är ansvariga och således är tvungna att ta emot folk?

One of my friends, who is a teacher, said this is how it's supposed to work here, but it doesn't. I got most of this information from a documentary, but heck if I can remember the name.

Schools are not assigned to students by geography. Every student has a specific amount of tax dollars that is allotted with them. If, for whatever reason, a parent no longer wants their child to attend one school, they can enroll them in another school (if the school has space). The idea is that bad schools will remove their children (and the funding) to put into a better school.

Schools then have an incentive to:
1) Keep good teachers! Good teachers = educated students = happy parents
2) Run the school well. Bad management will kill any business, even if you have the best talent.
3) Provide other services that appeal to parents (sports, art, music, daycare)
4) Keep costs low without sacrificing quality

Obviously, this doesn't really solve the issue of poor performing inner cities since the culture doesn't emphasize education enough and parents either can't (due to work conflicts) or don't put much emphasis on their child's education. in that case, I think we'd still see the same problem of volume &gt; quality.",1391283504,1,1,0,news

I support Israel for as long as they hold the land without undue violence (interpret how you will). But I support the people; I don't support the Torah’s claims to the land. I don't support barriers between people when they do not serve the greater good and if there is a claim that says these people should have sole benefit from these resources I will need to hear some powerful arguments as to why, which I think Jewish people can make in regards to Israel, but even then I may not agree. I just think you don’t want to go too far with the claims where now you have made claims that you can’t possibly prove are correct.

Obviously I Know that not every, and probably not even all that many, people in Israel think I'm just a simple goyim wandering my way through life with no direction. I work at a company with a large part in Israel and most of my Israeli co-workers treat me fantastically. I will more likely get an Asian looking at me sideways rather than an Israeli when I say I am studying computer science. 

Based on the link of this thread everyone can see that Jews do have to ever remain vigilant because there are really unfortunately stupid people out here, people who are calling for genocide because they are not getting their way. If Zionism is securing Israel for the safety of Jews than I would say I can get behind that. But if Zionism is saying, It’s for the Jews only and if want to participate I need to take a secondary role than I can’t support that Zionism.  Honestly, if there was a non-theological conversion to Judaism I think I would really consider it. If there was a Jewish political party where registering made me Jewish, I would probably be Jewish. Is there anything like that?

Edit: If for example Liberia had been a successful settlement and if was there I would have argued that that land was for freedom and saftey, not just the freedom and safety of ex-slaves but of anyone with those principals at heart. Of course the history of its foundation on the part of ex-slaves would not be diminished, that would be a fact no matter what like Israel' s foundation by Jews and america's by Europeans. I think the greatness would be even greater. If only it wasn't a failed settlement due to ..... I don't know why, I wasn't there.

**TSM over XDG:** Not much to say here really. XDG has looked weak and still has the problem with throwing. I think by the end of the split, XDG will be top 4/5 material but they aren't quite there yet and they're going against arguably the best team in NA.

**C9 over Coast:** Much like TSM VS XDG, we have a game pitting a team struggling to get their play in order VS a top of the table team. I still think Coast is a good team but they have to prove they can perform against the big dogs, until then I'll take C9 over Coast any day.

**Curse over CLG:** I don't even know who's playing for CLG, seems to be Chauster. Although I think Chauster is a considerably upgrade over HSGG, I don't think they'll have the synergy or coordination to beat Curse. Of course, Curse in all of their losses have been their own worst enemy with constant indecision and inaction, so this game will be up to them to win or lose.

**C9 over EG:** Again, another mismatch. EG had some luck with a slightly cheesey comp and they've been able to make their unique picks work. I just think C9's fundamentals are too strong to fall to EG.",1391283740,2,2,0,leagueoflegends

&gt;Anyway the tit is every percived insult and nasty thing leveled against Bush and that has resulted in it being thrown back at Obama I cant explain it any clearer to you.

...and I've tried explaining to you how Bush wasn't hated until he had done more than enough to deserve it...and we're barely halfway through the Obama administration with no ""disasters"" that aren't directly associated to the Bush admin (Drones &amp; NSA spying) --- 

&gt; For that matter every ""disaster"" that happened in Bush's presidency has very complicit democrats in the house of represanatives tied to it.

...it doesn't matter, it still happened under Bush. I've followed the Obama administration extremely close from day 1 &amp; the GOP has caused the majority of the ""disasters"" Obama has been blamed for --- We're not playing the blame game, were talking about the fact that the right-wing acts like Obama is a Nazi King for talking about Executive Orders...when Obama has issued less Executive Orders than any president in the last 120 years. If President A comes to my front door &amp; takes a shit, it's not ""tit for tat"" if I scream at President B like he's shitting on my front door when he came to my front door to deliver mail


People hate Bush for a number of reasons. Mainly starting 2 wars &amp; tanking the economy...but people didn't have blind outrage towards Bush when he first started --- People have had blind outrage at Obama since before he was even president (racism)...and that outrage has continued even though the Obama admin's policies have ended the Iraq war &amp; are currently ending the Afghan war...along with reducing the deficit at a historic pace. --- The #1 GOP complaint about Obama is the deficit &amp; out-of-control spending...when the Obama admin has slashed gov spending &amp; literally cut the deficit in half within 4 years of taking office

&gt;The movie was made nonetheless and it won awards and there are plenty of American leftists who enjoyed every moment of it if you dont think that contributes to todays climate you may want to look over your own bias's

The film. won. no. awards. 

You have the internet at your finger tips to learn this for yourself. It won no American awards at all. It won no international film awards. It won no major European film awards. The only reason anybody heard about this movie to begin with is because of the outrage from conservatives around it...Nobody. I repeat: Nobody who watched this movie ""loved it""...it's easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it was still completely forgettable even with all the controversy around it

&gt;

&gt;**Belgium** (^i/ˈbɛldʒəm/; [Dutch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language): België; [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): Belgique; [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): Belgien), officially the **Kingdom of Belgium**, is a [federal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation) [monarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy) in [Western Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe). It is a founding member of the [European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) and hosts the EU's headquarters as well as those of several other major international organisations such as [NATO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO). Belgium covers an area of 30,528 square kilometres (11,787 sq mi), and it has a population of about 11 million people.

&gt;Straddling the cultural boundary between [Germanic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic-speaking_Europe) and [Latin Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Europe), Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups, the [Dutch-speakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language) (about 59%), mostly [Flemish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_people), and the [French-speakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francophone) (about 41%), mostly [Walloons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walloons), in addition to a small group of [German-speakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-speaking_Community_of_Belgium). Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of [Flanders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Region) in the north and the French-speaking southern region of [Wallonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia). The [Brussels-Capital Region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels-Capital_Region), officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking [enclave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_enclaves_and_exclaves#Subnational_enclaves_which_are_not_exclaves) within the Flemish Region. A [German-speaking Community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-speaking_Community_of_Belgium) exists in eastern Wallonia. Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in the [political history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Belgium) and a complex [system of government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities_and_regions_of_Belgium).

&gt;Historically, Belgium, the [Netherlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) and [Luxembourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg) were known as the [Low Countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries), which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current [Benelux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelux) group of states. The region was called Belgica in Latin because of the [Roman province](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province) [Gallia Belgica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Belgica) which covered more or less the same area. From the end of the [Middle Ages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages) until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the [Belgian Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Revolution) in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the [Netherlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands), many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, causing it to be dubbed the ""Battlefield of Europe,"" a reputation strengthened by both World Wars.

However, another article, grabbed from the Telegraph states that only 20% of students in the UK are ESL http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10152869/More-pupils-speaking-English-as-a-second-language.html

20% is higher than the US national average which is just 10% (though by state it ranges from 2-30% without any clear effect on performance or economics), but it's still much lower than pretty much every other nation in Europe. It's also important to point out that The Telegraph doesn't make any distinction between students are fluent in English and those who are not.

The problem is that it's incrementally become an agenda-flogging exercise run by the condscending elites in education.  It simply is not longer really about history in context.

One example was the recent worldwide mooing over Mandela after his death.  There's no question he did a good thing in standing up to the oppression in SA.  But there has been
almost radio silence about his hamfisted mismanagment of the nation once he and his
follower were in charge - rampant crime, increasing poverty, and so on all get a pass

Spot on.  But again, some cultures get a pass *because* of color.  European Christian culture
- over time - gave us freedom, technology, and wealth.  Most of African culture is dominated by tribal violence and poverty.  Ditto Arab/Persian Islamic culture.  Asian culture is built on implict and even forced societal conformity, at least in most cases.  But you dare not say these true things in the modern academy because the oh-so-sensitive tolerance police will have a fit.

Personally, I favor historians that tell the truth - or as much of it as we know - *in context*  -
and leave the agenda peddling to the politicians.  This means that no one should ever be subjected to the moronic scribblings of Comrade Howard Zinn.

3. The acquis - there's a LARGE body of law and regulations (mostly economic) that's common to the entire EU, including uniform language for marketing products, consumer protections, and environmental regulations, all of which is common to the whole EU and in which every EU country has a vote.

4. EU budget.

Yes I've always felt that discriminating/lableing and rejecting those who think differently than oneself isn't really a good way of creating mutual understanding and respect.

Well I guess the ""black agenda"" is quite a different thing depending on where in the world one lives. I live in Europe, which means that black people have the same issues as most immigrants and therefore it's seen as a rasism and descrimination, rather than ""slavery this and that"". Even though Europe did indeed have slaves, they were of all colors since the slaves were taken from other contries/villages.

The expression ""the majority"" is a very interesting one when one speaks of history, since America today is considered a large contry, but just a few centuries ago it was not ""large"" in the sense of population or power. Anywho, here's a link on the history of homosexuality if it would interest you to know how it's been thru the ages ;) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_homosexuality

On a personal level I can say that I'm a bisexual female in a hetrosexual relationship. So I've felt both love and hate from both sides, since some hetro friends disliked when I dated girls and some homo/bi friends snarled when I announced my hetrosexual relationship. 

All I can say is that it's never as simple as black and white and there will always be idiots on both sides of any issue. The key is to not let them scare you. I know that when each side gave me bad remarks about my sexual preferences, they were actually expressing their own fears. I've never understood the fears that hetrosexuals express since there are so many of you, but I do understand the supressed axiety that many of my homo/bi friends have. It's difficult to find a partner when so many are ""hiding/shy"" and there's always the risk of it being ""a phase"". And yet I'm living in a very homo-friendly contry! It's a scary world to live in so I don't blame them for being a bit edgy about it to be honest. 
Further more I'd say the media is pushing it because they want to reach those who do harm. Because it is an issue of discrimination, similar to rasism and religious discrimination. And by this point in history we should be civilized enough to step away from such childish games and let people be who they want to be as long as they don't harm others.

The people you've met that call you bad names due to your religious views have probably been called names because of their view on sexuality: What goes around comes around. And at the end of the day, it's all about being the bigger man and not taking it personally. ",1391288582,2,2,0,JusticePorn

I didn't look into that at that time, but I never took anything I head about him as a fact, only as a possibility. Once I began to read more about him and read his speeches, I was struck by the fact that I agreed with most of what he said, just a quick search brings up a translation of one of his speeches, I can point to random part of it, and it always seems to be something undeniably true, for instance,

""These are only some of the grounds for the antagonisms which separate us from communism. I confess: these antagonisms cannot be bridged. Here are really two worlds which do but grow further apart from each other and can never unite. When in an English newspaper a Parliamentarian complains that we wish to divide Europe into two parts, then unfortunately we are bound to inform this Robinson Crusoe living on his happy British island that - however unwelcome it may be - this division is already an accomplished fact.... That one should refuse to see a thing does not mean that it is not there. For many a year in Germany I have been laughed to scorn as a prophet; for many a year my warnings and my prophecies were regarded as the illusions of a mind diseased....""

Other speeches, such as his speeches to German youth are truly inspirational. You may say that I'm still an idiot for looking up to Hitler since he has allegedly done all those terrible things. If you read more (or simply reexamine what you already know), you'll realize that the Allies weren't any better, their Soviet allies far worse than 10 Hitlers. Furthermore,  Once you find out about economics of that time, you will realize that Germany was practically forced to go to war and that Hitler tried to end the war as soon as possible, and the Allies are the ones who intensified the conflict.

Although obviously one-sided, this speech is a good introduction to the other side of the story, http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v08/v08p389_Hitler.html",1391288689,-11,-11,0,todayilearned
