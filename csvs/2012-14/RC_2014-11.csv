I can also, as Steven Segal did, show obvious support for Putin and Russia. I can say obscenities, I can produce independent movies about our own country's war crimes.

That's because to those in power, gay marriage matters not. The locals can fight over it while those in power stay in power. However, you're really exaggerating gay rights in the US. There's still many **states** where you can get fired for being gay. And queer bashings still happen. And, just a fun fact, a higher percent of black men are in prison right now in the U.S. then during South African apartheid.

&gt;systematic oppression of free speech, manipulation of public opinion, intentional data distortion that happens every day in Russia. Why, as an academic, would I want to be a coerced empty voice? 

The media system is run by a group of 5 or 6 oligarchic companies. It's not state run like in Russia, but it's still pretty bad, IMO. Yes, you can make your own shitty blog, no you won't change the public opinion with it.

&gt;There is a reason Russia's population has been sinking like the Titanic and their male life expectancy is pitiable. That isn't the West's fault!

Never said it is.

&gt;Bear in mind also that Russian exploitation of Belarus and Ukraine led starving citizens to cannibalism and killed millions (~1933).

If I can bring up atrocities that the U.S. did back then... There's just so many. I'm going to ignore that and lead to the assumption that both governments have changed, and the cold war made both do some shady shit.

&gt;They killed many more within their own borders. Again, can America be blamed for the parts they have inflicted on themselves?

Again, past. However, how many Natives has the U.S. killed? And put into reservations and then taken their resources after finding them in the tribal lands? This is all recent stuff.

&gt;If Russia has tried to do what the US did during the Iraq War with misleading information, they have achieved only a piecemeal farce. 

Maybe outside of Russia, yes. But inside? They are doing fine.

&gt;The achilles heal of their previously-growing economy is exposed to the world. 

Gas? It was not exposed, it was well known. And They are getting more and more connected to China. 

&gt;Also, don't forget how many of the internationally rich are indeed Russians themselves.

There's a few. However, the majority of them are bankers, politicians, and businessmen. And almost all are from the U.S. and Western Europe.

Want actual examples of what the U.S. does?

Or go look up the Banana wars, Pinochet, Depleted Uranium in Iraq, the deals that the IMF and World Bank give nations that give it money in exchange for austerity measures that take away money from the people in governments. It doesn't matter to they whether or not gays can get married. 

I'm not exactly pro-Russia. I'm Anti-U.S. And there is a long history of the U.S. forcing revolutions in regions it deems unfriendly, which is where Maiden started. And before you say I'm wrong, seriously, look up Pinochet. Look up the Bay of Pigs. Or here, just look through this list.

Los de derechas van a misa y son buenos.

Si es que complicais las cosas.

Pero en los últimos 100 años ha aparecido nuevas formas de entenderlo:

- Centro: O sea Derecha.
- Ni de Derechas ni de Izquierdas: O sea Derecha
- Social-liberal: O sea Derecha.

Alguno pensará que soy un radical extremista dogmático de izquierdas (o sea con rabo y cuernos), pero ni por todo el oro del mundo (eso que aprecia la Derecha) estoy dispuesto a renunciar a identificarme con las luchas del pueblo (o sea la izquierda). Desde Espartaco a las luchas obreras del siglo XX, llegando hasta las mareas del presente, yo tengo claro donde está la izquierda.

Porque al final, el viaje al centro de la izquierda nos lleva a justificar que la distribución injusta de los recursos es admisible. O que la desigualdad de oportunidades ante la vida es admisible. O que el enriquecimiento de Felipe González está justificado. No estás de acuerdo con que existan privilegios: eres de izquierdas.

Si me usan eso de ""Podemos no es de izquierdas ni de derechas"" para justificar que no participemos en una protesta (ha pasado en mi círculo) pues el que lo dice es de Derechas. Si un señor dice: ""yo llevo el carnet de Podemos en un bolsillo y en el otro el de PxC (xenofobos para quienes no los conozcan), pues es de Derechas.

Otro tema es el mal uso de las etiquetas, y que algún ""desubicado"" piense que por ponerse la etiqueta de izquierdas ya lo es. Gran parte de los miembros del PSOE, pero también de ERC, ICV e incluso algunos de IU, no merecen llevar la etiqueta de izquierda, porque es un insulto a los muchos que han luchado, han padecido el exilio, han sido torturados o ultrajados, por ser de izquierdas. 

Así que pasamos de ortodoxias, de ismos , de definiciones que nos limiten , y en eso estoy de acuerdo. Pero si olvidamos que somos pueblo (o sea izquierda) , que somos la voz de los desfavorecidos, y empezamos a tomar decisiones ambiguas, estamos perdidos.

Segundo, com essa medida, eles estão querendo nosso mercado interno, e o governo não aumenta impostos para importações, mas desonera, dando incentivos para quem produz no pais, para que aqueles que investem no pais tenham maiores lucros.

Devido ao nosso porte, a ao tamanho do nosso mercado, podemos usar isso como incentivo, e são poucos os paises que podem fazê-lo. Portanto querer que a gente não use uma vantagem que temos para atrairmos mais industrias.. para que exportemos mais não vai tornar os produtos mais baratos e vai aniquilar com a produção industrial do país

No caso do algodão dos EUA, incentivos deles nos fizeram perder competitividade internacional, nos fazendo perder totalmente nossa cadeia produtiva de algodão. é muito diferente

No caso do EU, querem que (virtualmente, por consequencia) nós nos desfaçamos das industrias locais, importando mais bens de alto valor agregado, o que alias vai beneficiar muito mais a China do que a Europa.

A ultima frase foi nesse sentido, a idéia de que é o nosso mercado interno, e os incentivos de desoneração que damos a industria local, que estão sendo questionados.

 È muito diferente de um produto Brasileiro e um Europeu estarem competindo no mercado internacional por exemplo, e o Europeu sofrer desvantagem se por exemplo o governo Brasileiro, der subsídios, tirando a competitividade do Europeu.. 
ou qualquer pratica **anti-competitiva**

Se cobrarmos alguma taxa aduaneira a mais por exemplo, é até correto questionar, mas desoneração para a industria local, não vejo em que plataforma isso é possivel, pois todos fazem isso, a diferença é que em paises como o Brasil e os EUA isso funciona

[Civil law countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system) don't use a common law system like America, and ostensibly base all criminal judgments on a code. However, in practice these systems really aren't that much different.

The problem is, it's impossible to create a code sophisticated enough to capture every pertinent detail of every criminal act. So in countries with penal codes, judges still have to interpret the law when faced with novel fact patterns. That's the dirty secret of penal code systems, when judges are faced with a situation that can't be determined by given codes, they generally base their decisions on precedent, analogizing from previous situations to the present. That's the exact same thing we do in common law. The two systems have very different theoretical underpinnings, but in practice they are much more alike than not alike. Also note that while every state still adheres to at least some aspects of common law, every state also uses a penal code, and most of them have adopted major portions of [the Model Penal Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code). This is the closest thing to the comprehensive, formal code that seeks to describe all possible criminal actions. But it's never worked the way you're hoping, there's just no way to perfectly describe all criminal action, unless you describe such actions very vaguely. When you get vagueness in the code, you're back to the same problem you have in common law systems. So most jurisdictions have settled with some combination of both. Basically no system is a pure common law or civil law country.

I would also suggest you might consider the fact that the only cases you are likely to ever hear about, the ones that make people (justifiably) upset, are a very, very small subset of cases where no clear cut answer is possible, and we're left with no option but to let someone make a decision. 
No penal code is going to be able to effectively balance the competing interests that are at stake in criminal trials (accused vs. victim, individual vs. society, presumption of innocence vs. desire for justice, etc.). ",1414801584,0,anon__sequitur,1414801264,t3_2kxdvo,0,clpmxzy,t5_2w2s8

&gt;

&gt;__Lampreys__ (sometimes also called __lamprey eels__) are an [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology\)) of [jawless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnatha) [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish), the adult of which is characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. The common name ""lamprey"" is probably derived from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) *lampetra*, which may mean ""stone licker"" (*[lambere](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lambere#Latin)* ""to lick"" + *[petra](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/petra#Latin)* ""stone""), though the etymology is uncertain. 

&gt;Currently there are about 38 known species of lampreys.  Although they are well known for boring into the flesh of other fish to [suck their blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematophagy), in fact only a minority do so;  only 18 species of lampreys are actually parasitic.  The lampreys are a very ancient lineage of vertebrates, though their exact relationship to [hagfishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagfish) and [jawed vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostomata) is still a matter of dispute.

Credit is the sickness that they spread. Taking countries and our planet into a debt that a multitude of future generations will have to pay for.

&gt;__Pyrrhocoridae__ is a family of [insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect) with more than 300 species world-wide. Many are red-coloured and are known as red bugs and some species are called __cotton stainers__ because their feeding activities leave an indelible yellow-brownish stain on [cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton) crops. A common species in parts of Europe is the [firebug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebug), and its genus name *Pyrrhocoris* and the family name are derived from the Greek roots for fire ""pyrrho-"" and bug ""coris"". Members of this family can be quickly separated from the [Lygaeidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lygaeidae) by the lack of [ocelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelli) (simple eyes).

&gt;

&gt;__Handball__ (also known as __team handball__, __Olympic handball__, __European team handball__, __European handball__, or __Borden ball__ ) is a [team sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport) in which two teams of seven players each (six outfield players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball to throw it into the goal of the other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.

&gt;Modern handball is played on a court 40 by 20 meters (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the center of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; the goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while ""jumping"" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of [field handball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_handball) and [Czech handball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_handball) (which were more common in the past) and [beach handball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_handball) (also called sandball). The game is quite fast and includes body contact, as the defenders try to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. Goals are scored quite frequently; usually both teams score at least 20 goals each, and it is not uncommon for both teams to score more than 30 goals.

&gt;The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern Europe, chiefly in Scandinavia and Germany. The modern set of rules was published in 1917 in Germany, and had several revisions since. The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930. Men's handball was first played at the [1936 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics) in Berlin as outdoors, and the next time at the [1972 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics) in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich) as indoors, and has been an Olympics sport since. Women's team handball was added at the [1976 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics).

---

&gt;

&gt;In the *Jungledyret* films, many animals talk to each other, but humans can't understand them. This is a standard conceit, seen in such films as *[Balto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balto_(film\))*.

&gt;


&gt;* __Hugo__

&gt;Hugo is a young, rare, apparently unique, fictional mammal of the previously unknown species *Hugus Primiticus*. His parents are never mentioned. He looks something like a living [teddy bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_bear) (or a [koala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala)), and has yellow [fur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur). In the second film, he mentions to a pig that he only has a summer coat.

&gt;He has [prehensile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehensile) (grasping) hands, each with three fingers and a thumb. He has large, fuzzy ears, and human-like feet with four toes. He is [bipedal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipedal), though he can run in a [quadrupedal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupedal) manner for speed. He can use tools such as levers and skateboards, and can outwit other animals, such as snakes, cats, and squirrels. He is noted for his cleverness, his kind heart, his love of food, his bragging, his mischievousness, and the occasional bout of childish selfishness. He eats mostly fruits and loves bananas (though he is omnivorous, as he won't shy away from eating meatballs). His most feared living specimen of all, of course, is humanity (except for Meatball Charlie).

&gt;In the original Danish release, Hugo was [voiced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_actor) by [Jesper Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesper_Klein). On the English dub, Hugo was voiced by [Bronson Pinchot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronson_Pinchot), probably best known in the United States for his role as [Balki Bartokomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balki_Bartokomous) on the [sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom) *[Perfect Strangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Strangers_(U.S._TV_series\))*.

&gt;Rita is a young [red fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox) who befriends Hugo on the streets of [Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen). She and Hugo quickly become [best friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_friend_(friendship\)). She's kind, streetwise, spunky, and has a decent amount of common sense—unlike Hugo, who is rather impulsive. She lived with her mother and her two little brothers and one little sister in a den near some railroad tracks, until the second movie, where she escaped alongside Hugo from Cupmann. Her father is never mentioned. A romance between Hugo and Rita is hinted and even implied on the first two films, but the later animated series and third film dimmed down this element to the point where it was only mentioned on a few occasions.

&gt;In the original Danish production, Rita was voiced by Kaya Brüel. On the English dub, Rita was voiced by [Holly Gauthier-Frankel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Gauthier-Frankel).

&gt;


&gt;* __Meatball Charlie__

&gt;Charlie is the cook aboard the [cargo ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship) that transports Hugo to Copenhagen. He finds Hugo, who has escaped the cargo hold, and at the end of the voyage, donates him to the city [zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo). He appears toward the end of the first film, and is not present in the second. Though, in the animated series, he appears once again, helping Hugo and Rita on numerous occasions, and in the third film, he makes several appearances, nearly coming off as part of the main character cast. Hugo mentions that Meatball Charlie is probably his and Rita's only ""human"" friend.

&gt;In the original Danish production, Meatball Charlie is named Dellekaj (a mixture of ""Delle"" which is [slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) for [frikadelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frikadelle), a special kind of Danish meatball and Kaj which is a common Danish name) and was voiced by [Jesper Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesper_Klein) who also voices Hugo. On the English dub, Charlie was voiced by Marcel Jeannin.

&gt;


&gt;* __Conrad Cupmann__

&gt;Conrad is a main antagonist in the first two films (he started out as a secondary antagonist in the first film, but was later promoted to main antagonist in the second film). He owns a movie studio in [Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen), and dreams of making lots of money. He is [morally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality) bankrupt, willing to [slash and burn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_and_burn) the jungle to capture Hugo. His first relationship started off with Izabella Dehavalot, but he rejected her wishes and left her when Hugo manages to escape Copenhagen in the first film. His second relationship is with Barbie Turner, but instead, he is rejected by her, since she did not want him hurting Hugo. On the English dub, Conrad was voiced by [Mark Camacho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Camacho).

&gt;


&gt;* __Generalissimo Maximillion Maximus__

&gt;Generalissimo Maximillion Maximus, or better known as General Maximus, is one of the series most recurrent major antagonists (and an antagonist in the third film). He is the ruler of the recently founded fictional nation ""Junglandia""- the country where Hugo originates from. The symbol of Junglelandia is General Maximus' coat of arms, which depicts the same species as Hugo and, since Hugo is the rarest animal in the world, General Maximus is always seeking Hugo, both to have him as a symbol of the nation and in order to gain a world famous reputation. He has a low moral set, promising a great reward to the ones who gets Hugo, but he will not always keep his promises, either cheating them, or will later break his promises, and displays a ruthless determination in order to capture him.

&gt;


&gt;* __Izabella Dehavalot__

&gt;Izabella is a black-haired starlet with a sharp figure. She is also the wife of Conrad Cupmann and the primary antagonist in the first film. Her goal is to gain notoriety through the exploitation of an animal co-star; she cites several fictional actors, and then her ""good friend [Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson)"" and his [chimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubbles_(chimpanzee\)). Upon the discovery of Hugo, Izabella brightens at the idea of using him as her co-star and stops at nothing to capture him. Conrad divorced her in the time span between the two films, after she becomes obsessed to the point of madness over capturing Hugo. In all European versions, she is called __Izabella Scorpio__. On the English dub Izabella was voiced by [Susan Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Glover).

&gt;


&gt;* __Barbie Turner__ (Miss Sensuella)

&gt;Barbie is a [stereotypical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypical) [dumb blonde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_blonde) and, in the second film, is Cupmann Studio's new starlet. It is also implied that she is Conrad's lover. She often chews [bubble gum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_gum), even on the [sound stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_stage). In the original version of the movie, her name is __Sensuella__. On the English dub, Barbie was voiced by Jennifer Seguin.

&gt;


&gt;* __Doctor Loongkoffer__

&gt;Loongkoffer is an animal psychologist hired by Conrad in Jungledyret 2 to [tame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication) Hugo; unfortunately, he fails in his endeavor to tame Hugo. Making a return in Jungledyret 3, he has turned over a new leaf and wishes to keep Hugo safe. He is disgusted by Professor Strix's idea of cloning Hugo, fearing that Hugo would die in the experiments. His role is reminiscent of [Animaniacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs)' [Dr. Otto Scratchansniff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Otto_Scratchansniff), whose job was to civilize [the Warner siblings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakko,_Wakko,_and_Dot). On the 2005 English dub, Loongkoffer was voiced by [Arthur Grosser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Grosser).

&gt;


&gt;* __Professor Strix__

&gt;Professor Strix is a mad scientist who appears in the last two episodes of the animated series. He is one of two scientists who believe Hugo is an unknown arctic animal. He runs a professional research facility. In the third movie, he makes a comeback and tried to eradicate Hugo, make multiple copies of Hugo and sell them all around the world. He is very heartless, as he was willing to kill Hugo in an effort to make clones of him.

&gt;


&gt;* __The Jungle Dog__

&gt;A small jungle dog pup that Hugo and Rita encounter in the third movie. Rita discovers the pup when she hides in a hollow log near the Jungle Dog's nest area. The pup mistakes Rita for its mother and Rita (presuming the pup was abandoned by its real mother) takes it under her wing. Before the movie's release, some fans mistook the pup to be Hugo and Rita's child.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier

So, you should be able to see a GDP increase beyond what's attributable to the stimulus.  I would imagine the deficit to GDP ratio also demonstrates a better economy.

In any event, just looking at the comparison with what's going on in Europe with their reverse policy, austerity (though we are doing austerity now) and their flirting with their 3rd recession, and huge unemployment, while our economy is slowly improving would seem to be sufficient evidence.  Our economy is outperforming the EUs even though the stimulus is long gone.

“After Zontov was appointed, things got better. You can actually take city business to him, and he will talk to you,” says Vladislav. 

“Yeah, now it’s finally possible for patriots to take power,” says Sergey, another activist at the assembly.

“By the way, what do you guys plan to do with him?” I point to the Lenin statue.

“We haven’t decided yet. The people should decide. We could do it civilly, take and move him to the local (Lenin) park,” says Vladislav.

“Yeah, another option is to sell him for scrap, he is made of bronze you know,” adds another voice.

The conversation then turns back to Zolotov. He is praised for his ‘corruption-free and transparent’ approach to heading the administration. Denis Begunov, one of Zolotov’s staff, is trying to entice the people to take up some of the still-vacant seats on the administration – the press-secretary and the deputy for building maintenance and culture.

Begunov is an exemplary Ukrainian patriot. “To me, Ukrainian language, the flag, and the anthem are sacred. Even though I speak Russian, my identity is Ukrainian. And I will fight for Ukraine, because it’s not a totalitarian state, but a democracy which lets people completely express their creative potential,” passionately explains Begunov.

When Party of Regions was in power, he says, Slavyansk was ruled like a fascist city. “One party, one religion, one opinion,” says Bigunov, who back then also worked for the city administration.
 
“And how could you stomach working for the ‘fascists administration’ back then?” I ask him.

“I always knew that Party of Regions will collapse under its own corruption. I even moderated an anti-Yanukovich group on Facebook, it had over 20,000 subscribers.” Proudly says Begunov, then adds, “Of course, I suffered greatly, because of my position. I did what they told me to. But I also did everything in my power to destroy them from the inside.” 

But Begunov admits - Kiev has abstracted itself from Donbass problems, and let the ‘patriotic upheval’ fend for itself. “In practical terms,” he says, “Kiev has done nothing to change things in Slavyansk.  So patriots like myself have to pick up the slack. While I am a public official, I think I spend most of my time building democracy, rather than on city business. I help lay the groundwork for free media and public organizations, stuff like that. And I feel more like a volunteer than a public official.” 

“But do you feel like the rest of Ukraine forgot about Slavyansk?”

“A little, but I understand, there is 8 million other people in Donbass who all need help. So while the war is on, it’s understandable that Kiev isn’t taking steps to Ukraine-ize Slavyansk.”

According to him, the most passionate patriots here are small and medium businessmen, and they will eventually pull the rest of the inert citizenry behind them. “To succeed, Ukraine must relax economic regulations, lustrate the corrupt officials, and diversify its markets,” says Begunov. “It’s imperative, because 90% of local businesses work with Russia. But I think eventually we’ll win and have a proper country.”

**Dreaming of a strong arm**

Organizers of the Saturday ‘assembly’ are, in fact, local businessmen. “We work with ceramics, Slavyanks is a city of ceramicsts.” tells me Aleksander Mima, director of the local Vostok company. ”And  we just decided that people who support Ukraine must self-organize,”
 
“Were you this patriotic before ‘green men’ showed up in Slaviansk?” I ask him and other entrepreneurs at the assembly, all speaking to each other in Russian.

“Well, we cheered for the Ukrainian soccer team when they played, and for Klichko when he fought. But back then we didn’t really think about Ukraine in patriotic terms, because people in power were stealing our money,” says Aleksander.

“But once you are faced with a choice, you understand what’s dear to you,” adds Vladislav, another pro-Ukrainian activist.

“I’ve had my ceramics business for 14 years,” adds Viktor, “but once the war started I quit and focused on helping my country instead.”

According to Irina Dovgan, “even those, who used to be pro-DNR, are chaning their mind about Ukraine.”

“At the polls,” she said, “one old woman came up to me and gave me flower, then said she voted for me. We need to stay clear of pessimistic attitudes. If we don’t show the rest of the people the way, who will? We do not want to be like Russia, who nurtured a whole new generation of nationalists.”

Unfortunately Ukrainian patriotism is seeping in slowly. “Some don’t like the new Kiev government, and they associate the government with Ukraine as a whole, ” says Vladislav. “But governments change, and your nation doesn’t.” He adds:

“Many of my friends respect Putin and think he is a strong leader, because he took Crimea. Most people here are kinda simple, and they yearn for a strong hand. They think like slaves. They don’t like to think, and they want others to make their choices for them.” 

One of Vladislav’s friends, Stepan, doesn’t entirely agree with Vladislav. He says he understands Putin’s actions. According to him, because the pro-American forces won on Maidan and there is a “Cold War,” Putin and to act.

While Stepan is not anti-Ukrainian, he despises Poroshenko, and blames him for civilian casualties in Slavyanks.  He says, “If a bunch people showed up with Kalashnikovs, fight them with Kalashnikovs. Don’t surround the town and bomb it with artillery. Why do that? Now that they lost [the military confrontation], Poroshenko is talking about special status for Donbass and about federalization. Why couldn’t they do this in April? Why did that piece of shit government have to fuck up our city instead?”
 
Another passer-by confides in me that he is unhappy with Kiev, calling their methonds ‘inhumane.’ With DNR, he said, he lived well, even though he lost a nice job and his wife left him. 

Even the pro-Ukrainians at the Saturday assembly keep echoing rebels’ demands for federalization. “Our main goal,” says Vladislav from the stage, “is to keep as much of the taxes with the city as we can. We don’t want to send them up to Kiev, where they will be stolen. With this, we will turn Slavyanks into a European town.” The crowd meets his words with surprised ‘oooh’s of approval.

The assembly is over, and everyone is drinking tea from a samovar someone brought to warm up the activists. The stereo is once again playing patriotic music.

**Zombie Apocalypse**

Slavyanks patriots hope that with the exodus of several thousand local pro-Russians, most of the remaining citizenry will once again come to believe in Ukraine. “The core supporters of DNR are pensioneers, and the unemployed, broke, and illiterate scum. With DNR here, we had a zombie apocalypse. I had an impression that gates of hell have opened up and that the most bizzare monsters crawled out from the depths,” passionately says administration worker Bigunov.

“And, now they have all crawled back into the depths?”

“Well, a significant number of those who took up arms and turned our city into Prypiat, are now gone.” (*Pripyat is next to Chernobyl, it was abandoned and is now a poster child for post-apocalyptic ghost towns.*)

“You think it’s a good thing that all of those people have left?”

 “Absolutely. It was absolutely horrible here. I am happy that these brainwashed cultists are gone. They don’t accept others’ opinion, they think in pre-fabricated clichés, and sometimes I think that they suffer from schizophrenia! How can one believe, at the same time, that both communism and Church are good?!” says Bigunov. (*The point he is making is that communists are atheist.*)

One example of a man who changed his opinion about Ukraine since the war began is Arthur. He works as a camera operator. “I used to hate Ukraine, because I worked all my life for a beggar’s salary ($150/mo), even though I am a trained professional. But once things started happening, I had no choice but to support my country. Now I don’t even remember why I hated Ukraine in the first place.” 

When Yanukovich was the governor of Donetsk, Arthur worked as his personal cameraman. According to Arthur, the Party of Regions was trying to destroy the people of Donbass: “They always used to tell us that Kiev doesn't care about us, and I believed that. But today, I just want Donetsk to be demolished to the ground. The people living in Donetsk are all scum gathered there by the four fascists, who make up this four-headed Nazi snake:  your Putin, Yanukovich, (local oligarch) Akhmetov, and (the Party of Regions functionary) Efremov. I say turn Donetsk into a crater, and then build a new city in its place.”

One of the problems facing local patriots is that many local pro-Ukrainians chose not to return to Slavyanks after Stelkov left. Many found jobs in Kiev and Kharkov, and are in no hurry to return. This weekend many of them came back to vote and to visit relatives.

“We live in Kiev right now,” I overhear two girls at a café saying to a friend.

“Aw, and why not Donetsk?” he asks them innocently, and the girl erupt in Homeric laughter. He also moved to Khrakov some time ago.

Many of the returnees also have to deal with the fact that many of their relatives still sympathize with Russia and DNR.  Pro-Ukrainian graffitis have to compete with pro-Russian for space. “Slava Ukraini” and “Russian fascism will not pass” versus “Glory to Rus” and “Go Russia!” are decorating the same facades.

It's possible that the information contained in another text would have been easier for Shakespeare to get hold of i.e. Agrippa's [**Three Books of Occult Philosophy**.](https://www.scribd.com/doc/120847926/Three-Books-of-Occult-Philosophy-pdf)  Because of the similarity of information contained, it is highly likely that Cornelius Agrippa used The Picatrix (Latin edition since that was the one most passed around Europe) to write his Three Books of Occult Philosophy (written as early as 1515 but published in 1531-33), but he escaped trouble with the church by re-framing the topic as a form of contemplative natural philosophy.  It's merely informational and very systematic - he didn't include any rituals or methods for actual practice, unlike the Picatrix which is full of practical applications (some necromantic), albeit disorganized in format.  Agrippa's reference text became the foundation of modern European occultism.  Most later orders/groups based their teachings on it (see Golden Dawn, 19th c. England in particular). 

Edit: I had forgotten the influence Christopher Marlowe had on Shakespeare.  The fact he wrote a play on Faust could indicate more than a passive interest in the occult.

,,KotakuInAction,1426248088,False,t3_2kw3m7,2,False,t1_clppe2p,0,,2,"This article holds no credible proof of sexism in the industry. I'll give you a scientific breakdown of why this research is flawed, and I'll try to remain unbiased as possible.

Firstly, the article begins with a trigger warning. These are usually used by people that identify with the social justice community, of which I assume she is a member. Looking at her profile, she indeed identifies as a social justice advocate.

As such, she is prone to confirmation bias and her research is affected by this. Research is intended to be wholly free of bias as much as possible, so a study that she carried out on her own (since her research is not actually cited in the article, nor would it be credible) is not evidence of much.

Research should be carried out independent of any agenda or ideology of the participant by neutral parties and peer reviewed. None of this seems to have occurred, so this does not serve to verify her research.

Secondly, her population and sample are never outlined. This is *the first stage* of thinking about conducting research, yet it is not outlined. Who are the people you want to study, and how many of these people can you feasibly sample and how?

Did she use probability or non-probability sampling? What kind? If the former, was it simple random? Stratified random? Cluster, multi-stage? If the latter, convenience, self-determined etc.? These are not outlined. I get the impression her population is gaming industry devs, and that she used convenience sampling, but her sample is not outlined nor are her methods.

Thirdly, and this is up for debate since it is personal opinion, her outlined definition of sexism is: ""any discomfort or discrimination that is caused in a situation as a result of a person’s gender"". 

But how can we define discomfort? It's a subjective feeling, and she goes on to cite ""rape jokes, the constant sprawl of sexed up female characters, the boys’ club culture"" but these are all *entirely* subjective.

With doubts to the credibility and significance to the results out of the way, let's look at her actual data:

""Almost all of my interview subjects, 70% of women surveyed, and over half of men called this industry a boy’s club.  69.3% of women and 44.4% of men admit that at least one colleague has acted in a way that they found offensive on the basis of gender. Moreover, 70.8% of women and 54.2% of men disagree with the statement that men as a whole are informed or educated on the issues surrounding the treatment of women in the video game industry.""

These are very high numbers, very high indeed. But since she does no source her data or research, I cannot credit or discredit it. Again, her sample comes into play. I would say the sample is biased, by intuition, but I cannot prove this due to no access to the data (which bloody baffles me, I simply cannot understand why she would not cite her research) but nor can the case be made that it is credible either.

And then there are the explanations to the findings too, but we won't go into that here, we'll keep scientific. I would enjoy seeing a large, official study into the presence of sexism in the industry, but so far this article is not doing that job.

Regarding the research she cited, [this](http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/1279/game_developer_salary_survey_2013.php?page=1), there are many things to address, but I am so thankful for being provided with tangible data.

Firstly, the methodology. Of the 4042 people they surveyed, 2414 responses were used to analyse the data. I do not know how many people work in dev, so I cannot speak for the ability to generalise this research to the population. The US, Canada and Europe were included, but I cannot understand why Japan was not. 

Looking at the results, it is shown that, of the 2414 responses, most of them were male. This is no surprise, the industry's largest demographic is male. Several of the graphs show that women tend to receive less pay, but it is not explained why. This relates to arguments against the gender wage gap, which is often cited. Research into this wage gap shows that women receive less pay, but do not show why.

Reasons such as tenure, type of work, amount of work completed, maternal leave, injury and illness, age, experience and education are cited as reasons why the gender wage gap may exist, and the same thing can be applied here. The graphs do not show the tenure of the men and women in the study, so for all we know the only women that were taken into account were those at entry-level positions.

Relating to this is the exclusion of positions that payed less than $10,000 and more than $202,500. This is significant to consider, because the gender of the people in those positions has an effect on the representation of sexism in the industry - certainly very many women are on both sides, and likely men are too; we just cannot know for sure.

On top of this, there is bound to be a correlation between level of representation and average pay. If the representation was at 50% for both men and women, would that affect the average and how? What extraneous variables (such as those I have mentioned - maternal leave, type of work etc.) were accounted for? The research does not say.

Coming back to Allaway's research, it is impossible to tell what questions were asked of the participants as well. On top of this, their personal stories factored into the research, which is *so rare an occurrence*. For instance, and personally I find this a ridiculous example of sexism:

""I was the only girl,"" she said. ""They hung out together, the boys…and talked a lot and told jokes to each other, and I was kind of just left out. And I don’t think I was given a chance, and part of that was because I’m a girl, but I have a sharp wit and I like inappropriate humor…I don’t mean inappropriate as in sexist, but just being fun and silly at work. I felt pretty lonely and outcast, really.”

Whose fault is that? Was there a definite exclamation that she was not allowed to hang out? It is claimed in the article that this is to ""spare them from inappropriate humour"". This is in no way a verifiable claim nor can it be implied that this is the case.

But let us grant it. In the case they wanted to spare her the inappropriate humour, why? You'd have to interview them. I doubt their answers would back up the claim, but if so, why is it you did not want her hearing your jokes? Does she find them offensive? If so, then no wonder she is being excluded. This pertains to the informality of gaming industry and development. It's not a corporate office, it's a creative space. It's laid back. And guys? Guys like to tell dick jokes, and piss each other off with dirty jokes that some may find distasteful. Is that a problem? I would argue no, it is not. 

The workers make themselves feel comfortable, and if one person is uncomfortable with that, why should it change? Regardless of gender, why should it change for anyone, unless it is overtly harmful? I'll call into question Adria Richards, who got someone fired over a dick joke that was not even meant for her, and which she could have handled better than she did. Imagine it, getting mortally offended over a dick joke, making a song and dance about it, costing a guy, who had a family to support, his job and *then getting fired yourself after being outed as a hypocrite.*

There are so many variables that go into this that make this argument grey, not black and white. But at the end of the day, the assertion that there is an issue involving sexism in the gaming industry has to be proven, and I am not convinced, at all, that it has been nor can be. 

My personal opinion is that it is not a demonstrable thing, but rather a fallacious claim made by those who are advocates of social justice and is not situated in substantial or significant evidence.

All I can pray is that someone is payed and treated fairly regardless of their gender, and that those who commit legitimate acts of sexism (be they male or female or other) face the consequences they deserve. If that's something we need to work towards, then sure, I'm on board. But if it isn't, and is an overblown, unproven, misrepresented situation, then why waste the resources?

**TL;DR: There are several problems with the research presented here, and the issue of sexism on the industry is not black and white. It is not quantifiable by mere numbers, but by hundreds, perhaps thousands of personal variables that affect social interaction. If a legitimate, proven problem of sexism arises, regardless of the instigator, then it should be solved and handled appropriately and satisfactorily. Gender should not factor into treatment of a person, and any credible case of mistreatment should be resolved - but if it is not credible and substantiated, it deserves no attention nor action, much less something that would result in damage to a person.**

As a heavy main, keep up the good work, but know that you should be getting a good KDA and high/mid-range damage as a baseline, particularly if you are a primary pocket (which I'm guessing you are because of no comp experience). So don't let it get to you head, be proud of what you've done and use that to accomplish more, but don't brag, people hate bragging kids that are *way* out of their depth (not saying you are, but be aware of this)

So I wrote up this whole long thing about maturity, priority, time spent in game to skill, team cohesion and more but deleted it to this. But what you really need to know is, older players (pretty much everyone) has different priorities than you, they have a life going on and really don't care whether you have played CoD or not, nor that you do well in lobbies or win MGE fights (with only 600 hours and new to comp I'm guess its not versus IM/Plat+ players).

You should jump right into Iron, knowing that your age wont be an issue, you *are* going to be less mature than other members so if you constantly shit talk or squeal and are asked to stop please, be mindful of other players and it wont be an issue. I get you might have concerns over being accepted or liked, but within the community you wont get mocked solely for being young.

*With that said* if you are a troll, or act in terribly immature way, don't be surprised if people insult you right back and throw your age in your face, remember its because you were a troll, that *happens*  to have a high pitched voice. Heck if that is a point of contention with you get a voice mask/filter to sound deeper if it helps you mentally. 

TLDR: No it really wont matter about your age. Yes play comp, go to the UGC (NA) or ETF2L (EU) forums now and start trying to get yourself on a team. Remember to have fun and stay in school kid :D

Edit: I'm 24 and have been playing comp games like Starcraft, WC3, Unreal 2k4, Dota, LOL, and many more from about the age of 12 until now. I can tell you that as a person you'll change so much it'll be shocking. Heck when I was 13 someone complained about 12 year old gamers in Dota I laughed, thinking ""ha I'm 13 you've never guessed because I am so mature"", let *that* sink in for a moment, its amusing because my thoughts of being ""oh so mature for my age"" were in fact rather immature and silly. Anyway that's my personal little moment shame shared, hope you enjoyed it.

Most sealed products from the good sets are way more expensive on the secondary market. It all depends on availability and demand. High demand and low availabilty makes stuff expensive (Try looking up the Commander deck with Kaalia. It used to be around €40, it's way over €120 now).
The availability is higher in the US because more people play M:tG over there. Also, keep in mind that there are translated cards available in some of the bigger European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain).

The rule of thumb for older sets is: If they're out of print and the set contains some broken (or otherwise really good) cards, prices ramp up insanely.

Furthermore, because the US and Europe are requiring retrofits of existing plants, the rate of decommissioning is at an all-time high.

&gt; By Williams, Daniel H.
&gt; Publication: The Energy Journal
&gt; Date: Tuesday, January 1 1991

&gt; ""The results described above indicate that when the bases for nuclear power plant and coal-fired plant decommissioning cost estimates are adjusted to permit a valid comparison, coal-fired power plants can be expected to cost approximately the same per megawatt to decommission as nuclear power plants. In addition to the total cost, the uncertainties on that cost for a coal-fired power plant rival the uncertainties on that cost for nuclear power plants.""

The retrofits are required because the plants spew a toxic mix of radiation, heavy metals, SO2, CO2, three of which are somewhat, but not fully, mitigated by scrubbing.  In the US, roughly 24,000 deaths annually are attributed to coal power production, in the form of cancer and respiratory illness.

http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-health_effects_from_US_power_plant_emissions
http://www.catf.us/resources/publications/files/The_Toll_from_Coal.pdf

In contrast, wikipedia gives the death toll from nuclear accidents:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_and_radiation_accidents_by_death_toll

Were you to include the most ridiculously outsized Chernobyl statistic of 200,000 cancer deaths from Greenpeace, it would pale in comparison to the roughly 1 millions deaths / year attributed to coal pollution from the WHO:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_the_coal_industry#Annual_excess_mortality_and_morbidity

&gt; Coal just doesn't even come close to that level of hazard.

Indeed, the hazards of coal mining, transport, combustion, infrastructure clean-up, health care, and human cost are so ridiculously greater than nuclear that comparing the two is almost impossible.

Welcome to League. :) I'm not certain as to what knowledge you are searching for and to what degree, so I gave you a load down on everything I use.

* [The League Wiki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki) is your friend when it comes to statistics. This is the go-to place for information and is fairly updated. Clicking on ""show me more"" on each champion ability answers FAQ you have regarding that particular ability and how it interacts. If you are uncertain weather ""x slow stack with y slow or not"", as you said, then this is the place to check that kind of information. 
* Korean professional scene is the best source of guidance as to how to build a certain champion. LCS is the name of the western pro scene, [OGN](http://www.twitch.tv/ongamenet) is the Korean version. [OGN Builds](http://ognbuilds.tumblr.com/) gives you up-to-date information about the builds used in the professional games in Korea. 
* Ranked games to professional players across the world can be found over at [Probuilds](http://www.probuilds.net/). It's secondary source for a champion build. 
* [Creepscore](http://mullinator.com/tools/cscore?c=202&amp;t=18.5&amp;p=94), [Riftkit](http://riftkit.net/), [Wardscore](http://wardscore.loltools.net/) and [Teryd](http://www.teryd.net/) are up-to-date League of Legends calculators. Creepscore can help you in becoming better at CSing. Riftkit is a genious way of communicating strategy or recreating a moment from a game to fellow players, Wardscore says something about the amount of wards you place. Teryd is a champion calculator which uses data from the League Wiki to calculate everything from diminishing returns on movement speed, total amount of gold, armor reduction %, magic penetration, etc. and other information directly from the files. 
* Match History - [EUW](http://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#page/landing-page) - [NA](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#page/landing-page) - [EUNE](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#page/landing-page) - is the official arena to see post data about your game. As a tank, I can see what kind of damage source the opponent used, and then buy the right type of armor next time I see that champion. 
* [Lastshadow9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWIfnDrWU_Cvc1a8qZribhA) is former pro starcraft player and League of Legends coach. He lives in Korea, interacts with the pro scene and coach for a living. You can learn a thing or two from this guy. 
* [LOLNexus](http://www.lolnexus.com/) Gives you information about all the builds used by all the 10 players in your game. I sometimes Alt+tab and check my opponent and what runes they used. 
* [OPGG](http://euw.op.gg/), [Riftwalkgg](http://www.riftwalk.gg/game-archive) and [lolking.net](http://www.lolking.net/) are sites that give you information about other players, their rune pages, their masteries, post matches etc. I prefer OPGG because it's superior [GUI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) and utility. Riftwalk record games in transcripts, map and graphs to show you how your game developed. LOLking is more simple and easy to use. 
* Amateur build sites like [ MOBAfire ](http://www.mobafire.com) and [Solomid](http://www.solomid.net/) provide a number of different perspective on champions. It can be useful to read as an introduction to understanding a champion, because the writers are one trick ponies who have spent 100s of hours on perfecting their champion. You will not see the most up to date meta here, and the few professionals who write free articles usually copy what the Koreans do. 
* [Chinese pro scene](http://wangyou.pcgames.com.cn/zhuanti/lol/season/LPL/). It's worth looking over at China. EU and NA have a handful of servers, China have 19. 
* [Baronreplay](https://ahri.tw/en/FAQ/) record your game as if you were spectating your own game. 
* Once every full moon the League of Legends Redditupvotes something of value. For example [calculating the gold efficiency of Season 4 masteries](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1rkvad/calculating_gold_efficiency_of_masteries/) or [the mana cost used by every champion](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2anujk/i_calculated_the_percent_of_mana_used_for_a_full/). You have to filter away 95% of all the NA Pro drama theater though. 
* [2ez](http://2ez.gg/) is a ""hub"" or a bookmark collection of several sites. I don't use it that often, because I've not found a way to easily integrate it, but it has potential if you'd want League of Legends to take be the starting page when you open your browser or something.  

Summery: You sound a bit like myself, I'm a person who likes to research everything there is to know. Maybe min-maxing the champion(s) I main. League of Legends is in the end a game of numbers and numbers can be calculated. **The League Wiki**  and **Teryd** are my most used tools to do so, because they provide the most amount of data. **Official Match History** and **Baron-replay** are a good way to verify practice and theory. **OPGG** and **LOLNexus** are good sources of information to use just before a game. **OGN Builds** and **Probuilds** are my primary and secondary sources of information when adopting a new champion or a new build. You can't research from watching **LS9**s youtube movies or watching his stream, but his community is small and you can soak up a lot of information very quickly by watching him coach for free on Twitch and Youtube. I rarely use the other sites, but it's handy to bookmark all of them.

""Halloween"" as it is celebrated in the US originates in the Celtic countries, particularly Ireland and Scotland. In some ways ""Halloween"" might seem like a misnomer. Prior to the creation of All Saints' Day and its subsequent move to Nov 1, these countries had their own celebrations (with pre-Christian origins) at this time of year. Those customs continued to be observed and evolve. Because All Hallows' Eve falls on this time, these celebrations came under its banner (and it no doubt had an influence on it). The Irish name for this Gaelic festival is Samhain (Sow-in), Halloween itself is ""Oíche Shamhna"" (Ee-ha howna) meaning ""eve of Samhain"".

The AAP was recently attacked by the [President of the British Association of Paediatric Urologists](http://www.nature.com/news/doctors-back-circumcision-1.11296) because the evidence of benefit is weak, and they are promoting **""Irreversible mutilating surgery.""**

[The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/167/5/532.2.full) has taken a position against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered illegal in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it was done to them and are becoming activists against it. 

The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same (link above).

The [Central Union for Child Welfare](http://www.childcentre.info/10595/) “considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person… **Circumcision can only be allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it has been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure.**”

The BMA considers that **the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it.** |

[Australian College of Paediatrics](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/acp1996/):

&gt;Some men **strongly resent having been circumcised as infants. There has been increasing interest in this problem,** evidenced by the number of surgical and non-surgical techniques for recreation of the foreskin.|

ON that note, [74% of Australian doctors overall believe circumcision should not be offered, and 51% consider it abuse](http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/strong-opposition-to-newborn-circumcision).

A letter by the [South African Medical Association](http://www.icgi.org/Downloads/SAMA-NOCIRC-2011-06-25.pdf) said this:
&gt;The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission.|

[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons](http://www.surgeons.org/media/292210/Male_non-therapeutic_circumcision.pdf) 
This one is a detailed evaluation of the arguments in favor of circumcision, They note that during one of the recent trials in Africa, the researchers claimed there was no loss of sexual satisfaction, when in fact there was. But the RACS called them out: 
&gt;""**Despite uncircumcised men reporting greater sexual satisfaction, which was statistically significant,** Kigozi et al (2008) concluded that adult male circumcision does not adversely affect sexual satisfaction or clinically significant function in men."" In general, they discuss how there's no evidence to support it.

[The Norwegian Council of Medical Ethics](http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/gulbrandsen1/) states that ritual circumcision of boys is not consistent with important principles of medical ethics, that it is without medical value, and should not be paid for with public funds.

The [Norwegian Children’s Ombudsman](http://www.crin.org/resources/infodetail.asp?id=25991) is opposed as well.

The strategic and economic aims of warfare dictate battlefield practices like Romans salting fields and taking slaves to sow terror and cripple the enemy. I think in the 19th century, a corp of professional soldiers in Europe developed a code of respect (eg. Films like the duelist and paths of glory) and chivalry, but this mostly ended in the industrialized killing fields of ww1. The culture still existed in some services like the air force and navy occasionally, however we can see over the next 50 years how this progressed to the bombed out moonscapes of Vietnam. The idea of a brotherhood of professional officers in Europe was really a short-lived glitch in the history of warfare.

People give Obama credit for the original stimulus but criticize him for not making it bigger in the first place and, later, for not challenging the Republicans more on the deficit focus.

Moving oil by rail is dangerous because of lax regulations and standards. What if I told you that fuel storage was something that was fixed prior to WW2? You literally had airplanes firing .50 caliber machine gun rounds at each other that wouldn't burst into flames because they figured it out. Even today modern sealing techniques can button up leaks within seconds of them occurring. 


It sounds like the issue is much more lazy, relaxed safety standards than anything else. 


""Blockading"" doesn't solve anything. That oil is going to be drilled whether it leaves the continent through Washington, Oregon, and BC, or if China has to physically plow it's way through the Arctic to make it happen. They want oil. Europe wants oil. Most of the globe wants oil. It is legitimately wiser to bring it through your own ports so that you, at some level, profit from it while dictating terms. 


If anything the idea of completely shutting up the conversation accomplishes nothing and instead goes a long way toward countries considering entirely *worse* options. The Pacific Northwest is well known for its environmentalist leanings. Eco-terrorism is mildly tolerated. Dick Cheney referred to Portland as *Little Beirut*. No company who is aware that what they do is destructive to the environment ever *willing* considers having anything to do with our region because sabotage is a fact of life. If it isn't spiked trees its destroyed equipment and blockaded roads. 


And mind you, even energy alternatives like solar and wind power have their own associated environmental impacts. Solar panels aren't made of rainbows and daisies. 


This assertion that because the economy was dramatically shifted under strict government control during WW2, we should be able to do the same today despite a complete lack of technology to make the shift off oil *happen* is woefully ignorant.

I can also see Europe breaking off from NATO's space program, or continuing to operate ESA separately, considering that they have been completely unrepresented so far in the story.

Also, there is now potentially destructive alien tech, not just near, but *on Earth*. The importance of this cannot be overstated. The power to launch a spacecraft is the power to destroy a city, and. North America is now even more OP than it is in real life, and considering the Scotch Creek facility, Canada is the most powerful nation on Earth, and could probably conquer it if they felt like it. Expect Russia, China, Etc. to attempt rather desperately to acquire physical access to alien tech.

If we assume *Pandora*, (which, independent of the name's actual merit wold have actually had about a 2% chance of not being named *Enterprise*, and was developed in far too short a timespan, considering the moon took seven years), is representative of a typical earth spacecraft, and cost somewhere in the ballpark of an Apollo launch to construct, not including research, infrastructure, and prototyping, a rough upper limit for how much NATO would be willing to spend, There is likely to be a rush among the world's nations to produce many more such craft, considering that it could basically solve any problem we have that could conceivably be solved by a single aircraft.

For example I can't even check shipping quotes from the US because you need to enter a US zip code. Ok now I managed, but got a quote like $60 for a small pouch.. then I go back and all data is reset.",False,0,FarkMcBark,1414820531,t3_2kycb5,0,clpsysi,t5_32hcd

There's the Complete mods, which ease some of the difficulty and unfinished design of the game (like incorporating a repair mechanic for weapons and armor that degrade over time). There's a Complete for each game, though the impact is most significant with SoC (and often discouraged for CoP since there's been lots of reports of savegame glitches).

Then the other end of the spectrum is Misery mod for CoP, which amps the difficulty to 11, adds a TON of items, and makes even a can of beans cost thousands of rubles (oh, and requires you to eat, drink, and sleep, lest you die pretty quick).

But most mods are somewhere in between the two, and there's a lot of them. A LOT. And most are major overhauls, most have some sort of overlap or similarities. A few even scrap the original stories and create brand new ones (like Secret Trails), whereas some are primarily visual overhauls with only a few new tweaks/features/items (like Autumn Aurora 2).

Basically each game can potentially be, like, ten games. It's crazy. The biggest downside is that the eastern Europe market is the source of most of the big-name mods, so whenever a new one comes out it takes a while before there's a good English translation; not an issue if one speaks Russian, of course.

Ehh I'd be careful with that logic. Assuming that's true, which it [might not be](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol#Non-Microsoft_implementations), there are some hurdles which Windows doesn't have to deal with:

First of all, RDP is a proprietary protocol:

&gt;~First line of the RPD article on wikipedia

It also appears to be [patent-encumbered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol#Patents).

And Microsoft has a *long* history of making their protocols undocumented and locked to Windows. Take a look at OOXML and WINE. Actually, take a look at J++ as well (Microsoft's attempt to lock Java developers into win32).

Also, take a look at [this 31-page report on Microsoft's anticompetitive at leveraging their monopoly to force vendor lock-in](http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf).

The reason behind climate change is that the carbon removed from the ground is not being cycled quickly enough back into the ground, or other ""carbon sinks"". If all oil, oil derived products, and energy we used was based on biological systems (biobutanol, bioplastics, etc) would be carbon neutral. There really is nothing wrong with oil except that it's a source of carbon that is not being recycled fast enough. 

These are really important issues that must be addressed in a much broader way than taking a Bono/Kerry approach of ""leave it in the ground"" as that would put the average life expectancy somewhere back into your early to mid 50's and all of this would be moot as few people would know what a granny is. At the same time, we need energy now to make the advanced materials that go into solar panels, wind turbines and other 'green energy' solutions. 

I should also point out ""the way we shifted the economy during WWII"" was by drilling more oil wells, mining more coal, making more steel, aluminum, uranium and articles made of those things and then dropping them on Europe and remote islands in the pacific than at any time in human history. I appreciate the sentiment, but frankly it needs much more granularity before it can even be considered as serious. 

If everyone was serious about dropping oil tomorrow, nuclear is really the only other option as it is energy dense enough to provide the chemical feedstocks the rest of society needs. We get more from oil than just energy, and whether the grannies knew it or not, they were wearing and sitting on oil while out there in the rain. I'm sure earlier in the day they were probably eating or drinking something made of oil. 

I am one who has always appreciated the freedom and honesty that comes with age. However these women have lived their whole lives enjoying the benefits of oil. As my generation comes up, they want to turn off the tap and force my generation to be one to watch the lights go out, the live saving drugs be used up, and the primary modes of transportation to grind to a halt. I don't think these grannies are quite that malthusian, which leads me to conclude they are either hypocrites, or willfully ignorant.

I never inferred the star was ""the"" proof but only suggested that one doesn't have to look to deeply and can see hints even ""on its surface"". Can you lightly assume that a nation that paints its religious symbols on its warplanes holds its religion as a national identifier? What can you assume about a group that calls itself ""Islamic Resistance Movement""? Would you admit, in the very least, that this conflict has religious undertones?

 Both Israel and Hamas have their reasons to downplay the religious aspects of this conflict. Israel has been attacked multiple times by Islamic nations and probably doesn't want to announce that this is a holy war which would invite greater numbers of Muslims to the fight. Hamas has to downplay the religious aspect because most western sympathy would melt away if the west felt it was supporting a jihad.

*""The other issue I have is your focus on the Iranian nuclear weapons program while ignoring the 100 or so nuclear weapons stockpiled by the Israelis"" 

I've stated in English  ""I think it's terrible for Israel, a country involved in a religious conflict, to have Nuclear weapons.""

*""Since you overly opine of the world's total nuclear stockpile but complain about Iran's who may and may not have a such program is being one sided, towards Israel who actually has a stockpile.""

There is no solid evidence that Israel or Iran have nuclear weapons as neither one has admitted openly to having any. Both have enough evidence to suggest that its a reality for Israel already to have them and Iran is pursuing them. It could just as easily be argued that both of them maintain this position to make an aggressor think twice about an invasion. I personally hope neither has.

*""Where is the specific link to the article going to source and asking me to find it means you don't know either.""

Why are you being so accusatory and aggressive with me? I listed 2 links. One that has the [specific](http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2004/gov2004-34.pdf) data you're looking for and one that has a [broader](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/iaeairan/index.shtml) amount of data. 

If you're getting frustrated that I don't join you in your anti-Israel rant its because I don't hold allegiance to Islam nor Judaism. This conflict started before Israel seized the area that Hamas is fighting from and I can't believe that it would end if Israel stopped building settlements.

 You mention that 17% of Israelis are Muslim but you should know that Israel passed a [law](https://www.opendemocracy.net/arab-awakening/quinn-coffey/israel-passes-legislation-to-reclassify-its-christian-citizens-as-%E2%80%98non-a) in Feb 2014 that specifically identifies the populations of Christian/Muslim Arabs to bring Christians into its fold and to exclude Muslims. There will be no 1 state solution. I don't believe the Israelis are going to pack up and move out of the Middle East and I don't believe Islam will tolerate Jews being in control of the Holy Land.

I won't take a side. I can only observe the history of the conflict. 

The area was Jewish until the Romans conquered the area and destroyed the military and political power of the Jewish state. This saw a diaspora of Jewish populations to Europe. The Romans renamed the area Palestine. It became a mixed Pagan/Jewish area until the Romans converted to Christianity. This produced an area of mix Jewish/Christian/Pagan populations that saw Christianity spread greatly. When Islam invaded the area the Pagan/Jew/Christian populations plummeted. The remnant populations were reduced to the level of dhimmis until the western powers moved the European Jewish population back to their homeland. 

This immediately culminated in a series of wars that saw Muslim attackers repelled. These attackers were the Muslim nations of Egypt,Jordan,Syria,Lebanon, and Iraq. The Jordanian/Iraqi attack penetrated a corridor on the West Bank of the Dead Sea. Israel seized this area due to its strategic value. Israel also seized the entire Sinai Peninsula from Egypt but returned it after peace was declared. Israel will *never* let go of the West bank of the Dead Sea. It will use the Dead Sea as its Eastern border as a matter of national security. 

 I can only hope as human being that the conflict doesn't go nuclear.

Mock funerals were held all over the United States. Perhaps the most poignant of them all occurred on December 26, 1799. At daybreak, sixteen cannons were fired and volleys were shot on a half-hour basis in Philadelphia. An empty casket was carried in an elaborate funeral procession which consisted of two marines wearing black scarves escorting a riderless horse festooned with black and white feathers, and a bald eagle depicted on the horse's breast. A religious service was held at the German Lutheran Church officiated by Reverend William White, a bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States. The news of Washington's death had a profound effect in Europe. In France, Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul, asked Louis-Marcelin de Fontanes to give a eulogy and ordered a ten-day requiem.

So that would make it harder to spread. Secondly it was the religion of the Persian empires and not Rome, and the eastern empires were fairly religiously tolerant. Christianity only grew in the west because  the Roman emperors were converted to it.

But let's say that it did somehow happen. I suspect that more of Europe would have converted to Islam in much the same way Persia did when it was conquered. It's very likely that many of the traditional religions of Scandinavia, the Baltic and Slavs would remain common till today and that Islam would have had a great effect on Africa and Asia.

European culture itself would be very different. For a start, death would be treated very differently then it is in Christianity. Zoroastrians believed that dead bodies were pure evil and should be left out on high towers for birds to eat. Holidays such as Easter or Christmas wouldn't exist, or at the very least they would be drastically different then they are today. There is information suggesting that incestuous marriages were common or even expected for kings and high priests (Often the king is also the high priest).

Christianity played a very important part in European history and culture, so it would be hard to speculate what changes Zoroastrianism would have made, but it wouldn't just be a reskin of current history. Europeans most certainly would have discovered America, although who and when would have been different. And perhaps it would be filled with the few Christians that survived under the Muslims and Zoroastrians. It's also likely that the Native Americans would still own much of the land they once did.

Don't forget that it is the Palestinians who are the original Israelite, which later converted to Christianity and Islam, as proven by Israeli genetic researcher Dr. Ashraf Ezzat and Professor Ariella Oppenheim 

Its farcical of the Zionists to dispute this, when its what all the early Zionists believed.

David Ben-Gurion made aliyah in 1906 but was in New York during World War I. He published a treatise on this very topic ""On the Origin of the Falahin"". The falahin are descendants of Jews who remained in Palestine after the Roman expulsion and who later converted to Islam:

&gt;&gt;*The greater majority and main structures of the Muslim falahin in western Eretz Israel present to us one racial strand and a whole ethnic unit, and there is no doubt that much Jewish blood flows in their veins - the blood of those Jewish farmers, ""lay persons,"" who chose in the travesty of times to abandon their faith in order to remain on their land"".* http://www.meforum.org/2001/early-zionists-and-arabs Fall 2008, pp. 67-71

And before they claim that that is the beastly propaganda of the lying antisemites, they should note that the Middle East Quarterly is a very well-funded Zionist source!

&gt;Most Jewish settlers are proven early converts only...

That looks pretty certain too - the latest and by far the best accepted work is Shlomo Sand's ""The invention of the Jewish People"", 2008.

&gt;&gt;[Shlomo Sand] suggests the diaspora was the consequence, not of the expulsion of the Hebrews from Palestine, but of proselytising across north Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East

&gt;&gt;... The smokescreen of national historiography hides an astonishing reality. From the Maccabean revolt of the mid-2nd century BC to the Bar Kokhba revolt of the 2nd century AD, Judaism was the most actively proselytising religion. 

&gt;&gt;The Judeo-Hellenic Hasmoneans forcibly converted the Idumeans of southern Judea and the Itureans of Galilee and incorporated them into the people of Israel. Judaism spread across the Middle East and round the Mediterranean. 

&gt;&gt;The 1st century AD saw the emergence in modern Kurdistan of the Jewish kingdom of Adiabene, just one of many that converted. http://mondediplo.com/2008/09/07israel

The only non-pagan date in the Christian calendar is Easter which gets its timing from Passover. However, much of the imagery, aside from the cross used for Easter is decidedly European Pagan.  

Much of Christianity is cultural now, especially here in Europe, and it is an irony that one of Christianity's contributions to European (Pagan) culture is to preserve and popularise its festivals across the world, despite early European Christianity's bloodthirsty attempts to eradicate them.  

I think that's a valid point for debate in itself. What a famously jealous God makes of His followers frolicking in such a pagan-influenced way is another interesting topic.

,,WritingPrompts,1426245125,False,t3_2kys9z,28,False,t1_clpvpqh,0,,28,"Waking up at 2 in the afternoon was routine. William found himself slacking in more ways than you would imagine your average college student would. Slumping off of his elevated dorm bed, his feet greeted by one of the many piles of dirty clothing littering his side of the dorm, he would presume to get ready for the day. 

Last night was like many other for William. Long, dragging, and fueled by adderall with the occasional few bumps from his room mates cocaine stash. 

It was not only until later into the day that he logged onto his campus grading site to review the marks for his essay he labored for all through the night. Astonished, he immediately noticed  the 95 percent grade given by his political science teacher, Dr. Cole. Not because he did not believe in his abilities as a writer, though his grades did not show it he was adamant about this ability much above his ability in exams, but because of the teachers reputations to never give any mark over a 90 percent for any paper. William had never heard of or thought to look up professor rating websites. Along with this high mark was a notification in the comment section of the report. An apparently amazed Dr. Cole wrote of its in depth evaluation on our current socio-economic state and its hindsight into a query into human natures ability to forgo the mischief of political practice and an eventual progression to humanist politics. 

To fast forward, Williams paper is published with no will of his own but at the doing of his professor Dr. Cole with Williams hesitant yes to do so. But he was firm in keeping his real name of off the report. This happened to be around the time of the ongoing race for the 2018 election. Candidate Vermin Supreme, who was gaining much popularity through out the nation, was a graduate of Bull Shit University and knew Dr. Cole quiet well. One thing leads to another and Sir Supreme begins to use this, now ""manifesto"", into his political platform.

Vermin Supreme wins the 2018 presidential election by a staggeringly large majority, known mostly because of his platform based on humanist ideologies in all aspects of reform. 

The UN summit on international treaty agreements of 2019 would go down in history. President Supreme, proudly brandishing his boot on his head, lead a speech that would have put Chaplin's historic ""The Great Dictator"" Speech in shame. Heard around the world leaders had to respond positively to this ideology do the public outcry, not only that but Vermin's subtle and non verbal threats of destruction to those who opposed him. (Along with humanist views, Vermin was an advocate of quadrupling the U.S. military power) 

It soon became initiated world wide. Canada first to jump in on this doctrine of peace, the slavics, eventually all of Europe, until the first world was completely absolved in peace. Even the middle east religious hate zone was instantly abolished. The leaders of ISIS and other such organizations sent out video statements on its newfound love of its enemies. 

Parts of Africa slowly became growing and powerful economic states. The lack of corrupt governments and there unfair sanctions allowed for companies to invest more so into individual states for production and consumer purposes. 

Everything seemed to turn over to another beautiful development of peace and worldly development. The U.S. media was even reporting on the world in a more factual and positive way, since that was a reflection of the new world it was reporting on. 

It was another late night for William. More adderall and cocaine. Writing a paper for his ""bullshit"" economics class. Going on with his self destructive routine with little knowledge, or even care for that matter, of his influence on a global scale. No name to give credit to Vermin's policy was taken into his own credit and was given much eternal glory and sunshine beach parties forever. As William wakes up again around 2 to begin another round of his seemingly endless and mentally painful personal hell. 

Note: First time I've ever done one of these. Just a student who has, almost ironically, snorted quiet a bit of addarall himself tonight and was looking for a medium to burn off some of this energy. Rip it apart with criticism. I like to write but have no experience especially in the fictional so have at it i could use the critiques. Thanks!

I actually took the time to read through your story and it appears that you went into Judo with the wrong mindset the first time around. Judo takes time to understand and the philosophy of respect is the first step of that understanding. Respect the 'rei'. I am glad that you want to come back to Judo with the mindset of learning instead of winning. That is the right approach. I'll now answer your questions;

* A higher belt is achieved by improvement, literally. How long it takes is basically up to yourself, but there are certain regulations of in-grade time. e.g. 2 months with yellow, minimum, before you can proceed. But most knowledgeable sensei, that does not have an ego-issue, usually see past this to positively discriminate between talent. You receive the next belt-level by learning a club-decided curriculum, usually based on the Japanese ['Gokyo'](http://a3.mzstatic.com/eu/r30/Purple2/v4/e4/65/1f/e4651fc1-7a84-d663-ab60-b84aaab31503/screen568x568.jpeg) (you can google it) that is based on 5 sets of techniques of 7 each. The sets usually correspond to the belt-grade. The belts are usually as follows; white, yellow, orange, green, blue, brown. After you have completed the gokyo, it is time for a black belt. The fastest time you can achieve a black-belt is usually between 2-5 years, depending on your devotion to Judo. Many people use 10 years to achieve this. BJJ uses a completely different system, they go from white directly to blue over a 2 year period (usually). 
* When it comes to gi I recommend buying a double-weave one straight away, invest some money into it if you take Judo seriously. Mizuno is a well respected brand, but as a beginner there are probably much cheaper alternatives that are on par in quality.
* When it comes to technique you will eventually find your own Judo, it just takes time and practice. I recommend focusing on the basics like stances, walking, break-falling and movement. In time true skill will come. Just follow your sensei's instructions and the gokyo.

The gokyo and belt system is a great way of setting up goals. Your first goal should be knowing the fundamentals of walking patterns, break-falling to all sides, the 6 stances (out of shizen-tai and jigo-tai). And ultimately the first set of the gokyo for yellow belt. Good luck!",False,0,Ryvai,1414842053,t3_2kynoi,0,clpwcef,t5_2qkzy

The main turning point in the civil war was during the Ukrainian siege of Donetsk when a large number of forces crossed the Russian border and attacked Mariupol. This is one of the biggest interventions by Russia as it is seen as a desperate attempt to not let the rebels lose Donetsk. Around this time reports of Russian soldiers on the ground also reached their peak.

But besides that, there is really nothing the EU can do, they have given  money to Ukraine but apart from that not much else. Common Foreign and Security Policy is not an attribute of the Commission but of the European Council so there you need to have 28 heads of state or government agree - sometimes with unanimity, sometimes with consensus - about a course of action. 

And even if all agree the most they can do is send military equipment and more money, because the EU does not have an armed force to help. 

So then we go to NATO which could feasibly do it but you would have to think of the implications. People often forget that even though Russia may not be economically strong they still have the largest nuclear arsenal and most western leaders don't want to go back to a cold-war type era over the situation in Ukraine. 

It's a sad and frustrating truth, I know, but let's not let passion cloud rational judgement. The EU is pursuing a diplomatic solution but the complexity of the situation makes it a lengthy process, there are hidden desires on both sides, the separatists are not a unitary group and the implementation of a peace process will be lengthy and difficult.

I was part of group that does living history, specifically the Roman Empire, even more specifically Legio V Macedonica.   There was about..15 of us heavies, a few scouts and a centurion marching through a clearing in the woods. We were in a double line, just practicing field maneuvers. 

Then from the tree line, this tiny red cylinder flies at us, lands sort of in the middle of our line and goes ""BANG"". This..thing wearing a pointy hat with some glitter and a few stars on it and a bath robe appears. ""I killed you all! My fireball got you! All of you! Dead! Ha ha ha ha!"". 

We all kind of look at each other. We all seem fine. Not dead. 

We have scutum, gladii, and a few javelins each. There's one of him, 15 of us. The centurion is pissed. 

""Unum Ordinem Facite!""

""Pila Tollite!""

There's a faint ""Hey what are you doing! I killed you all! stop moving!"" heard. We don't care. There's a barbarian, and we're going to kill him and all his barbarian friends with their horrible looking 'armor' and swords. Nor do we care for his barbarian gods and barbarian magic. 

""Pila Iacite!"" and the javelins fly. The apparition had already disappeared though, shouting about 'Geems' or some other barbaric nonsense. Also he mentioned cheating, as though war has rules. Our quickest scout popped out of the woods about 1 minute later, reported a whole camp just inside the woods. 

""Gladios Destringite "" and the swords come out.  

""Impetum Facite"" and we move out to attack. 

And there, just inside the tree line is an earth wall. Well more of a berm really. With a gate. But theres only one wall..so more like a line of piled up earth with a gate in it. Ok not so much a gate but a gap...the other sides of the encampment were surrounded with rope. A single rope, it wasn't a barricade or anything. And, maybe bravely, maybe stupidly, near the encampment stands a single barbarian. Holding out his hand, likely imploring us to stop. Our charge knocked him to the ground. The rope is no impediment. Barbarians scramble for their tents with shouts of fear. 

We commence a sack of the camp (we took all the beer that we could find). From time to time a barbarian would stick his head out to see what was going on. Finally one of the braver ones asked 'are you guys playing too?' which was gruffly answered 'do we look like we're playing!'. 

Moral of the story is that Eastern European reenactors really get into the spirit of things at times =).

* Not a whole lot of gingers, mostly average to tall, about 1.80m and taller, I'd say. Odd question to think on, lol.

2.

* Russia - Depends on who you're asking. Almost half the population is Russian, but sometimes it feels like us Latvians are in the minority. I don't have a lot of Russian friends, but from what I gather, the Russians in Latvia mostly feel neutral towards Putin. There's always the odd nutjob who will go off in public about Putin being the best, but it's mostly chill. Latvians are almost all strongly anti-Russia, but we're still a bit scared. There's quite a lot of trade tied to our neighbor, so it's not just being afraid of Russia pulling Ukraine on us, but it's also being afraid of fucking up the relations, because it hurts us economically. I really admire what Estonians are doing.

* America - I suppose you mean the USA. A lot of people still view it as the land of the free. People who don't frequent Reddit generally don't know *anything* about American internal politics. What I think, personally, would require a lot of typing, but in short - I wish I could visit the USA without getting my ass probed because I look like I might be middle eastern. As for you Canadians - you're cool. As for South America - most people don't give a shit, I find it interesting and would love to visit.

* Religion is kinda - eh, whatever. Not a lot of crazies. Most people, I'd call agnostic.

* I'd have to dig up actual facts about which politicians/ex-politicans/oligarchs own which media outlet, but generally, even though the media is free, the news are rubbish. Especially national news. Very biased. Same faces over and over again, same promises. 

* Elsewhere - kind of a broad topic. Elsewhere in Europe? On the world? 

3.

*  Don't stay in Riga, if you're here for a few days, take 2-3 of them and go explore the rest of Latvia. Stay in a guest house, go to a sauna, enjoy the food. Beware of potholes. When are you planning to visit? I'd suggest you choose late spring or summer. In Riga - exploring the Old Town doesn't take more than a day. It's quite small. Same goes for the rest of the center. You can fit it all in a day or two. I'd strongly suggest visiting Āgenskalns, it's only about 10-15 minutes from the center, has great wooden architecture and a small town feel to it. Definitely my favorite neighborhood. If you want to see how most people live, go to Imanta or Purvciems. LOTS of block apartment buildings.

Al igual que lo que tenemos ahora no es ni siquiera capitalismo.
Es FINANCIALISMO.
El súmmum de las doctrinas ""liberales"" (han pervertido hasta esta -en su origen- digna palabra) predicadas por San Milton Friedman, entre otras lindezas, con su ""doctrina del shock"".
Y esta abracadabrante engaño se empezó a perpetrar y poner en práctica en los años 80, bajo la égida de un mal actor de serie Z, palurdo donde los haya además y una acomplejada sádica. En efecto, me refiero a Ronald Reagan y Margaret Thatcher.
Fueron ellos los que empezaron la sistemática demolición del Contrato Social y de la clase media. A las pruebas me remito.
Son los que sacaron de la botella al genio de los sacrosantos ""mercados"", que ni en época de los fisiócratas del ""laissez faire, lassiez passer"" han campado por sus respetos tan a sus anchas, y tan encantados de haberse conocido.
La ""globalización"" defendida incluso por gente supuestamente de izquierdas como Glez., no ha sido sino otra parte de la Gran Mentira, de esta Gran Estafa, puesto que lo que se ha globalizado no ha sido sino el movimiento sin control de capitales y la extensión de la esclavitud.
Al igual que el otro perverso mensaje de la casta de tontos útiles del capital financiero a nivel mundial: el mal llamado ""estado de bienestar"".
NO ES bienestar en el sentido de que NO ES ni caridad ni servicios que se nos proporcionan ""gratuitamente"". JAMÁS lo han sido puesto que SIEMPRE hemos pagado por ellos a través de nuestros impuestos.
Otra cosa es la gestión que de ese dinero, que es nuestro, hayan hecho los tontos útiles del Financialismo imperante.
Esto es indecente e indigno. El Darwinismo Social que están implantando esta gentuza a nivel mundial (insisto, esto es una pandemia, no exclusiva de España y ni siquiera exclusiva de la Unión Europea comandada por la monja arrepentida de Mrs. Merkel) es la negación absoluta de todo aquello que nos ha hecho progresar como seres humanos desde las épocas oscuras de la Edad Media.
Hay que desmantelar de inmediato las falacias una y mil veces repetidas por los profetas de San Milton Friedman y acólitos, y volver a instaurar un capitalismo social, que en un momento dado se llamó socialdemocracia, un capitalismo justo, que garantice la igualdad de oportunidades para todo el mundo, y al que todos colaboren según sus posibilidades. Hay que volver al buen y viejo capitalismo y no a esta salvajada inhumana e inmunda que, entre otras cosas, premia la oleada de corrupción que estamos viviendo en España, puesto que lo que predica no es sino el enriquecimiento fácil y rápido, sea cual sea el medio empleado para ello, aun cuando eso incluya estafar al ciudadano.
Y ya veremos si llegamos a tiempo antes del próximo Armageddon Financiero, que está a la vuelta de la esquina según algunos economistas como, por ejemplo, Juan Laborda.
De hacerse efectivas sus predicciones, el crash del 29 va a parecer una fiesta de cumpleaños.
Porque efectivamente, los ricos sin obscenamente, absurdamente ricos, y cada día más, pero hagámonos una pregunta: ¿cuánto dinero de verdad, del que vale para comprar pan, leche, y huevos tiene en realidad esta gente? ¿Cuánta de su riqueza está invertida en acciones de compañías a todas luces supersobrevaloradas en los mercados de acciones? ¿Cuánta de su riqueza está en derivados que no son sino apuestas -literalmente- sobre el comportamiento del precio de determinadas cosas a futuro? El problema no es tanto que en realidad, cuando esto estalle, vamos a ver que no son tan ricos como lo parecían, sino que su caída nos arrastre a todos los demás, puesto que el efecto dominó de que el humo de su supuesto dinero se disipe nos arrastrará en mayor o menos medida a todas las sociedades occidentales. Y ya veremos si el descalabro es de tal magnitud que incluso el papel moneda llegue a perder su valor.
Por no hablar de la más que probable implosión de la propia Unión Europea (ni que decir tiene del Euro) por su propia cortedad de miras, ya que ésta hoy en día no trabaja para los ciudadanos europeos, sino para las oligarquías y las castas financialistas.
O se derrumbará por su propio peso como el castillo de naipes que es, o alguien le dará a Mrs. Merkel un puñetazo encima de la mesa. Y ese alguien será el menos indicado, ante la ausencia de arrestos de todos los demás para hacerlo: ese alguien será el fascismo que ya creíamos olvidado, revivido por Marine Le Pen o Nigel Farage, por poner un ejemplo.
Aún estamos a tiempo. Pero no sabemos cuánto tiempo nos queda.
Más nos vale ponernos manos a la obra.

&gt;

&gt;The __Children's Crusade__ is the name given to a disastrous [Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade) by European Christians to expel Muslims from the [Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land) said to have taken place in 1212. The traditional narrative is probably conflated from some factual and mythical notions of the period including visions by a French or German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the [Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land) to Christianity, bands of children marching to Italy, and children being sold into slavery.

&gt;A study published in 1977 casts doubt on the existence of these events, and many historians came to believe that they were not (or not primarily) children but multiple bands of ""wandering poor"" in Germany and France, some of whom tried to reach the Holy Land and others who never intended to do so. Early versions of events, of which there are many variations told over the centuries, are largely [apocryphal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocryphal). [*[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)*]

Le mariage au rabais existe déjà, c'est le PACS, et à l'étage en dessous, le concubinage aussi à un régime légal. Faire confiance au législateur pour élaborer une législation efficace, je ne dis pas que ce n'est pas insensé, mais c'est quand même la base de notre système de démocratie représentative. Je ne pense pas que ce risque existe, au contraire, utiliser un outil ad hoc sera toujours plus utile que de s’agréger à une institution préexistante. 


Non c'est pas une opinion. C'est bel et bien un argument. Pour faire un enfant il faut un spermatozoïde et un ovule, nous avons tous un père et une mère. On vit pas dans un conte de fée, on a tous des parcours différents, et parfois ça marche bien et  parfois ça ne marche pas, mais à la base, c'est ainsi que fonctionne la nature animale de l'homme. Avoir deux parents de sexes différents, c'est donc la norme, c'est la situation par défaut, et c'est parce qu'elle est naturelle, la meilleure, un enfant à besoin d'un père et d'une mère, on en a pas tous, et c'est regrettable, ça fait pas de ceux qui n'en ont pas eu des être inférieurs, mais je crois que ce manque d'un parent cause des peines qu'on devrait éviter et ne pas encourager, même si ça veut dire qu'on ne devrait pas faciliter l'adoption et la GPA pour des couples homosexuels. Si certaines personnes plus dramatiques que moi parlent de changement de civilisation, c'est parce qu'on autorise le droit positif à aller à l'encontre du droit naturel, il y a une violence infligée à l'encontre de l'enfant à naître - une privation de chance en somme - qui a été privé de la possibilité d'avoir deux parents de sexe différents parce qu'on a mit en avant le désir de parents homosexuels d'avoir des enfants.


Sur le troisième points je ne suis pas d'accord. Cette égalitarisme n'est pas vu défavorablement par une grande majorité des partisans socialistes. Il est même encouragé. Le mariage homosexuel, l'élargissement du droit de vote aux élections locales, et beaucoup de conceptions plus générales sur les frontières, les nations, les religions s'inscrivent dans un universalisme socialiste où l'on conçoit l'homme comme un être universel, or moi j'ai une approche différente, comme Foucault, je ne conçois pas l'homme hors de son contexte ethnique et géographique. Là où je t'avouerais que je me contredis un peu, c'est que j'utilise un universalisme quand je parle de droit naturel, et que je critique l'universalisme quand je critique le concept d'homme universel dans ce dernier paragraphe.

Out of a military perspective (keeping mind that this is a counterinsurgency conflict), both the American and Soviet way of waging war against insurgents was hopeless. The differences were small. While the brunt of the Vietnam War was waged by search and destroy missions in which platoon sized units combed through South Vietnam in search of insurgents on foot, the 40th Soviet Army was mechanized and while it did partake in the same sort of sweeps, it was commonly done by convoys (in particular when it comes to the major operations which far more resembled a conventional offensive than anything that would have been appropriate for the conflict they fought in). Both nations used overwhelming firepower to annihilate their enemy. They were still bound to a very conventional way of thinking and focused entirely on killing enemies instead of putting more weight into other areas that should have been focused on, such as the civilian population.

Despite the very determined and stubborn view in popular culture of the American soldier mistreating a South Vietnamese civilian in a remote hamlet, the policy of the Soviets in Afghanistan towards the civilian rural population makes the US pale in comparison. While the US did partake in resettlement operations (such as the case of the infamous Iron Triangle), they did have a plan more consistent with counterinsurgency strategies but which was carried out poorly by the South Vietnamese government. The Soviets, on the other hand, carried out a strategy of depopulating the civilian population from rural areas and forcing them to resettle elsewhere. The way they did this was by using brute force. The countryside was torn apart by artillery and helicopters and while this did make it more difficult for the insurgents to hide and to uphold a good base of logistics, it not only brutalized the population but firmly turned it against the Soviets.

There were some attempts by both sides to establish a government hold where there was none, but also to create self-defense forces which would be loyal to the government and protect individual villages against insurgents. While both nations tried out the latter with varied results, the former was either not carried out at all or attempted, but never expanded (like the Marine CAP or the attempts to establish a nucleus in Afghan villages). Perhaps the closest thing the Soviet had to creating a seen and present presence among civilians were the, for the ordinary Soviet conscript, dreaded *zastavas* guard posts which were scattered among important supply lines, cities and other locations of strategic worth. Even though the garrison of a guard post might have contact with the Afghan population and remain rather neutral toward each other, the nature of the *zastavas* were, in the end, conventional and was not part of a larger attempt to create a government presence in rural Afghanistan.

Both the Vietnam War and the Soviet-Afghan War was waged by a nation prepared to fight on the plains of Europe and was now waging a war in a far-away place without knowing how-to and resorting to the only sort of warfare they were prepared for: conventional warfare. It was the mindset of focusing on annihilating the enemy with superior firepower instead of trying to combine that with trying to win over the population and reforming the actual political and economical institutions that led to both their defeats. In the American and Soviet case, there were some adaptations to the particular conflict which made it easier for them to engage the enemy on their terms, but this meant very little when you only focused on the military aspect of it. In the case of Afghanistan, the insurgents were fighting against actual reforms carried out by the communist government and that made it even harder for the Soviets to convince them to get on their side - not that they put much effort in trying to convince them in the first place.

You ask me the question ""how much of the territory they fought for was under their control?"". Territory doesn't matter in counterinsurgency. A conventional mindset would put great importance on winning territory and while it is important to hold onto strategic locations like bridges, major cities and supply lines - the focus was never on gaining territory beyond that of the realm of mind. Winning hearts and minds is the way to win a counterinsurgency conflict and while both the US and Soviet Union were aware of this, their armed forces and political leadership neither had the will or the knowledge to carry this through.

&gt;

&gt;___De Re Militari___ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) ""Concerning Military Matters""), also ___Epitoma Rei Militaris___, is a treatise by the [late Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Latin) writer [Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Flavius_Vegetius_Renatus) about [Roman warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_warfare) and military principles as a presentation of methods and practices in use during the height of Rome's power, and responsible for that power. The extant text dates to the 5th century.

&gt;Vegetius emphasized things such as [training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_training) of soldiers as a disciplined force, orderly [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy), maintenance of [supply lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_lines) and [logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics), quality leadership and use of [tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics) and even deceit to ensure advantage over the opposition. He was concerned about selection of good soldiers and recommended hard training of at least four months before the soldier was accepted into the ranks. The leader of the army (*dux* or duke) had to take care of the men under his command and keep himself informed about the movements of the enemy to gain advantage in the battle.

&gt;*De Re Militari* became a military guide in the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages). Even after the introduction of [gunpowder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder) to Europe, it was carried by general officers and their staffs as a field guide to methods. Friends and subordinates customarily presented embellished copies as gifts to leaders. It went on into the 18th and 19th centuries as a source of policy and strategy to the major states of Europe. In that sense *De Re Militari* is a projection of Roman civilization into modern times and a continuation of its influence on its cultural descendants.

Is merely being born in the west an offense against God? Is being born in a time and place where there are few wars and strong institutions that make growth and maintenance of wealth relatively easy compared to history?

We are wealthy largely because we have a well-established rule of law, low rates of corruption, open and healthy markets, wide distribution of information, and relative peace in our lands.

Now you can contrast this with the posts I've reposted from the priest serving a mission in Nigeria. They lack a rule of law. Corruption is everywhere. Their markets are sick and malfunctioning. And Islam &amp; gangs brings violence to their lands. Of all the things that are important for growth of wealth, they only have access to information because they have increasing access to the internet and because literacy rates have improved vastly over the past generation. But they lack all other metrics.

If a man is poor not because another is rich but because his own people have not yet embraced social mechanisms that are necessary for economic growth, is that a man enjoys the wealth of a common westerner an offense to God?

&gt;estate tax of 5.3 million dollars

It is obvious you are not in business. Many businesses have high capital requirements, high cost of operation, and low profit margins. A lot of family farms are worth more than 5.3 million because of the cost of land and equipment. When mom &amp; dad die, they pass the farm on to their son or daughter who maybe (maybe) net, after expenses, a middle-class income from their work. But because of the estate tax, they lose the farm or have to sell off a large portion to pay the estate taxes. 

A similar thing happened to a historic African American newspaper in Chicago that served the underserved. The estate tax killed their business because the building and equipment were shown to have too much value even though extracting large levels of revenue from the building and equipment was almost impossible given the business climate for traditional newspaper publishing.

Your article that linked to ""tax subsidies"" actually was about tax cuts. There is no necessary connection between tax revenue and government spending for nations that print and control their own money supply. You might benefit from reading MMT economist Stephanie Kelton. If the US wants to double their welfare spending, they can without raising a dime in taxes -- and they can deficit spend virtually forever. The reason why we wouldn't double welfare spending is if it created perverse incentives and damaged the social institutions.

But subsidies do have a place, even for millionaires. For example, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has secured a lot of subsidies for his business of developing and manufacturing all-electric cars. If having widespread use of all-electric cars and a lower rate of gasoline-fueled cars is a social and economic good that is unlikely to be achieved except by subsidies during the development and establishment phases of business development, then subsidies may be warranted and be considered a social and economic good.

And we can also go back to the family farm. Farm subsidies are established for farmers to NOT farm all their land which is used to create price stability and the maintenance of excess slack that can be used rather rapidly in the case of a national crisis. Without the excess slack, prices would be lower and farmers would be unable to rapidly change their production patterns, lacking the slack and capital necessary to do so.

&gt;depreciated employee wages 

Middle income wages are weaker now than they were 30 or 35 years ago. But that isn't the full story. The full story looks at household income and not individual income. That's because we are social beings and what happens to the size of our family or our spouse income affects us significantly.

Since the invention of oral contraceptives, there has been large demographic changes in the west (and really everywhere). From 1970 to today the family size has shrunk and more and more women have entered the workforce. Thus the average middle-income household has **more** income power than they did 30 years ago.

Growth in inequality is almost entirely due to the same effect. It has been true in modern times that women typically marry men who are as educated or more educated then themselves. There is partner-selection bias built in to marrying patterns. In 1950 very few women worked and those who did were usually women whose husbands were on the low-end of the income scale. They worked because families needed the wife's income to buy food and keep the one car running.

But then women entered the workforce. Women at the low-end of the economic scale were already working. So the women who entered the workforce were, on average, more educated than the women already there -- and had husbands who made more money.

If you compare average incomes from two high school graduates and compare it to a married couple with undergraduate degrees and then compare to a married couple with PhD's, you will see that the addition of women to the workforce itself produces greater economic inequality.

If wages were really stagnant, you wouldn't see the [growth in middle-class consumption](http://cafehayek.com/2014/10/middle-class-consumption.html) we've seen.

See, you've got to scratch below the headlines and see what the data really says. For example, the popular story about CEO's making some figure massively larger than their employees -- that is only true in the companies in the Fortune 500 index. The average CEO actually makes somewhere between $140k and $160k depending on whose data you are using. The phenomenon is known as the ""long tale"" effect. The very top get paid very well (CEO's, baseball players, artists, etc.) and the rest have are likely to have very average incomes. Heck, you see the same effect in ice cream selection: Well over 50% of the ice cream market is vanilla. The rest of the flavors have to ""fight"" over the rest of the market. That vanilla is so popular is not an affront to Moose Tracks and that Bill Gates did so much better than my programmer brother-in-law is not an affront to him as a programmer.

We can debate taxes and economic programs -- both can be legitimate and both can be perverse, depending on how they are structured -- but your ""headline-level"" analysis of the facts does nothing but hurt those who are interested in a serious discussion of the issues at hand.",False,0,mbevks,1414847884,t1_clplo5r,0,clpxg0r,t5_2qi4f

Absolutely do it now because legislation can change anytime, but once you have the citizenship they can't just revoke it. 

If the Lithuanian experience is similar to the Irish one, it will require contacting the town council where your grandparents were born and asking them for a copy of their birth certificate — they'll mail you a new, modern one. You'll also need to get marriage records, birth certificates and death certificates (if applicable) of your grandparents, mother and yourself. 

Plan to wade through a bureaucratic mess for a couple years, but it's absolutely do-able and the cheapest and best way to live abroad that I know of. EU citizenship = you can live anywhere in the EU and get a job without worrying about a visa.

For Ireland, the end of the process was receiving a ""Certificate of Foreign Birth"" — NOT getting a passport. Next you'll have to use that form to apply for your passport.

Because modern science is highly specialized there are multiple types of education with different levels of specialization. There are multiple stages in a university career: Bachelor, Master and Phd. 

In general a bachelor is quite broad. for instance: when you study Physics (in the Netherlands) you get electronics, fluid dynamics, calculus, linear algebra, solid state physics just to name a few. You finish your bachelor by passing tests and sometimes by writing a bachelor thesis. Most bachelors are three years. 

When you continue with your master you start to specialize more. To continue with the physics example, you could choose to do a master which goes mainly into solid state physics and material science for instance. A master's degree is always finished by writing a master thesis. In Europe almost all bachelor students continue on for a master. Masters are usually 1 or 2 years. 

After your master you can choose to go to work or continue with a phd. A phd is an additional study where you are trained to become a scientist. You basically do research under the supervision of a professor in a research group. Research groups are often highly specialized, a few examples: Non-linear optics or Reversed-Osmosis membranes are research group topics. Your phd is finished by writing a phd thesis which is a collection of multiple articles written during your time as a phd student. Generally a phd takes 4 years. After which most phd students continue to work at a university as a researcher and/or lecturer.

But OK - let's see.

American values in 99% ARE western values. Idividualism over collectivism. Freedom of speech over censorship. Separation of religion and state. Democracy over absolutism.

The few values that differ on the surface (consumerism, capitalism over socialism, gun law) aren't inherently different in Europe either - see Switzerland for gun law, EE for capitalism, the whole world for consumerism. All of these are in Europe just in different countries. USA would fit as a regular country in western Europe culturaly, it isn't more different than Spain from Norway.

USA was founded by Europeans and it really shows.

And anyway - what you call propaganda is just entertainment. Hollywoood, Rock and roll and rap isn't financed by government, it's just American culture. By that logic Manga and Anime is Japanese propaganda, Harry Potter is English propaganda and Don Quichote and Flamenco is Spanish propaganda.

People choosing capitalism over alternatives is just common sense - see for yourself how countries that choosen ""communism"" did. Even China switched in everything except name.

Generally, women's fabrics are more expensive because they're expected to buy silks and cashmere that make them look nice, and feel good to the touch.

Generally a man should figure out what level of formality is appropriate and dress within one. If he's in a conservative industry, he should match exactly. Work clothes and play clothes come out of the same uniform list.

Women are different in that they have two fundementally different paths, with sub paths, each of which has different connotations. Shirts and jeans are basically similar with the caveat that women's fashion changes styles a lot faster than men's, and it is more acceptable for a man to wear a cut that is out of style.

When you reach suits, women must choose between a pant-suit, a pencil-skirt suit, and a dress. A pant-suit will make her look the most competent, but many will find her humorless and stern. A pencil-skirt suit is the safest bet, and makes her look dull. A dress will make people like her personality better, but think she's incompetent, and too feminine to do her job. 

This is a particularly treacherous choice for women who hold political office, as they're just going to get made fun of no matter what they wear, since all three have some negative connotations.

Also worth noting is that this is only true of work. When it comes to play, women are more constrained. It is not socially acceptable for a woman to wear a tuxedo. She is expected to wear a dress. Similarly, in white tie events, even female heads of state wear dresses instead of tailcoats.",False,0,zhirzzh,1414850600,t1_clpxnez,0,clpy5l4,t5_2t5sa

Before the 14th century Spain was divided into several kingdoms that were too busy fighting the moors in Granada to worry about Portugal especially since we were allies at the time.        
Then in the 14th century there was a succession crisis when the king died and Spain invaded but, together with our English allies we defeated them (search about the battle of Aljubarrota on wikipedia).   
        
After that both Spain and Portugal started creating their colonial empires in Africa and the Americas and we got filthy rich thanks to the spice commerce we did with the rest of Europe and the other resources from the colonies. So we were both too busy with the colonies to go to war.           
           
In the 16th century we had another succession crisis and the Spanish king also became the king of Portugal by defeating the other suitors. We were under Spanish rule for about 60 years but Spain got into a mess in Europe fighting the 30 years war and we used that opportunity to overthrow the Spanish king and regain our independence. We fought a war with Spain for a couple of years, and since they were already strained from the 30 years war, eventually they agreed to peace.      
           
After that there were some centuries of peace and Spain invaded again under orders from Napoleon in the 19th century. The royal family escaped to Brazil, which as still a colony and part of the kingdom at the time, and ruled from there. Once again with the help of our English allies we defeated the Spanish and French armies and after that Spain didn't really attack us again.       
        
There were some plans drafted during WW2 where Franco would go to Hitler's side and with Hitler's help annex Portugal but that never came to be. And then again in 1975 after the Carnation revolution where Spain proposed to the US the annexation of Portugal if the Communist party reached power but that also never came to be.

,,worldnews,1426243625,False,t3_2kx0oc,7,False,t1_clpyxi8,0,,7,"For the average person this is bad news in general but good news in some specific ways.


This will mean that it is cheaper to borrow Swedish Kroner (SEK) and that it when you save deposits of SEK you get a lower return. 

For the average person this means that saving money in a bank account does not generate much of a return. In fact, when you take into account inflation it will likely turn out that people are losing money by saving it in an account (you might get 1% interest, but lose 2% of value to inflation). So the average person thinks ""I'm losing the money sitting in my current account anyway so maybe I'll buy that extra [hat, coat, food, car, dildo, whatever] after all"". So there is a boost in or (in Sweden's case) a continuation of consumer spending. This helps firms because they do more trade. 

But there are downsides to low deposit rates. 

Lets say you operate a large company with considerable amounts of SEK lying around. Maybe you're a pension company. Why would you keep all that money in a Swedish currency and get terrible interest rates? You could convert it to a different currency where the interest rates are higher (like GBP), get a better deposit rate, then convert the money back to SEK when you need to spend it in Sweden. Hey presto, you just made some cash for doing nothing! So you and every other treasury guy start thinking about swapping out of SEK for a little while. 
But wait. There are a lot of smart people in the world and a lot of these people ended up in international finance because we have broken career incentives for smart graduates. Somewhere there is a currency trader who looks at the situation and says to himself ""If these guys convert out of SEK now and back into it later, I'm going to get screwed. But I can work out what SEK/GBP exchange rate means that they can't get a free lunch."" So he/she/it works this out and it implies that the SEK should actually lose some value. So it does. 
Back to the average person:
So now the SEK is lower in value, this means that the cost of imports has gone up (because your 1 SEK doesn't go as far as it used to). So the prices of imported good has increased, which increases the cost of living which *should* lead to an increase in inflation.
But lets not forget that for people buying Swedish exports this means that they can buy more of them, because the Euro or GBP or whatever goes further in Sweden now. So this boosts exporting businesses. 

Your average person is trapped here. Prices are going up, but at the same time they're not getting any benefit from just sitting on their cash. Where this really gets tricky is pensions. This person wants to save for their retirement so they put money in the pension company. The pension company invests this money in several things, one of which is bonds. Bonds are where a private individual lends a company, or government or some other bond issuing entity money. But the basis cost of borrowing money just dropped to zero. So now the bond issuer doesn't offer such good bond rates, because it's cheaper to get a bank loan. The pension company knows this so they try to look for alternative ways to make money. In the market we call call this ""chasing yield"". So the pension company looks at investing more in stocks, more in distressed debt, more in real estate, whatever. This then means that money floods into markets that it wouldn't normally go. 

Lets take real estate. Who owns all the properties that aren't owned by the people to occupy them? Landlords, right? But who owns these landlords? If you chase these things up then you realise that a large chunk of the world we occupy is indirectly owned by pension companies, insurance firms, trusts, sovereign wealth funds, banks and all sorts of institutions that are investing on behalf of regular people (on a side note I feel like this is one of the best parts of the capitalist system - it's also one of the most horribly and depressingly broken). So these investment companies are now pumping cash into the real estate market so the prices of real estate go up and the returns go down. We're seeing this effect now across Europe. The prices of real estate in western Europe is getting embarrassingly high, and looks set to continue while rates stay low.  
Just to be clear on something here, people will say that these increases in property prices will be driven by cheaper mortgages and loans on commercial assets. These loans are the banks way of investing in real estate. A loan secured on real estate is effectively the bank taking ownership of part of the asset in return for a fixed return and a priority on payment. 

So your asset prices go up and it becomes more expensive to buy a home. This is bad. 


The people who do well here are borrowers, and people who already own assets (like shares and real estate). But this got away from me and I'm too tired to go on right now. ",False,0,monkeyspanner,1414853107,t1_clpn16e,0,clpyxi8,t5_2qh13

2. Juncker is OK for the job, qualified - but a man of the past. He started as minister in 1982 when he was 28 years. He left after almost 19 years as prime minister in Luxembourg. He is experienced and flexible - but not the Obama type leader who will lead the Europeans to sustainable development. On the opposite, he chose the oil industry for his climate policy and two austerity hardliners to lead Moscovici.

 We have seen CAP reforms - but not enough. We should get rid of the many subsidies, costly for consumers and tax payers, of no value for farmers since subsidies are normally capitalized as higher prices for the farms.

Berätta, med motivering vilka etniska grupper som ska undantas från vilka regler och varför.  Sen berätt hur du ska införa det.  

Självklart ska de bötfällas och kastas ut från Sverige för att *lagen* säger att EU- medborgare är ansvariga för sin egen försörjning i andra länder. Springer de omkring och tigger så kan de ju inte det. Och det säger *lagen*. Eller menar du att a) vi inte ska följa EU-lagstiftningen? B) vissa grupper ska slippa följa lagen i Sverige och att alltså utlänningar inte behöver följa svenska lagar och regler. Gäller det då alla lagar och alla utlänningar? Berätta gärna i detalj, extremt noggrant hur din etniska indelning ser ut och motiveras.  Samt- hur du ska få igenom den på EU-nivå.

,,education,1426243381,False,t3_2kyrku,2,False,t1_clpzgb1,0,,2,"If you're going to a public school, it is going to depend on the town you live in.  Schools vary a great deal, depending on the wealth of the area.

VERY GENERALLY:

School calendar begins between mid-August through early Sept. and ends in early June.

The day is usually around 7 hours long.  If your school is on a ""block schedule"" then your week may have 3 courses on MW and 3 courses on T-TH for about 90 minutes each.  On Friday, you would have 45 minute sessions of all six classes. If you're on a traditional schedule, you would have all 6 classes every day for about 50 minutes per day.  

Your lunch time will be painfully short (as I understand it from a European perspective).

You may also be assigned to a ""study hall"" period - just a block of time where you're supposed to be reading/doing homework.  I don't know if that happens much any more though.

Costs should be fairly low.  Public schooling is paid for through taxation.  You may have some fees related to elective classes you take (art, photography, etc) and if you do any extracurricular activities such as playing on a sports team, there will be costs.  You would have to pay for your general supplies like notebooks, pens, pencils, a computer.  

Classes are often categorized by difficulty.  You could take ""honors"" classes if you are academically talented and want to follow a college prep pathway.  You can take [""Advanced Placement"" \(AP\)](http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/home) courses that are supposed to offer you the equivalent college-level rigor in History, Biology, Chemistry etc.  In order to earn college credit for them, you have to pass an end of course test.  

Some schools also offer the [Inter baccalaureate](http://www.ibo.org/) program which is supposed to mirror the higher expectations that exist in European secondary schools.

On the other hand, if you're not especially talented or motivated, you would take the ""regular"" course.  In some schools though, you may not actually have much of a choice because there is an overwhelming expectation that kids prepare and go to college right now.

Core subjects to take include: math (basic/functional, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, statistics); science (earth science, chemistry, biology, physics), foreign language (Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, American Sign Language, Latin); English literature (American, World, British, and varieties there of); social studies (American, European, world history, geography, American government); and computer applications.

Then there are electives which run all over the place: music, drama, art, creative writing, ethnic studies, business/entrepreneurship, etc.

The course offerings are entirely dependent on the wealth and demographics of your community.  Wealthier communities can afford to have their students take a broad range of classes; poorer communities cannot.  So in a wealthy suburb of Seattle, WA you may see computer programming and Mandarin Chinese as possible classes, whereas in rural Louisiana the focus is going to be on providing the core subjects.

This is the standard, public school scenario.  There are many other options a young person could choose: [charter schools](http://eagleridgehigh.com/newsite/index.html), [private schools](http://www.kinkaid.org/page.cfm?p=283), [online schools](http://www.k12.com/cava/curriculum/high-school#.VFT3s_nF98E), [magnet schools](http://www.wyoung.org/).

&gt; ""Only last month, a senior Tory strategist was listing the characteristics of Ukip voters: older people, who left school aged 15, who apparently agree with the statement ‘I hardly recognise the country I’m living in any more.’ The Conservatives should listen to such voters, he said, even respect them. But their demands should not be heeded. They represent the past; the modern Tories should be interested in the future.""

But the truth is quite the opposite. The Tories are completely focussed on UKIP voters, to the exclusion of all else. Whenever UKIP gets a blip in the polls, or wins a by-election, you can guarantee that Cameron will be on the news the next day, promising to send home the migrants, give the EU the finger, turn back the tides... whatever he thinks UKIP supporters want to hear.

I could perfectly well imagine myself voting for moderate Conservatives such as Ken Clarke, but this small-minded, xenophobic, little-Englandism turns my stomach. There's no way Cameron will get my vote while he's frothing at the mouth, trying to out-Farage Farage.

Every time Cameron tries to ape UKIP's ludicrous policies, he simply validates them in the minds of the waverers. The Tories seem hell-bent on becoming UKIP-lite. Well if that's all they are, why not vote for the real thing, eh?

There was a tentative reset. He answered it by invading Ukraine with his army then try to annexe it.

Which it's not. Russia's only property is the russian federation, and maybe a bit of the *stans. Not the European countries.

&gt; The other point to keep in mind is that the Iraq war was a big slap in the face of Russia.

Irak was a mistake, i agree; and the western european opinion (except for UK) is well known on the subject (""frenchs are coward and traitors"" anyone ?). But using it as an excuse to annexate ukraine is like if i were using WWII as an excuse to justify going in russia proper and declare it baltic or finnish territory. That's bonkers.

Ironically, we might have to come back in iraq, not as invaders this time but to help prop the country (sunnis included.) against the totally insane daesh death cult (isis)

&gt; a wake up moment for Putin in which he realised that the West couldn't care less about Russia's interests.

Or, that he could grab a bit of Ukraine in the momentum and getting away with it. Problem is, the guy doesn't know where to stop so he keeps pushing further and further within ukrainian territory and sooner or later it's going to blow in his face one way or another. What russia doesn't get is that the fact we don't actually want to just kill them all to the last and be done with it is pretty much the only reason they're tiny separatist fiefdom still exist. And they thinks it's a ""surrender"". retards.

About the russians interests, they're a great power. They have a seat at the UNSC table. But that doesn't mean they have a right to decide EU or US internal policy. That's our own damn business. And if they go in our countries with tanks because they decided our policies doesn't please them, it's called war; then we'll have trouble giving a crap about what an invading country that try to kill us after that wants from us. We should have glassed them away in ukraine, not even negociate. Yet we did, because we try being *nice* with them and not cause another bloodbath. Now see where that's leading us.

As the saying goes, *such is life*; or using an american saying, *deal with it*. And not by killing large numbers of your most heavily armed neighbors as a tantrum that will only get you sooner or later open, full, all hands out war with NATO in the end as they keep pushing in.

Western Europe probably. Eastern Europe so-so. US probably not. Asia ties with Israel are growing (India-Israel relations are sky rocketing). Muslim world strategic ties are growing. Oceania ties are growing. Rest of the world doesn't have much involvment in the Middle East either way.

This has been said by US officials going back decades and in fact the US has sided against Israel when it has been in US interests to do so, it is nothing new. Not only is your analysis of the comment incorrect, the actual idea presented is incorrect, I'll give a guess as to which middle easternnation spends the most on lobbying the US.

Hint: It's not Israel. 

The UAE and Saudi Arabia spend several times more on lobbying the US than Israel does. (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2014/05/14/which-foreign-countries-spent-the-most-to-influence-u-s-politics/)

Israel doesn't have an official lobby - Israel is supported by the US because Israel has immense support from the American people.

,,Futurology,1426243082,False,t3_2kz5s3,17,False,t1_clq03eh,0,,17,"A perennial optimist when it comes to technology, he argues that all that will change. Rapid improvements in artificial intelligence, for instance, will make computers and robots adept at most jobs. Given the chance to give up work, nine out of 10 people “wouldn’t want to be doing what they’re doing today”.

What of people who might regret losing their work? Once jobs have been rendered obsolete by technology, there is no point wasting time hankering after them, says Page. “The idea that everyone should slavishly work so they do something inefficiently so they keep their job – that just doesn’t make any sense to me. That can’t be the right answer.”

He sees another boon in the effect that technology will have on the prices of many everyday goods and services. A massive deflation is coming: “Even if there’s going to be a disruption on people’s jobs, in the short term that’s likely to be made up by the decreasing cost of things we need, which I think is really important and not being talked about.”

New technologies will make businesses not 10 per cent, but 10 times more efficient, he says. Provided that flows through into lower prices: “I think the things you want to live a comfortable life could get much, much, much cheaper.”

Collapsing house prices could be another part of this equation. Even more than technology, he puts this down to policy changes needed to make land more readily available for construction. Rather than exceeding $1m, there’s no reason why the median home in Palo Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, shouldn’t cost $50,000, he says.

For many, the thought of upheavals like this in their personal economics might seem pie in the sky – not to mention highly disturbing. The prospect of millions of jobs being rendered obsolete, private-home values collapsing and the prices of everyday goods going into a deflationary spiral hardly sounds like a recipe for nirvana. But in a capitalist system, he suggests, the elimination of inefficiency through technology has to be pursued to its logical conclusion.

“You can’t wish away these things from happening, they are going to happen,” says Page. “You’re going to have some very amazing capabilities in the economy. When we have computers that can do more and more jobs, it’s going to change how we think about work. There’s no way around that. You can’t wish it away.”

. . .

When it comes to discussing policy, Page, like many technocrats, quickly sounds frustrated by the intractability of issues that are not susceptible to the kind of rigour he brings to his technological inquiries. “I do think there’s a tremendous amount of angst about these things and we’ve got to turn it round,” he says, though he has few concrete ideas about how to do that. “As a society, it’s very difficult to do something differently, and I don’t think that’s good.

“Some of the most fundamental questions which people are not thinking about, there’s the question of how do we organise people, how do we motivate people,” he says. “It’s a really interesting problem, how do we organise our democracies? If you look at satisfaction in the US, it’s not going up, it’s going down. That’s pretty worrying.”

In a reference to what he sees as Europe’s weak support for entrepreneurialism and technology, he adds: “I think many of the problems in Europe are like that.”

Another obstacle lies closer to home. In reaching for the tech industry’s ultimate prizes, Google may already be knocking up against the limits of what it is possible for one company to do. Page relates a frequent debate that he says he had with Steve Jobs, the boss of Apple, who died three years ago: “He would always tell me, You’re doing too much stuff. I’d be like, You’re not doing enough stuff.”

The argument he made to Jobs: “It’s unsatisfying to have all these people, and we have all these billions we should be investing to make people’s lives better. If we just do the same things we did before and don’t do something new, it seems like a crime to me.”

But the idealism does not blind him to the problem of his own ambition. “What Steve said is right – you, Larry, can only manage so many things.” If he – and Google – are to win, they will have to beat the odds that have held big companies back in the past, particularly in the tech industry, where few leaders from one generation of technology have made it big in the next.

Larry Page, chief executive officer and co-founder of Google listens to questions from the audience during the keynote at the Google I/O developers conference at Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco, California, USA, 15 May 2013
‘Sometimes it’s important to wake up and stop dreaming. When a really great dream shows up, grab it’ — 2009
“The biggest companies are all within an order of magnitude of the same size, certainly in market cap,” says Page, who has a palpable sense of the limits against which his company is already pushing. “You say we’re going to take over all these important things, but there’s no example of a company doing that.”

His thinking about how to break through the invisible ceiling seems to have been evolving of late. Google X, the internal lab that was the brainchild of Brin, marked a first attempt to back big new ideas, with projects such as Glass and the driverless car. Despite Brin stepping back from Google’s main business, Page still describes them as close allies. “We spent a lot of time together . . . there are very few people who share that experience,” he says. Of Brin’s constant agitation to reach for the biggest bets, he adds: “He’s always on the more extreme side, which is important.”

Now, moving beyond X, Page is experimenting with setting up freestanding business units with semi-independent leaders charged with building big new businesses under the wing of Google. Besides Calico, Google has revealed in recent days that these will include the “smart home” division Nest, as well as a new unit comprising its investments in internet access and energy. Google has also quickly emerged in the past two years as the biggest venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.

There is no model for the kind of company Google wants to become, says Page. But if there’s a single person who represents many of the qualities he thinks will be needed for the task ahead, then it’s famed investor Warren Buffett.

Sounding not at all like the idealistic young technologist who once spoke of brain implants that would answer questions by the power of thought, he says: “One thing we’re doing is providing long-term, patient capital.”

He is at an age where he can still afford to take the long view. But with an ambition that shows few bounds, patience may be another matter.",False,0,mrprint,1414856390,t1_clq03aj,0,clq03eh,t5_2t7no

I must highlight the difference between a report and a statement. Statements can be done without any serious backing, reports can also be done without serious backing, but its far more difficult to do so and you can easily notice when reports that are bullshit.

Although it's undeniable that a country becoming independent brings a huge deal of uncertainty, its also undeniable that:

1) Scotland is a great prospect for an independent country, that in the long run has a great chance of becoming fairly successful.

2) The UK government will do what it cans in order to lower the uncertainty. Not doing so will be shooting itself,not in the leg, but in the heart.

Did you see how the FTSE 100 dropped because of all the uncertainty that the referendum caused? If they have unveiled their plans for the case of a ""yes"" vote, it would have suffered much less.  Now, imagine, what will happen in case of another referendum in which they constantly say a yes vote equals an economic fallout and the yes wins. They have two choices. 

1) Try to fuck Scotland. Scotland won't like getting fucked, so the uncertainty won't drop, since you have one side saying A and another side saying B. This would be terrible poisonous for investors. The DAX has been growing lately, they almost merged with NYSE, and it is likely it will eventually surpass the FTSE. If the FTSE really suffers in the case of a yes vote, it will only speed up the process and at the end of it, London would have seen its financial square seriously crippled.

2) Doing whatever its possible in order to reduce uncertainty. That will mean: Buisness as usual during the year between the referendum and independence. A year in which they will likely agree to several things like: Scotland keep trident and its share of the debt, Scotland's keep the pound for a while and the UK don't tries to avoid Scotland joining the EU,etc.

Tl;dr: Scotland would face uncertainty, but the only way it faces an economic minefield would be if the UK deliberately tries to fuck Scotland. The UK is unlikely to try to fuck Scotland, since if they do, they will have their own economic minefield.

Of course, an explanation of the geopolitical situation and the history of the entire region in less than 5 sentences is not going to hold up a high academic standard, nor provide all the answers to this expansion. To assume I was entirely serious and giving my fullest thought on the matter is to be standing on airfield tarmac and not hearing the airplane engines.

 But to say, as Chomsky does, that it was only at the behest and push of the NATO, that it continued to expand is absolutely ludicrous and ignores the political wishes and will of the people involved. I can attest to you that the people of the Baltic and Eastern Europe wished to join NATO. It existed not out of fear of USSR that ceased to exist but the political games there were to continue. The Russian Federation that emerged was piloted by the same men, the crew was the same, except the stickers on the outside had changed. Privatization is a funny thing - its the ones in the right place at the right time that win. Those usually being of high political power and influence to begin with. A man feeds himself. One only needs to look at the military and political fall out of the collapse to see reasons for the continued existence of NATO. Furthermore, what NATO was in its original period of creation 40s/50s/60s it was not in the 90s. Organisation change and NATO is a very organic institution, that ensured its own survival. Furthermore, it was a valuable asset for providing stability and peace between its members, as no NATO member states have been at open conflict with one another. That same cannot be said about Warsaw Pact.

I don't want to shun any prepper, it's great when (especially) youngsters want to learn survival skills and such, but one event made me very sceptical of 'hardcore survivalists'. In my country, when I was younger, it was a standard to have first aid courses and checks every few months at school. It starts in year 1, when you're 7. I was also with the scouts, which in my country are part of the army and get called up to the front lines during wars, even the young ones. So as  soon as you join, even at 7-10 years old, they have trainings. Durning summer you go hardcore survival camping with them. These days it's gone, but it was present before we joined the EU. So I had some stable skills for all sorts of emergencies. When I moved to another country and went for a survival weekend event for young people, I was amazed at how many of them depended on equipmnent (and tacky outfits which were pretty useless). All I took with me was a basic backpack, while some of the kids had bags twice their sizes, and dragged a tent. Me and my team had some troubles here and there, and I don't mean to brag, but... honestly, if I didn't know some of the stuff I did, it would have been very difficult 3 days. 

So while gear surely is a great advantage to have available, make sure that you mastered the most important skills so that you can do them efortlessly. Go beyond the basics, learn to work with your enviroment, not only for nature settings but have ideas for every setting. You never know when you'll loose your gear.

They're derivative of and restricted to the otaku subculture which, while highly visible on the internet, is not nearly as prevalent in Japan as people like to believe.

Like feudal households in Europe, Japan's feudal elite had numerous domestic servants to take care of the necessities of life. Merchants, too, would often have servants to deal with things, in addition to the free labor provided by the brutal, almost servant-like apprenticeship system then in place. 

I honestly don't think any of that has anything to do with the ""Meido"" fetish, though. To me, that comes from two sources. One, the Meiji-era fascination with all things western and the conscious desire of the Japanese elite to pattern all parts of their existence on the model of contemporary European nobility. This meant the importation of the particular outfit for their servants, which became an enduring cultural icon ([an icon which endures in the West, as well](https://www.google.com/search?q=french+maid+halloween+costume)). Two, the the growing obsession with kawaii and moe in postwar anime/otaku culture, a sociological phenomenon that deserves whole books. The icon gets subsumed into the fetish, and a new subculture is born. It also has intersections with a [separate fashion movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_fashion) developing around the same time, patterned on the same late-19th-century historical moment of exchange between Japan and Europe. IMO the whole ""meido"" thing comes from these sources way more than any domestic tradition of domestic workers.

I don't think this is political correctness or tolerance. I'd say it's closer to a sort of fear. Actively engaging against these activities could be a way to spiral the situation out of control. These actions (or lack of actions) seem far more a mistake of fear and weakness than political correctness and tolerance. If the fight is one that they think they cannot win, then it only makes sense not to fight it. I'm not justifying these actions, but I don't think this is political correctness or tolerance. Nobody think it's politically correct to not prosecute rape, or to allow terrorist organizations to recruit. The only reason to not fight them is out of fear of loss.   

&gt; the Elitism I describe is more of a society that points out and punishes flaws in the thinking or actions of people compared to the one of now   

This is counter-intuitive to advancement. If you lock people down within a certain set of thinking, the ability to have creative and interesting thought will be limited. Massive advancements don't come from the good, average person; massive advancements usually come from lunatic geniuses. No great thinker is accepted or not laughed about until after he's already become rich or successful. Your ""elitism"" is actually quite average, and puts a rather large damper on us. In fact, it also cuts us back on quite a bit of room for debate, argument, and critical thinking skills when choosing personal life philosophies and whatnot. When these choices are laid out before us forcibly, we either accept them without thinking (and thus becoming shit-for-brains), or we (the more intelligent people) will probably get pissed about this force and may possibly become extremist.

The people moved below frantically, as if to say we are here for you John, but you sadly have already proclaimed your separation from us. John felt isolated and excluded from the community at large and furthermore, the world. 

""Can a universe really control an entire species to act against one single man? What the hell have I done that's so offensive?"" John pondered.

It seemed the trouble that besought him 3 months prior had only increased from then. Sleeping aids only served as a reminder the the sleep had finished; alcohol only drowned the weakest emotions he hardly ever felt to begin with; and to dabble with any stronger would be a sign that someone was actually wrong with his life. But was it so?

""I told her I wanted to pay with debit. Who the fuck really thinks it would be appropriate to grimace like a baffoon expecting conversation?"" John's ruminating only intensified the rapid puzzling together of the insane pieces, which lead to only one conclusion -- the entire world was against him.

Wasn't it clear to the Jews that the concentration camps were for them at one point? Does not abused not fear for it's own safety up until the point of contact? It had reached that point for John and his mind, while wildly racing, seemed to continuously end up and one peculiar thought, that this world was not peace loving, it was not humane; the rights of a fellow global citizen was being stripped and conformity was but one of his choices, the other...a global avoidance.

""Run!"" John uttered. ""But to where?"" He paused a moment staring at the television remote. As he turned the news station on, he flipped to the national news channel (NNC). 

""And in other news"" a chipper anchor read eagerly, ""John Doe has 16 hours left before world officials begin an official washing search.

Correct.

From the OP article:

&gt; Residents of New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. can get 500-megabit connections thanks to Verizon (VZ, Tech30), though they come at a cost of $300 a month.
&gt; 
&gt; There are a few cities in the U.S. where you can find 1000-megabit connections. Chattanooga, Tenn., and Lafayette, La. have community-owned fiber networks, and Google (GOOGL, Tech30) has deployed a fiber network in Kansas City. High-speed Internet users in Chattanooga and Kansas City pay $70, while in Lafayette, it's $110. 


&gt;&gt; Even our urban areas have worse and more expensive internet than other countries?!

Now you've changed your claim. Your first claim is about speed. The second claim is about ""quality"" (you do not define ""worse"") and cost.

These are all separate items.

,,WritingPrompts,1426242573,False,t3_2kw7ih,2,False,t1_clq16nl,0,,2,"The problem is that with Hitler and his clique in power you **can't** eliminate the attempt to restore Germany to pre-WW1 greatness and cancel the push eastwards for Lebensraum. Those were not his own ideas mind you - they were ideas of German imperialists during the Kaiser regime. Notice that the lands Hitler demanded were nothing but German lands under Wilhelm and Franz Josef. The rest was just pure conquest.
You can imagine Hitler ditching the whole Jew nonsense (although it's hard to imagine because of nazi logic) but if you are to have a nationalistic ideology ruling Germany then you have to be honest about what it means. Germans might have lived in a hundred of states but they had a pretty good idea about what *being German* meant - even though there were plenty of people who despised Hitler in Germany. So Austria would have to go. With Austria within Germany Sudetenland which was mostly Germans who attempted reunification with Austria during and after treaty of Trianon would have to go. Then the ""historically German"" lands in the Polish corridor to integrate East Prussia and Danzig/Gdansk. Then Lorraine and Alsace but that required war with France. At this point Germany would stop reforming but might want to start expanding because of the whole ""Lebensraum"" nonsense.

But at this moment they pissed off a number of countries most notably Poland and France who had alliance aimed directly at Germany. That this alliance would necessarily be revealed as toothless was besides the point. There was an alliance and because of that there was an imminent threat of war between Germany and France. Because of that Britain had absolutely no choice but to support France. Because of that the United States gets involved in any war which threatens Britain. So the only way for WW2 to even try to occur differently would be for Poland to surrender to Hitler and become a German satellite state like Hungary or Slovakia or Romania. I don't see that happening and I think history gave us good evidence that the Poles would rather die than be subjugated again. If Hitler was more of a standard imperialistic fellow (like those 20 years before him who sent Pilsudski to help rally Poles to German cause for the price of an autonomous Polish land within the German empire - something like Kingdom of Bavaria etc) without other notions then perhaps... perhaps there would be a chance. One in a hundred. But not like that.

But let's say the impossible happens - that would also imply certain changes in the East. Because most likely with Poland by his side France would be more cautious to openly become hostile because Britain would have a good excuse to push for neutrality (see, the Poles like it!) and France alone would sit still .. or start talking to Stalin.  If they do then WW2 is repeated all because the French are shitting their pants and getting aggressive whenever they're not the biggest and the baddest dog on the block.  If they don't somehow - or Stalin doesn't trust them - then Germany invading Russia in 1941 might be a whole different Germany from the one which did it in history. Most importantly they probably don't start away with wiping the population off but incorporate them as second class citizens (or first class citizens in the Baltics) into the Reich). That means Ukraine turns German, Baltics turn German and most likely Belarus turns either German or Polish (which is German in this scenario). That's some 40-50 million people turning sides. It also means that Germans have working infrastructure with helpful population aiding in their advance. That results in the fall of Moscow in 1942, the collapse of Stalin, Soviets being pushed back to the Wolga line which most likely becomes the new border at which point Germans are too stretched already and agree to Peace. They have more land than they know what to do with it.

As for the unlikely case that Germany doesn't attack the USSR... well I don't know if you are aware of that but Stalin had his own plans for invasion of Germany and Europe. So while Germany is bogged down in the West Stalin enters Poland and starts to ""liberate"" Europe from German fascism. He most likely doesn't stop until Paris or so. Europe turns communist.

Invasion of Britain was entirely possible and actually quite likely if German ever had plans for doing that.  They simply didn't. If you want to invade Britain what you do is - first don't mess up Dunquerque because that allowed the brits to reclaim their whole trained military force, then you entangle RAF as in the battle of Britain, you block and entangle RN with uboats and just send small invasion fleets across the channel. Not one huge invasion - small detachments. Paratroopers. Britain had absolutely no land forces at the time. They'd be literally defending themselves with pitchforks and hunting rifles.

It is a matter of countries wanting to protect and preserve themselves... solving their OWN future problems, but for all those destructive practices they require to maintain their current ways of life (logging, intensive agriculture, heavy livestock grazing, etc), they ship that demand off to other less developed (and consequently more environmentally sensitive) parts of the world... where you are essentially having a country making their problems, someone else's problems (cause they have the money to do it).

That is the issue we see here in THIS case of Amazonian deforestation. Firstly the biggest contributor to deforestation is landclearing for pasture to graze cattle. Brazil is the largest exporter of beef in the world now, shipping to over 130 countries. It is Brazil's role as a beef producing powerhouse (at the detriment to its rainforests), along with a world that is more than willing to BUY this beef, which is contributing MOST now to deforestation. Remember, you need two to tango... a seller and a buyer. If countries who import this Brazillian beef only realized the destructive power consuming this beef actually HAD (and discontinued buying it), we could go a *far* way to reducing deforestation in the Amazon. 

Furthermore, as I have said elsewhere in this thread, landclearing for organic soybean farming is next on the list for major causes of deforestation in the Amazon... with that export mostly going to the EU, since, for the most part, the EU refuses to consume the American GM soybean product. That seemingly irrational fear of GM soybeans seems like an unjustifiable reason to import product from a country whose destructive farming practices are so so harmful to the sensitive Amazonian rainforest ecosystem.  

If only we could convince countries who heavily consume Brazillian soybeans and beef to reduce or eliminate that import, we could make LEAPS and BOUNDS of progress as far as slowing the rate of destruction of the rainforest. Unfortunately, I never hear people talk about eliminating deforestation in these terms. Thankfully, as far as this front goes, the US is well ahead of the curve, being that they import nearly zero soybeans or cattle from Brazil. The key should be to try to achieve a more self-sustainable country, rather than exporting all that demand to ecologically sensitive parts of the world in a NIMBY type style of not wanting those unattractive industries 'unprettying' *your* particular country.

Princip failing to take the opportunity to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

As a result:

 - The First World War never happens. 17 million casualties averted.
 - Germany still has a strong government (rather than the weak and ineffectual government thrust upon them by the Treaty of Versailles) and hence is better able to cope with the Great Depression.
 - As a direct result of this, Hitler is unable to rise to power. Instead, he's relegated to the sidelines of history as a one of the insane ultra-rightwing nut jobs who always come out of the woodwork when things are slightly tough and is forgotten about as soon as things improve.
 - As a result of this, the Second World War never happens. 60 million or so casualties averted.
 - A direct consequence of this is the Holocaust never happens and the Allies never find themselves liberating a whole bunch of concentration and death camps. This has a huge impact on Western culture.
   - Why's that? Simple. Anti-semitism (and for that matter outright racism towards pretty much any culture other than your own) wasn't considered particularly unusual or wrong in the 1930s-40s. A huge driver to change that was seeing up close the final, logical conclusion of such attitudes which was widely documented by the Allies as we liberated the Nazi concentration camps.
 - Germany is in a much stronger position to halt the spread of communism - it never winds up being split into East and West Germany.
 - The attack on Pearl Harbor probably still takes place - while it was the pivotal moment that brought the Americans into World War 2, it was partly driven by events that had little to do with what was going on in Europe at the time. But this time there isn't a World War 2 to get involved in, so instead the attack on Pearl Harbor precipitates a war between America and Japan with little outside involvement.
 - The Americans don't have an atom bomb - WWII was the main driver for its development, so without that going on it never gets developed. Hiroshima and Nagasaki therefore do not get blown to pieces. Tsutomu Yamaguchi never has a particularly interesting story to tell his grandchildren.
 - Rather than being forced to surrender, the war in Japan ends in an uneasy truce when it becomes clear that neither side is prepared to back down and the Americans feel they have made their point. This is interesting because arguably one of the things that helped drive Japan to become the technical powerhouse it is today is losing the war. But that never happens.

In Uruguay, president Mujica talks shit about the US sometimes, but 99.9% of the time (that I hear about it) it's related to consumerism/human rights such as Guantanamo/lack of action on global warming/failure of the US drug war. 

From what I've heard, when he talks about the drug war it's not blaming any of Uruguay's problems on the US, it's more along the lines of ""Your idea is clearly not working, so we have a better plan and fuck you if you disagree with it"".

November 1, 2014

SOURCE: PANDO DAILY

Ukraine just held its first post-revolution parliamentary elections, and amid all of the oligarchs, EU enthusiasts, neo-Nazis, nepotism babies, and death squad commanders, there is one newly-elected parliamentarian’s name that stands out for her connection to Silicon Valley: Svitlana Zalishchuk, from the billionaire president’s Poroshenko Bloc party.

Zalishchuk was given a choice spot on the president’s party list, at number 18, ensuring her a seat in the new Rada. 

And she owes her rise to power to another oligarch besides Ukraine’s president — Pierre Omidyar, whose funding with USAID helped topple the previous government. Zalishchuk’s pro-Maidan revolution outfits were directly funded by Omidyar.

Earlier this year, Pando exposed how eBay billionaire and Intercept publisher Pierre Omidyar co-funded with USAID Zalishchuk’s web of nongovernmental organizations — New Citizen, Chesno, Center UA. 

According to the Financial Times, New Citizen, which received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Omidyar, “played a big role in getting the [Maidan] protest up and running” in November 2013. 

Omidyar Network’s website features Zalishchuk’s photograph on its page describing its investment in New Citizen. 

Zalishchuk was brought into the NGOs by her longtime mentor, Oleh Rybachuk, a former deputy prime minster who led the last failed effort to integrate Ukraine into the EU and NATO.

This is what happened after he **was** assassinated in real life.

After being assassinated in 1914, World War I began. Europe was torn apart, millions dead. The Germans funded a revolution in Russia, and the Tsar and his family were killed. Communism gained power, and Russia became the Soviet Union. 

After Vladimir Lenin's death in 1924, Joesph Stalin gained ultimate power and took many territories, killing dozens of millions of those he deemed to be enemies of the state.
Japan built an empire in the east, taking over China, Thailand, the Philippines, Korea, and more.

Germany was upset, and Adolf Hitler came to power. After launching World War II with Italy and Japan on his side, the Holocaust began. 6 million Jews died. 10 million German and Russian soldiers died on the eastern front before Hitler's Reich finally fell.

After liberating much of the Pacific, the United States and the Soviet Union focused on Japan. The United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, ensuring its surrender. Korea was split between the United States in the south and the Soviet Union in the north. 

Stalin instilled Communist dictatorships in North Korea, China, Vietnam, and many Eastern European nations. Europe was divided, along with Germany.

Israel was formed, upsetting much of the Middle East, in a feud that has still yet to end today.

The Soviets felt threatened by the United States's nuclear arsenal, so they built some as well. Soon, the USA and the USSR were bitter enemies, and many wars between lesser nations (Korea and Vietnam) became wars only to prove a point.

The United States landed on the moon, only to show the Soviets up. The world held its breath even further as the two rival nations grew to hate each other even more.

After the UN was formed, Britain and France began to decolonize the world. India became an independent nation, along with Iraq, Algeria, South Africa, and dozens of others.

The Soviet Union invaded central Asia, taking over Afghanistan. Native Osama bin Laden was recruited by the United States government and formed a terrorist organization known as al-Qaeda.
In 1991, the USSR fell, leaving a chaotic Eurasian region. Countries fought civil wars, as nations like Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia were split up. Eastern Europe descended into chaos.

The newly liberated central Asia, and more importantly, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda turned on the United States, launching terrorist attacks that provoked United States invasion of Afghanistan and a pointless campaign to take Iraq, which didn't even have anything to do with anything, and led to the rise of ISIS.

Vladimir Putin took control of Russia, and kept it relatively imperialist. Even now, China and North Korea remain Communist, with uprisings in places like Hong Kong.

I speak Dutch, so Dutch sources would be fine for me. 

&gt;Well, I don't mean to apologise for slavery, but often slavery is looked upon with first of all contemporary perspectives, and second of all as if the Western European countries created it

I don't think anybody here would insinuate that slavery was a Western European creation. That would be silly. A contemporary perspective can have its uses, but even when trying to look at the Atlantic Slave trade in the context of its time you can make the case that it stands out in certain areas. 

If you look, for instance, at the extreme mortality rates in some colonies (provided they made it there at all), that stands in quite a stark contrast to the conditions in Europe itself. Of course another key issue is the whole racial caste aspect of this particular slave trade. And what about the fact that some of the main slave trading countries where actively trying to get rid of a caste-like system at home during the latter parts of the time period? 

&gt;Do not view Western slave trade as something outside of an ongoing system, when looking at slavetrade on a global scale we are part of it, I kind of fail to find the right English words to explain what I mean, but its about people often viewing slave trade as a purely Western thing that we are entirely to blame for. Which is incorrect.

Again, I don't think anybody here views slavery as a purely Western thing. But if we're talking about the Atlantic slave trade specifically, it's not strange to focus primarily on the Atlantic slave traders. For one thing, just because slavery was going on elsewhere doesn't excuse this particular case. And for another, like I said, there are certain aspects of the Atlantic slave trade that could certainly be said to stand out. 

&gt;if you were to look at Europe and how we've treated each other over the centuries, is way more exploitive then how we exploited a part of Africa for 4-5 centuries.

This is just meaningless. What sort of comparison would this even be? What are the criteria for such a comparison? How could we possibly quantify something like that? 

See, it's statements like that which give the impression that you're trying to play down the Atlantic slave trade, for whatever reason. 

Nobody is arguing against nuance, but changing a black and white representation to one where everything is the same shade of gray is even less accurate, and probably more dishonest. What I mean is that just because there is nuance, that doesn't mean you can't talk about this particular issue without acknowledging every other bad thing that anybody has done in the history of the world.

[1997 book](http://books.google.de/books?id=dY1Cgg8NV64C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by [this](http://unr.edu/cla/history/people/dworkin/index.html) white male oppressor.

&gt;The earlier book is a history of an unorthodox intellectual tradition that is both specific to Britain and part of a more general twentieth-century European development--Western Marxism.   British cultural Marxism has been responsible for launching the interdisciplinary field of cultural studies, whose impact on the social sciences and the humanities has been felt internationally, and it has been pivotal to the development of peoples’ history or “history from below” and the “new social history.” 

&gt;The scope of Class Struggles is wider than Cultural Marxism, but it explores many of the same intellectual themes, carrying the story up to the present as well as returning to the historical origins of “class” in the writings of Marx and Max Weber.  The book focuses on the role of “class” in critiques of social history and the rise of cultural history in scholarly work pertaining to Britain, France, India, Ireland, Latin America, and the United States.  It also discusses work in a range of disciplines outside of history: cultural studies, literary theory, philosophy, political theory, sociology, philosophy, and political theory.  The book’s title has a double meaning.  It refers to a central concept in Marx’s understanding of history--class struggle--while suggesting that it is the concept, rather than what it seeks to describe, that is doing the struggling. The overall argument is that the displacement of class as a master category of explanation and the breakup of social and labor history’s hegemony have made it possible to reconfigure class in new and innovative ways.",False,0,patriarkydontreal,1414861088,t1_clq1s0f,0,clq203j,t5_3441a

Most of the states have payments around the same percentage of their GNI as a consequence of how the EU is funded: for the most part, a subscription based on the size of the GNI of the state relative to the EU's total GNI. The UK receives a substantial rebate, two thirds of its net contribution. That automatically shuffles everyone up a smidgen and the UK down substantially. 

That leaves an explanation due for why Greece is at the too and Sweden second bottom. Well, Sweden gets three rebates. One, capping the contribution to the UK's rebate. Two, as a reduced VAT call rate I.e. they pay around 0.15% of Their VAT tax take to the EU in comparison to the usual 0.3%. Three, they receive a lump sum repayment of few hundred million EUR. This applies to The Netherlands too. Germany and Austria receive only the first two rebates. 

That explains why some are lower than others. The remainder of that probably arises from difference in tax take for VAT based on relative consumer spendings and the VAT rate. 

But why are some countries much higher? I'm going to speculate and guess that its because they're small countries with very large ports, relatively.

Europeans had a powerful cultural prohibition against the enslavement of other Christians, and ""slavery"" as we think of it today was only possible once non-christian, racially distinct groups of people became available for sale.  

Your sources are likely confusing an institution known as *indentured servitude* with slavery; under this system, Europeans were brought to the colonies free of charge, and in return signed on to labor for someone else for a set period of time.  This was a coercive labor system, in that once someone agree to an indenture contract they could not back out, and the ""masters"" of these ""servants"" had considerable power over them - but the servants were bound *by contract* rather than for life, and they retained most of the other rights and privileges of legal persons.  ""Slavery"" in this context means something quite different; slaves were treated as property, rather than persons, they were slaves for life, and there were basically no limits on masters' power over them.

I've seen lots of people argue that indenture was sometimes *like* slavery in that it was obviously an exploitive and harsh system of providing and controlling labor - and there's certainly some truth to that.  But there many very important differences between indenture and slavery in the Americas, so it's very important to use the proper term when you talk about these things.  Describing indentured servants as ""slaves,"" in other words, risks conflating two completely different things.  You won't find any respected/reputable historians who are willing to refer to the ""servants"" of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as ""slaves,"" because the experiences and legal status of indentured servants was fundamentally different from and can't really be compared to that of slaves.

Share with others, so you can all get over whatever pre-conceived notions you have about each other's countries and cultures. Realize that 99% of people on the planet are looking for the same thing - enough money to live a good life, a roof over their head, food in their belly, good friends, good health, happiness, and a better future for their children. We all just approach it a little differently.

Get lost in a city where you can't understand the street signs. Get confused when a waiter tells you they're out of whatever you just ordered. Get frustrated when you can't understand why some bureaucrat isn't giving you the form you need. Get drunk on the local liquor. Eat that ""weird"" part of the animal.

Then, be amazed at yourself when you can finally give a stranger directions in the local language. Discover a new favorite food, drink, song, or artist. Participate in a local festival you'd never heard of before. Find out who you are at the core of your being, and become stronger and wiser because of it.

Maybe you'll find a place that lets you lead the life you've always felt you should be living. Maybe you'll discover it isn't for you, and you'll return back home. Either way, you'll be a different, and probably better, person from taking the chance.

However, it is an organisation that none the less retains an independence of its own - look at France's refusal to participate in Iraq.

Furthermore, NATOs abilities to protect its assets have been in recent years called into question - as the famous Article 5 itself requires a uniform YES from all member states to go ahead.

how long ‘short-term’ impacts may be expected to persist, and whether they are
likely to be significant in magnitude.** In addition, as described above, the speed of
the labour market’s adjustment may vary over time according to economic context
and other factors. Therefore the persistence and magnitude of short-term impacts is
a matter for empirical study. **The literature review in Chapter 6 considers the
empirical evidence in recent decades.**
""

And what does Chapter 6 say?...

&gt; ""**To date, there is still little evidence of any statistically significant labour market
displacement caused by EU migrants.** This could mean that EU migration has no
statistically significant displacement impacts, or that data issues have prevented
any impacts from being observed.
""

So, in theory there *might* be a *short term* effect on low skilled jobs, but nobody's yet been able to find any actual evidence for it.

I'm very well aware of the impact that geolocal distribution has on latency (it's significant, and it's worth it if you have the traffic to justify the cost), but I'm speaking from an economics perspective.

A CDN to reduce latency isn't really worth the cost until you have a significant audience in *two* very distant geographical regions (and honestly, I'm not sure I'd say that ""US and Western EU"" count, since most SLAs will give you an upper bound of 90ms latency for that link) - if most of your traffic comes from one region, you stick your origin in that region and call it a day. It's unusual to gain enough traffic from two regions far enough apart that you need geolocal distribution of your content and *don't* need origin offload.

My point isn't ""geolocal distribution is bad"", it's ""you will almost certainly need origin offload before you can justify the cost of geolocal distribution"".

I would just like to add one point for background on the reason for those comments on Native Americans and their warfare. Several scholars asserted that by and large, both Natives and immigrant Europeans completely misunderstood each other's cultures, particularly their modes of warfare. Native and European warfare affected each other, producing unique strategic and tactical considerations on the continent. Combined with the influences of converging Empires of France and Great Britain, colonists and Natives alike struggled to adapt and survive between clashing imperial powers and cultural understandings. By the late 1600s, by and large, many natives practiced what was called a ""mourning war"" by which raids were conducted to kidnap individuals to replace a lost member of their community. These could target men, women, or children and usually resulted in a measure of destruction. Correspondingly, Europeans seemed to embrace an all out destructive warfare, such as we see in the Pequot War, that decimated entire communities. This decimation seemed to Europeans warranted, as they could not fathom the raids and ""skulking"" warfare of indigenous populations. 

There is a generational aspect here as well. By the time of these ""clash of cultures,"" the sons and grandsons of European settlers suffered from similar economic, political, religious, and social breakdowns that had largely motivated them to emigrate from England in the first place. These pressures led to more racial resentments, as desire for land and economic power grew among these settlers. Combined with Native resentment over encroaching Europeans and their dismissal of old jurisdictional and legal agreements, protracted war seemed likely.

Across the continent, clashing cultures resulted in destructive European vs. Native Wars, such as King Phillip's War, the Yammasee War, and others, largely destroying a measure of cohabitation that had marked early European and native communities. As imperial wars grew in frequency, seemingly breaking out every decade, differing native groups were pushed and pulled into other power's orbit and participated in such conflicts. Their roles, to disrupt interior communities and put pressure on colonial's ability to aid their imperial masters, left a bitter memory in the minds of colonists. Correspondingly, European's harsh warfare also left bitter memories amongst native peoples.

By the time of the American Revolution then, both sides had experienced nearly a century of unremitting warfare and accompanying ideas of cultural and racial superiority that put off non-immigrant Europeans. Many remarked that American colonists held a special hatred for natives, largely bound up in this history. Added to this background is the fact that differing native groups correctly observed that victorious American colonies would end geographical restrictions on colonial encroachment, as well as economic agreements, resulting in many tribes joined the British cause. Other tribes, who saw opportunities to exact revenge or gain a better foothold over old native enemies, joined the American side. The result was a chaotic and to colonists, confusing warfare. Racial conceptions that had hardened during the colonial period did not allow them to see differing motivations, cultural values, and etc, resulting in the sentiments we see in the Declaration of Independence. 

Thus, the Declaration served to act as a propaganda piece, that leveraged old racial concepts and bitter memories, and combined with the chaotic nature of the American Revolution to produce growing support against the British Empire. We should not minimize the colonial resentment at old imperial policies of settlement restriction and now of enlisting native support for a war against his own people. All of these factors meshed together in this document and would inform American opinion for hundreds of years.

4. I'm rather bitter about Osprey, they are shaky and IMO unstable pieces of shit. Some air guys swear by them. The transition is hardly noticeable, but you quite literally haul ass from take off, so its quite the difference from a 53.

5. Recon Marines are issued silencers per mission.

6. Most radios today are line of sight and suffered terribly from terrain, like dense forests or mountain ranges. There are satellite radios that can perform well, but they are really expensive and not really used often. Within a recon fire team, there is an embedded radio operator who focuses on maintaining comm with other teams and higher headquarters. Team leaders sometimes may have a smaller radio pack, but they are limited in capability and again, issued per mission.

A educação teve um corte neste orçamento de 700 milhoes. É enorme, com certeza. Só que o pessoal esquece-se que este ano o Ministerio da Educação gastou 500M acima do orçamentado.  
Na saude, o pessoal também se esquece que quando este governo tomou posse, havia 3 mil milhões de euros de divida do sector da saude, dos quais mais de 2 mil milhões já foram pagos.  
Ora, se foram dividas aos grandes sectores da saúde, ás farmacêuticas e tal, é discutível, mas o facto é que foi pago, numa altura em que as farmacêuticas ameaçavam cortar os medicamentos ás farmácias.  
  
Eu recuso-me a ser a *mouthpiece* do governo, não o sou, porque nunca pertenci a uma jota, nunca fui associado a qualquer partido, e mantenho a minha independência. Isso permite-me ver os factos, e por exemplo a divida da saude é uma divida que é independente de ideologia, existe uma divida que tem que ser paga, e pronto.   e é um facto de que a troika quando chegou cá, disse ""ou vocês fazem isto á nossa maneira, ou não há nada para ninguém""..  
Porque o pessoal que diz que a austeridade não serviu porque apenas cortou para pagar serviço da divida, queria saber onde é que eles iriam arranjar o dinheiro para pagar juros a 10% e 15% que eram os juros da divida que teriamos se não tivéssemos pedido resgate.   
  
A não ser que caiamos na tentação de pensar que os mercados emprestavam dinheiro a 0%, o que é ridiculo, ou que poderíamos dizer unilateralmente que não pagavamos mais juros, e no dia seguinte, ir á porta dos mercados pedir mais dinheiro emprestado, e eles o fariam.  
  
Facto é que enquanto tivermos deficit, temos mais divida. Querem deixar de depender dos caprichos do mercado? Então deixem de ter deficit. Façam um orçamento 0. Eu sou grande apologista disso. Só que não dá para cortar nas despesas para fazer um orçamento 0 sem cortar na maior fatia da despesa estatal, que são os salários e pensões.

Problem. There are many definitions of equality in politics, and truthfully no one is better than the rest. Here's two:

* Assign equally to each nation. Just like in the EU, where tiny Malta has just as much of a veto as massive Germany. Advantage small nations because the veto:population ratio is smaller there. They are 'more represented' so to speak.
* Assign equally per a set amount of the population, e.g. 1 Senator per 1,000,000 people. Advantage big nations because their greater population means they have more representatives, e.g. England in the UK.

Fascinating that you bring up the Roma. Unless there's some kerfuffle in France or wherever, they're rarely talked about in our media. The biggest race-issues over here usually involve muslims. 

From what I gather, most people's problems with the Roma come from their nomadic lifestyle conflicting with modern society. They're an insular, deeply religious group of people, and they never stay anywhere long enough for locals to get friendly with them (or, for them to have to get friendly with the locals). 

Also, wherever a Roma caravan settles, reports of increased instances of theft and pick-pocketing usually follow.

It's a poor fit for the polysyllabic creolized Japanese language, since each kanji can have 3 readings or more, unlike Mandarin. 

**The vast majority of Chinese characters aren't even ideograms**, they were pictogram combos with no visual meaning, used purely for their phonetic values. To top it all off, those were the phonetic values of [2000 year-old Classical Chinese](http://youtu.be/__vHa_JZ_iM), which has as much relation to modern dialects as Proto-Indo-European.

The Chinese script is not a ""good ideographic script"", it is a poor phonetic script. The only reason kanji was used was because there was no indigenous alternative until the 1500s.

It's just like English spelling, which has no consistent pronunciation rules, due to three language creolization. Why can't spelling reform happen?

Because all our modern books use that spelling, and it has been culturally ingrained. Our society *bullies people who have ""poor spelling""*, which often has more consistent rules than the actual system. **""Good spelling"" has been associated with intelligence**, and the same thing has happened to Japanese and Mandarin.

In Korea and Vietnam, they have abolished Chinese characters, and are all the better for it. It did have some value for their monosyllabic languages, but Japanese is polysyllabic and thus gains no benefits from kanji.",1414868867,0,sagnessagiel,1414867152,t1_clq3s74,0,clq4o90,t5_2qh1i
