The pike and shot formations that you mentioned were starting to fall out of favour even in the Thirty Years War. 

One reason for the shift away from mixed formations of pike and musket armed infantry was the increasing prevalence of the bayonet, which could essentially turn a musketman into a pikeman with relative ease. Replacing pikemen with musketmen could thus double the firepower of any given unit without, theoretically, sacrificing their strength on the charge or when defending against cavalry.

Early bayonets were of the ""plug"" type, which meant they had to be inserted into the barrel of the musket to be used. In combat situations this essentially precluded the subsequent firing of the musket, so an order to fix bayonets would have to be given very carefully. By the end of the 17th century the socket bayonet became more reliable, and most European armies had adopted it by the early 18th. The socket configuration allowed the musket to be fired and reloaded while the bayonet was affixed, finally eliminating any benefit from having dedicated pikemen in an infantry formation. Around the turn of the century the flintlock also started to replace the matchlock as the standard mechanism on European muskets, which made them more reliable and increased their rate of fire.

The increased use of mobile battlefield artillery also started to shift the character of battles in the 17th century. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden is famous for putting mobile artillery to its first truly effective use at the Battle of Breitenfeld during the Thirty Years War, and over the next few decades this became a fairly common practice. Lighter guns, usually towed by teams of horses, could be moved relatively quickly into new positions on the battlefield. In conjunction with heavier, more static pieces these guns could help support an advance or cover a new defensive position after a retreat, and tactics had to adjust accordingly.

One result of these developments was that battles became, for a time, less decisive. It became exceedingly difficult for one army to destroy another on the field, even with the advantage of numbers, position and firepower. Take for example the battle of Ramillies during the War of Spanish Succession. The allied English-Dutch army and their French enemies each had about 60,000 men. The allies took fewer than 4,000 casualties, while the French took nearly 20,000 and were forced to retreat. But the bulk of their army survived to fight another day.

At the Battle of Blenheim in 1704, the Duke of Marlborough crushed the French army under Tallard. Out of nearly 60,000 men, the French lost more than 30,000 killed, wounded or captured. But the rest escaped, and the English and their allies lost over 12,000 men out of 50,000. Even outright victories such as this were costly for the victors.

This trend toward relative tactical indecisiveness was matched by a strategic trend toward caution among Western European armies. When even a crushing defeat left half one's army intact, capitalizing on tactical victories became increasingly difficult. That, combined with the increasing prevalence of strong fortifications made advancing deep into enemy territory a very dangerous proposition. While commanders like Prince Eugene of Savoy and Marlborough argued consistently for bolder offensives, it was a risk their governments were unwilling to take. 

As for good books covering the topic, I can recommend *The Wars of Louis XIV* by John A. Lynn as a good general survey of those conflicts. In many ways they embody the transition you're interested in, and he does a good job of giving background, and covering the political side of the wars as well as tactics and strategy.",Dreadlord_Kurgh

http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/tolstoy/wp/wp11eng.htm

Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind. Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a well known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered another one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble. **The absurd answer (that Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous.**

By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.

A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.

This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small, and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion.

In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills, is continuous.

To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all those human wills, man's mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another.

The second method is to consider the actions of some one man - a king or a commander - as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage.

Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others, or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is in itself false.

**It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation - as criticism has every right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected.**

Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.

The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.

The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling these sayings and doings ""the Revolution""; then they give a detailed biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him; tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that is why this movement took place and those are its laws.

But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.

""But every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors; every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men,"" says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch.

Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine.

The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this direction have already been made.

To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders, and ministers and propounding the historians' own reflections concerning these actions.",[deleted]

In other words, the question of whether something is racist boils down to whether it's wrong, rather than vice versa.

We can attempt to intellectualize the unintellectual, but why bother? Racism as a term was always meant as an insult to get people to shut up, not as an intellectual critique of someone's policies.

&gt;The trouble with your approach of identifying as a racist is that the agnostics and secularists of the PC religion - people you should want to win over - will be fooled into thinking that you approve of actual racism (as Auster would define it).

Leftism, like most religions, attempts to use shaming to control people's behavior. If you don't subject to their shaming they become frustrated and angry.

It's like being an atheist in late 18th century Europe. People used it as an insult back then, and intellectuals would seek to deny being atheists by calling themselves pantheists or deists. Why bother?

Leftists get high on a power trip when they see Paula Deen blubber on TV. They want you to ask for their moral approval. I don't.

This in my opinion, is Spain's biggest problem. Their emphasis on tiki-taka makes it a Midfielder's game. Sometimes, you need a decisive and clinical striker to tilt the balance.

So, even simple math was too heady for you?

&gt; I also love how you gloss over the fact that America needs foreign oil to run its economy.

My original argument is that the US is less economically dependent on trade than other countries. What developed country is NOT dependent on foreign oil?

By the way, the US is on track to be energy independent by 2030:

http://www.industryweek.com/global-economy/us-become-nearly-energy-independent-2030

This is while countries in Europe will be increasing dependent on energy from Russia, that is unless of course the US starts selling oil and gas to Europe, which *wouldn't happen in the event of some sort of trade war between Europe and the US*.

Does that make sense to you? Or is that also too heady for your diseased little mind to compute?

&gt; If you think you can just add or subtract to get total economic output then you are a true dumbass conservative troll.

That didn't make the least bit of sense.

&gt;  If you think taking away the trade imports only means economic output would drop 3.6%, I have a bridge to sell you

Trade makes up a smaller percentage of the US GDP than every other developed country except for Japan.

http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_tra_of_gdp-economy-trade-of-gdp

As I said, the US is very economically self-sufficient. The US is in a WAY better position to survive and withstand the effects of a trade war between Europe and the US than Europe is.

It means no country can compel another country to do what they don't want to do. It's the cornerstone of International Law and has been since the 17th century.

Anything ""trans-national"" like international treaties only have force if all nations agree to participate. Usually when they sign up, the treaty becomes ""law of the land"" and so the rule of law compels the nation to follow it. Any penalties for breaking a treaty must be either purely external (such as nations stop trading/having relations with you) or voluntary from within the violating nation. Treaties can not have non-voluntary internal punishments.



When China has been sued repeatedly for intellectual theft (and I'm not talking about DVD and purses, I'm talking about cars and medicine that they steal the plans to) the Chinese have refused to pay the compensation. Short of a trade embargo there is nothing else that can be done and unfortunately a trade embargo with China are considered more costly than what the recovered fines would be. 

Without an act of war, nations can not *force* a foreign government to act a particular way, they can only isolate them from contact and hope it goes away (see North Korea). Isolating China would cost billions if not trillions and since the Chinese government doesn't seem to care that they are breaking the treaties there's nothing we can do.

Edit: For example, just about every European nation has been brought before an international tribunal of some kind, and they almost always agree to whatever the ruling is even if it costs them money. They could refuse to pay, but that would mean the other European nations could start limiting trade or otherwise denying benefits of other treaties. The Queen of England herself was brought before an EU court for not converting to metric in the businesses she owns and even though no nation could *force* her to pay she paid anyway. Rule of Law and threat of isolation are the only ""power"" these trans-national groups have until we create a new kind of international law (and there's no real proposals of what to switch *to* in that regard). 

China doesn't care about the rule of law like the West does and doesn't fear isolation since that would never happen, there's no big motivation for them to follow everything they sign. ",auandi

Aircrafts altimeters use pressure to tell the pilot what altitude the aircraft is flying at, because of the constant changing conditions the altimeter can change even while the plane is sitting on the ground (this is one of the startup checks, making sure the correct pressure setting is entered).

At lower altitudes aircraft have to avoid terrain and civilian aircraft have a speed limit (200-250kts) so that pressure setting along with an up to date map and good situational awareness from the pilot means they can avoid terrain if they have the correct settings inputted and the aircraft and ATC can organise altitudes for the aircraft to fly at to avoid each other.

Flight levels occur above the point at which the highest bit of terrain can be clear by a minimum amount. In the USA that is 18000ft, in Europe that is 10000ft in most places and the UK it drops down to 4000ft, these altitudes are called transition altitudes.

Above the transition altitudes, all the aircraft fly on a standard pressure setting as they will always be clear of obstacles and only need to organise with each other, if everyone has the same setting then its much easier.

It wasn't even me who convinced them, really. A doctor that my mom works with was Jordanian and basically explained how safe and stable the country *was,* although I fear the monarchy may not last forever. (The US, Israel and Europe will do everything they can to prevent this, but I'm not convinced it will remain a Hashemite Kingdom forever.)

But they were still paranoid as fuck, and I cannot completely fault them for this. The day I landed in Jordan was the day that Gaddaffi was killed, which reinvigorated protests across the region, including Jordan. 
The war in Syria was also in its nascence, so chaos was really all around. I actually got caught up in a spontaneous protest in Amman that was both an amazingly enlightening and terrifying experience, but my parents will never hear about that one! So for my whole trip in Jordan, they were on edge. 

Then I was in Morocco last year on 9/11 when Ambassador Stevens got killed. This really frightened them and made them unnecessarily paranoid. They actually told me that I was not to leave the campus for a month (Hahaha!), but I went back to travelling the weekend after the protests blew over. 

You really just have to hammer in their head that you have a much, much higher chance of dying in a car accident than being blown to bits or stabbed to death. Hell, you're more likely to die from a stray bullet in the local city of yours than being beheaded by Ahmed and Osama. Also, be mature and straightforward when talking with them.

When it comes to a ""leading country"" I would vote for France but I don't think the EU should have a leader in the first place. 
However I think that you probably give the UK to much credit. In Brussels they couldn't care less about Cameron. When I was visiting some friend there (they work kind of for the EU) they told me that they always roll their eyes when they talk with British representatives. I don't know how true this is because I'm not a politician but this really seemed to be a common thinking in Brussels.   
In my opinion the UK hates us because a) the Pound is very strong and b) because their only working industry - the financial district - would collapse with a devaluation of the Pound. 
I don't think that the UK has a lot of power either. Even Italy (which is struggling with the crisis) has more importance in the commission than Britain. If the UK does spy on European civilians this is something that is against our civil rights.   
If the UK leaves every European would be happy and the Brits would be happy as well. 
But I think that your point could be a very important reason. I think the power should be balanced. Nobody should be a leader of Europe. That was never the idea of the Union.

There is no stability in North America, its more like everyone is out for themselves and there is no strong stable organization to handle what is going on in both the amature circute and the professional one. 

So you end up seeing these kids that are high level players in Starcraft II or in League of Legends who get picked up by shady people who want to be their managers and end up signing contracts that have no benefit to them. Sure its cool that they might make a little bit of money and it beats working minimum wage but they get exploited/taken advantage of. 

This also applies to people who have casting or writing talent/go out there to be a reporter on the floor, they get signed on by websites who don't pay them much when they could be doing more/earning more with what they have if people didn't take advantage of them.

This problem has been brought up several times, its more common in EU/on those branches. Korea is the space that has set the standard or organizations but occasionally players get shitty deals since its only 1 - 2 organizations running it all. 

Several people have talked about this issue including Husky Starcraft and still no solution has come out from companies and organizations because esports is seen as a high risk/high rewards where eventually the bubble will burst. The collapse of IPL, MLG being shit and Azubu TV showcasing this. Without significant funding/a strong company coming and trying to reform things it will stick to the standstill that it is now.

Also while I am not ignoring LCS I am not condoning it either with the choke it has over Professional League/the Amature scene. I don't like it being the end all/be all of League in the North America and EU. While I understand its their game and they can do with it as they please if they continue to have a monopoly/choke hold then pros will certainly look elsewhere to get a foothold in other regions.

In the middle ages, there was a genre known as the bestiary. To put it very briefly, the bestiary took ""facts"" about real (or believed to be real) animals and drew spiritual truths from them. These texts were far from scientific and often included mythological beasts and absurd stories about real animals. But around the 13th century, these texts began evolving into a more pseudo-scientific genre. People like Albertus Magnus (a theologian as well as one of the first great post-classical naturalists) began looking for fact in addition to truth and wrote texts similar to the bestiary which relied on observation of the natural world. These texts were fairly popular in the middle ages, and the stories were circulated widely.

 Around the 14th and 15th centuries, however, yet another genre began to emerge from the existing literature. Texts like the *Travels of John de Mandeville* cropped up, purporting to be true accounts of journeys across Europe. In some ways, travel texts mark a step backwards in terms of knowledge of the outside world, because much of their content is rooted in legend and myth. However, these texts, extremely popular as they were, would have formed much of the average 16th century English peasant's understanding of the world. 

So to sum up, the average 16th century English peasant might have thought he knew a fair amount about the outside world, but his supposed knowledge would have been rooted in works which were at the very least semi-fictitious.",hcahc

The developer wanted to have it as a point of Cherokee pride, but the government and people did not react as he hoped. This caused him to give up on the Cherokee Nation and move West. 

He did develop and impressively easy language, but it was just used as another way to acquiesce Native American culture to Europeans in an attempt to look ""civilized"" so they could try to hold off the Trail of Tears for a little longer. Americans of European descent were already saying that the ""primitives"" needed to move out of the way of Western civilization (manifest destiny and all that).

My midwife gave me information on the seriousness of the infection and the chances of babies getting infected. If I am Group B Strep positive and have no antibiotics there is a 0.5% chance of my baby getting infected. This is if there are no risk factors...wich are: baby being born before 37 weeks, me having a fever or a ruptured membrane for more that 18 hours. 
Of the 0.5% that do get infected about 2-3% die. A child dying is nothing to gamble with, I understand but if I choose not to have the antibiotics the likelihood of my child dying from this infection will increase from 0% to 0.015%. My child will have the same screening test as the ones born at a hospital so I am pretty confident in my decision.
If I would test positive (will find out next week) there are mesures I can take to minimize the infection with diet and hygiene and at my birth my midwife will perform some kind of cleansing in the birth canal to minimize it even more.
If you are interested I can send you the information via e-mail. It has references to studies within the US as well as in Europe.

A nation could obviously use that as a reason to go to war if they wanted to, but it certainly wouldn't be approved of on the international. 

Outside of the UK, which seems to be subject to far less spying by the NSA, European countries don't really have much of an offensive military capability and, UK included, wouldn't pose a serious threat to the US militarily (using conventional arms). A single carrier US group is as if not more powerful than the combined navies of all the European nations. We also have a far better logistical capability than the European nations. In short, the US has the capability to bring the fight to European soil, while European countries lack the capability to bring the fight to American soil. 

Of course the EU is an economic juggernaut, even if they are going through tough times right now. So if they wanted they could enact sanctions to seriously hurt the US economically. Unfortunately the EU can't do that without also hurting themselves in the process. Not only would the sanctions they impose on the US hurt, but the US would almost certainly have retaliatory sanctions. 

European countries may retaliate in less obvious forms though such as; dragging their feet on trade negotiations or favoring non-US based companies. But serious economic sanctions like what has heeknput in place against Iran or North Korea are simply not a possibility.

Dear Ksquared1166:

I received your communication indicating your concerns about the two National Security Agency programs that have been in the news recently. I appreciate that you took the time to write on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to respond.

First, I understand your concerns and want to point out that by law, the government cannot listen to an American's telephone calls or read their emails without a court warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause. As is described in the attachment to this letter provided by the Executive Branch, the programs that were recently disclosed have to do with information about phone calls – the kind of information that you might find on a telephone bill – in one case, and the internet communications (such as email) of non-Americans outside the United States in the other case. Both programs are subject to checks and balances, and oversight by the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary.

As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that I believe the oversight we have conducted is strong and effective and I am doing my level best to get more information declassified. Please know that it is equally frustrating to me, as it is to you, that I cannot provide more detail on the value these programs provide and the strict limitations placed on how this information is used. I take serious my responsibility to make sure intelligence programs are effective, but I work equally hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights.

These surveillance programs have proven to be very effective in identifying terrorists, their activities, and those associated with terrorist plots, and in allowing the Intelligence Community and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent numerous terrorist attacks. More information on this should be forthcoming.

· On June 18, 2003, the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) testified to the House Intelligence Committee that there have been ""over 50 potential terrorist events"" that these programs helped prevent.

· While the specific uses of these surveillance programs remain largely classified, I have reviewed the classified testimony and reports from the Executive Branch that describe in detail how this surveillance has stopped attacks.

· Two examples where these surveillance programs were used to prevent terrorist attacks were: (1) the attempted bombing of the New York City subway system in September 2009 by Najibullah Zazi and his co-conspirators; and (2) the attempted attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in October 2009 by U.S. citizen David Headley and his associates.

· Regarding the planned bombing of the New York City subway system, the NSA has determined that in early September of 2009, while monitoring the activities of Al Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan, NSA noted contact from an individual in the U.S. that the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based Najibullah Zazi. The U.S. Intelligence Community, including the FBI and NSA, worked in concert to determine his relationship with Al Qaeda, as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links. The FBI tracked Zazi as he traveled to New York to meet with co-conspirators, where they were planning to conduct a terrorist attack using hydrogen peroxide bombs placed in backpacks. Zazi and his co-conspirators were subsequently arrested. Zazi eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the NYC subway system.

· Regarding terrorist David Headley, he was also involved in the planning and reconnaissance of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India that killed 166 people, including six Americans. According to NSA, in October 2009, Headley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistani citizen, was arrested by the FBI as he tried to depart from Chicago O'Hare airport on a trip to Europe. Headley was charged with material support to terrorism based on his involvement in the planning and reconnaissance of the hotel attack in Mumbai 2008. At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper that published the unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, at the behest of Al Qaeda.

Not only has Congress been briefed on these programs, but laws passed and enacted since 9/11 specifically authorize them. The surveillance programs are authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which itself was enacted by Congress in 1978 to establish the legal structure to carry out these programs, but also to prevent government abuses, such as surveillance of Americans without approval from the federal courts. The Act authorizes the government to gather communications and other information for foreign intelligence purposes. It also establishes privacy protections, oversight mechanisms (including court review), and other restrictions to protect privacy rights of Americans.

The laws that have established and reauthorized these programs since 9/11 have passed by mostly overwhelming margins. For example, the phone call business record program was reauthorized most recently on May 26, 2011 by a vote of 72-23 in the Senate and 250-153 in the House. The internet communications program was reauthorized most recently on December 30, 2012 by a vote of 73-22 in the Senate and 301-118 in the House.

Attached to this letter is a brief summary of the two intelligence surveillance programs that were recently disclosed in media articles. While I very much regret the disclosure of classified information in a way that will damage our ability to identify and stop terrorist activity, I believe it is important to ensure that the public record now available on these programs is accurate and provided with the proper context.

Again, thank you for contacting me with your concerns and comments. I appreciate knowing your views and hope you continue to inform me of issues that matter to you. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington, D.C. at (202) 224-3841.

Sincerely yours,

Dianne Feinstein United States Senator

To Explain better; I have met very many people who, for example, when asked what their religion is, will say that they are catholic.  However, when I confront them with the problems of the doctrine of the religion which they just claimed they are a member of, they say that they don't believe 'that part'.  It completely defeats the purpose of following a particular religion if you are picking and choosing which parts you believe.  In these cases, I would say that this person is not a member of that religion, but a member of their own religion which happens to share a large portion of beliefs with some other religion.

There are exceptions to this, less dogmatic religious groups such as non-denominational christian, hindu, buddhism, and others.  However, in the cases of dogmatic religions, if you do not believe the dogma, then you should not be labling yourself a member of that group.  I wouldn't call myself a fan of football (European), and then when playing and someone tells me that I'm out of bounds tell them that 'i don't follow that rule'.  Either follow your own damn rules or pick a different label.  This flimsy bullshit pisses me off to no end.  If you say you are a christian then you sure as hell better believe in jesus christ as some sort of avatar of an all powerful god.  I'm willing to bet that for every straw man constructed by an atheist in an argument, there are three theists who have put out the wrong label and then acted like it was the atheists fault for attacking the wrong belief set.

Atheists; Just like we get pissed for theists sometimes acting like there's no such thing as a good atheist, there is such a thing as a good theist.  Whether you like it or not, Newton was a damn good scientist, AND a christian.  There are lots of theists and religious groups who do go to impoverished parts of the world and save lives and all that nice crap.  Some of them are even very intelligent people who thought about their beliefs for a long time and can speak intelligently.  Theists are not stupid, and they are not bad people just by way of them not coming to the conclusion we did that there is no significant higher power.",Garblin

Can the US defeat the arrayed militaries of the EU? Almost certainly. Even if we include Russia, the Cold War ended a long time ago, and they lost.

Using laser designation, air support, and technology to increase the value of each individual soldier far and above what simply a man with a rifle is capable of. It's an incredibly expensive way to fight wars, but it means that you can defeat numerically superior forces. 

Can we occupy Europe? Not a chance in hell. Too much space, too many people. Even if the post-invasion phase was performed flawlessly, there are too many people living in the EU (again, not to mention Russia) to hope to pacify through military force. Unless you can manage to convince all these people that they needed to be invaded (not easy to begin with) , you don't have a hope for success, even in the short term. In the long term, the US simply doesn't have the population to form an empire of that scope.

&gt;Can't believe this article in The Nation, the Via Campesina reported the purchase of 500,000 shares of Monsanto, for more than $23 million by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which with this action completed the outing of the mask of “philanthropy.” Another association that is not surprising.

Monsanto is a publicly traded company which is actually a decent investment.  Additionally, the Gates Foundation (unlike anti-GMO activists) understand that because of climate change million of people in Africa are at risk of starvation in the future unless they can grow crops in the new environment.  That is why they want companies and universities to develop more drought resistant crops.

&gt;They [Monsanto] produce genetically modified seeds.

Yes but most GMOs are created by universities.  Monsanto doesn't even have close to a monopoly.

&gt;They [Monsanto] spray toxic poisons spilling from Agent Orange to PCBs, pesticides, hormones and serve them to us.

This is emotive language which ruins your argument, stick with the facts.

Monsanto didn't invent Agent Orange, but they are one of the companies that made it.  They certainly didn't spray it and they are no longer in this business

Monsanto was found guilty in 2003 of dumping PCBs in the 1970s.  They ended that business (the created and/or dumping) decades ago.

Monsanto does have some GMOs that use a herbicide (Roundup).  These GMOs were created because farmers were maxing out on far more toxic chemicals in the 1960-70-80s and the weeds were becoming immune.  Ironically, Roundup Ready corn and soy are and elegant and environmental solution for this problem.

*

You could find similar cases with any company that has existed for a while.  Do you have a problem with Mitsubishi cars because they built the planes that bombed Pearl Harbor?  Just pointing out the weakness of attacking a company for something they did long before the current issue.

&gt;So powerful it makes me feel helpless.

The anti-GMO activists have done a good job of spreading [Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) in you to the point that you feel helpless and that massive forces are against you.

The only antidote to this is to educate yourself with the facts, not conspiracy theory websites.  Don't believe what people are saying unless you check it out yourself.  

A good place to start is with the scientific consensus that GMOs are as safe as non-GMOs

However, I think men are also negatively impacted in a number of ways, and it's not clear that men are really benefiting more than women are. 

One thing you mentioned was related to men receiving higher wages, which seems to be mostly due to men and women taking different jobs and differences in salary negotiation (both of which have to do with societal pressure). However, it seems that [women are making more of the key purchases in households](http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/buying-power), which at the very least suggests that who controls money may not be as simple as determining who earns more. Moreover, one of the reasons men try to earn a lot of money is because women want them to - for example, [study 3 in this paper](http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/LiLab/LiBaileyKenrickLinsenmeier2002.pdf) shows that women seem to hold status and resources as necessities in long-term mates, while men do not, again suggesting that the issue of earning income may be more complicated.  

If you want to be liked in society, it seems to be better to be a women. For example, [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274) shows that people favour their mothers over their fathers, and are more likely to associate men with violence, which could be one of the reasons why [women receive lighter sentences for crimes](http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/34220/1/556980417.pdf).  

[Boys](http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/02/14/boys-fall-behind-girls-school) and [young men](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/627/1/184.short) are falling further and further behind in education, which could be in part due to the difficult climate for male teachers to work in - for example, there's a (self-reported) [one in seven](http://www.cea-ace.ca/education-canada/article/false-accusations-growing-fear-classroom) male teachers in Canada who have been falsely suspected of having inappropriate contact with students, with the number of male teachers continuing to drop.

Men have a greater likelihood of dying throughout their lifespan, accounting for [92% of occupational deaths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_fatality#Risk_factors), women-focused health issues seem to get more funding, such as the disparatity between [breast cancer and prostate cancer](http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/05/breast-cancer-receives-much-more-research-funding-publicity-than-prostate-cancer-despite-similar-number-of-victims/), and [men are more likely to commit suicide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide). Some of these are due to men's choices, but those choices are affected by societal pressures in the same manner that women's are, except those pressures are more to be a provider at the cost of the self, and that concern for health is unmanly, or a sign of weakness.

Men are [more likely to be homeless than women](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/who.html) and have [few places to go to in response to domestic abuse](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/03/20/privately-run-shelter-for-male-victims-of-domestic-abuse-forced-to-close-its-doors-due-to-lack-of-funding/), which seems to be much more [gender-equivalent than was thought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence_against_men) (though it seems men do more damage than women, due to physical strength differences).

Women certainly have had a lot less visible power in societies, but even this isn't clear - there's the idea from My Big Fat Greek Wedding that ""men are the head of the household, but women are the neck"", or the idea that ""behind every great man is a great women"". These may well be justifications for an unequal system, but it is also possible that there is some truth in them - that by looking at who occupies official roles in society, you may be missing out on the unofficial power that others exert. 

I think that people who think that things are fair in society between men and women aren't familiar with the evidence that really shows they are not - women are disadvantaged still in all kinds of ways, across all kinds of societies. However, I think there is a great deal of evidence that suggests it's not really clear that men come out as the clear winners in society. Looking at the high end, there are lots of men in power who live great lives, and looking at the low end, there are lots of men suffering who live very difficult lives. 

Feminism has a great deal still to offer - gender norms and how our society operates really _does_ hurt everyone. There are many ways that women are systematically disadvantaged over men, but also many ways that men are systematically disadvantaged over women. As others have put before, it's really not a competition, but I think recognizing that both genders are frequently screwed over, and doing what can be done to fix both womens' and mens' roles in society would be for the best. Because of the inter-related nature of gender norms in our society, both sides need to be addressed together; very often, the downside of one gender presents a flipped downside to the other in different circumstances.",Zorander22

Anyhow, I agree with the person who gave this to your friends, OP. This is because I live in an area that has a very large service industry (probably 80-90% of the jobs here). Most of the people working in said service industry are English-speakers. The vast majority of immigrants and visitors expect us, the residents and workers serving them, to learn their native language and make no attempt to learn English in a society that primarily speaks English. Recently, we have had an influx of immigrants that speak other languages, mainly Spanish. They have found jobs and work the same way many long-time residents have, except they have a very, very, *very* basic comprehension of English. Instead of learning the local language, they choose to be ignorant, and expect everyone else to learn their language. I hate to make this reference, but think South Park's episode about the ""Goobacks."" It's a bit exaggerated, but it's what is happening and has been happening where I live.



I don't see what the difference is between the current times and the past times, the times when many American's ancestors immigrated. What I mean is way back when, when most immigration was from Europe, people who spoke a different language would try to learn the local language of the area they settled. Nowadays, at least in my area, an immigrant moves here and expects the current residents to speak *his* language. When he is told to learn English, the people telling him to learn English are chastised just as y'all are chastising the person who wrote the thing OP posted. I just don't get it...





TL;DR - People moving to English-speaking areas of the US that refuse to learn the local language (English) piss the residents off, and things like what OP posted are created.",jdps27

Z: ""In the US. Breasts being exposed or shown on TV aren't as big of a deal in Europe.""

X is claiming that boobs aren't genitals.

Y then claims they're thought about in a similar way genitals are thought about.

Z then says in the US. In Europe, it's not like that.


If Z said, ""In the US**[comma]** breasts being exposed or shown on TV aren't as big of a deal **[like they are]** in Europe."" Then I would agree I made an error.

What I said is grammatically correct and makes sense. No one but you sees it any other way.",no_sissies_allowed

I had started reading it a few years ago but I lost it before I could get all the way through (it's quite a large book).  As an American, every page of this brought new information to light for me, especially with regards to the diversity of political factions in Eastern Europe and how these were exploited after the war.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who reads this sub.  Time for me to get a replacement copy.

In regards to your main question, I think the idea that all French have an affinity toward revolution does seem a bit too broad.  As the others said, there always seem to be a decent number of counter-revolutionaries or more so a powerful class looking to hedge their losses during times of revolution.  One notable example I was somewhat surprised to find is during the time of the French Revolution,  Plantation owners in Martinique (a French colony) basically handed control of the island over to the British in order to dodge the abolition of slavery.  For this reason it seems that many of the French in the colonies has royalist leanings.

Sorry it does not outright say it the paper but I think one should be able to extrapolate for oneself.

Again, the use of 'Roundup Ready' crops increases the use of glyphosate; it's a fairly obvious correlation.  

&gt;Between 1996 and 2011, overall herbicide use increased by 239 million kilograms (527 million pounds) (Benbrook 2012).

Furthermore,
&gt;The US (and Canadian) yields are falling behind economically and technologically equivalent agroecosystems matched for latitude, season and crop type; pesticide (both herbicide and insecticide) use is higher in the United States than in comparator W. European countries; the industries of all types that are supplying inputs to the farmer are becoming more concentrated and monopolistic (Fuglie et al. 2012) and these tendencies correlate with stagnation or declines in germplasm diversity (Welsh and Glenna 2006, Howard 2009, Domina and Taylor 2010).

When the reportera asked the finance minister about it, he referred them to the fiscal oversight committee. They called themselves out-of-jusristiction.

It's just not possible to have any sort of effective universal surveillance with that. I think it's pretty safe to assume that most spying in of Europe is targeted because the agencies just don't have the knowledge and money to collect and parse every citizen's data by default.

To compare, Britain's GCHQ has a budget of ~2 billion Euros and ~6000 employees. The NSA has ~40000 employees and a budget of ~8 billion Euros. The German Stasi had ~90000 employees.

Because the Mexican Revolution was very much like the Spanish Revolution/Civil War (in the sense that a lot of international fighters showed up and then went home afterward) a lot of its symbolism and ideas spread, especially throughout Latin America. This is why you see Sandino (1930s) using black and red, as well as Cuban revolutionaries using black and red. It was originally explicitly associated with anarcho-communism, but lost this association through successive games of telephone and ended up symbolizing revolutionary communism (is there any other sort, really?) in general.

The usage in Spain seems to be either coincidental or a result of ties between Mexican and Spanish revolutionaries (which are not completely improbable). This is why you see the CNT-FAI using red and black for its flag about 15 years later.

In any case, black was seen as the traditional colour of anarchism (and had been for about 30-40 years) and red was the long-standing traditional colour of socialism/communism, especially Marxism, so in Spain and Mexico red-and-black was seen as symbolic of a broad-radical-left movement, or libertarian communism more specifically. In Russia, Ukraine, etc. the situation was more polarized -- since anarchists were actively attacked and persecuted by the Bolsheviks more or less from the beginning, there was considerably more factionalism and hostility within the left, so anarchists tended to stick strongly to their black flags. As well, the Mexican Revolution was very distant from the Russian Revolution (culturally, geographically, and in terms of contact between individual revolutionaries) so the black-and-red wasn't adopted (to anyone's knowledge) by anarchists in Russia.

The Spanish Revolution and especially the aftermath (where many CNT members fled to France, Switzerland, or postwar Italy) led to the specific CNT flag (minus the CNT markings) being adopted as the most common red-and-black configuration (previously the horizontal divide was more common, and is still more common in Latin America). This is the easiest way to tell which movements were directly inspired by the Mexican Revolution as opposed to movements directly inspired by the Spanish Revolution.

In contrast, a lot of anarchists in northwestern Europe (think England, West Germany, etc.) didn't have much meaningful contact with anarchists in Italy and hadn't had the historical experience of the Spanish Revolution, so they relied much more intensely on plain black flags and the circle-A as their symbols. This was true up until the 80s and 90s, when true anarcho-communism (i.e. inspired by Bakunin and Kropotkin) re-circulated -- before then, ""anarchist communists"" in northern Europe were more in the style of libertarian Marxists and were sorted more into the left-communist milieu than they were considered to have a unique identity.",julius2

If the US wants to dominate world politics, which it does, it uses the carrot and the stick. Poor countries are kept in line with foreign aid, development loans, anything that ties them to us and keeps them in our debt. If they step out of line, we can pull our aid money, impose sanctions, call in our loans, and get a lot of other countries to back us. If that doesn't break them, we fund their opponents (Contras). If the opponents take power, we make sure to hook the new nobility deep so they'll stay in line. If the opposition is smothered or defeated, we find a reason to invade (Panama, Grenada, Iraq).

There's nothing more threatening to this kind of racket than a country that won't take our money (see Cuba). If they're not in the red, they're a threat. They might have a democratic vote and choose the wrong people (Mossadegh). Or even worse, they might choose someone honest.

I suppose my point is that the $7 billion isn't charity. It's an investment in the glory of the empire. And it can't be viewed as a single expenditure or a line-item in a budget, because it's part of a deeper strategy. If the US wants to gut the African continent and profit from its resources, which it does, it needs a way to cut to the front of the line. If the EU survives the next ten to twenty years, it will collaborate with the US more than compete directly. China's growing in influence, and making inroads in Africa because they're desperate for energy. But our pockets are deeper, and we've been at this a very long time. US-Chinese trade realities won't allow for a proxy war like between the US and Soviet Union, so the US will aim deep, China will aim wide and shallow.

It's a shame, really. I'd be glad to see the US spend $7b on charity.",[deleted]

&gt;One document lists 38 embassies and missions, describing them as ""targets"". It details an extraordinary range of spying methods used against each target, from bugs implanted in electronic communications gear to taps into cables to the collection of transmissions with specialised antennae.

&gt;Along with traditional ideological adversaries and sensitive Middle Eastern countries, the list of targets includes the EU missions and the French, Italian and Greek embassies, as well as a number of other American allies, including Japan, Mexico, South Korea, India and Turkey. The list in the September 2010 document does not mention the UK, Germany or other western European states.

&gt;One of the bugging methods mentioned is codenamed Dropmire, which, according to a 2007 document, is ""implanted on the Cryptofax at the EU embassy, DC"" – an apparent reference to a bug placed in a commercially available encrypted fax machine used at the mission. The NSA documents note the machine is used to send cables back to foreign affairs ministries in European capitals.

&gt;The documents suggest the aim of the bugging exercise against the EU embassy in central Washington is to gather inside knowledge of policy disagreements on global issues and other rifts between member states.

&gt;The new revelations come at a time when there is already considerable anger across the EU over earlier evidence provided by Snowden of NSA eavesdropping on America's European allies.

&gt;Germany's justice minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, demanded an explanation from Washington, saying that if confirmed, US behaviour “was reminiscent of the actions of enemies during the cold war”.

------------------------

@Silence_hr,  

Apologies for that.  There is a bit of a learning curve but we'll start off relatively shallow and allow you just to get your feet wet.  We'll get to the more serious stuff later.

First of all, try thinking of this new club that you've joined as a big Yugoslavia.  In fact, the very process you've just gone through is a staged variant of Balkanisation, only much, much bigger and with much higher stakes and less say.  Now, to put yourself in the proper mood;  Le Pen is on the rise in France^1, support in Spain has halved since the crisis^2 - which there shows no sign of abating, Cyprus literally had its current accounts raided^3, the Greek IMF bailout stretches into 2022 but chances are it's not going to stop there^4, and Italian lenders have said that if something major doesn't change soon then Italy will need a bailout within the next 6 months^5.  Good luck getting any meaningful reform through, 20 years of trying and the UK has all but given up, in fact the whole idea of closer integration isn't going to happen because the UK has a black ball  referendum on further EU powers.  Already the fears of the CFP are beginning to take seed.  Turn yourself over to the scepticism.^6

Ease yourself into it.  

Once you're hauled before the ECJ a couple of times by others that flagrantly abuse the singlemarket law, which is pretty much everyone except Finland, it will start to come naturally.  Also the President of the Parliament recently described his favourite book as an inspiration to him^7: the author was a Marxist apologist of Stalin who defended the liquidation of millions of people if it meant forcing a political agenda - many of them would have been Slavs.^8  Oh, EUphoria, the President's inspiration is a man who justified a double holocaust if it meant achieving political goals.   

If you do feel you need any pointers, remember to tune your viddy screen into the Commission paid for broadcast network,^9 and they are looking for a conflict to join^10 , so try to keep an eye out.

Most American's don't even access to this beer, but chances are they have access to something equally great that I don't.

The IPA is one example of a style that I think America has really made it's own and really taken to new levels. It's a shame that most of the craft breweries don't have the resources to export to other countries, so the impression of American Beer is still Bud and Coors to the rest of the world.

Countries like Britain didn't fare so well, but to the East in places like the Byzantine Empire things carried on more or less as they were until the sack of Constantinople in the 1450s. Even in the West, Rome as a seat of power had been declining steadily for four centuries, with the city being repeatedly sacked, until Odoacer set himself up as King of Italy (thus ending the Roman Empire in the popular narrative), but his rule actually created more order than there had been. 

Britain itself can be said to have had a collapse, with the ruling Roman soldiers being pulled back to the continental mainland and areas being freed from Roman rule, but even that was a slow process, beginning in 383 and ending in 410. After that, people left Roman living behind over the next two centuries, each generation changing from the one before but none of the common probably conscious of any sort of collapse. The country dissolved into a set of kingdoms, but for the average peasant and town dweller not immediately involved in the battle, this merely changed who was in charge.

It's entirely possible, even probable that we're actually in collapse right now, with various systems breaking down locally in a wider and wider pattern.

LoL is about game knowledge and how well you can synergize with your teammates, not so much about sheer mechanics because they are quite simple. Of course koreans will still find a way to make EU/NA look like a joke mechanically but it's not a huge factor if you're just starting; just focus on last hitting (should be pretty easy having played SC2), not dying and taking objectives (turrets and inhibs). 

Cheap champions are in no way worse than the most expensive ones, you could start with Ryze or Kayle (they're OP and dirt cheap) and learn the basics from there on. If you have a friend that you can play with then by all means do it, the social aspect of this game is what makes it so good imo. Some people can get quite heated in game but it's not worse than any random BM kid you could meet in the SC2 ladder so you should be fine.

Though, as you'll most likely join in with which ever group of people you run into on your way, you'll all make group decisions as long as you have the same time deadlines.

There's shoe and adventure shops in the larger towns such as Burgos and Leon if you need things like poles or new shoes. I agree with the other advice about using walking shoes, NOT hiking shoes. You'll be mostly walking flat trails and not hugely rocky hikes. That being said, you will need to be comfortable on all ground types.

I had a 30L backpack and it was the absolute minimum I would have chosen,  I would have preferred a little bigger.

I went in February-March, which is winter and I wholeheartedly recommend going in this time period!! Most private albergues were closed, and we had to stay in mainly municipal ones. We got a list from one of the Albergues early on, which was a HUGE help that described which Albergues were open and when. I went through snow, rain, mud and wonderful sunshine and warmth and I wouldn't want it any other way. I heard too many horror stories about people doing it in summer and leaving each morning at 5am just to secure a spot at the next stop so that they don't have to sleep in a parking lot or church.

TL;DR - I only decided to do it because I had time to kill while travelling in Europe and it was the best decision I've ever made. Just do it, I winged it and it turned out fine! Good luck!",nastybit

In general, it relied upon a significant enough level of immigrants to form a community, and for them to cluster in a specific area around common industries or types of employment. It may have also had to do with cultural or religious institutions. A church or community centre would facilitate such centrality

 In the case of the Chinese on the west coast of Canada and the USA, it was the late 19th and early 20th century. Later immigrants from Europe like the Greeks didn't form communities in cities like Toronto and Montreal until a little bit later, Many groups fell in between

Reception is complicated, and it against was dependent on ethnicity. In general terms, those who were white ethnics (Italians, Greeks, Poles, etc...) were better welcomed than the Chinese and Japanese. All groups, however, were looked upon with distrust in some way. The Chinese for example, would have their communities painted as slums in which drugs and illegal activities were common; references were often made to the corruption of white women by these men, as many of the Chinese immigrants were male. In some other cities, these communities became focal points for racially-motivated riots. One example is the post Great War riot against Greek Canadians in Toronto

I can't take anything you mumble seriously, because you clearly believe that Limbaugh isn't worth having on the air, when he just about single-handedly saved Conservatism in the first half of the 1990s.  The Republican Party literally would have completely fallen into the hands of the neo-con/Bob Dole/Lincoln Chafee wing of the party, and Conservatives would have been completely marginalized, like they were over in Europe.

Limbaugh's work led night-to-day to the Republican Revolution of 1994, which forced Clinton's hand to reform welfare, balance the budget, and even sign the Defense of Marriage Act.

The first one, Three strong Women by Marie NDiaye, really wasn't my cup of tea. I gather it won the Prix Goncourt, so it'll be me - I'm sure.

The biggest problem I had, right from the very start, is NDiaye's writing style. One paragraph is one sentence. I have problems reading this kind of style. My eyes are on the constant lookout for a pause, but the pause doesn't seem to come, so I'm quickly going further in order to know where we're going, but we don't seem to be going anywhere, so really I'm at loss mid-sentence, still trying to find the dot at the end of the sentence, but it doesn't seem to come, o my god, what if the dot never comes, and I'm reading a sentence that will go on for ever, and ever, and ever...

Yes, it makes me really nervous.

There's only one author I know of that similarly builds sentences in paragraphs, and that's Franz Kafka.
But, Kafka's style is so stylized, so sparse and naked, you simply dazzle at the beauty and ingenuity of his prose.
I didn't have this feeling with NDiaye's novel at all. She writes a lot. Nothing sparse about it. Thick descriptions so thick it could easily bridge the geographical gap between Europe and Senegal. Yes, I drowned in her descriptions. Sometimes I noticed I read two to three pages on automatic pilot, without remembering what I just read. But when I zone in again, I can still follow the story completely.
Yes, she uses a lot of words to tell three very thin stories. The first story is about a daughter - who happens to be a lawyer- that has to visit her estranged father, and finds out her brother's in jail. The second one is about Fanta and her husband (really... You expect me to take your novel seriously if you're going to name one of the leading characters to a beverage?). She follows him from Africa to Europe, and sees her marriage unravel. The third one is about a girl who's husband passes, and because she didn't have any children she was ostracized in the community. Therefore she tries to make it to Europe, in hope for a better life.
That's the synopsis for the whole book, yet she needs more than 200 pages to get it told.
That's just insane. These are simple and straightforward stories. What you see is what you get. If you're looking for depth in the novel, you'll break your nose on the surface.

Words, words, words.

Nope. Not for me

The second book was Juli Zehs 'Nullzeit'. I heard some really good things about this book, so I had high expectations.
Unfortunately these expectations haven't been met. Not by a long shot.

This story about a diving instructor that gets into trouble as his relationship with two of his customers takes a dive, is great summer reading material, but that's about it. You can read it absentmindedly, whilst having a cocktail on a sun laden beach, and enjoy the holiday spirit. 
However, if you'd read it to be swept away by some great literature, please keep moving.

The customers are a German couple; one being a B star actress, and the other a failed writer.
They have a pretty masochistic relationship, playing pranks just to hurt the other.
Our diving instructor is a goodie two-shoes, that manages to fall in love with the actress, and ends up risking his relationship, his job, his life because of it.

The book reads like a thriller, but it lacks the ""page-turner"" style that sets a good thriller apart from the mediocre thrillers. My guess is Zeh didn't really want to write a thriller, but wanted take some elements of the thriller genre, and make it Literature. 
This. Fails. Miserably. 
Because she couldn't chose a register to fully explore, the result is a rather half-assed attempt at a literary thrillerish kind of book. The twist she forces at the end doesn't really come as a surprise, and neither can she meet the excitement of a thriller. In stead of building towards a climax, it just drags on and on and on -- despite the book having only about 220 pages or so.

For me, it fails at being a thriller. And it certainly fails as literature as well. The main character states at the end of the novel that he became a new man. In nothing Zeh wrote, this can be justified. There are no character progressions in the novel whatsoever. The female lead is still a manipulative bitch, and the male protagonist is still a goodie two-shoes that can't seem to make decisions of his own.

A great under-accomplished disappointment of a novel this is.",MKeirsbi

Normally she would just renew it every 10 years by sending in her passport, however a year or two ago, the government made everyone reapply after it expired instead of just getting it renewed. Had to spend quite some money requesting her mother's birth certificate and all that, going down to London as well I believe, and it was a real hassle to sort out. I looked into her applying for British citizenship on her behalf.

Quick edit: Appears it changed after 2002, on the Australian side at least. http://www.citizenship.gov.au/current/dual_citizenship/

Also there was a time when she couldn't do it because they would only allow it if your father was British, which has since changed it appears http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/eligibility/registration/britishmother/

I suppose it would be better for her to apply for British citizenship, either now through descent or naturalisation, since she would then get the full benefits of the EU.

Edit: Although regarding descent, it seems rather awkward going about it as we would have to see if she kept any old passports showing her British nationality, which would be rather difficult considering the distance between us and them.

the wiki article on alchemy is a decent place to start--alchemy grew out of (and is hard to distinguish from) early heuristic and mystical attempts to explain and manipulate the world. many early thinkers, including the presocratics, were trying to establish a theoretical understanding of the world and the things in the world. in addition to providing a background for aristotle (who provided a background for ptolmey, etc. etc.) the writing of these thinkers helped lay the groundwork for the more familiar if partially fabulous later european alchemists of the collective imagination.

and, for what it's worth, aristotle's physics have a pretty distinct ""alchemical"" flavor to them--he treats earth, water, air, and fire as the fundamental building blocks of the (terrestrial) world, and outlines some properties of each. for example, he speculates that different kinds of material have different intrinsic motions of varying strength and would interact in generally predictable ways. although he didn't have as complex a table of 'elements' as later alchemists, you can see in his and other contemporary work the beginnings of physical theorizing being answerable to experience and experiment. it took a long time for experiment to weed out the fallacious precepts from useful theory, and our modern-day physics is in no way 'finished', but the alchemists can be thought of as standing between the classical thinkers and modernity.

(further complicating your question is the dearth of philosophers well-known to the public in the heyday of alchemy! while the names of some classical thinkers like those you mention persist in the public memory, heraclitus or say parmenides are less well known. and while russell, wittgenstein, kirkegaard, nietzsche, and hegel have ascended into the pantheon, feuerbach and his ilk are mostly forgotten, while for kripke, lewis, searle, and the rest of the early contemporary set it's too early to say. of the medieval period, perhaps only william of ockham and thomas aquinas have any measure of notability.)",cornmantheking

A meu ver, para explicar a situação, podemos assumir que a troika defende um certo tipo de ideologia onde se acredita que um governo mais pequeno e ágil associado a uma economia constituída por empresas dinâmicas e pouco reguladas vai resultar num ambiente muito mais eficiente do que temos actualmente. Assim, num futuro mais ou menos próximo esperam que estas medidas estimulem a economia o suficiente para termos um crescimento positivo que não só vai ultrapassar os actuais problemas como também nos vai proporcionar a todos uma vida melhor. Isto é óptimo.

No entanto, a hipótese anterior não faz muito sentido. Para a hipótese anterior fazer sentido seria necessário que atacassem o problema por igual em todas as frentes: 

* Evidentemente, teria de haver um esforço ainda maior por parte da troika para acabar com a corrupção em Portugal, não há mercado que funcione de forma eficiente com corrupção. Apesar de se falar em reforma da justiça nos vários memorandos da troika, a verdade é que não se assistem a grandes mudanças nesta área. O que é necessário fazer não é um mistério;

* Depois temos o facto de uma percentagem brutal do orçamento de estado ser usado para pagar rendas a empresas como a EDP, Mota Engil, etc. Mais uma vez isto não é prática que se possa tolerar, em circunstância nenhuma e, ainda menos, numa economia saudável. Todos nós sabemos o que vai sendo feito nesta área ou seja, qualquer coisa entre muito pouco e coisa nenhuma;

* O estado português é muito pesado. O estado deve ser aligeirado. Para tal a troika e este governo têm apenas uma solução: despedir pessoal. Penso que, em alguns casos isso seja necessário mas, mais uma vez, está longe de ser o mais importante. O estado gasta dinheiro em coisas que não sabe para que servem, talvez fosse mais inteligente arrumar primeiro a casa e, só depois, tomar as medidas mais drásticas. Há um facto que não consigo compreender nas administrações públicas, não há um sistema centralizado de contabilidade, funcionamos como se estivéssemos no século XIX nesse aspecto. Porquê? Temos o problema da despesa descontrolada dos municípios. Estão à espera do quê para começar a fechar empresas municipais que não servem para nada? (Eu sei, há os boys, temos de pensar nos boys);
 
* Por fim, temos os bancos, o pior cancro da nossa economia. Os bancos são instituições profundamente corruptas. Estão efectivamente parados há 5 anos e não temos grandes esperanças que venham a melhorar em breve. Pelo contrário, estão continuamente a posicionar-se de modo a sugar o máximo do estado. Nestes últimos anos absorveram toda a capacidade de endividamento do estado (pelo menos uns 75 mil milhões de euros entre garantias e injecções de capital por parte dos contribuintes). Nestes amigos, ninguém toca, são vacas sagradas.

Do anterior sou levado a concluir que a troika e o governo não estão interessados na hipótese que enunciei. Na realidade não faz sentido o que andam a fazer... 

A menos que, a troika e o governo sejam tão corruptos como os nossos banqueiros, grandes ""empresários"", etc (aqueles que vivem da mama do estado). Mas isto é teoria da conspiração, nem sequer se pode colocar esta ideia.",hgg

I am sure the EU does other things with it's pocket money, but I am not quite aware of them right now.


 44 % of the budget currently goes to CAP (Common agrucultural Policy). Two of the biggest receipients of the rural development is France and Italy, two G7 countries that have been on the receiving end of this for 40 + years. Apparently it is not working or they would be on the receiving end any more, but the EU seem to refuse to cut it, or re-evalue it, drastically. If it were working, they wouldn't need it. Not to mention that we sponsor ineffective and downright dangerous stuff with it, like tobacco and wine. 

&gt; but I think the idea is that half the money of the EU is used to build/improve the infrastructure of the less develloped european countries, so that they can be economically competitive.

But it is not working. If it were, why is Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain etc in need of more money that ever. Perhaps we should re-evalue it and concentrate much more on education, research or other stuff that truly makes us competitive, not an empty airfield in the middle of Spain. 

What irritates me is that the EU seem to have no plan and no capacity for re-evaluation, no strategy. 

They are taking in countries that need money, but are not re-evaluating it strategies. If sponsoring infrastructure worked- why isn't Spain a net payer, for example? I think the whole budget and the direction has to be re-evaluated, not to mention huge programs like CAP - if rural development worked, why are they stille receiving money after 40 + years? If building highways is not working (clearly) - is there anything else we should do perhaps? 

I just feel that they are not spending money wisely, not at all. Furthermore, they are not evaluating what has worked and what hasn't, and to top it off, they seem to have no strategy. Not a good grade, not at all.

I will use the example of the textile industry to try and answer your question. The ""spinning jenny"" allowed yarn to be spun in quantity but not with quality. Richard Arkwright then invented the water frame which treated the cotton before spinning which allowed stronger yarn to be produced in quantity.^2 Then came the ""mule"" which combined previous inventions to allow for huge quantities of higher quality wool to be produced. Now the production of wool outpaced the the speed with which it could be used by weavers. As a result the power driven loom was created in 1787.^3 

At the same time the British agricultural revolution was under way and there was great demand for iron implements such as plows and horseshoes. The demand for coal to use in the smelting process required mines to be dug deeper. But with depth came water and hand or horse driven pumps were inefficient at keeping water out of mine shafts. As a result, the earliest steam engines were invented to power the pumps used in the mining process. Water mills were the primary power source of textile manufacturing machines before the steam engine was applied to the manufacturing process. With steam power came yet another increase in productivity in the textile industry

As you can see the development of technology inspired, and often required, more innovation that was not necessary before industrialization. Before machines, hand spinning techniques did not significantly outpace weaving techniques and in this way innovation was not *needed* until such a scenario occurred.

To answer your question I would be hesitant to say that something made the Industrial revolution inevitable. I think the closest explanation to what you are looking for may be that ""...mechanized forms of production created their own self-sustaining momentum. Innovation in one sector of the economy created demands in other sectors, which led to new innovations and new demand in yet other areas.""^4

Hopefully this helps. Good luck finding a suitable answer to your question!

People that are of European descent have A or O blood which is rare in the Philippines.
(edit I think it is A or O ask an expert to find out)

So it you happen to have this rare blood type, you can make a lot of money:)

If you are a foreigner or have foreign blood in you :) Probably is a good idea to get a blood typing test. And then line up potential donors. If you catch dengue you might need a lot of blood and fast. 

A relative needed blood, and he happened to have the rare blood type in the Philippines. We called all the hospitals and the only one that had the blood was PGH. Anyway they asked for a donation of 1K per unit of blood. I don't know where the blood came from. Anyway PGH is short of money and I didn't mind donating. I don't know if any foreigners have been in that hospital but it is scary:)

Behind us in line was a jeepney driver whose daughter had dengue and he needed blood. He thought that you could just stick the blood in a back pack:) Anyway when he saw we had to pay 2k for our blood he got worried since he only had 1K. When he was at the counter, he didn't have a cooler or ice. Fortunately being the extra prepared guy I am, I had lots of ice. So I gave him some:) I also didn't mind since he offered to pay. The attendant was really nice also, he rigged a makeshift cooler with a cardboard box for the guy. And then when the jeepney driver offered to pay, the attendant said they had a surplus of that type of blood and it was free. 

Technically speaking the 2K was a donation I think.

I didn't mind donating. Fucking provincial/government and some private hospitals in the Philippines are down right scary. On the other hand when u only pay 500 per day what do you expect.

Greenland has a lot of choices to make in the near future (melting polar ice, resource extraction, geopolitical alignment) so that's a bit of a wildcard.

East. The remnants of Joegoslavia + Albania will join sooner or later. 

As for the traditional sphere of influence of Russia (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Transdniestria), they are trying to get the best of both world by straddling the fence between Russia and EU, but as they should know from historical experience that the fence between Russia and the rest of Europe is no safe place. They'll opt for closer ties with either side at some point. Obviously the EU is the easier choice to do that.

The Caucasus: Armenia is considered aligned with Europe already due to being Christian. They're also small countries that aren't likely to disrupt much, and there's oil. Against them pleads the fact that they're a lot deeper in Asia. Neither Russia nor Turkey would like meddling in their backyard. Violence still isn't far away, and there are unresolved territorial disputes.

Turkey: the situation as it is will likely continue for a while: slow progress on the legislative side, while nothing decisive happens on the three unresolved conflicts: Armenia, Cyprus, the Kurds.

Russia: Too big. Even if it joins, there will be an exception for most rules east of the Ural, and Russia is not wont to divide itself internally. And that's ignoring the autocratic tendencies and militarism of Russia. On the flip side, these weaknesses would be strengths as an ally because they complement EU weaknesses in the geopolitical arena.

The battles in the Pacific were the nastiest in many respects. Unlike basically every other belligerent in the war, the Japanese rarely surrendered. In fact, they'd pretend to surrender only to kill the naive Marines with a grenade or a handgun when they approached. They exploited Americans' decency. The Japanese would also deliberately target medics/corpsmen when they treated wounded Marines. The Germans didn't do this in Europe. In Europe, American medics would wear regular medic uniforms with the red cross on them and it was common for the Germans to hold their fire when they saw them. In the Pacific, US medics and corpsmen had to start wearing regular uniforms after the first few months because before that the Japanese were killing them all.

The Japanese defended many islands that US Marines had to take over inch by inch. On Islands like Iwo Jima, the Japanese had miles and miles of subterranean tunnels, machine gun nests, artillery and mortar emplacements. The Marines had every disadvantage on the ground and lost men for every bit of land they gained.

Since the Japanese didn't usually surrender, sometimes the entire defending force of tens of thousands would be wiped out by the Americans. Marines had to go from bunker to bunker with fucking flame throwers.

However there is this pretension that a lot of Europeans feel when they hear about the UK. For example the opinion that Britain is one of the most important countries in the EU. They really are not. They probably are on 4th place after Ger,Fr and Ita. 
Also other things that a lot of Europeans (and I'm just talking for Germany, Belgium and Italy here) don't like are your high pride of your monarchy. I've heard people called you ""stupid monarchists"" (yes in Brussels) because your Queens seems to be a big deal. 
Also the Pound. Many people on the continent assume (even professors in economics at my university) that it's only that high because of the importance of London in the financial district. This industry of course is very frowned upon and it really is your biggest industry (some labour representatives agree with my statement as well). I don't have anything against your country or your people (which are awesome as well as the beer) but the UK really seems like an archaic country that still thinks there biggest enemy is Napoleon Bonaparte and that makes a big deal about their weird commonwealth.   
And all those extra treatments that the UK receives (like the UK rebate) seem to be unfair.  

&gt;The Euro - which has only survived because of the might of Germany. 

That may be true but the Euro is one of the best inventions on our continent. And a lot of people don't seem to understand this (like the UK and A LOT of people in Germany). The EEC which later became the EG (that's the German term a translation doesn't seem to exist in English?) has improved a lot in Europe. It always was a chore to take out my passport and waiting in line when taking the train to London from Brussels. Also the need to change money- god that's awful. 

&gt;Bad directives from Brussels that we are all bound to.

I hear this a lot but I never hear the exact ""bad directives"". The crisis? I think the commission handled it well. 

&gt;Virtually open door immigration - our country is unrecognisable in terms of the make-up of the population compared to just 10-15 years ago.

That's another weird thing that I can't understand. What's so bad bad about immigration? When Italy asked about the possibility to transfer immigrants to the other countries it was the UK (and Germany) that didn't want to have any more immigrants. Instead of accepting the change in demographics a lot of countries hate on immigrant. Remember back in the '90s and '00s everybody was talking about the problems of emigration in Europe. 
Britain had negative migration in the '90s as well [Link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/UK_net_migration.png/450px-UK_net_migration.png) Of course it changed but I don't think that's a very bad thing.

*The mice are secretive about their digestion too though so Carmody had to measure how the mice moved and how much weight they gained as an indication of the amount of energy that was not being lost through inefficiency as feces. All things equal, the bigger the mice got on a given diet, the more calories they were getting. Carmody fed adult, male mice organic sweet potatoes (to, in essence, retest what was already known) or organic, lean beef. These foods were served up raw and whole, raw and pounded, cooked and whole, or cooked and pounded. The standard system of calories, the one used to put the numbers on the food you buy in the store, assumes (and hence also predicts) these have no effect on calorie content; but would they? The mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted and how much they consumed was closely monitored (Carmody had to pick each and every bit of uneaten food up from inside the cage).*

*The mice on the different diets got about the same amount of exercise. They all had a wheel to run on, and they did not differ one treatment to the next in terms of how inclined they were to take a jog. They did differ, however, in how much they weighed at the end of the study. As predicted, mice lost more than four grams of weight on raw sweet potatoes, but gained weight when given cooked sweet potatoes (whether or not they were pounded). But what about meat? Cooked meat was easier to digest. The mice lost 2 grams of body mass on raw meat but just 1 gram on cooked meat.*

*Even if two people were to somehow eat the same sweet potato cooked the same way they would not get the same number of calories. Carmody and colleagues studied a single strain of heavily inbred lab mice such that their mice were as similar to each other as possible. Yet the mice still varied in terms of how much they grew or shrank on a given diet, thanks presumably to subtle differences in their behavior or bodies. Humans vary in nearly all traits, whether height, skin color, or our guts. Back when it was the craze to measure such variety European scientists discovered that Russian intestines are about five feet longer than those of, say, Italians. This means that those Russians eating the same amount of food as the Italians likely get more out of it.*

*How you digest food depends on which microbes you have and which microbes you have differs from one person to the next. Different foods can both affect and be affected by our microbes (gut bacteria).*

So yeah, more complex than just calories in and calories out. What you actually eat can have a pretty good effect on how your body actually works with it. 300 calories of processed donut is what different than 300 calories worth of beef even if they're the same amount of ""calories"".",butterfly_beatrice

There are a million little delicacies from different countries that I miss living in America (just like there are missing from every country, obviously). Some of the ones I miss the most: kinder bueno (even better than kinder surprise), supermarket halva, alphonso mangoes, european fanta, jaffa cakes, millions of flavors of potato chips.

But living abroad made me truly appreciate how many great American products never leave our shores, like: Sriracha, proper ketchup (not that sickly sweet or super spicy stuff available in most places), BBQ sauce (and BBQ in general), maple syrup, American craft beer, tortilla chips, and of course, reese's.

The song tells us a story of a relationship of the first-person narrator and a ghost. Only once is the first-person pronoun mentioned and it is *boku* which is usually used by boys.

No, I don't think so. First, they are not legally allowed to pay less just because *their* pet projects get scrapped. I mean, how would that look? Finland doesn't get one of their pet project OK'd, so they refuse to pay? Not even France can get away with that, apart from it being arrogant, ignorant and illegal as hell. Do you really think Germany and UK would stand for that? 

&gt; And then that would be a huge blow to the Common Market.

And, it is illegal as hell. We can not sponsor our own agricultual industry. That is one of the points with CAP, so if France does that, it will be illegal and against free trade. I have no doubt that other countries, like the UK or the Netherlands would take them to court. France still decides far to much when it comes to the CAP, but not even France can just ignore the other 27 countries, the courts etc. 

I however would love the trial, it would expose how bad the CAP is, and how it is tailored towards France's needs. 

&gt;So maybe the CAP shouldn't be seen as a part of the EU budget, but a way for the countries to keep an eye on each others subvention?

Well, I am all for that  -let each country take care of their own agriculture, I have absolutely no problem with that. But, as long I have to pay for French wine and Polish tobacco and the ""devleopment"" of rural Italy (which they haven't managed in + 40 years) I *will* care about the CAP, it is the biggest post of the budget, and it size is idiotic, not to mention many of the things it subsidizes.

I can agree with that :)

&gt;It depends upon the circumstances. Usually I'd blame the individual solider but your example leaves out hat his motivations would be. If they were intentional and they knew that they were a civilian and had shown islamaphobic bias in the past then they need to be held accountable. but if, for example, the gun accidentally goes off, killing the civilian then it was an accident and punishment isn't necessarily a priority.

And another agreement.

&gt;muslim terrorists

My bad. What I had meant to say is that at the present time most terrorist attacks are committed by muslims, not that islam was a terrorist religion, nor that most muslims approve of and support terrorist attacks. There was a recent survey that came out about muslim beliefs in the world concerning various issues from Sharia law to terrorism to the importance of faith in schools, and it clearly demonstrated that those who were willing to commit terrorist acts were in the very small minority, and those supporting such acts being in a slightly larger minority. Most muslims world-wide are peaceful. Then again, most muslims world-wide live in peaceful areas.

I was aware of the Tamil Tigers and the IRA, but I was not aware of Babbar Khasla nor of the PKK, and I am surprised at the number of victims they have made.

&gt;As for the wider fostering of such negative mentalities, blaming wont do any good. We blame people for negative actions and we educate people to prevent these things from happening again, as I stated earlier, you cant blame a concept.

I would think you can. I mean, wouldn't you blame religious intolerance as part of the reason why the communist regime was so violent against religions? Blaming the antisemitist violence on the nationalist socialist work party's stance on the aryan race? 

I'm curious, because the way I see it, you can blame the individual for the acts he committed, and the group he is part of for generating this kind of beliefs that would lead to violent actions. Do we agree so far? How much more of a step is it to blame the ideology binding the group together, and to associate the blaming of that ideology with other violent groups united by the same ideals? Isn't that sort of missing the forest for the trees?

&gt;I think it depends upon the situation. Please give an example of where you statement exhibits itself.

Once again, I agree with you :) 

Per examples, the USSR is a very good one, as was the People's Republic of China when religions were forbidden. We also have the Inquisition during the middle ages and present-day fundamentalism in Islam and Christianity.

The first two examples would imprison and/or execute those who didn't obey and went to church, the last two when in an institutionalized organization with a lot of power and influence would root out those not believing the same things from among their ranks (apostasy laws in Sharia, and Mark 9:42 as justifications) and imposing their beliefs on others, through force (convert or die for both the upstart Muslim empire, and the same for the Inquisition/religious wars in Europe) or through guile (the Inquisition forced people to convert or be deported, the muslim empire imposed taxes on people of other faiths when things were nice, and burned down their temples when things weren't so nice).

the solution? criminals and press gangs. they would give criminals a ""choice""- either we chain you up for the rest if your life, or you crew on a ship (usually there was no actual choice - they were just forced). Press gangs were basically bounty hunters who went around kidnapping young and poor fit young men (the ones who were passed out in front of a pub in the morning after a fun night were the easiest to take) and forcing - ""impressing"" - them to crew on ships. ""good morning mate- hope you had a fun night- by the way, youre spending the next four yets at sea"". these crews became part of the property of the ship by law. so if a ship was captured by another flag. officers and soldiers would be taken as prisoner, but the crew would remain with the ship as part of it, simply with new officers from another country.
now- we can imagine that these crews were not very willing to do what they were told. criminals, kidnapped young men, and crews from captured rival countries.
the solution? armed soldiers on the ship - or ""marine"" soldiers - to discipline and guard them. their side responsibility was fight on land if it ever came to that- but sea battles of that time never ended up on shore. you met an enemy ship at sea and just started firing cannons at eat other.

The people's trust in their government depends on how closely they've been paying attention and how well they understand history. Monitoring what people say and to whom is a direct attack on free speech as well as privacy. We can't claim to be a free and open society if people are afraid to express their opinions without experiencing repercussions later on.

My position is that absolute power does indeed corrupt absolutely. That is to say, give the government power, and they will abuse that power in almost all cases. I've been alive long enough to know that 90% of what government officials say are lies told to enrich themselves and maintain power. There's very little that they could say which would convince me they're working in our best interest. It's simply not true and history supports that.

As to what they could use all this data for, corporate and economic espionage and blackmail comes to mind. This information can be used to earn billions of dollars in the stock market, or simply steal trade secrets and bring them to market first. Powerful people keep dark secrets, and if the government knows those secrets, they can be blackmailed into supporting a government agenda that is not good for the public at large. On a smaller scale, the repercussions of security agents abusing the system to carry out personal vendettas is unlimited. 

&gt;If they tried anything particularly nefarious there's no way they'd get away with it. 

Actually, yes, they could. And they almost assuredly have. That's the nature of the top secret world. We plebs never hear about it. Case in point, we're actually hearing about it right now. Surveilling the EU parliament and Germany at the same rate as China and Iran is pretty nefarious, and they've been getting away with it for years now.

&gt;The only time I can see them using this data against you is if you actually did something wrong...

This statement is truly one of the most dangerous mentalities in society today. The idea that ""If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about"" has been deconstructed numerous times, and I hope that it's something you'll think long and hard about. 

Lastly, let's assume that all this data collection is totally benign, and really is just to fight terrorism. Do you think that will still be the case in 20-30 years? What about after another 9/11-scale attack? Who will our leader be? Hitler came to power in 4 short years.

The reason I posted is because the British weren't exactly part of the occupied bit of Europe (although many of their soldiers were trapped there) so it was odd that some of them managed to come into Axis service. 

John Amery also went into prison camps and personally lectured the captured Brits on why fascism/Nazism was the way forward, and although he was sneered at by most, some soldiers stood up and agreed with him for varying reasons. I think the main reason was probably fear of what the Nazis would do to them if they didn't join, which is just basic cowardice. However some were apparently legitimately convinced fascism was the only deterrent to 'Jewish Communism' and that the allies had simply become puppets of the USSR to fight the Germans.

No worries! Just steal from your allies (in this case, the US)!

Ariane 5 (Basically the 5th major evolution of their rocket), quoting wikipedia here, *Ariane 5 is a nearly-complete redesign.*

Though perhaps coincidence, it seems highly suspicious to me that they had problems with the launcher, decided to make it a mission to conduct espionage to learn about the Atlas launcher, and then they redesigned their own launcher significantly, in fact converting the two lower stages with a single, cryogenic core stage, just as the Atlas rocket does.

Heck, when you go onto the Wikipedia article for Industrial Espionage, France has its own section of espionage against the United States!

&gt;*""...electronic intercepts of telecommunications traffic, accomplished from French-government owned and operated mountain-top listening posts, to the installation of clandestine listening devices (more commonly, bugs) in hotel rooms in which foreign businessmen""*

Now that's government espionage!

Later on, in the original linked paper above, the paper discusses Marc Goldberg, a french citizen working in the USA, who was caught trying to transfer trade secrets of the company he was working for to France. Goldberg was arrested at San 
Francisco International Airport while attempting to board a flight to Paris.

&gt;*""Goldberg had originally come to the United States under the Foreign Ministry program described earlier and received pay from the French government throughout his stay in the United States.

It's really an interesting story on how the US company caught them, the French government's reaction to being caught, and I recommend you read it.

New US documents show the biggest threat being China (by far) and Russia, though we are all still spying on each other.

My story isnt that interesting but i will share it with you!

I was born with a cleft, which means i had a big gap in my upper jaw and lip and in the roof of my mouth, this meant that it was hard for me to breath as a baby. Over the last 25 years of my life i have has numerous operations to have it fixed, also to have my nose reconstructed to due multiple operations, some of which didnt work out. So this was a major part of my life, but thankfully, its over now and i am finished with all of that. Its not as big a deal as someone with a life threatening illness or disease or cancer, but it was a big part of my whole life.

I celebrated the completion of my operations with a few friends by traveling all around Europe for 3-4 weeks a few years back, just after the last operation. We travelled through Germany, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and England. We stopped at many places on the tour and enjoyed some really really memorable times on this holiday, memories that will stay with me forever.

After this tour, working full time at a bar just wasnt cutting it, i needed to feed my travel bug, so, every year, i would work my arse off, save up all my money, and spend it all on a big holiday to the UK, i managed to do this 2 years in a row, i loved every minute of the holidays and even made some really cool friends along the way.

However, two years ago today, i realised that working behind a bar wasnt going to get me anywhere in life, so i started to study a Bachelor of Media, i am still studying today, and not 6 months into the course i applied for a job on the railway. It was a traineeship to learn how to drive coal trains, i didnt think i would get it, but i applied anyway.

Today, after slogging it out pouring beers for the local drunks for 5 years and after numerous operations that i thought would never end i am now in my final year of study and i am enjoying a good career on the railway.

I havent been able to travel anymore due to my work and study, but i am about to embark on the biggest adventure of a lifetime, i have recently bought my own home and i move in within two weeks!

Thanks for reading if you made it this far!!!

Keep in mind that the EU was never meant to be a union of countries strictly located on the European continent. It was created to pacfiy Europe, but the conflicts that it was meant to avoid have never been limited to the continent. 

Obviously, there's a bunch of countries left that are actually in Europe, but don't currently want to be part of the EU. Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Liechtenstein would probably be accepted very quickly if they decided to join.

Then there are certain countries that the EU is currently actively pursuing, including former Yugoslavia (hello Croatia, btw.) and Turkey. All of these would internalize border conflicts between the EU and neighboring states. Economically and culturally, they're all very close, although Turkey could do a 180 still. Either way it seems very likely to me that these will all end up in the EU at some point in the future.

But then, what's next? The core of Europe is part of the EU already. Eastern neighbors like Belarus or Ukraine seem to be relatively unimportant and also not necessarily compatible yet, with neither side willing to put more effort into making them compatible. Integrating Russia would be economical and geopolitical madness, and Russia has no reason of her own to join. 

Outside Europe, another priority I see in the future is further expansion around the Mediterranean. We don't have to wait for Norway or Switzerland and so on; there are countries outside Europe that are strategically interesting for the EU and culturally and politically close. 

In Africa, there's Morocco. It applied in 1987 and was rejected, but Turkey was rejected then too, and Morocco has made large improvements toward compatibility. It's easily the most privileged partner of the EU in Africa right now, with ENP advanced status, free trade, open skies, and so on. It's also not in the African Union, and it's a NATO ally. Accession of Morocco would internalize a border conflict with Spain, and give the EU full control over the Strait of Gibraltar. Currently, the EU has territories on both sides of it, with Ceuta on the African side, and the accession of Morocco would give the EU full control over one of the most important avenues for illegal immigration as well as an important trade route.

The rest of Africa seems unlikely. Algeria technically was a member of the EC until its secession from France. They aren't anywhere close to compatibility with the EU right now, though, and the same applies to pretty much all of North Africa. Morocco is the exception.

Then there's the Middle East. Israel would not be terribly unlikely. Culturally, it's obviously much closer to Europe than to its neighboring countries. The idea is not unpopular within Israel, and has been discussed in the EU as well. Currently this doesn't look to be happening anytime soon, but if the EU is going to expand in that direction at all, Israel is the most likely candidate. Among the Arab countries, Jordan is probably the most likely, but then they are all not terribly likely due to the huge cultural differences.

And that's about it. A case could be made for certain Commonwealth of Nations states, but pretty much all of them would require a significant re-definition of the EU. India probably has the closest ties with the EU, but an integration of India isn't really manageable and I don't really see what's in it for India that they can't get out of a strong partnership. IMHO we're more likely to see the UK leave the EU in favor of a Commonwealth based union of its own... which will then fail for the same reasons for which the British Empire failed, but that's another story.

Oh, right, there are some special cases involving territories outside Europe that are part of EU member states. I guess any of them could become fully parts of the EU very quickly, or become independent of their EU parent, but that's not terribly interesting. Their citizens are already EU citizens and so on, they just get special treatment to facilitate trade with geographically close neighbors. They could go in either direction without any huge process required. We have cases like that in Europe too, Germany and Italy have exclaves in Switzerland that are not part of the EU VAT union, the Channel Islands are special, Åland is special, and so on. If Switzerland joins the EU after all, the exclaves will be fully integrated as well, but nobody really cares enough about any of these to pursue a change of status.

**TL;DR** If the EU doesn't fail, all of continental Europe will eventually end up in it. Outside Europe, Morocco and Israel seem to be the most likely candidates, but it's not going to happen soon. I don't think we'll see any further expansion outside Europe unless the definition of the EU changes significantly.",thatfool

Despite what everyone says, a lot of nations still respect the US (to varying degrees and for varying reasons) even when it does corrupt things. There are many reasons why this is, but its level of corruption pales in comparison to other states with major clout, especially repressive ones like China or Russia. People often cite the EU as the next superpower (especially in, like, every futuristic video game ever), but I don't see that happening. It is an economic alliance seeking to branch out into crisis management endeavors. The problem with this is that each country has to contribute troops and support, and the larger countries contribute way more than the smaller ones despite the smaller ones getting benefits from being EU members, which causes some resentment and a desire for some sort of reform. A lot of people in the UK also want to leave the EU, which would be a massive blow to it.

The US has also slowly strayed away from Cold War policy somewhat, making it arguably more of a benevolent hegemon, though many would argue against this. But if you look at the interventionist policies of the Cold War, things are a bit different. Reagan is the best example. He went out of his way to support brutal autocrats who were anti-communist. Saddam Hussein is one example, although for better or worse his rule in Iraq stabilized the Middle East through a balance of power. Another example is the Contras--remnants of the old Nicaraguan ""puppet"" government of the US that was quite repressive. When they were overthrown by the Sandinistas (under Carter's watch despite a heavy effort to stop them), Reagan ended up breaking laws to supports them. With the anti-Soviet craze dead, the US is sort of evolving on foreign policy. We've only had three presidents since the Soviet Union fell, so it's hard to gauge where exactly the US is going as a hyperpower. The neoconservative influence that first gained power under Reagan had a huge resurgence under Bush, and Obama has only barely lessened it (which I think is the very root of liberal dissatisfaction with him, while conservatives dislike him for domestic policy). But he's taken a more cautious approach on the Arab Spring, which I don't think Bush would have done. I think the next president will be more inclined to ratchet down neoconservative foreign policy.

To try and pull in new players Valve changed up a few stats here and there, a few angles, added gametypes that appeal to the fast and furious respawners of other FPS games. It's sort of worked from what I understand, but not enough to get a community that's worth pumping money into.

No. Reddit has no opinions on anything, really. The users have opinions, and some will be more popular than others, but such is life. You may even end up with multiple posts on the same subject with the prevalent opinions being the complete opposite.

And while each country in the EU have intelligence agencies of various kinds, as I said, I fully expect them to be spending time spying on each other as well. This isn't the case in the US. It's not like Texas has its own intelligence agency, feeding the Texas senate information on what Maine, Oregon or North Dakota are up to. The EU is a collection of independent countries with various agreements between all of them - the US is a collection of interdependent states.

But instead of simply being angry at people (like me), who posts something that can be seen as anti-American, how about you think about it from another perspective. Are you seriously going to claim, that if the roles were reversed, you wouldn't be upset about, say, Russia collecting information about millions of phone calls in the US, as well as email etc.?

[Really?](http://townhall.com/columnists/walterewilliams/2012/10/24/what_you_cant_say/page/full)

&gt;Slavery is widely misunderstood, and as such has been a tool for hustlers and demagogues. Slavery has been part of the human condition throughout recorded history and everywhere on the globe. Romans enslaved other Europeans; Greeks enslaved other Greeks; Asians enslaved Asians; Africans enslaved Africans; and in the New World, Aztecs enslaved Aztecs and other native groups. Even the word slave is derived from the fact that Slavic people were among the early European slaves.

&gt;Though racism has been used to justify slavery, the origins of slavery had little to do with racism. In recent history, the major slave traders and slave owners have been Arabs, who enslaved Europeans, black Africans and Asians. A unique aspect of slavery in the Western world was the moral outrage against it, which began to emerge in the 18th century and led to massive efforts to eliminate it. It was Britain's military might and the sight of the Union Jack on the high seas that ultimately put an end to the slave trade.

&gt;Unfortunately, the facts about slavery are not the lessons taught in our schools and colleges. The gross misrepresentation and suggestion in textbooks and lectures is that slavery was a uniquely American practice done by racist white people to black people. Despite abundant historical evidence, youngsters are taught nothing about how the Founding Fathers quarreled, debated and agonized over the slave issue.

Yes it would be nice if it was more fair.  But what we see is nothing new what-so-ever.  Its just another cycle of discrimination and abuse of power.  There has always been and always will be a small portion of society that gain power, and then will do anything to maintain that power.  Where they see weakness, they see opportunity.  Marx and countless others saw this coming a long time ago. But the left arent any better, because once they gain power they tear each other apart as well. They fail to realize human nature and how power works, that's why they lost the cold war.        

The 'fair go', egalitarian idealism of Australian culture is fading as we catch up with the individualist, dog-eat-dog cultures of the US and Europe.  As everyone is becoming more informed than ever before, our innocence is fading, and we are learning to play the game.

The problem isnt the system, its people.  The system is simply the rules that determine the amount of opportunity and chaos, and how it controlled.

I've done some looking into 17th-19th cent. cookbooks, and there are plenty of recipes for preserving whole fruits or making jams and marmalades, but they also contained no fruit leather recipes. The crude step between the two is to lay the marmalade or jam out on a sheet to bake, but there are no recipes for this, nor any evidence that the thought would have occured to turn jam into fruit leather. Marmalades and jams were used as accents for breads and meats and as pie fillings -- many more tasty and practical uses than drying it out for jerky. And generally speaking, it's always been hard for poor folk or soldiers to get ahold of fruit, let alone have the time or equipment to turn it into much aside from preserves or eating it dried or raw (i.e. raisins, dried figs, etc.), and the parts of 19th century America most affected by the Civil War were not particularly wealthy areas. Fruit preservation by means of sugar was also a European method, so fruit leather wouldn't have come from the Native Americans, either.


**Edit:** Found documentation of the predecessor to the Fruit Roll-Up, the [Joray Fruit Roll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joray_Fruit_Rolls). It was introduced in New York by a Lebanese immigrant who founded a candy and/or baking company in 1886, and one of the cited articles claims the packaging appears to be dated to the 1950s. It was based off of a Lebanese apricot confection, so given that the makers were established after the end of the Civil War and is derived from a Lebanese recipe, I'd have to agree with your friend.",PonderousPlatypus

“The PROBLEM &amp; SOULTION are the same thing: FOOD!”  Rod Finley

Those that have known me for a while remember the 5 year stretch in which I was a vegetarian.  Some might even remember  prior to that when I could be found eating cheese sticks, chili fries, and a club sandwich on a daily basis. Yes; that was my tri-fecta! I also recall always having stomach aches, acid reflux, and flatulence. I got tired of feeling crappy, and decided to do a complete overhaul of my diet.  Though I understand now becoming a vegetarian was not the wisest choice; at least I tired.

I was 24 then.  I'm 37 now; I eat a high protein, medium fat, and low carbohydrate diet and I rarely have a stomach ache.  When I go the doctor for blood work and physicals- I get treated like a 4.0 student.    But I know plenty of folks who still eat like I ate when I was 21.  I know folks who eat fast-food everyday and happily wash it down with a Pepsi!  I know people that eat so many Better Made chips that they should own stock in the company.  I know folks that were borderline suicidal when they stopped making Twinkies.  Some of these people have grown to be obese, others have always been obese, and some are naturally lean.  I hear complaints about their weight, failed exercise attempts, and various medical problems.  

2 things the folks listed about have in common is that they're all black and they're all doing their bodies a great injustice.

The PROBLEM &amp; SOULTION are the same thing: FOOD!


This blog post is not about going organic or grass feed.  This post is not about supplementation or exercise.  All that stuff will get written about future posts.  This is about lifestyle changes and the easiest one to start with is limiting fast food.  This is simply about cooking your own patties instead of going through the drive-thru, making the chicken salad instead of buying fried chicken fingers, drinking a glass of water instead of grabbing a Coke, adding broccoli &amp; carrots with your meal instead of fries and onion rings.  The discussion has to start with buying your own groceries, cooking your own food 5 times a week, and making healthier choices.  

In some way or another – we are all slaves to convenience.  Remote controls, microwaves, cell phones, cubicle jobs, the internet, and fast-food has vice-grips on all us.  Its easier to make cereal for breakfast than steel cut oatmeal and eggs.  Most times you will drive past 10 fast-food restaurants on the way to the grocery store.

The PROBLEM &amp; SOULTION are the same thing: FOOD!

My grandmother didn't always practice the most optimal diet but certain things made a lot of sense.
-Fast food was a once a week experience (no matter how much I begged for a Big Mac).
-Cod Liver oil was given to me every night (“This will make you smart,” she said).
-Fish &amp; rice, beef stew &amp; peas, chicken &amp; green beans, salmon pattie and potatoes, were some of her combinations.
-We didn't own a microwave or buyh frozen meals until she passed and my grandfather and I were forced to fend for ourselves. Lol

I listed a series of diseases above and the problem has been laid out- now lets look at solutions


-The same thing that causes Alzheimer's is the same thing that causes diabetes.  Too much damn sugar.  There is sugar in bread, sugar in cereal, sugar in breakfast bars, sugar in low-fat food, etc.....  Alzheimer’s is like diabetes of the brain.  Since we all have I-Phones/Smart phones – when you go shopping  look up how much sugar you're buying either on the label or in your phone (i'm sure there is an app for that-lol)
-Bad fats and bad carbohydrates lead  to Heart disease and strokes.  This means limiting foods fried in vegetable or canola oil (when those oils get heated – they become toxic).  Here's another secret – you don't have to put flour on wings to make them taste good! lol  If upgrading to Coconut or Macedonia nut oil is too costly – then just bake your chicken!
- a reduction in colon issues and other intestinal concerns can be aided by proper fiber consumption.  Kale, spinach, Romain lettuce, and mix nuts are all excellent sources of fiber that should be consumed on a a regular basis. Aslo, saurkrout and cabbage has great probiotics in them to keep your gut healthy!
-The longer men live, the more likely they are to get prostate issues. But that doesn't mean they should die from them.  A decrease in processed carbohydrates and daily ejaculations will reduce possibly problems. 
-Eating bacon, chicken and steak won't take you to obesity land; but eating toast, jelly, corn, and cookies will.

The PROBLEM &amp; SOULTION are the same thing: FOOD!

These are just a handful or choices to think about but doing all those doesn't mean you won't live forever or you won't get sick.  But I'm all about stacking the odds in my favor, and lets me honest – do you really want to be on 30 different medications instead of just changing your eating habits?  Do it before its too late, the damn clock is ticking.



Again: I am not a doctor, personal trainer, health guru, nutrientalist, dietician, sociologist, or mastermind. In the grand scheme of things – I’m a nobody; a regular guy who figured out what works for me and maybe it will work for you. We are all made different with different metabolisms, genders, birth dates, different genetics/medical histories, and different body types. You have to make/learn what works for you.

Karma would probably stomp the shit out of him if he talked too much.  

But anyway, without winning, I can see some changes being made.  Mirx already looked like he was ready to quit during the Championship match vs. coL.  But like others said, they won't actually drop anyone prior to gFinity.  And if someone quit, it would screw them over because it's hard to find a replacement for a European tournament in a few weeks.

I would start by taking issue with the general perspective on peasants here and would in fact argue that peasants, by the sixteenth century at least, were both more aware and more interested in the wider world than has traditionally been argued. First we need to accept the limits of what we know here, the literature of more traditional social histories of the area sounds deceptively certain about what we know about ""peasants"". What I can assure you of is that in reality all we have are snapshots and that ""peasants"" - however we define them - have tended to be the victim of tremendous assumption by historians. The worst of these for me is the usage term itself, the very idea that we can ascribe universal characteristics to the commons of Britain (note by using this term we include Scotland and Wales), when they are largely writing illiterate and leave no records. How can we truly speak of ""peasants"" as a whole when we have such sporadic evidence? Second of all, consider that we talking about the sixteenth century and society is rapidly changing at this point. This is when we begin to see a departure from the medieval, this is not just the same as medieval Britain and should not be lumped in with it. However, moving on from these slightly de-constructive points I will now add a few things for you to think about that immediately spring to mind. I hope that this goes some way to demonstrating what the commons of Britain *could* know in the hopes of making this whole picture a little more three dimensional.

What I want to broadly talk about if the circulation of news, there are already answers given here by /u/bakuraptor that hint at one form coming from the parish priest. Notices were indeed read out after or during church services, I'm sure anyone familiar with church will know this still happens today. The difference is, that in the sixteenth century church and state were strongly intertwined and churches acted as a direct means of communication between monarch and subject. As a result when they wanted to report news of a victory, prime the population ahead of calling a parliament to request money or simply issue a decree about behaviour they took exception to, it would be read in church. As an aside point they also broadcasted the official message of the monarch, [homilies of obedience] (http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/noa/pdf/27636_16u23Homilies.1_2.tp.pdf) are an important and chilling example of the message that was preached. So, this was a form of news management, it spread the news that the monarchy wanted the population to hear, so doubtless in England at least, they would be aware of the more major events just through this.

Moving onto an area which exists at the margins of historical visibility, news was also spread through word of mouth. Again, it is difficult to speak definitively of this, but it is important not to underestimate it as a means of news dissemination. I lack a link on the internet, but I will summarise the content of  an important example I once encountered on this subject. It was in a letter from Ralph Sadler to Thomas Cromwell in 1638, Sadler was travelling through the North of England to get to Scotland on an ambassadorial mission. The north was still disturbed after the [Pilgrimage of Grace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage_of_Grace) so he was also reporting the state of the North of England on his way there. In his letter he details staying at an inn and upon arrival the population of the town began gathering outside. When he asked them what they wanted they replied asked him where he was going and if there was any news about measures taken to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. He replied that he was on his way to meet a Scottish official (I forget his title) to which they responded by saying this was impossible, as they knew he was in France. First of all this shows us how people in the know were canvassed for news by ordinary people, but also the extent of knowledge ordinary people could possess, the comings and goings of Scottish diplomatic missions was hardly expected to be common knowledge. Consider from this how much busier the roads were by the sixteenth century and how much location of the town or village defined their awareness of domestic and international events. I.e. lots of traffic probably = greater knowledge of the outside world and for this reason, settlements in Wales and the Highlands of Scotland likely knew less. The general historical consensus is actually that there was a substantial thirst for international news but domestic news was more tightly controlled. However, the late sixteenth century sees the occurrence for the first time of a [public sphere] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere) so knowledge of domestic news would have increased beyond what the monarch sought to broadcast from the 1580s (see John Stubb's Gaping Gulf, The Marprelate Tracts and Leicester's Commonwealth for examples)

Lastly, I would like to emphasise the impact of both the Reformation and  economic growth across the sixteenth century. First of all, the Reformation made people even more curious about the world around them, as  Protestants in Britain felt a kinship with those being persecuted in the Netherlands during the Dutch Revolt and France during the French Wars of Religion. The circulation of knowledge itself was substantially enhanced by the growth of textile manufacturing in England, with their international links which increased as the trade began to shift to Southern Europe and the Mediterranean in the latter part of the century. Uneven economic growth forced large amounts of the poor off their land in this century, forcing them to migrate to textile communities. Cloth merchants with their industry booming, travelled backwards and forwards to rural areas buying up wool and searching for potential spinners and weavers, acted to proliferate news and increase awareness of the outside world. Also during slumps in the textile industry, many who were out of work would be forced to migrated back out to villages again, further spreading the greater knowledge of the world gained in textile communities.

Unfortunately, from all of this I cannot truly provide you with a set answer to this question, as it is so difficult to truly know anything about this area. However I hope that this provides you with some idea of how much more nuanced the answer is than more traditional interpretations tell us. 

Incidentally if anyone wants specific sources for this I can provide them, but in general it comes from reading Joad Raymond, Keith Wrightson and Andy Wood.      ",SpurgalFinn

(hey OP mention that in your interviews)

Well you can clearly prove with statistics/math that each decision made has an expected value, whether negative, positive, or breakeven.  You just have to get individuals to understand that this expected value comes in the long run after encountering the similar situation numerous times.  That in the instance of this single hand (sample size = 1), that the expected value and amount you won/lost in this instance isn't going to be the same.

Also, to an extent you can show that there is a game theory optimal way to play poker.  It isn't by any means solved, at least not in no limit holdem (bots in HU limit holdem beat top players though).  Meaning there is a strategy (at least in some spots) you can employ that at worst is breakeven.  And that's only if the other individual is also employing an optimal strategy.  But against all other strategies, you will be winning.

&gt; Your point of view is very interesting to me because its culturally very different to my (European?) experience. Yes, some people think its pure luck in amateurs circles, but there is also respect for professionals, someone able to make a living out of it would be looked down (I think). I mention poker as a hobby in my resume, and it has always been, at worst, neutral.

Mostly it's just brought about by ignorance.  People seem to love taking a stern stance on things even when they don't have much knowledge on the situation.  I've played online as my sole source of income for a few years now, and still have friends/family that don't understand I'm not exactly gambling.  I play in home games with individuals who have played for years, that still routinely speak about how poker is ""all luck"".

To people that understand the game, winners are definitely respected.  But to me, it just seems like most people that don't understand the intricacies of poker view them as overall luckier than others.  They believe that the individuals that consistently do well in tournaments or bolster huge wins in cash games got there not because of their skill, but because of their luck.

Which honestly, isn't really a bad thing.  At least not when considering the profitability of poker.  If more people realized it was a game of skill then it's entirely likely less poor players would be playing.

Or the colonization and decolonization of Africa, or any of the Asian colonies. 

Columbus was indeed a scumbag for all the reasons you cite and more. But the problem is that his voyages were responsible in many ways for the world as we know it today. As much as I hate to attribute this to such a giant bag of dicks, his voyages kicked off the era of global interconnectedness, economically, culturally, even ecologically because of the interest in the West that his voyages generated. Not all of that is due to him, but a big part of it is. For example, it was American food crops which saved millions from famine in Ireland and China and other places over the next few centuries.    Potatoes did not exist outside of central and south america before they were brought to Europe by explorers. Neither did tomatoes or chile peppers. What's Italian food without tomatoes? None of that really excuses genocide or slavery, I'm just saying the world we live in today he is in very large part responsible for. We should acknowledge that as well as acknowledging his brutality and callousness, because that is how our world was born. I don't think it makes sense to deny either side of it. Columbus Day should be a day about learning how the world used to be and what happened to change it, good and bad. In that sense, it should be called Columbus Day because Columbus was emblematic of all the revolutionary change and violent brutality that came with exploration and colonization.

I wouldn't be surprised to find out that most of the protesters demanding handouts at the state capitol are Atheists, or Muslims.  The idea that you are directly responsible for your own actions is a pretty important moral thread to weave into society.  And regarding some of the tax hikes, it is action of a responsible society to pay for what it buys.  After 50 years of Democrat control, it is time to start balancing our budget.

&gt; You aren't IN /r/NorthCarolina, nimrod.

Uh, this is what I'm talking about.  Is there any doubt that you would downvote every comment I make?  Why give you the power of censorship?  Isn't the Left supposed to be about freedom of expression and listening to multiple points of view to arrive at a ""consensus""?  I wish more people would start looking at the *actions* for Liberals instead of listening to the nice things they say.  Their agenda is control in the form of Government.  

&gt;  Dirka dirka, muhammad Jihad! Your blasphemy is still there, at the bottom, with the garbage, where it belongs!

:) Like I said, the Left isn't interested in having an open dialogue.  They're just trolls who live on other people's tax dollars.  That's why they love the Government so much.  ",le_boux

That said, whatbox is better for Americans imo because Feral's upstream provider (cogent) has major congestion problems with one or more EU&lt;-&gt; US hops.  If you search the history in this subreddit, you'll see at least a half-dozen complaints (if not more) about slow transfer speeds between Feral's boxes and US end points.

Personally speaking, I can max out my home internet connection transferring from whatbox pretty much 24x7.  With Feral, I can do that in off-peak times (mostly morning, PDT), but am lucky to get 1Mbps during peak hours. (afternoon and evenings, PDT)

To be clear: this is out of Feral's direct control, but it does impact the ability to use their service for US customers.  I also think they should be pushing their upstream provider to do something about the problem as it's been happening for months now.

Both providers have outstanding service.  Feral is usually faster to respond than whatbox, though lately they've been having a lot of stuff going on due to OVH drama and some Debian upgrades.  Feral also has outstanding help/FAQ files if you're more of a DIY'er.

&gt;While economists expect the euro zone economy to stabilize in the course of this year after a recession that has lasted a year and a half, growth will likely remain too slow to generate large numbers of jobs.

&gt;Nor is there much hope of government policies that would stimulate growth. European leaders agreed last week on a plan to combat youth unemployment, which rose to 23.8 percent in May in the euro zone from 23 percent a year earlier. The youth jobs plan calls for accelerated spending of 6 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, a sum that some analysts said was too small to make a big dent in the problem. On Wednesday, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will host other European leaders at a conference in Berlin on youth employment.

Thats how they saw themselves (the Spaniards -referencing my use of the term civilized). They were not, in my opinion, but that is nether here nor there.

I'm in no way condoning anything that Christopher Columbus did, but it's important to view the actions of historical characters in a cultural and social context. There were plenty of other explorers during this time who did similar things to native peoples. 

The cold hard truth is that Europeans didn't see the ""barbarians"" as people. Therefore it wasn't an atrocity at that time. Not even in ""civilized"" parts of the world like Europe. Christopher Columbus and his counter parts likely grew up their entire lives being told this was the case.

I would expect the tire shop to handle the swap for you. If the rim is in-stock at the remanufacturer then they can do a 1-1 swap. If not then they may need to keep it 1-3 days to remanufacturer the wheel they took off.  

If repairable they'll re-machine it and powder coat it. Make a point of parking it in the sun and comparing the tint of the powder coating between the front and rear wheel. They should match. Make sure the tire pressure sensor is in working order before you leave (if you have TPS).

&gt; Are you seriously so petty that having a little bit of your tax money spent on something that might change the world for better is a horrible deed that must not be done?

Wasting taxpayer money by giving it to worthless Big Renewables companies who inevitably go bankrupt after lining the pockets of their executives isn't ""making the world a better place"".

Let the true believers fund renewables, leave taxpayer money out of it.  Its just a shame that the smart money **never** funds renewables.  Look at all the major EU companies pulling out of solar.  Its a bust.

Fracking and Nuclear are the future, renewables are an expensive farce.

&gt;Count in historical emissions, and oops, seems that China's emissions have been much lower than those of countries such as USA.

Two can play at that game.  I want China to be held accountable for **all** historical emissions.  I want China to be held accountable for every bit of emissions from every yak fart and rice field going back to 5000 BC.  Lets charge China for every tree they chopped down since prehistoric times.

**Historical Emissions is the most baseless theory in climate mitigation.  Its nothing more than another China Greenwashing exercise.**

[Le Roi et L'oiseau](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZJtMim3Cag) (The King and the Bird) is acclaimed in Europe and Japan, but virtually unknown in the US. I feel that it's underrated because it's influence on other work spans everything from Disney &amp; Don Bluthe to Studio Ghibli.

With the advent of computer resources the actual cost of educating students has gone down significantly.  Your books can put put online, you can have online lectures, and we can even fill classes much more efficiently.  It would then be assumed logically that prices should have been flat or falling the past 30 years, however that clearly hasn't been the case. 

When we examine European countries where the state controls costs, like France, the advances in technology have saved them money.  They can afford to let kids attend college for almost no cost and in some cases paying them a subsidy.  Yet the US uses a student loan model in which the 16-17 year old decision makers who decide which colleges are receive the payout from the loans are not price sensitive and are making their decisions on a superficial basis.  

This creates a system where colleges are rewarded for funding sports teams and building extremely fancy and aesthetic pleasing buildings.  Things that appeal to 16-17 year old students.  However things that won't immediately appeal to young students are put to the way side.  This includes paying professors to teach their classes instead of grad students or having an extremely well funded placement programs to get them a job. 

The reason it is such a dramatic market failure is that individual decision makers have little recourse.  16-17 year olds will always lack price sensitivity and thus tuition won't fall as long as the loans exist to sustain the cost.

To 'buck the system' and try to self teach would dramatically reduce a persons employment options.  Going to a community college is a possibility but that has its own limitations.  The most efficient decision for most students is to take out student loans and hope to find employment on their own.  Which feeds into the market failure further.",oceanlifetime
