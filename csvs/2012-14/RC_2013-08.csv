A) no full-time working person with a family has time to investigate every single Monsanto (or whoever) subsidiary, remove every product from their grocery list, and find an affordable alternative. Most working people don't have time to keep up with what new artificial flavors the FDA is permitting. 

B) Any watchdog system that wants to be effective will most likely have to be state run. There is no civilian, non-state equivalent that will be able to keep up with the size, scope, and funding of a corporate structure that is already unbelievably skilled at circling the wagons to protect itself. The state has not proven effective at this so far, but that's because the inmates have bought out much of the asylum. 

&gt; My point is that capitalism, (and thus the private enterprise system) is a bottom-up, evolutionary system that is largely successful without any top-down direction. 

Untrue, and especially untrue if we look at the most successful countries and then control for quality of living. There are 0 countries that are employing a capitalist system without top-down direction. That said, the countries that do the best, and have the highest quality of life on average (Japan, Western Europe, perhaps Canada) control corporations and capitalism quite a bit. The countries that exercise less restraint, the U.S., China, (most third world countries): are selling out their resources as fast as they can,  at the price of gutting the bottom 2/3rds of society (by under-educating, under-employing, and imprisoning them) to benefit the top 1/3rd (mostly through moves decided by the top .05%, whose kids worldwide go to school with one another.)

Also, check out the book ""The Shock Doctrine""

&gt;business owners are not disproportionately malicious villains that want to be rich and make everyone else poor.

Actually, according to top-down unrestrained capitalism, that's exactly what they are. That's certainly what major multi-industrial conglomerates hope to achieve. But I think I know what you mean:

It's not about malicious villains. It's that most people in western society tend to do what capitalism does: choose their favorite thing. The absolute highest return for themselves no matter what the cost to others. Like [this].(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQSRPMFDTSs) Unless there's some kind of a law, tax, or misdirection.

One other thing I'd point out is that this is not entirely isolated to foreigners...

Most were traders and once they became fluent in the Māori language, acted as translators and go-betweens. They would marry Māori women, often in arranged marriages to the daughters of important chiefs which was a way of ensuring their loyalty to the host tribe. Many of them chose to defect from European society either to avoid restrictive social norms or because they were on the run from the law. They adopted Māori clothing and customs, and some even fought with Māori in inter-tribal conflicts. 

Later, during the New Zealand land wars, there were a few cases where Europeans would join belligerent Māori groups and fight with them against British or colonial armed forces. A famous example was [Kimble Bent](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1b19/bent-kimble), an American by birth who joined the British Army and deserted after suffering harsh punishments for insubordination, drinking and theft.

He was forcibly married and met several other deserters who were assisting Māori forces in various ways, including manufacturing gunpowder. During Titokowaru's war in 1868, he tended the wounded, repaired weapons and extracted gunpowder from shells and grenades. After the war he was considered a traitor by the colonists, so continued to live among Māori in obscurity for many years until being [tracked down by historian James Cowan and interviewed for a book, which made him famous](http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-CowKimb.html).

Which is linked through that WSJ article actually does an effort to correct the analysis (or tries to anyway).  

and comes up with a figure of 26% rather than 17%.  

Which doesn't seem to fundamentally change the argument that to increase pay you'd need to increase prices.   Ok so a 4 dollar hamburger would become a 5.04 rather than 4.68.  

All of the analysis is basically useless though.  How much would you have to increase pay down the production chain to all of the people who work for a McDonalds supplier etc?   European McDonalds, that pay higher wages (France and the UK particularly) would be interesting to compare to their US counterparts, but that data isn't trivially available.  

McDonalds doesn't have their pay itemized by employee type either.  Ideally you'd like to know what percentage of employees are in what pay scale.  You could have 1 CEO making 9 million dollars a year and 325 000 employees working 2000 hours a year (each) for 7.25 an hour - but that would be nonsense.   If they have 6500 employees at corporate taking in 50% of the 4.7 billion dollars in payroll (~350k/employee then) you'd be saying something about how pay is divided up at McDonalds.

And if you read the sidebar Core is better suited for /r/metalcore. And most of the genres you mentioned don't even exist. Southern metal? PopCore? As i said Core isn't metal (except for grindcore). 
Let me break it down for you guys. Here is the most accepted version of breaking down metal genres: In metal there are tons of terms that you need to keep in mind when branding or labeling a band/album/song. The main word in a metalgenre are of course Metal, you can combine it with dozens of words like: Progressive, Death, Power, Black, Doom, Thrash, Heavy, Folk and Pagan. 
Progressive Metal is often very technical, often contains weird time signatures and alot of instrumental parts. 
Heavy metal is hard to describe but it's the classics like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. 
Thrash metal was one of the first ''new subgenres'' of Heavy metal. It was a movement started/made famous by Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax.[Thrash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB8OvPtf_d0). It was Punk mixed with the new wave of British heavy metal(Iron Maiden and Saxon ETC). Very fast and not very complicated but it can also be very complicated and technical. Thrash was/is inspired by Punks lyrical themes like politics, society and sometimes just about partying. 
After Thrash there came a new genre from the northern regions of Europe called Scandinavia, mostly Norway and it was called Black metal. [Black metal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZmDL_PzvdY) is another mixture of Punk and Metal but in a much more darker and more ''brutal way''. The black metal movement focused more on satanism and darker subjects than Thrash did and the sound was darker. Black metal was really the genre that made the double bass pedal drums more present in metal. Black metal is known for its on purpose low quality recordings. 
After black came Death metal, pretty much at the same time but a little bit later. Death metal took the drums from black metal and the guitar riffs from thrash metal and combined it to what most people call the most brutal Metal genre, involving lyrics sung with either a pretty [highpitched](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHk7HOS11YA) or a [low-end](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Jjy3Zy7kk) growl. The lyrical themes of death metal includes but are not limited to:Death, Torture, War and mutilation of the human body.
Black and Death metal are usually the hardest to get into just because of their harsh sound but they are my favorites. 
Now the easiest way to get into metal is through Power Metal, if you ask me. Why? Although it is fast and very interesting it contains all the things that make pop music popular. It often has a catchy chorus, a lot of nice melodies and the lyrics aren't about very dark things. Power metal lyrics are often inspired by fantasy. Dragons, swords and knights are very popular topics in power metal, epic tales about great battles are also popular.  One band i would really recommend is [Sabaton] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFO0Xo9TZ54), They do power metal but sing about The first and second world war. Their singer is very talented and the lyrics are really good.
Folk Metal is another very good genre for beginners in metal. Folk metal is Metal mixed with folk music. They often use violins, the harp or other instruments not common in metal. Folk metal is a genre that almost never sounds the same because the only rule is that it should have some folk instruments in it or atleast a keyboard that can mimic the sound of it. I would recommend the band [Ensiferum] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyvPe0uqjjY). 
Pagan metal is a genre that is very similar to folk metal but is often alot darker and more focused on chanting than using folk-instruments. It's very famous to combine pagan and black metal because of their dark sound. A band that i would recommend here is [Bathory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6DF6TePZh4). Because they started playing before the Pagan Metal movement, they aren't actually considered pagan metal but if you wanna know how Pagan metal can sound then check 'em out.
The last one is Doom/stoner Metal. Doom/stoner Metal is a very slow metal genre. Listen to  early Black Sabbath if you want to know how it sounds. Just like Bathory came before the pagan metal movement, Black Sabbath came ages before Doom Metal but listen to [Black Sabbath](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6VdTVsLiRQ) and you will understand the genre. The notes are really long, dragged out and sound very heavy. The vocals can be done however the singer wants, no requirements at all, preferably dragged out long notes just like the guitar. 
Now that you have heard of the basic subgenres there is one more thing you need to know. There are some terms that are used to describe the genres even more. [Technical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Jjy3Zy7kk):It's obvious, more advanced guitar, bass and drum playing. [Melodic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTzu0mGnQGU): Also obvious, the guitar doesn't focus on being technical or playing fast, just on sounding beautiful.
But really if you wanna learn about metal you should try to experience it. This isn't even enough to explain the basics of metal. Just listen to the links i've posted and tell me if there is anything you like or are interested in, i can show you more.

I live near Oakland and I actually have seen innocent people attacked/harassed and stores being burned/trashed more than once in the past few years.

Things have gotten better though. In decades past, when US was at the socio-political level of China, rallies/riots had gotten to the point that an entire black neighborhood was attacked/bombed.

This isn't to bash the US, but to point out that the problems you're talking about are hardly uniquely East Asian... that even a place like the US deals with these sorts of issues. It's the norm, except for most of the US and a few European countries at the moment. South Asia has India/Pakistan and a bunch of others. In South East Asia, racial riots as violent as the 1998 Jakarta riot are still fresh in many minds.. 

Even for the US, it's only relatively recently we've reached this rather peaceful state and no small part due to the lack of threat we faced. The last time we seriously faced threat, from 9/11 disaster, a lot of brown people were attacked and/or harassed (e.g. chemical attacks in care centers, a Sikh man killed).

It's interesting that the last time we in the US/Canada (that I know of) made a major fuss about Taro Aso visiting the war shrines and how angry so many Chinese had to have been, hardly anyone noticed in China except for loud/angry fringe groups. Even the Chinese state media didn't say much about it and chose to focus on a Sino-Japanese political conference as well as a business deal involving opening the market to Hello Kitty. Of course, you rather talk about something more exciting and contentious?

In any case, that's not what I even had the most issue with. Of course different groups around the world will have some grudges towards each other left over from WW2 era. I noticed you've avoided going back into the bold claim you made earlier, *""We believe we are better than any other race.""*"

I started a WordPress blog on April1, seriously!  After much investigation of platforms, WP just seemed to be the best combination of usability and noninvasive (i.e. Google).  I won't spam here, but it's an art blog, and after years of consuming others I pretty much knew exactly what I wanted and how i would maintain it, and WP had the tools.  After 4 months it has been flawless, easy, and awesome, I plan to move my actual for profit company from static html to WP later when time allows.  The difficulties I faced were:

Themes: it's like buying white paint at Home Depot, how can there be 1001 shades of white / WP themes and none of them good enough?  As an industrial designer, I both listed and sketched what I wanted, it was a frustrating conundrum that no themes were good enough.  I chose Ari, and heavily modified it.

Hacking.  Seriously, what the hell is going on here.  Everywhere, even on Reddit r/wordpress, it's just hacked, hacked, and hacked.  Lots of advice on hardening, but, come on.  I know the entire continent of eastern Europe is home to several million pHd programmer hackers, but it was almost enough to scare me off, basically, not if but when, and if I listen to the loud talkers, it will take about 9 minutes from loading until some Bulgarian defaces my Wordpress front page.  Extremely weird, I even had a dream 1 night after showing my blog to my old art professor that it was hacked with golden ""praying hands of Jesus"" over front page!!!

Matt - as a 30+ year product developer - this is a fundamental marketable feature: strength, robustness, but also fundamentally unsexy.  The only thing Wordpress publishes on this is reactive: how to harden after installation, how to backup and reinstall for when you've been hacked.  Basically, FU is my attitude when I see such mediocre fatalism; this is a domain previously owned by Microsoft.

Okay, so all that aside, as a novice, self taught html'er, Wordpress is a simple joy to use.  As an artist, it takes me from 1 day to one month to create a new work, and about 30 seconds to upload a new post for the world to see: this is how it should be.  I deeply appreciate that WP requires nothing of or from me (unlike 4th Reich Google), and your partners' one button installation is gold, pure gold."

So let me say this, the idea of ""race"" is an entirely social construct, and there are several reasons supporting this, primarily of course, that humans beings are the only creatures that for some reason have ""race"" added to their taxonomic rank. Every other creature for some reason simple ends at species.

Secondly is the idea of a viable offspring, if you mate a lion with tiger, even though they're incredibly similar, will not yield a fertile offspring, the same applies for donkeys and horses (mules) they are all sterile, asian and african elephants also face this problem. So, different species, this doesn't apply to us humans. We have viable, and healthy offspring. As an aside, women (when not on the pill) are actually attracted to different mates, this is also one reason why incest is considered taboo. Evidence for that is a simple glance at all cultures, where cannibalism, murder and incest is taboo, regardless of distance or contact with other societies.

As for ""europids"" which incidentally I've never come across in my years at university (however a cursory google search points to white power websites as the top users) Is actually a reference to the caucasoid ""race."" Which incidentally includes northern africa, the middle east, and south asia. Another thing you learn in anthropology 101 is that ""race"" is never discussed, because its part of sociology, and has been dismissed a long time ago as irrelevant, being that it was a part of the eugenics movement.

As for the original europeans, I hate to break it to you, if you go back far enough homo sapiens were invasive, and we eradicated the neanderthal by being more efficient, warfare and outbreeding them.

But lets forget your misquotation of the social sciences and lets pretend you studied sociology for 4 years (from 12-16) this is where you can argue with the notion of race, the problem of course is that unlike the other sciences, definitions here change. If we go back even 60 years, during the mass immigration to the US of Italians and Irish, we find ""scientific"" documents pointing to the inferiority of these ""races."" Go back a little more and we see that the slavs were considered sub human according to the germanic peoples. If we go back to the middle ages, instead of race, we had class. Royalty was superior, nobles were considered a better stock of people compared to commoners, and lateral movement was all but nonexistent. So the idea of race is very flexible, and is constantly brought up during times of xenophobia, in order to rally a people, there had to be a distinct established difference that made ""us"" better than ""them.""


Last but not least, you're evading the questions I asked, you're resorting to a physical difference when I'm asking you about the cultural variances, these are things that YOU brought up with your words of ""white culture."" Saying white ulture is as ridiculous as saying asian culture or brown culture, it just doesn't make sense anyway you look at it, the orthodox church of russia is culturally closer to the ethiopian orthodox church than any other of the ""white"" christian churches, European languages themselves don't even share the same roots. and I'm still waiting for an answer, so I reject your arrogant dismissal and I eagerly await your response.

""You still have allowed your country to fall behind Europe when it comes to politics, education, and human rights.""

We have been behind for quite a while. We missed the whole Renaissance thing and were late to the Industrial Revolution. Well, we did have the only true republic in Europe during the Dark Ages (see The Novgorod Republic). In the beginning of the 20th century, our social democrat revolution was subverted by an international cabal of Bolsheviks, who were financed from Germany and the US. They raped our people and culture, keeping us behind the Iron Curtain for 70 years. We were much less isolated than places like North Korea, but still pretty isolated and kept away from your sexual revolutions, civil rights movements and other such social progress thing.

As far as our current economic situation, we've had 15 years of solid growth (with a small post World Economic Crisis dip in 2009). The real income and the size of the middle class have increased by 500%, industrial output by 70%, domestic service industries - 600%, poverty levels decreased significantly, low unemployment rate, average life expectancies are back to Soviet levels, the population is growing again... all terrible stuff, right? In fact, this year World Bank has declared that as far as overall, nominal GDP (PPP), our economy has become the largest in Europe and also added us the the list of ""high income countries"". 

Natural resources exports account for a quarter to a third of our GDP, but they are not even close to being depleted and in contrast to the Yeltsin Era, the majority of the proceeds are not pocketed by the oligarchs and their Western ""benefactors"" and moved out of the country. We have a Norway style National Stabilization Fund, which has helped us weather the 2008 World Econ Crisis better than most. We have also paid off all of us enormous Soviet era international debt and currently have some of the largest currency and gold reserves. 

Putin is far from an ideal leader, but he has been ""the right man at the right time"" and is far better than Yeltsin or any of the current opposition politicians. The Western press has basically been slandering and libeling the man with one baseless accusation and innuendo after another, because the West hates seeing a re-emerging strong and fiercely independent Russia, which is not ruled by an easily-manipulated drunken buffoon and doesn't act like a defeated bitch.

I don't care that he's ex-KGB. At some point in the 70's, the KGB stopped recruiting people based on ideology and blind loyalty and actually went for the best and the brightest. You know who else was KGB? Andropov - the guy who recognized that things couldn't go on the way that they were and carefully pulled the string in order to position an obscure provincial Party boss with progressive ideas (Gorby) into power. You know who Gorby is, right? He is the guy who dismantled the Soviet dictatorship from within and set Eastern Europe (including Russia) free.

We don't provide anything of value? Well, our weapons and space launch services are still pretty popular, we have some of the best programmers and mathematicians in the world and still have the best opera and ballet around. 

Putin actually has been really supportive of ethnic and religious minorities, passing a bunch of laws to protect their rights and feelings, investing countless billions into rebuilding Chechnya. Russian nationalists (most the opposition) hate his guts for it. But yes, we do have a lot of moronic and corrupt politicians. Putin sacked some of the worst ones, like the former mayor of Moscow Luzhkov and the corrupt idiot former defense minister, but there are a lot more of them to get to. So, here's my real comeback. "

The Byzantines held many of the ancient Greek manuscripts at the Library of Constantinople until its destruction during the Sack of Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders in 1204. They had virtually all of the ancient Greek and Roman works of science, philosophy, etc. at their fingertips - just look at the Suda or read Michael Psellos or Anna Komnene for proof - almost none of that ancient knowledge died out during the height of the Empire. It's a common misconception that the Saracens were the ones who preserved the ancient works for the entirety of the medieval period. They helped, but they certainly didn't do all of the work!

After the sack of the Byzantine Capital, the Muslim scholars had plenty of copies of those texts left over (and frequently used) from the intercultural and interscholastic exchange between the Byzantines and the Arabs/Turks, and so preserved what was lost until the rediscovery of such texts during the early Renaissance and beyond. It was the fall of the Empire, as well as the rise of the Italian maritime powers like Venice that brought such works back from the East and began a full-fledged revival of scholasticism and study of the ancient works in the Latin West.

**To answer your question:** I would definitely argue against people saying that the Muslim translations weren't important in preserving the ancient works. Even if some of the works survived in the Latin West, not all of them would have - and early scholars during the Renaissance would have needed access to more than just the few that were available in the West. Remember, by that time, the Library of Constantinople (the largest Christian library for almost 1000 years) had been destroyed. They would have needed the Arabic translations to further their study.

 The positive cultural interaction during the reign of the Komnenoi between the Byzantines and the Italian maritime states probably provided a good amount of these works to those who wanted them, but from what I have read, the Italians and the Crusaders probably weren't too interested in philosophy or science - they seem to care more about conquest and money (but that could be a Byzantine bias, but it's hard to tell because the Byzantine authors didn't seem to mind mentioning Arab/Turkish scholars when they came around). If I were to come across some mention in the primary sources of a Latin philosopher in the Empire, I would mention them, but I am not aware of one during that time that the Byzantines knew about. Perhaps someone specializing more in Latin scholasticism during that period (c. 1100-1500) would be of better help. I'm sure there were some (there always were in Latin Europe) but they were usually monks/clergy, and therefore only made up a small portion of the population."

James Watt, in 1780's, took a concept and design that was already in existence, and got credit for it by using it on an industrial scale (edit: Ok, he did improve the efficiency by a few % with some tinkering, but not some paradigm shifting change). The limiting factor for it to take off wasn't the steam engine itself, but rather finding suitable fuel in large enough amounts to feed it's voracious appetite... English coal mines, and a job to do that required that large amount of power... pumping water from English coal mines. Kind of recursive, but that was the logic behind it.

Gaskets, another requirement for the industrial revolution (needed for the steam engine) were in use in Roman times to seal plumbing in the form of clay. In the 1200's people made gaskets from wax for plumbing. But no material would withstand the conditions of the steam engine for very long until natural rubber came along. It was found in Brazil during Portuguese and Spanish colonialism.

And steel was very ancient, it had been around forever, and the innovations in the materials science to make it suitable for use in steam engines had also been around long before the industrial revolution. But the vast mines in the Americas, for steel and all kinds of metals (not to mention the slaves to mine it, who were often just standing right atop the mine, how convenient), were like opening floodgates.

Sure oil had been around but it was in precious little quantities, that's why there was a whaling industry. Rubber was (to Europeans) a brand new substance. Even the phenomenon of material elasticity didn't exist in European science until rubber was found, they had to invent the term.

To me it looks like the innovations came first, and there they waited in the annals of human knowledge until a satisfactory material was found, extracted, exploited and put to the task of solving long-standing, yet stubborn problems.

I admit, I am not well-read on the preservation of philosophy in Latin Europe during the medieval period. This would be a great question for an expert on the subject.

&gt; Was it previously popular then lost because of any event then reintroduced by venice, genoa and so on, or western Europe never had that much interest on it for start?

Again, better to ask an expert, but as far as I can tell from the chronicles of the Crusades and from Byzantine sources (who often paint the Latins as ""barbarians"", mind you), it seems that a lot of the ancient philosophy and science was forgotten by a vast, vast majority of the population. However, many monks and church scholars had some understanding of the ancient works - take a look at the Venerable Bede for an example.

&gt; Also, on the Constantinople sack, the library was aimed at by the crusaders or was it just a sort of collateral damage?

Although not much is certain, some say that it was burned because it was a symbol of Byzantine wealth and grandeur. It could have been an accident, but, I'd say it wasn't because the Latins destroyed many of the most prominent buildings and statues in the city (barring some holy churches, like the Hagia Sophia) when they stormed it. They wanted to establish a Western kingdom (the Latin Empire) in the East and probably wanted to remove as many traces of the Empire as possible. The Byzantine Empire was a powerful rival to the Latin West, and for much of its history, could not be challenged by any kingdom under the nominal direction of the Pope. This was finally a chance for the Latins (both the Pope and the Western kingdoms) to rid themselves of what they saw as a nearly invincible and bossy/manipulative rival who hindered trade and kept all the wealth for themselves. With Constantinople under the control of a Latin Kingdom, the ruling at the old Council of Chalcedon (that the religious authority of Constantinople was the essential equal of Rome) was rendered invalid, and therefore, the Latin Pope had no rival to share in his power - he was the sole leader of all of Christendom. 

&gt; I wonder if there was any animosity and call to destruction of these pagan works by the roman churchn even known that Constantinople wasn't what the churche aimed for during this crusade.

See, the Crusade wasn't supposed to go to Constantinople, it was to retake Jerusalem. But the Venetians, who were running the show saw an opportunity and sought revenge:

1. The massacre of the Latins, which occurred in 1182 when Andronikos Komnenos (the deviant outcast of the Komnenos family) stormed into the Byzantine Capital and usurped the throne from the rightful heir, Alexios II (who was in the care of his mother Maria, because he was a child). Some Greek people didn't like the fact that the Italians were given accommodations inside of the Capital (and because they sometimes raided eachother's quarters for business disputes), and so, a number of Greek ruffians, along with Andronikos' army, murdered 10,000 Italian merchants and their families when the Capital was overtaken. 

2. The Venetians had hated paying taxes to the Empire to trade with the Middle East (their primary source of trade income, which was very important to them), but had no way to circumvent the Empire's navy patrols or ports. Alexios I Komnenos, and the subsequent Komnenoi, gave the Venetians some reductions on these taxes, but the Venetians still saw this as a burden to their trade empire. 

3. Andronikos' actions destroyed the Komnenoi dynasty (he was a murderous tyrannical xenophobe) and he was killed after only 3 years of rule. His successors, the Angeloi, were lazy and incompetent and drove the Empire's military into the ground. In 1204, Constantinople was a weakly defended, but incredibly wealthy prize. An easy target for the massive Crusader army.

Historically, Korea is a tributary vassal state of China for hundreds of years, so China considers Korea to be within her exclusive sphere of influence.

China intervened on N. Korea's behalf because she wanted to demonstrate her willingness to aid/protect her tributary allies, and wanted to reaffirm her historical status as the supreme military power in East Asia, which after the ""century of humiliation"" at the hands of Europeans/Japanese, has led China to have the moniker (東亞病夫;Sick Man of East Asia) which she tried to rectify.

Historically, the most successful invasion routes to conquer China was through the North East, through Manchuria (located next to Korea). The Mongols, Manchus, and Japanese bypassed Manchuria to conquer China (hence the Great Wall is located along the North East), and China thought the U.S. could use North Korea as a springhead into China for KMT Taiwan troops just like Imperial Japan invaded China through Manchuria.

Tang China allied with Silla Korea, Yuan China with Koguryo, Ming China with Joseon, Qing China with Joseon, and PRC with DPRK... it's an alliance that dates back thousands of years."

* In some countries, for religious reasons. In some Islamic countries, alcohol is illegal. This is not as irrelevant to non-Islamic countries as you might think: a plant containing mescaline was banned in Christian Europe partly for religious reasons (rather vague associations with the devil) at the time. Non-Muslims in Ethiopia were not allowed to drink coffee, as it was seen as a Muslim drink. Recently the Taliban banned opium as it was against Islam.
* Often as a political response to a more localised problem. The Harrison act (and other laws) regulated and taxed opium as a countermeasure to Chinese opium dens in the States, for instance. These opium dens were generally seen as places that young men and women would be coerced into going to and they would become addicted, fall into immoral practices, and have their lives ruined, which caused national outcry. Drugs were far less well understood at the time, of course, and so limiting their use was the only way of making people conscious that they were dangerous."

Washington's main focus in foreign policy was to remain neutral in the war between Britain and France. As for commerce, he was more than happy to make trade agreements with Europe, but wanted to avoid special preference to individual countries over others. It was too easy to get caught up in another country's political affairs when special preference was given. I don't think there was much concern with Europe's banking system other than the debt that the U.S. needed to repay. Washington stressed that the debt should not be a burden on the next generation. (If only our current president felt that way!)

&gt;I've also noted his desires to see America move towards a Union and away from confederation.

Yes, George Washington was a staunch Federalist. He had good reason to be, as that was the only way America was going to defeat the British and form a country strong enough to repel potential foreign invaders. He still believed in State rights for domestic affairs.

&gt;Today I would like to see stronger State governments and the Federal government become less pervasive - something that will not happen.

I agree that there should be stronger State governments. I think the NSA leaks are giving State governments strong incentive to assert themselves. Also, the movements in some States to legalize marijuana is another example. I think you are witnessing a shift to stronger State governments, as more people become frustrated with the state of affairs of our Federal government."

Say you're a rancher and you don't like wolves because they eat your livestock. So you and your rancher buddies go on an extermination campaign to kill every wolf you can find until they no longer exist. This is exactly what happened all over Europe and North America. It is still happening today in a few states, including Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

So once your wolves are gone, your deer no longer have natural predators (or your elk or moose or other large herbivores). So they reproduce, and they eat much more than they would normally eat. If they're desperate enough, they will eat tree saplings, which suppresses forest growth.

So when you drive away wolf populations, a direct consequence of that is your forests start to disappear. This is due to ""deer overpopulation,"" but it's really just one aspect of a larger imbalance."

Insurance companies, on the other hand, can then say ""welp, the system is working because we negotiated the price down 11,000%, without us protecting the consumer health care costs would be out of control!"" and justify their continued existence.

All of this is in German for the Bundesliga. It'd be like if you follow an English club you'd have to do without any British media outlet. You'd only understand what the men in charge at your club say in some interviews if somebody translates it for you, and you hope that there aren't any translating errors (like it sometimes happens once some of your country's papers pick up the story, most of the time days later)

Now NBC will offer (I think) a lot of matchday analysis, plus rumours and stuff. So maybe you'll be alright just watching and reading American media and ignoring the British media and still feel well informed. But this NBC deal happened after the EPL was by far the strongest league in America.

As far as I know the most popular league in South America is La Liga. In America it's the EPL (and I think the growing Spanish speaking population is rather fond of La LIga as well). I honestly don't see how the Bundesliga could make up the native language advantage those two leagues have in those regions.

I think the Bundesliga should focus more on the Eastern European, Middle Eastern and Asian market (although the EPL has quite a head start there). I think the American market is a lost cause for the Bundesliga. The EPL has the advantage that English is an often spoken second language, but maybe in some of those regions it won't matter much"

It is certainly not the intention of the refugee convention that you are a refugee if you can get a better quality of life somewhere else.  And it is not interpreted that way in Australia.

With good insurance you basically only have to pay the deductible and then insurance will take care of most of the cost after that. **You will still have to pay a certain percentage but you can usually pay that off within a few years at most.**

And how the fuck is paying for a few years acceptable if you had a medical emergency WITH a good insurance? Here in Europe, everything is free. You don't have people dying in their house because they are afraid to be financially ruined if they go to a hospital. I have also seen another American a few days ago claiming that his huge student debt was worth it for his experience with college. Well of course getting an education in the field you enjoy is worth it but the cost is still outrageous. Your leaders have you paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for basic human necessities like healthcare and education and you fuckers actually settled with that idea. I don't even know why I care so much....I live in Europe where these things are free and I never intend to go to the US...but as a fellow human being it just makes me so mad how some assholes are making a fortune by charging their people for basic healthcare and education...there is no way in hell those prices can be justified other that pure greed. And the saddest thing about it is how you all fall in line and take it...and actually have come to view it as ""normal"". 

And by the way, don't be fooled by the fact that you guys pay lower income tax. Sure, we here in the EU have healthcare and education covered because we pay higher income taxes....but you can go to a private school or medical center. They are all quite well equipped and, at least for medical centers, just as good as the state hospitals. So these people have no backing from the state but still their prices are perfectly affordable. So if you have a medical emergency in the US WITH good insurance you still have to pay off that debt in a few years time. But if the same happens in the EU WITH NO INSURANCE at all (because you go to a private clinic) you can pay it off from your wallet, no problem. The US people get charged 100x more for no reason at all...other than pure greed. And not for luxury items....but for basic necessities. Fuck everything about your system. People would burn down government buildings if they tried this shit in Europe.

I'm not debating whether or not white people have it easier, because we do. However, to give a personal example. My grandparents came to the U.S. from Latvia, a tiny European country on the Baltic sea. After WWII, the Russians came in and established Latvia as a puppet state, taking most if not all of my grandparents material/monetary possessions. Fast forward 5-10 years and fleeing the country,  my Grandma has completed her grad/med school to become a psychiatrist and my grandpa has gotten his degree in physics. After achieving their degrees with support only from kind and generous individuals, they both managed to (albeit difficultly) immigrate to the U.S. Through hard work and determination, my grandparents were able to build up a comfortable lifestyle and buy a home/become decently well off. The point of this story is that to claim that they got to where they were because they are white, cheapens their struggle. If I (and let me be clear that I don't actually believe this) claimed that someone was successful only because of affirmative action, how insulting would that be? It undermines their hard work and in my opinion is wrong to say to *anyone* regardless of race.

Museum/curative studies and work within is one of the most cutthroat and competitive areas in the humanities. I had thought about it, but when I spoke to my advisor, she was honest and upfront about the lack of jobs available for qualified graduates. As a result of this, the truth is you have very little, to no, chance of finding a position in a European institution. There are enough historians, anthropologists, and sociologists graduating to take those positions, specialisation in curation or not.

It'll nearly be required you speak the local language and have a specialisation/expertise (published work, experience teaching on the graduate level, or field-work) in part to one of the exhibits or ""theme"" of the museum (as, if I recall, there was an Israeli working in the Budapest Holocaust Memorial Centre). Your best bet is to decide if you want to build experience and then attempt or try for Europe.

It is becoming harder for Americans to score tefl visas in certain countries either through limited numbers or programme reforms. This is particularly true in Western Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe you still have a viable shot at receiving a visa, but you will need accreditation.  I know what it is like to want to do something and feel frustrated that it doesn't give you the full suite. Do you want your job or do you want Europe?

With anthropology, there are also a lot of options in the Middle East. I have two friends doing field-work out there who are absolutely loving it. One of them is hoping to convert it to working in France (she's been out there for five years now) and it is looking very likely, mostly due to her experience. You may need to go somewhere you don't want to go to build the experience and either way - Europe is going to be hard.

If you don't like ""surviving"" I think TEFL in Europe is not the way to go. It's a great way to experience life for a short period, but it can be very hand-to-mouth and living beneath the traditional poverty belt (ie: 50% of your salary to rent). Even in cities like Budapest where the cost of living is low, English teachers don't make a huge amount, which then reduces doing all the great stuff in Europe like travel (though budget airlines and hostels do help). The only other thing I'd suggest is try and get involved with finance such as payroll administration and attempt to learn book-keeping and accountancy. You'd be amazed at how many financial-orientated people are moved around."

12 tickets de $145 pour un règlement municipal qui n'existait plus depuis 5 ans. 

Mais j'ai été condamné in abstensia par un tribunal secret (ça existe, j'y suis allé subséquemment, et c'est tellement secret qu'il n'y a pas du tout de place pour le public) pour un des tickets, puis acquitté pour un autre (TOUS les tickets étaient IDENTIQUES), puis assigné à comparaitre pour les 10 autres. Pour cinq d'entre eux, ça a pris 30 secondes pour convaincre le procureur de laisser tomber, jusqu'à ce que je tombe sur un enfant de chienne sale de crotté de tête dure de procureur à la marde qui a voulu aller de l'avant, car il ne me croyait pas que le l'article du règlement avait été abrogé.

Ce crétin là a d'ailleurs petté une coche après que je lui ai montré non-seulement  la copie du règlement avec l'article abrogé (il ne l'avait pas), mais également une copie du règlement qui abrogeait l'article en question (ça avait rondement marché auparavant). ""Où avez-vous trouvé ça???"" qu'il s'écrie... Le site web de la ville est de la câlisse de grosse marde; impossible de trouver un règlement, et j'ai même vu le greffier en chef, en personne, de Montréal être incapable de trouver ce règlement sur leur système informatique!!!!

- ""Je  l'ai trouvé avec Google!"", que je lui répond, ce qui lui a fait petter une coche ""c'est pas valide!"", ""c'est pas officiel"", qu'il a gueulé. À peu près dans ces temps là, un ami s'était fait acquitter d'un ticket de stationnement en présentant au juge des photos de Google Street View qui démontraient qu'il n'y avait pas de panneaux d'interdiction. Le procureur avait petté une coche ""ça brise la chaîne d'évidence! C'est pas valide! C'est pas officiel"", et le juge lui a dit de se la fermer avant d'aquitter mon ami.

Bref, les avocats de la ville n'aiment pas Google parce que ça  permet de mettre leur grande incompétence en évidence...

Donc, tout ça, avant de passer en cour, j'ai voulu avoir  une copie certifiée conforme du règlement.

Or, c'est pratiquement impossible à avoir, parce que ça demande une quinzaine d'heures à un avocat de la ville à fouiller dans les archives... Parce qu'il faut partir de la version originale du règlement, puis ensuite éplucher tous les amendements afin de compiler la  version finale, qui s'appelle une ""codification administrative"".

J'ai eu la chance extrême de tomber sur un secrétaire d'arrondissement (le titre sonne banal, mais c'est un avocat en chef) très aimable qui m'a fourni une codification administrative certifiée conforme (une codification administrative n'a AUCUNE valeur légale - [voyez le premier paragraphe du règlement anti-marcher-sur-le-gazon](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ARROND_VMA_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/REGLEMENT-PARCS(P-3)-CODIFIE.PDF)).

Finalement, quand je suis passé en cour, pas de procureur crotté, mais une procureuse baveuse qui m’a pratiquement envoyé chier après m’avoir dit qu'on recherchait mon cas, celà juste avant de passer en cour, et près de 2 ans après avoir eu les tickets.

Puis, deux heures plus tard, juste avant que le juge entre dans la cour, elle m'a dit de m'en aller chez-moi parce qu'ils laissaient tomber les accusations.

Je lui  ai  dit, carrément, dans la salle de cour ""vous êtes des hosties de beaux deux-de-piques incompétents; ça vous a  pris 2 ans pour trouver que l'article était  abrogé, tandis que moi, ça m'a  pris 5 minutes pour le trouver, grâce à Google. Mais je vais rester ici,  parce que ça  fait 8 fois  que  je viens en  cour  pour  vos  conneries et je  veux  le voir  pour  le  croire"". La  grosse hostie de tabarnak de vache sale me fusillait des yeux,  la câlisse de sacrament.

Finalement la juge arrive, quand mon tour arrive,  la grosse torche dit posément qu'ils retirent les accusations."

And it is made worse by the European colonialists. 

From what I read - the native Americans used cannibalism as a way to intimidate their rivals way back before Columbus. The story I read was pretty dramatic: according to [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/07/us/new-data-suggests-some-cannibalism-by-ancient-indians.html), ""... biochemical tests revealed clear traces of digested human muscle protein in the dried coprolite, or fossilized prehistoric feces"". In plain English, people found human meat in ancient shit (if this is not convincing to most Redditors, I don't know what is ;)

Fast forward to post-Columbus S. America, the Europeans didn't ""civilize"" the ""barbarians"" so to speak. Instead, having had their ""guns and germs"", they played an even rougher game of intimidation. Recent studies pieced together some pretty gruesome stories of how the Conquistadors abused the Incas.

The socio-cultural heritage of this unholy union of primitive brutality and modern mechanics, I speculate, is what led to today's excessive violence we see in Latin America. Yes, the drug related violence is somewhat man-made by the misguided policies. However, you can see this type of violence in many other areas of Latin American life too. Whether it was the prevalent kidnap-for-money, or the Columbian state-sanctioned violence during the war against leftist Guerrillas, or the simple gesture of Pres. Fujimori of Peru stepping over the body of a dead hostage-taker ... you see traces here and there. I suspect that even without the drugs, things like this may still happen in other places.

Say land right struggles. When I visited Brazil a few years back, I saw people living in huts along highways. Later, I learned the bloody conflicts between rich ranchers and the landless poor. We also toured Favelas (made famous by the movie City of God) when we were in Rio. The threat and immenance of violence is palable even to a casual walk-by tourists.

Max Weber famously said State has the monopoly of violence (or something like that). I guess he was referring to the European States in the 19-20th centuries. Many Latin America countries, and African ones too, never really had a tradition of monopolized and supervised exercise of violence. Nor are their governments today strong enough to play that role. 

TL;DR - it is rooted in culture and colonial history.

Well I can't really speak for Muslims or Christians (well, except for my extremely Catholic friend who's extremely respectful of other peoples' religions and not homophobic in the least bit), but I can speak on behalf of this one: those extremely religious Jews who you see walking around most often don't encompass all Orthodox Jews. Hell, they don't even encompass all Jews who look like that. It's a common misconception, and I don't blame people for thinking that, as it's the concept of the vocal minority sometimes speaking louder than the majority (similar to how, although about 1% of Israelis really live on settlements and only somewhat more promote it, many people outside of Israel assume the whole state promotes it).

Many of the very religious Jews that look like that are actually extremely tolerant people and some of the sweetest people you'll know. Others...not so much, but they don't make up the majority, fortunately. They all also don't make up the majority of all Orthodox Jews--many don't wear that attire and are also some of the most tolerant, friendly people you'll meet who will stick by the Torah to the point where it will never compromise their relationships with any other people around them. It's extremely fascinating, and I remember my first time seeing the wide spectrum of these Orthodox Jews.

Sorry to stray so long on three words lol; I like to clear any potential misconceptions.

&gt;Unfortunately, it did the opposite.

I think you might be getting that idea based only on the events in history that are more negative and brought about by the really vocal zealots. In truth, religion did bring about a ton of things that we take for granted today. For example, though we may have developed some moral concepts through a necessity to collaborate in human history, many of the first principles of the ethical treatment of animals came from the Torah (what makes meat Kosher is that the animal must be slaughtered on an exact part of the neck that contains the least nerve endings so minimize the pain the animal experiences in death). 

Additionally, there's no way we would've taken giving to the poor and less fortunate as a standard moral principle without religion--by logic, abandoning those people means the society left over is made of stronger survivors. Only through religion could we have reached that conclusion. 

Also, many of the first principles of hygiene came through religion (there were a few reasons why the Jews didn't catch the Black Death and why the Christians accused them of creating it, but one reason why is because by Jewish law to keep themselves clean, they had to shower at least once a week and wash their hands before and after meals). 

There was a whole religious renaissance of peace, art and science for a couple centuries during the Muslim rule of Spain before the Cristrian takeover--during that period of time, the concept of one common God brought Muslims and Jews together (truth be told, Jews, Christians and Muslims all believe in the same God, but choose to follow the belief in different ways), and it was supposedly a big golden age sometimes overlooked in history.

While religion was the cause of many wars, inquisitions, and the Dark Ages, I do believe that many (aside from the Dark Ages part--that was caused by the literal reading of the Bible becoming, for some strange reason, the dominant way of running Europe) would've come about anyways just by human nature. Religion was just one outlet.

Heh, I'm sorry I ended up writing so much. There are a few things I get quite passionate about (music, religion, computer science, the importance of certain video games, etc.), and I could talk **way too much** about them.

We could always agree to disagree, but I felt it necessary to first bring in the other side here on why religion's effects on the world weren't all that bad."

That being said, I've always had an interest in the views of people such as yourself, so I'm going to take this opportunity to ask you on your most recent reply a few things I *really* want to know. Feel free to be as elaborate as you wish; you can even call me any names you want to! Just to help you out, I'm half Ethiopian and half Black-American and have lived in the US my entire life (excluding a semester abroad in Spain).

I've got to know, in you're white nationalist world, what happens to the descendants of African slaves brought to the Americas? They've been here for just as long as Europeans have been here, took part in conquering the territory from the Native Americans and up to 30% of blood group types found in African Americans have European origin. 

Most have no connection to Africa seeing as we generally don't know what part of the Continent we were shipped from. So if your answer is ""send them back to Africa"" I'd like to know what part exactly? Now I'd assume you want me in Ethiopia since my mom is from there, but what happens to my dad and his side of the family? 

Are you comfortable with California's new status as a minority-majority state? Yes it was conquered by the US in 1848, but it had been Spanish and then Mexican for a lot longer than it has been American, same with Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. What about Hawaii? A state that has never had a white majority, would you request that the white people leave the islands because it has historically been populated by polynesians and other Asian-Pacific Islander people groups? 

What about people groups in Europe that have never had a home land? Like the Roma who came into Europe in the middle ages and never really left, rather content to spread out across the continent and form their own communities. European Jews who haven't gone to Israel? Or should Israel even be allowed to exist? If not, where should the Jewish diaspora go? 

What sort of solution do you have for Latin America and the Carribbean? A multi-ethnic/racial region in which people of mixed ancestry are the norm rather than the exception. Sure, Uraguay and Argentina have large numbers of whites, but most of South and Central America is brown mixed with European and AmerIndian populations while some countries like Brazil, Venezuela, the DR, and Cuba have large African populations as well. Should they be sorted out? Or is it just too complex a situation to deal with? 

My main point here is that, even *if* you were right and such a separation were desirable, the logistics behind it would be impossible. There is no reason why Europeans should be entitled to the US and Canada at the expense of Africans and Amerindians, especially seeing as all of us are mixed with something from everyone and that Africans have been on the continent for just as long as Europeans, and Amerindians have been here for *far* longer."

The idea that blacks just want to blame whites for their problems is based off of the media, which is viewed mostly by whites, simply due to the fact that whites are the majority. That is why race baiters are always given the most attention, it riles people up. So the idea that blacks blame whites for their problems is due to ignorance on both parts. That is not to say there is not racism against blacks today, it merely is systemic.

Segregation of schools, even after Brown v Board, still existed into the seventies until the Court finally said enough is enough. Segregation of schools exists in Detroit due to white flight, which took away all the tax base which meant poor schools, as blacks were historically impoverished. So blacks by and large are still in worse schools than whites are, thus less opportunity to improve one's life. This is why there is less an emphasis in black communities on school as there is on sports. You see this in any impoverished community (see Friday Night Lights). It is harder for blacks to do well in school, as their districts don't have enough money to retain good teachers, and their parents will likely not be able to afford college.

When it comes to jobs, when comparing equal candidates, a candidate with a ""black"" sounding name gets the job 15% less, even when they have the same credentials as a white.

Foodstamps and housing will allow a person to survive, but it will not give them economic opportunity. Programs like Head Start, Teacher Corps, and Upward Bound do not have budgets big enough to be effective. These programs are necessary for the poor to have an equal opportunity in achieving. We should not punish children for their parent's lack of wealth.

So by and large the current problem is that many blacks have become stuck in poverty, and since the Reagan era the government has done less and less to help the impoverished in society, regardless of race. This is not to say that race doesn't also effect the black community, but its not the deciding factor. Although it has been argued that American reticence towards welfare is due to racial tensions that did not exist in Europe at the time (thus why their safety nets are stronger).

What is the problem in essence is colonialism of any sort. The coal companies essentially colonized Appalachia, leaving the white coal workers their is complete squalor. The same has historically happened to blacks, making it harder for them to gain economic equality and parity with whites in general.

It does nor seem to be something that occurs that much in Northern Europe, which I find to be very interesting. The attitude seems to be that either you ask for advice how to deal, you speak your mind to the person bothering you or you let it be. Most people I've met here are very anti all back talking. They don't have a mean girls culture either and friendships between women are often described as deep, intimate and caring. The concept of frenemies seems to have been unknown until very recently by stuff like mean girls etc.

So I don't think it is an inhernet female trait. I think it is in part because this is a behavioural model give  to girls (and there are some horrible models out there for men, upon which some are acting on, but that's and other thread). Movies, tv shows and older people (either by doing or saying) feed children a pickture that this is what women do... so they start aping after. And unless you analyse your behaviour and keep an eye on you - you might do it without realising you could let it be.

In practice I think backtalking serves a few functions. For one, it is an outlwt for agression. Women are taught to be nice and pleasent, avoid conflicts. In addition, in the US, the importance of being supportive and positive is valued high. Sometimes to the point where you are not really supposed to say negative things. Combine these two, and you basically ""blocked"" a lot of ideas over how to deal. Mind you, I'm not after justifying the behaviour, just sharing on my opinion why it might happen.

On a second note, people who are unhappy are also likely to lash out. They blame others, might be aggressive, feel negatively about e.g. homosexuals, immigrants, a different socio-economic class, the other gender, religion/atheism etc. Or they might (perhaps again to be able to maintain general ""niceness"") complain about others to people close to then.

Similar legal protection has been adopted by over 70 countries. Most recently Canada, Australia,[15] and Chile signed agreements with Europe that limit the use of the term ""champagne"" to only those products produced in the Champagne region. The United States bans the use from all new U.S.-produced wines.[3] Only those that had approval to use the term on labels before 2006 may continue to use it and only when it is accompanied by the wine's actual origin (e.g., ""California"").[3] The majority of U.S.-produced sparkling wines do not use the term champagne on their labels [16] and some states, such as Oregon,[17] ban producers in their states from using the term.

All teams have 8 games left. Enough to turn the tables completely around as things stand.

As for EG vs. Fnatic, a reality check for you: this split EG is 2-1 up against Fnatic. I.e., to put it in simple words for you: statistically they have the edge against Fnatic. In fact they are also 2-0 vs. Gambit, another team most are so sure is going to the worlds. Their bad records are vs. NiP, Alternate (0-3) and Lemondogs (1-2).

Lastly, the playoffs format means that anything can happen. We saw GGU (now Team Coast) get to the finals in spring playoffs from 6th spot. If anything EG is known for being hit-or-miss: some days the dominate, some days they come to the stage with bronze-plays.

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved.
In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for free for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply publicize what the music business wants to make money with.

&gt;Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. And rock critics will study more of rock history and realize who invented what and who simply exploited it commercially.

&gt;Beatles' ""aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll: it replaced syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.

&gt;Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for a good reason. They could not figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). THat phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Fours'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"". Not to mention later and far greater British musicians. Not to mention the American musicians who created what the Beatles later sold to the masses.

&gt;The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial band.

&gt; Everybody that arrived there already was prepared to shed their identity, 

This is not part of the deal, and it never was. In fact, pretty much from its inception, the US was meant to a place where people could come if they **DID NOT** want to shed any previous identities (it's kind of like traditional dutch tolerance in that respect). 

While Massachusetts was supposed to be a refuge for calvinists, Maryland was supposed to be one for Catholics, and Pennsylvania for Quakers and Germans. New York meanwhile had dutch tolerance written into its law as a condition for its transfer from dutch to british sovereignty. It meant that within NY, Sephardic Jews, Native Americans, Huguenots, free blacks, and Dutch settlers could not legally be persecuted...even in the 18th century. 

As for more recent immigrants, many immigrant communities also did not come prepared to shed their identities.... and a number of immigrant subcultures have grown-up in the US over time. The Chinese, the Irish and the Italians being good examples of what I mean. 

The deal is that you participate in society (education, labor market, et cetera)...  NOT that that you have to adopt local customs and dress while you do it. That is one of the reasons that the US managed to become a successful country.

I think that these interpretations change over time. Its all aout what you can sell to the voters, I'd say. 

&gt; The PS and the SP.a have a radically different view on socialism. Merging would cost the SP.a a lot of their votes. 


SPa is already one of the weakest socialist parties in the entire EU. They haven't got a whole lot to lose, except for all the goodwill that they've generated at the local level. This is by their own admission (I was once a member of a joint PvdA/SPa strategy session in 2011, and this was one of the reasons for the session). 

&gt; CD&amp;V is rather different from CDH

Okay, then they'd become like the CDA over in Holland. That party doesn't have a clear consensus when it comes to economic policy...just on moral issues.  Generally they do alright for themselves though. 

&gt;  A merger? I don't think so.

I see it as a prisoner's dilemma game. Whoever merges first would take the most advantage...so nobody would want to be the last to merge. Kind of like in prisoners dilemma, you do not want to be the party who doesn't snitch if you rationally expect your counter-party to snitch.

E não é uma questão de escolheres uma marca ou outra, porque os preços são semelhantes. Eu não só tenho que dar mais ao estado por cada imperial (no meu caso 0,28€) mas paguei mais por ela. Se eu subir os peus preços para compensar, o cliente queixa-se que os preços tão altos e vai a outro lado.

You're looking at it all wrong.

&gt;Deal with it for 26 years and see if you don't get upset. Have better educational attainment than any other racial group in the country and still get paid less and see if you don't get upset. Have some of the shittiest representation in media and see if you don't get upset. Have your university acceptance rates get artificially held down by quotas and see if you don't get upset. Have to sit through the litany of stereotypes from people around you and on TV and in movies, and see if you don't get upset. And then have people tell you ""You're complaining about nothing."" and see if you don't get upset. 

I've actually been dealing with it for 26 year, since 1987 when I came here as a kid with my parents.

What are you talking about getting paid less, who's feeding you that bullshit?? 

Your university acceptance gets fucked by quotas like everyone elses that isn't Black or Female 
how about the University acceptance quotas against white males, how about government job quotas against white males? You have a much better change getting into a university than your white counterpart, that's reality and I'm not considered a minority  like you because I'm Polish, I'm just the evil white guy. 

Stereotypes are a part of life, in fact some are true and some aren't so what?? I'm Polish, you want a list of stereotypes ??

&gt;Perception is one thing. But why do people think that I would give a shit about that Korean person they met once? We don't all know each other. And that guy was from Korea, not the US.

I was fucking born and raised here and they cannot wrap their heads around the idea that I am American.

BECAUSE that's a human thing to do man, it's not personal. Ohh you're Polish, no shit...I use to do construction with this guy Marek or I dated a Polish chick once...what ever who gives a shit ?
Why the hell would you get upset over something like that, that's just people trying to connect on the most basic level. 

No it's not necessarily that they see you are Asian or Korean 1st, maybe it's because they see you as different than them...not less than, just different.

&gt;A co-worker at my job keeps talking to me about his dad who fought in the Korean war. What the shit man. I wasn't alive when that happened. My parents weren't even alive when that happened. Aweeesome. I can guarantee he doesn't go around talking about a relative who fought in WWII to German-Americans or Italian-Americans or to Jews who had parents/grand-parents in Europe.

You're like the ever complaining Black guy who thinks it's the white man keeping him down or a woman is a racist because she becomes more cautious when on the street all alone. Similar to the gay guy who sees everything through his sexuality and thinks everyone else does too.

I am able to better understand the role of Islam in unifying middle-eastern nationalism and can use that knowledge to better benefit myself.

History made me understand the origins of hate. Sexism, racism and any other form of bigotry evolved throughout the years in weird ways, and examining the ways people killed eachother can help you understand why all of those definitions are flawed. To the modern man, race seems almost natural - he's white, that guy's red and I'm black, we belong to other races. But some of the original American settlers thought that their children would grow up to be red because they were born in America. For them, the divide between Europeans and Americans was something different entirely. Studying hate doesn't make me hate humanity, but understand why we feel the need to turn on eachother.

Sure, there were tyrants and wrongdoers, wars and the occasional holocaust, but for each dark there's light. For Hernan Cortez there's Bartolome De Las Casas and for every smoke-spewing industrial Victorian chimney there's *The Condition of the Working Class in England*. History is not about evil or horribleness for the same reason the present isn't a bright shining utopia. It's just people, doing what they thought was best for their interests. By studying their views and actions, we can in turn become better people ourselves."

Well then you have either not been to many or not paid attention quite simply.

&gt;Foreign nationals love to share their culture with others. Imagine moving to another country and trying to have an ""America Day"" and see how far you would get. People would be angry with you for imposing American culture on them

There is a big American festival in my city.

But you also ignore the pervasiveness of American culture all over the world and it's embraced by the majority of people in Europe for example.

&gt;You see it on Reddit all the time. Americans shit on their country constantly. 

There are way more Americans than non-Americans. It's not representative of the world. 

&gt;Why is it okay for a German to tell an American how great Germany is, but if an American tells a German how great America is, they are a stupid asshole?

Well that's both okay and in Germany lots of people have great admiration for America and just because some people you know behave a certain way that's somehow representative of not just Germany but the whole world? Some really good anecdotal evidence.

Do you think Obama's big speech in Berlin in 2008 just attracted a giant crowd because he was black or maybe rather because he held a great speech on America and American values and American-German relations? I'm sure all those people hate America.

&gt;America is the only country in the world where patriotism is considered a bad thing. 

Well now that's just complete rubbish. Where do you get this from? Patriotism in Germany? Seriously? The only places you see flags in Germany are the government buildings and no one ever says things like ""the greatest nation on earth"" or ""god bless Germany"". That is unimaginable.

The same goes for other countries too by the way. Spain for example. You will not hear Spaniards say ""Spain is the greatest nation on earth"" ever. Not on TV or in real life. Spain is very self-deprecating. Portugal too. 

&gt;Why is U.S. patriotism cringeworthy but not patriotism in any other country?

People VERY MUCH cringe at patriotism in Europe. ""God bless America"" and ""greatest nation on earth"" doesn't happen in most of Europe. It's hard to even imagine this happening in France or the UK. Certainly not the extent that every American politician does it. It's not comparable. Only Hungary comes to mind, and they have a radical extremist quasi-fascist government at the moment. Even much more subtle attempts at patriotism, usually trying to imitate some of America or UK, are cringed at."

There is no evidence of slavery in Egypt, and their writing system does not indicate anything similar to slavery. Some people here are then trying to find an accurate definition of ""slave"": historians and archaeologists usually look at the greeks and romans, as their case of slavery is clear cut - they had an entire class of people that were enslaved, with rules on how to deal with those slaves, terminology, etc. Egypt has none of that. There probably were particular cases where prisoners of war were used as slave labor or something, but nothing like what we see years later in Greece or Rome.

Regarding to how the pyramids were built, the people that built them were citizens. Let's not forget that the common citizen viewed the Faraoh as a God, and that they were willing to sacrifice a good amount of time and energy to build and dedicate a monument to that God. Second, most of the Egyptian population at that time were farmers and they worked on the banks of the Nile: they had three season, one of sowing, and for harvesting and one where nothing much happened because the crops were going. During this time, which could last up to 4 month, all the farmers would head out to whatever fancy place the faraoh was building some shit and sell their services for some money. Imagine, thousands of people just carrying stones and doing construction work all day - and multiply that by 20 to 25 years. And that how you get pyramids.

PS: the large pyramids we see today were built pretty early on in Egyptian history, I'm not sure but I think it was the 3rd or 4th dynasty that built that shit.

**EDIT**: Sorry for mispelling Pharaoh - I studied Archaeology in Portugal and although I have recently learned some english, there are some words I haven't used since I first learned them.

2nd: No sources sorry, just stating what my professor in undergrad told me.

3rd: I learned this shit in undergrad but I have not really applied this knowledge anymore since my interests and profession don't really focus on Egypt. Every now and then I have to write some stuff about labour and shit, and Egypt comes in handy as a case-study, but except for that, I don't really use my limited knowledge about egypt that much.

4th: In reply to the guy that says he is a farmer: work, I'm assuming, was a lot more flexible than we believe back in ancient Egypt. There were professions *per se* like scribes and barbers for example, but there was also a big mass of people that would just do manual labour and farming. While hardcore farmers would probably stick around to farming, there was a large group of people that would go between farming and other form of manual labour. (Can't source any of this unfortunately because I'm miles away from a decent library or even a decent computer)

**EDIT 2**: Found the following in David A. R. 1986 The pyramid builders of Ancient Egypt. P. 58

*The peasants were
not slaves in the strict sense of the word, although their freedom
and choice of action in terms of their place and type of work was
strictly limited by social and economic factors.*

When I get home I'll see what else I can find. My professor had a book specifically on this subject (labour in Egypt) and I can see if I can find anything there.

**EDIT 3:** for those arguing about foreign slaves. Yeah those existed but I'm not what's the scale we're talking about. Also in David A. R. 1986 The pyramid builders of Ancient Egypt. P. 31

*Other sources which suggest considerable links between Egypt
and her northern neighbours include stelae and papyri in which
Asiatic slaves are mentioned as being present in Egypt during the
12th and 13th Dynasties. Two series of Execration Texts from the
reign of Sesostris III and the succeeding years also leave little
doubt that the Egyptians had a detailed knowledge of the princes
of Syria and Palestine in the 12th Dynasty.*

**EDIT 4**

Found this [article](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/11/great-pyramid-tombs-slaves-egypt)

Interesting is the quote right here

*Amihai Mazar, professor at the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says that myth stemmed from an erroneous claim by the former Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, on a visit to Egypt in 1977, that Jews built the pyramids.*

Apparently jews didn't even exist during this time, so saying that there jew slaves built the pyramids is a bit anachronistic. The Ancient egyptian civilization spans several millenia so its kinda stupid to argue if there were slaves during this whole time. Regarding the pyramids, there really isn't any evidence that there were slaves involved in their construction.

**EDIT 5:**

The British Museum's Dictionary of Ancient Egypt: under ""Rameses"" entry

*Defensive foreign policy occupied much of the early part of his reign. His first conflict, in the fifth year of his reign, was with the LlBYA'\!S and their allies, whom he defeated and brought back to Egypt as slaves. Three years later the great coalition of displaced and migrant peoples from the north, known as the SEA PEOPLES, who had been repulsed by l\Jlcrenptah in the late thirteenth century Be, advanced into Syria, apparently with the aim of settling. The Sea Peoples, as their name indicates, were backed up by naval forces, including Sherden troops, who were noted seafarers. Although presumably not used to fighting maritime battles, the Egyptian navy managed to destroy the Sea Peoples' fleet, while simultaneously defeating the troops in Syria on land. Apart from another campaign against the Libyans in his eleventh year, the
remaining two decades of Rameses Ill'S reign
were peaceful.*

under ""slaves"":

*Attempts to analyse the use ofslaves in ancient Egyptian society have often been thwarted by problems of definition and translation, as well as by the emotive connotations of a term that invariably conjures up anachronistic visions either of ancient Rome or of the nineteenthcentury plantations of the New World.
Most of the population of Pharaonic Egypt were tied to the land or followed strictly hereditary professions; these men or women were often included among the possessions of kings, high-ranking officials or TEMPLE estates. They might, however, be better described as 'serfs' (semedeJ or meret), although even this translation is perhaps too closely connected with images of feudal society in medieval Europe, especially in view of the fact that Egyptian farmers were 'tied to the land' not legally but by tradition and economic circumstances. Semedet and meret were allowed to own property but appear to have enjoyed very limited freedom by modern western standards.
True slavery, in the Classical sense of the word, seems to have been rare in Egypt before the Ptolemaic period (332-30 BC). Most Egyptian slaves (hemw or bakw) would have been Asiatic prisoners of war (khenetw, or, more commonly, sekerw ankhw), although it is clear from records of the Late Period (747-332 Be) that Egyptians too could be slaves, and indeed that they were sometimes obliged to sell themselves into slavery, presumably in order to gain food and shelter or to pay debts. The Jewish mercenaries at Elephantine (ASWAN), for instance, are said to have had Egyptian slaves during the Late Period. It appears that slaves were generally well treated, and some at least seem to have owned property. Both male and female owners of slaves had the right to free them, and it was possible for slaves to marry free-born women and even to own land.
The popular assertion that thc PYRAMIDS were built by slave labour finds little support in the surviving textual records of the Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BC), since the work on royal funerary monuments was mostly conducted through corvee labour. Quarrying and mining, however, were sometimes carried out by convicts or foreign prisoners of war. It was not until the Middle Kingdom and the Ne"" Kingdom that prisoners of war became numerous enough to play any perceptible role in Egyptian society. The records of the workmen's village at OEIR EL-MEDINA show that slaves were employed on a communal basis, particularly to help with the grinding of grain for bread-making, and some workmen in the community even owned personal slaves. One
19th-Dynasty worker, Ken, buried in tomb TT4 at Deir el-Medina, appears to have had about twelve slaves, thus illustrating that the ownership of slaves was by no means the exclusive preserve of the elite.*

Incorrect.  The US contains *many, many* cultures.  Do you think that the culture of a blue-blood family from Cape Cod is going to be the same as a welfare family in New Orleans?  They go along racial lines.

In sociology, these different sub-cultures (relative to general American culture, that is) are hyphenated.  Families with Italian heritage are called Italian Americans.  Armenian heritage?  Armenian Americans.  Koreans?  Korean-Americans.  They retain a lot of the same values as the places their ancestors are from.  They are distinct in a *ton* of different ways.  Values, education, child-rearing, internet-use, language, and so on.  A ton of things you wouldn't even *think* to test for.

Now of course it's a stretch to say that African-Americans have retained a ton of African culture.  It isn't true.  But African-Americans *do*, and I emphasize this, *do* have a distinct culture from European-Americans (yes, European-American is a term used in sociology to refer to general white Americans).  Not just stereotypical ebonics rap inner-city stereotypes (though that is part of it).  They inherited this culture from their slave forefathers, and from the hundred years of segregation (and fifty plus years of de facto segregation...i.e. city and Southern living, generally).

It's best not to try to erase an entire culture with their own values.  African American culture DOES exist.  Pretending it doesn't would only do *them* a disservice and continue discrimination.  Thank you."

You are wrong, and its dangerous. 

Even seemingly timid bits of information is important. Say like what you are eating. Let's say you are a official in a vegetarian organization and share your grocery lists online. Let's say you aren't 100% true to the cause and knots down some minced meat for a juicy hamburger in that list. 

What if NSA, or some other security service wanted to put some pressure on you? Maybe your dad works at a power plant where they want a USB stick inserted into a computer? Are you willing to risk your friend's trust in the vegetarian organization knowing you bought minced meat unless you casually drop that USB stick at the reception desk for the nosey receptionist to insert in her computer?

I agree that this scenario seems really paranoid, but maybe that organisation is really really important to you (and everyone else in it would just kick you out and de-friend you on facebook if they found out, omfg the horrorz). 

Are you willing to be outed as a homosexual (not that dangerous in norway, but is in other countries) based on your friend lists? Because NSA can tell if you are gay based on your contact network alone (some of your friends are publicly gay, and based on % they can tell).

Those snide comments you made about socialists/communists/capitalists/immigrants? Can you handle a fake trial brought on where you are accused of hate speech? 

I have personally received legal threats from the EU from respected law firms that I do not wish to fight (this was a copyright thing where I used a companies name, and the website in question was a website that deals in free speech, it was not related to piracy or copyright infringment). I was not prepared to deal with the consequences in this case and thus free speech was denied. I'm not saying NSA was involved in that, because the the information was publically accessible and searchable, but I can see them using a 20 page legal threat from London as a way to intimidate dissident.

Realize that if they want to get someone else in your proximity (family, friends, co-workers), they might use YOUR information even if it's not you who are the real target. The same thing works the other way around. You have friends who are the least hypocrite? Then you are a possible target for blackmailing. "

* Second pick is about the Dutch NT being the best country in WC qualification in Europe after a dramatic Euro, being the only country without dropping the ball somewhere. 18 points from 6 games, 20 goals scored and only 2 conceded. I worried we would not qualify for Brazil, but we might be the first European country securing qualification. "

That being said, over here in Europe, I don't see the Model S taking off because it is ludicrously expensive (take the US base price, now add about 50% to that for the base model) and people are still rather apprehensive about getting an electric car (can't really fault them for that because charging stations are few and far in between) and people who need their car for frequent business trips abroad (ie: Belgium-Germany for instance) really do need something like a supercharger network like Tesla has in the US, else there really is no point in going electric rather than petrol/diesel. 

All of that aside, I think BMW is trying to be ""futuristic"" in their EV design. For me personally though, it has only one redeeming feature and that's the fact that it's RWD. But then so is a 3-series, which has more range and is cheaper."

I left my career in design and am trying to find a way to study sociology or liberal arts, hopefully in Europe or North America, where mentalities are very different. It may be good or bad.

Everything on that list is meant to denigrate and shame the super majority race in the USA into giving away their earned rights passed on from their ancestors to those who did nothing to contribute to what makes the USA great.


'Freedom of association' is a human right.  Whites who want to live in an all white society have the right to create that society.  Blacks who want to live in an all black society have the right to create that society.  Blacks and whites who wish to live together in a mixed race society have the right to create that society.  Up until 1965, it was the official policy of the USA to be an all white society.  The blacks we did have lived by themselves.  The USA did not import nonwhites before this date.  From that point in time you can see a major negative shift in the success of the USA.

Blacks do not have the right to force themselves into an all white society.  Whites do not have the right to force themselves into an all black society.

Given the genetic differences in IQ, black societies fail to even begin and on the rare occasion they create something, they do not achieve the same levels of civilization as all white societies.  Compare sub saharan africa to Europe before globalization and you have your answer of who ""won"".

Well tbh, the only reason they are not a pest is because they are so few and located almost absolutely in protected parks.

TL;DR - not everything that's a pest to humans should be hunted to extinction. It's a question of conservation.

Travis Pastrana currently races in the Nationwide series, which is the second tier series, hence why you won't hear his name alongside Dale Earnhardt, Jr., or Danica Patrick who both race in the Sprint Cup series.

As for the team aspect, although every car/team for each driver is treated separately, most of the ownership organizations own multiple teams. These organizations all build similar equipment for each team and share information with each other relating on how to set up their car to get an advantage over everybody else. Sometimes these organizations share alliances with other organizations where they share equipment. For example, Hendrick currently has an alliance with Stewart-Haas which allows Stewart-Haas access to the Hendrick built engines, but they operate as different organizations and aren't necessarily teammates. 

As mentioned by the other poster, each driver earns the points, not each team. For another example, Denny Hamlin had an injury earlier this season and had to stay out of the car.

We mix a currency of a corrupt country that has had a currency crisis around once a week; with a country that is 16 trillion in debt; with a currency that while healthy is tiny and would be drowned by the other two so that you have 3 highly diverse economies trying to use not only a single currency but the single interest rate that generally goes along with that concept. 

The only outcome would be that certain parts of the economy would unbelievably overheat due to the interest rates not being high enough while other parts would stagnate because interest rates are too high. 

Basically this is already a problem in all three countries. If you look at the European Union this is exactly what happened. Interest rates should have gone way up in Spain, Greece, and Ireland to slow down the out of control bubble while they might have even been able to go down more at the same time in Germany. If Eurowide interest rates had been raised then Germany would have gone into the crapper.

Personally I think within Canada that the Maritimes should have a different currency than Alberta along with different interest rates.

&gt;It does NOT. (have a common Economic Policy)

I say it does, without caps of course, and the European Commission agrees. [ Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) represents a major step in the integration of EU economies. It involves the coordination of economic and fiscal policies, a common monetary policy, and a common currency, the euro. Whilst all 27 EU Member States take part in the economic union, some countries have taken integration further and adopted the euro. Together, these countries make up the euro area.](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/emu/)

Additionally, this 

&gt; Why do you think some countries failed and others succeeded? It's the opposite of common economic policy.

Is simply not the case. No country has failed. Some are doing rather poorly. Greece is an extreme case.  But they are being bailed out? By whom? The UK? No. The US. Are you having a laugh? The EU is bailing them out. Is Alabama in the states doing particularly well? No. Does the US have a common Federal Economic policy? Of course they do. Do the states still have room to manouver? Of course they do. It's called Federalism. In the EU it's a Supra National common policy. That doesn't mean it's not there. And all of this is in the context that the EU is an acting political unit, which it is. We have a common currency and a Central European Bank. Your assertion is bold facedly absurd. If you are European, then your State's education system has failed you. 

So on our common Economic Policy you were completely wrong. Up to the gums as it were. Let's see how you fare on our defense policy. 

&gt;We do NOT. (Have a common defense policy)

Let us see. Sadly, you are even more mistaken here. We simply even call it the Common Security and Defense Policy. 

&gt;[The Common Security Defence Policy - CSDP (formerly known as European Security and Defence Policy - ESDP) was launched at the Cologne European Council of June 1999 as an integral part of the Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Since 1999, political, civilian and military bodies have been established in Brussels, common capabilities goals set and a number of crisis management operations have been carried out.](http://www.iss.europa.eu/topics/csdp/) 


Or Wikipedia if actual EU websites that describe what we actually have here are too much for you...


&gt;[The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), formerly known as the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), is a major element of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union (EU) and is the domain of EU policy covering defence and military aspects, as well as civilian crisis management. The ESDP was the successor of the European Security and Defence Identity under NATO, but differs in that it falls under the jurisdiction of the European Union itself, including countries with no ties to NATO.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy)

So there's number 2. You are simply flat out wrong twice. So wrong in fact that I am starting to be embarrassed for you. 

Let's examine number 3. 

&gt;Europe is not a political unit at all. I will tell you what the EU is:

No. This is just slop handed jackassery. The EU has 2 presidents, a legislature, a court of justice, its own Military, its own Military staff, 2 capitals and its own taxes. It's clearly a Supra-National Political Unit. So no. I’d be expecting you to delete this garbage and run away, but optimism is a fault in this day and age. 

And the broken little children of your point three: 

&gt; * a common set of rough legal guidelines

Nonsense. EU law is the accepted enforceable law almost all 28 countries subject to how far their own courts will allow them to comply. They aren't rough guidelines. Brussels is famous for long and detailed regulations. That's why there are so few British Fisherman left....because they couldn't read well enough to compete. Not because they couldn't fish ass well as the rapacious Belgians…. 

&gt; * common rights for EU citizens in all countries 


Only up to the point of recognized subisdiarity. It's a semi federal union. Domestic law applies as far as it can go. Half a point. 


&gt; * no borders

A monolithic oversimplification. There is free travel for goods and people between member states of the various Treaties. That's not the same as the borders not existing. Primary incoming flights are still subject passport control, and the UK only complies partially, as one example. 

The Danish and the Dutch reactivated their borders for various reasons, just a little while ago. All the member states can do so if necessary.  Where did you go to school? 

&gt; * a system that establishes permanent pan-European governmental cooperation through the EU institutions and especially the European Council 

Only correct thing you've said this entire post. One point. 

So at the end. 1,5 items were correct. But everything else was dead wrong. Embarrasingly so. Stupidly so. And if you are any kind of European, unexcusably so. 

Let's get some things straight now shall we? 

**TL;DR:**

1. Europe has a common economic policy. Not a centrally planned economy, but a common economic policy. That has been shown. 

2. Europe has a common defense policy. It's related to, and cooperates with, but is not the same as NATO. We even call it the Common Security and Defence Policy. That has been shown. 

3. The EU is a politcal unit. It is a political body, made up of a variety of political offices, some of which are appointed and some of which elected, who do political things, Diplomatic, Legal, Military, and Economic,  some of which deal with Europe internally, some of which are international. 

From the evidence presented, these 3 points are indisputable. So your belligerence and self righteousness are not excusable. Next time you tell someone what the EU is, please actually tell them what it is.

The North-American Indians for example, they warred now and then, but without fireweapons, and not a lot of people would die that way. Then the colonists came, and they were wiped out.

The next example: Sudan and South-Sudan. Before the British came along, they were doing not too bad. South-Sudan was still a collection of tribes, and Sudan itself was developed a bit under the Ottoman empire. The British however restricted travel between the two, to give Christianity a chance in South-Sudan. When the British left, South-Sudan was still tribal, but it was governed by 'northerners' who had had some improvements from the Empire. The result of what the British did? A war from since Sudan gained independence to about 2 years ago, killing a lot of people, and preventing the countries from developing. 

And the British giving money to India is in no way comparable to the destruction they brought unto the Indians. They sucked out anything that could be sold from most of their colonies. It is like saying you are doing good by keeping a beggar alive when you distroyed his business.

The empire never colonised a country to help it, even though that might have been said to make slaughtering half the natives and letting the other half work their butts off ethically  a bit better, because the natives now became good Christians.

The United states of America is a bad example on the whole, because they managed to get out of the grasp of the British Empire rather quickly.

And if you look at the other countries: India is poor, poorer than both China and Japan, who were less colonised.
The British empire was not some benevolent power who helped other countries reach its wealth and development level.

The reason many western European powers were rich, (England, France, Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark and perhaps one should count a few more) was that they plundered the rest of the world and forced the people somewhere else to work for them. England had a very large empire, of which only Australia and the USA are really rich, I will come back to them later. France sucked the wealth from Haiti, Southeast Asia and Western Africa, Spain got money out of the Americas, Portugal out of Brazil, the Netherlands out of Indonesia, and so on.

As to the USA and Australia, these were not helping anyone except for the English. The natives were brutally massacred, put away in useless plains, their land was stolen and they became second-class citizens in a land that was theirs. The Aboriginals were not helped by the British, and the reason that Austalia is rich is not that the British empire helped the natives, but that they 'replaced' the natives with English people, thereby more or less establishing a life standard the English were used to, thus higher than the average in the world. The story for the US is bit different, but this model is accurate enough, since American Indians are still below the average income, and that in land that was theirs.

And finally, I do not think it is good on average to kill a significant portion of the population of a country, force the rest to work for you and get money from it and then later claim you did well because you cultured the natives and brought them education. 

And some advice: don't ever state that this is your view to a native from any of the regions that were under influence of the British Empire, because they might repay you the 'kindness' of the British Empire with some rather violent things."

Why? Because if governments can pay less they will. This is illustrated by Seapower. The size of all European Navies has been a steadily downward curve with some interruptions since WWII. Standing navies are expensive to maintain and update. Why bother if the Americans have 10 Aircraft carriers and they are a NATO partner. If you need them, they'll apparently be there. So making your own. Not necessary. 

&gt;Europe built up its military heavily during the Cold War as well

Is this the same Europe that you swear up and down isn't actually any kind of measureable poltical unit in a different thread?

&gt;So I ask, why does Europe need to be a big military power today?

Who said it did? We seem to prefer soft power solutions. 

&gt;What does America protect us from in 2013. 

Arguably the threat of response from all NATO countries keeps all NATO countries safe from their neighbors, presumably. 

&gt;Because historically we waged war on ourselves, and that has been over since 1945, and 1991 in the case of Russia.

Historically Europe waged war all over the world including here in the backyard. And last I checked Russia had not declared pacifism or neutrality. The cold war is over, but if you think that means open the borders to the east while the Russians are still armed to the teeth, then you are being purposefully naive. The Georgians learned that lesson the hard way. 

&gt;Examples please.

Sure. Ashton in Egypt, and Europe in Libya. The first is a case of Soft Power diplomacy, the second a case of attempted negotiations, followed by carrying out threats of force.  The EU can flex its economic muscles safe in the knowledge that NATO is right behind it.

Same for onions. And plenty others.

As such, I'm a bit puzzled how your supermarkets manage to keep the different varieties apart. I understand there will typically much fewer produce from other countries as the US is large enough to produce most everything with its wide variety of climates - but if there are, for example, pineapples from Costa Rica (is this even a thing?) - would they be allowed next to melons from the US, just not next to other pineapples from a different origin?

Yes, some aristocrat philosophers saw in the United States the embodiment of the republican ideals of the Enlightment Age, the first state without a monarchy that could ""rewrite from scratch"" the system with liberty as basis. Some military commanders who fought in America brought back the tales of their military success against the English crown and how militias could be formed from revolting peasants. But that's a tiny tiny minority without much impact. The French Revolution was sparked by the masses of starving peasants - the Third Estate - who stormed the symbols of power (and bakeries). This idea that the common Frenchman took inspiration in the success of the American Revolution is mostly an American conception. It doesn't prevail in Europe and isn't backed by historical evidence. It is part of the American Exceptionalism mythos. It is taught to children in elementary and secondary schools but it's not part of any serious study about the French Revolution. It is a bit like ""When Christopher Columbus sailed to America everybody taught the Earth was flat"". Not true at all. It is a bit like the French's boasting about their direct link with Ancient Greece and Imperial Rome. A bit like Canadian history when they tell us that the French and English colonists were *loved* by the native tribes unlike the eeevil  government of the United States. Quite a bit a of stretch.

France's monarchy was an absolute monarchy. Nobles, gentry and bourgeoisie hold very little power over the State's affairs while purveying the means of production and finances of the crown. Their will to revolt against the king was much more inspired by the successes of the English Civil War. They wanted to put an end to *absolute* monarchy like in England. They wanted a parliamentary system and more power within the State like in England. The peasants were litteraly starving for the most the century, thousands of peasants' revolts occurred in 18th century France. It got worse after the American war of Independence when France almost went bankrupt. The king tried to squeeze more taxes out of the nobility (who ""owned"" the peasantry) starving the populace even more. When the crown tried to establish a parliament to appease the nobility and bourgeosie, it failed to redistribute powers among these classes and angered them even more. When the peasant's revolts intensified to the point of no return the bourgeoisie and nobility embarked in the revolution to end the absolute monarchy ... but things kinda got off their hands and a couple of bloody and chaotic years later the king had lost his head and most of the nobility was disgraced if not killed. When the Revolutionaries took the reign of power, ALL the surrounding monarchies declared war on France. Power in France had shifted from an absolute monarch to the bourgeoisie who played well its cards in the revolution by pushing the nobility out of power positions and effectively were leading the masses. Terror and chaos would go on until the bourgeoisie installed and deposed their new ""kings"", Robespierre, etc. until Napoleon was declared Emperor of a republican empire at war with all of Europe's monarchies."

The state cushions you in many ways: you won't be forced to sleep in a car or on the street, you won't be evicted for missing 3 months rent and you can't be fired without a significant severance package to keep you floating.  You'll often be given counseling, guidance or even training to get a new job, unemployment benefits can be substantial as long as you're actively searching for new work.  The safety net exists for a reason.  It simply can't be compared.

The organization wouldn't have let the #2 pick in the draft get buried.

Darko got 5 minutes a game his rookie year because he sucked. Larry Hughes got 20 minutes a game as a rookie under Larry Brown. David Lee got 15. Channing Frye got 25. Carlos Delfino got 15.

Lastly, the Pistons didn't have some complete team that Darko just didn't fit into. During his rookie year, they gave up two first-round picks to pick up a big man (Rasheed Wallace) who promptly got starters' minutes.

It is the same with sports - many of the Middle East countries do not formally recognise Israel, and refuse to play against them. I also think it could be very dangerous for Israeli athletes to go to some countries, they are not even allowed to I belive. So, Israel compete with the Europeans. At least in sports, I'd say it is a huge loss for Israel, European countries are far better at sport than the Middle Eastern ones.

The most common ones, and the ones I'm rather interested at the moment in is teaching a language (English in my case) or being a translator(what I'm hoping for).

 You can be either a translator/language guy for small/bigger business, translate literature and so on (if you specialize in it, you don't have to be a state translation to get those jobs, it would certainly help, but just knowing the language [and probably majoring in certain subjects help) or a state translator (this one is harder, you have to pass a very hard exam [also, pay for it, expensive as it is, if you fail you can only take it twice a year] to be accepted.

Being a state translator lets you sit in important positions like, from what I understand, important positions like being a translator for the court, or government officials, or even EU ones.

Then there's also the choice of what kind of a translator you're going to be (there are various 'roles' so to speak, depending on your abilities, knowledge and so on)

I might be wrong in some things though."

Edit: As far as my Googling can tell, all EU countries as well as the UK are officially 230V -6% +10%, although the UK is closer to 220V and the EU is closer to 240V.  At some point they decided to make an official standard, but the UK was formerly at 220V and the EU was formerly at 240V, and they didn't deem it necessary to spend all the time and money to change those values, so instead they grouped them under a 230V official voltage.

&gt; The state cushions you in many ways: you won't be forced to sleep in a car or on the street, you won't be evicted for missing 3 months rent and you can't be fired without a significant severance package to keep you floating. You'll often be given counseling, guidance or even training to get a new job, unemployment benefits can be substantial as long as you're actively searching for new work. The safety net exists for a reason. It simply can't be compared.

I also don't think you realise how much of the safety net has been stripped away in parts of Southern Europe. In Spain, for instance, after 24 months you get no benefit at all - and there are a lot of people in that situation years after the crisis. In Greece, it's even worse. These governments are completely bankrupt. In Romania, not even in the Euro, but massively affected by it's problems, they slashed teachers' salaries by 25%, so even people in work are in a bad way.

&gt; Industrial output in Europe is now further from peak than it was during the Great Depression.
&gt; What relevance does this have to your argument? Developed nations transition to service based economies, not industrial ones. Frankly I'd be shocked if Europe's current indigenous industrial output outstripped its capacity at any time between 1900-1980.

The transition to a service based economy is in terms of employment and GDP share, not in absolute levels of output. Output has kept on climbing, even in the most post-industrial societies like the UK. When I mention decline mean from the beginning of the relative crisis (2007 for the current one).

You could say Belgium started the whole thing by distinguishing between the Tutsi and Hutu, and favoring the Tutsi as closer to being European, which engendered all sorts of racial politics that might not have been as tense without it, but you're probably looking for something a little closer to the time of the incident. There's a large set of articles and speculation about France's involvement in the Rwandan Genocide for a couple of reasons:
1. Most of the arms deals that the Hutu negotiated were at the Rwandan embassy in Paris. These arms included the infamous machetes bought whole-sale from China, as well as mortars, grenades, and AK-47s
2. The French response to the beginnings of the genocide was Operation Turquoise, where French troops theoretically were deployed in order to quell violence in areas. However, they were systematically deployed to regions where the brunt of genocide had already occurred. There has been reasonable lines of thought that say Operation Turquoise's true purpose was to prevent the Tutsi RPF from taking Kigali back. 

I'd be interested in finding more academic sources about this though, I usually just read news articles like this [one](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1968392,00.html) about France's attempting to figure out their own role of responsibility within the genocide. I think a piece by Linda Melvern for the Times entitled ""France and Genocide"" is supposed to be pretty rigorous in the sense that she was one of the first people to go through the French documents and connections between France and Rwanda. You should also check out the varying commission reports between France and Rwanda."

Problemet ligger efter dette punkt:

Fejlen rammer folk på den server der spiller på EU West og nogle få på EU Nordic East. Fejlen skyldes enten, at trafikken ikke routes videre fra ovenstående punkt, som er en router et sted i England eller at Riot Games rent faktisk har problemer med deres login server. Det er ikke noget vi eller TDC har noget med at gøre.

Så problemet ligger i routingen til EU West serveren eller problemer på selve serveren, og det skal meldes til League of Legends’ support.

Vi kan også læse, at der er kunder i Sverige, Tyskland og Belgien som har problemet. Dem der spiller fra Tyskland routes på intet tidspunkt igennem TDC net og det samme er tilfældet for spillere fra Frankrig Spanien osv. Vi har som en test lavet en traceroute fra USA til samme EU West server og får samme fejl derfra – dvs. problemet er ikke udbyderbaseret."

World War 1 started on 28 July 1914.

&gt;10. On August 2nd, 1941, (Av 9, 5701 AM), SS commander Heinrich Himmler received approval from the Nazi party for ""The Final Solution"". One year later, to the day, the plan was formally implemented. The final solution was the almost completely successful plan to murder all the Jews in Europe. Almost 50% of the Jews on the face of the earth were captured and killed at that time.

Wrong date and people. On 31 July 1941 Hermann Göring gave written authorization to Reinhard Heydrich to prepare and submit a plan for a ""total solution of the Jewish question"" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organizations. 

Implementation was begun at the Wannsee Conference on the 20th of January 1942.

I know the LCS is great for developing the Region, but because of that, there tends to be large gaps between regions e.g Korea and EU or EU and NA and so forth with no way of really scrimming/playing eachother to really get better. 

We can only hope that Riot sees to make more international tournaments of the scale of allstar. Allstar was good, but the only real thing it showed was that NA wasn't trash as everyone thought and Korea was godlike. It showed nothing else because really all the teams had around 1 weeks worth of practice to scrim, probably less. I just hope that riot makes the allstar 'practice' time longer for the teams to actually practice before the tournament so you dont get teams like the EU team who just had no synergy at all apart from the 3 gambit players"

Local control. In the end, I don't think it makes sense to leave a country if you're only in it to save money.

*  Also, with growing tension between Russia and Germany at the time, Russia was basically scared that if Germany chose to cut off exports, Russia would have nothing.
*  (Russia and France did eventually ally)Anyway, it's also important to note that after the initial fall out of the global economy, Germany was probably hit the hardest among the European states.
*  Germany's industry and export based economy was less impacted by that, and more by the lack of people with money to buy stuff from them (though of course had some problems with finance as well).
*  As other economies began to recover and new markets started building up, German industry and export businesses were still at full capacity to jump on the opportunity.

If you are able to locate different types of worms, you can also offer silkworms, hornworms, and repti-worms, which are the larvae of soldier flies or beetles.  Roaches such as dubias and lobster roaches are good options too.  

For crickets and basic worms, here it is to be expected to spend between $5 and $10 a week, depending on where you go, if you buy them in bulk, etc.  For roaches and the less common worms, that depends highly on where you get them and how many you keep on hand - they can range (here in the states) anywhere from $20 to $100 a shipment depending on the size and quantity you get. 

So as a baseline, expect to be buying about 400 crickets a month (100 per week), and about 400 mealworms/giant mealworms/superworms a month.  You know what you can find those for locally, so I'll leave the cost calculations up to you.  Here you can get 400 crickets for about $20, or you can get [1,000 shipped to you for $30.] (http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/feeder-crickets-worms-rodents-roaches-and-more/crickets/)  Depending on the worms, those range depending on size, and here the breakdown for 400 is $8/ $16/ $26, or you can 1,000 quantities shipped to you for about the same price.

Again, all the shipping costs are for the US, so your pricing may be different.  I don't know how readily available bugs are in Europe, but unless prices for crickets, locusts, or worms are higher than what you pay for gas, I don't see how the cost for food would be $200 or more.

It's still seen as counter-culture now. That said, I have nothing against these religions or anyone following them. It's just slightly amusing to see them jump from one pan to the next. "

Unless you're in eastern Europe or Africa or east Asia or something, you don't have a local orphanage.  You might have a local receiving facility or a local residential group home, but you certainly can't adopt a six-year-old from one.

I bring this up because it makes me think you have a LOT of reading and research to do to understand the basics of adoption, and adoptee psychology.  Adopting older children is really not easy.  They come with a lot of problems caused by abuse and neglect, take a lot of time and attention, and you have to be SO well-informed about the problems they face.  It's not like *Annie*.

I invite you to hang around here and read a lot of the posts.  You'll hear opinions and experiences from a lot of adoptees, and adoptive parents of older children.  Check out [Fosterwee](http://fosterwee.wordpress.com/) and [Fosterhood](http://fosterhood.tumblr.com/), they're amazing sites and very honest about the pressures of adopting from foster care.  It's a good way to learn!

Adopting older children is a really great thing to do.  I don't think anyone is ready for it at age 23 or 24, though, and especially not when their SO is not on board.  Barring special circumstances like your SO is same-sex and you can't legally two-parent adopt, no agency is going to place a child into a situation where one parent will be adopting and the other won't (and even then, both parents need to be on board).  If you're really interested in this, take some time, attend some parenting classes, join Big Sisters and mentor a foster child, so you can see what you're getting into.  You will be in a far better place to foster or adopt if you make the decision to go ahead and do it."

The director and current devs of 14 are firing on all cylinders. I say this as an extremely skeptical person coming from how 11 has been managed over the years. SE has done a complete change around from how they use to be and Yoshi-P is listening and doing his hardest to make the game everyone wants.

Some back story about 1.0. The original director of 1.0 ran ff11 and he ran that game into the ground. The NA community was ignored and they added content that was just boring, brutal, and stuff no one wanted (we had an update that added fucking bells, this was a large update and all we got was fucking bells).

When that director left to work on 14, 11 improved leaps and bounds. When I started alpha testing 14, it was horrible. All the communities, NA JP EU gave them all the feedback in the world. They ignored it all. Tanaka (director of 14 1.0) released them game way to early and it failed. Yoshi was put in place and started fixing 1.0 and making decisions about 2.0 while Tanaka went back to 11. When that happened 11 turned to shit. Tanaka eventually stepped down and 11 has take. A swing for the better, but that game is stuck mostly because of the divide of PS2 players and the PS2 limitations.

The beta for 14 2.0 was one if the most polished betas I've ever been in. Ever since leaving 11 I've been looking for a new mmo with that certain spark and 14 2.0 has it. The devs actually listen and communicate rather frequently, in normal talk. I cant tell you how nice it is to hear things with a non PR spin on them. Yoshi is about the most realistic person I've ever seen.

So with that said, 14 is sub based, and its worth every dime."

In fact, this would go forth in helping actually solidifying a *""Western Bloc""*, instead of it merely being some pipe dream. 

The coming century has been dubbed the *""Asian Century""*, and for good reason. While, at present, America and the European Union are the largest economies on the planet, this is due to change with rising Asian juggernauts *(specifically China &amp; India)*. We have the present power, but both those countries have the potential to eclipse us completely and to influence the world in the way they see it. If we still want a voice in the future, a Western influence in global geo-politics, I think something like this is EXTREMELY essential to ensuring that. 

We have the momentum to define the world by Western standards and quality. If we hesitate we'll lose that chance completely. I'd like to bring up this BBC article, [US-EU trade deal: Six reasons to care](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22909209), specifically this part: 

&gt;**4. Chinese standards edged out**

&gt;It will be tricky for the two regions to agree on exactly the same regulations, but the hope is they will harmonise enough to bring huge savings to manufacturers.

&gt;Companies tend to build things that are easier to sell in the biggest market, says Stokes, so a huge market with common technical standards will be a huge draw for global investment.

&gt;""You would be creating a market with no tariff barriers and diminished regulatory barriers, worth about $30tn (£19tn), which would basically set the technical standards for the immediate future.

&gt;""Samsung has made it clear, for example, that its next generation of mobile phones will be built to either a European-American standard, or a Chinese one. And that if Brussels and Washington fail to come up with common specifications, it will be Beijing's standards that Samsung adopts.

&gt;""And perhaps more importantly, these regulations would be openly arrived at, transparent and accountable, unlike those developed by the Chinese government.""

&gt;Car manufacturers in the US and EU have already agreed common standards in things that the average consumer never sees, says Stokes, like the way batteries in electric cars are tested and operate.

&gt;To avoid car companies having to come up with separate electrical vehicles for each market, he says, they want to build cars in Europe they can sell in the US and vice-versa.

===================================================

And this point as well: 

===================================================

&gt;**2. Europe less reliant on Russian gas**

&gt;Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, US natural gas exports are regulated and must be authorised by the Department of Energy, which considers whether exporting is ""consistent with the public interest"".

&gt;However, exports to free-trade-agreement (FTA) partner countries are fast-tracked, so cheap American shale gas would be available to all member countries of the EU, says Bruce Stokes, a non-resident fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

&gt;""That would be in American self-interest and help our trade imbalance but there are US industries who benefit from cheap energy and who probably are not keen to see European competitors benefit from it also.

&gt;""It would also help the European economy and go some way to weaning it off Russian gas. So there are huge geo-strategic reasons for the US to tie its allies to itself through energy exports.

&gt;""Whether you would be able to export enough gas to wean Europe off Russia entirely, it depends, but symbolically it would be very important.""

**TL;DR The EU-US FTA solidifies a Western Bloc, ensures that Western standards and quality are the global status quo (as opposed to China), takes away Europe's reliance on Russia for natural gas (improves energy security) and it seems the only major losers, backed up even by this article, are “BRIC”countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), both of our country/union's potential competitors/rivals in the developing Multi-Polar World of the ""Asian Century"".**"

I actually have a set rule to never wear a jacket if it is more than 10C (50F) outside. So as long as it is above that, I am comfortable in indoor clothing. I'm fine with the temperature during the summer, I only wished the summer lasted a bit longer and that the water temperature was higher. 

However, the temperature change is quite rapid and just counting the past 20 years, when I was a kid, the average temperature has gone up with a bit more than 1 degree celsius, which makes a big difference.

There's actually lots of tourists from Southern Europe that come to the north during the summers. As it is simply too hot down there, while up here the temperature is just right and the vegetation is booming. On the flip side, lots of Swedens go on a vacation to the south during the winter.

The water temperature is around 20C (68F) during the summer, though that I wished it was a bit more. So in that sense global warming isn't that bad. The government has done quite a bit of calculations concerning it and it turns out Sweden would actually have a net gain from Global warming. It would decrease the cost of heating up, increase the farming season as well as have a bunch of other positive factors. The issue with rising sea levels is also almost of no concern since the country is still rising every year since the last ice age.

Still, Sweden is one of the countries that does the most to fight global warming and has less than 30% of the CO2 emissions than for example the US has per capita.

the problem with most students of western thought is that they interpret the ancient Eastern philosophy too literally i.e. winged beings, etc. That is the spiritual component of eastern philosophy and we must cut it some slack considering that this philosophy predates western thought by a few millenia and probably influenced it to a great degree.

Take some examples from the bhagavad gita which is one of many indian philosophy texts. Krishna states that 'inaction  is death'.

Now, krishna is a God whome people believe in. Does that invalidate what he says? Can some philosophical subcontext be gleaned from this. Of course. you'd have to be retarded to simply see the spiritual element and discount it.

Therefore, everwhere outside of Europe and the so called realms of western thought, eastern philosophy is regarded as more advanced, more in-depth and vastly more complex than plato and socrates.

That's a bit of an oxymoron IMHO.  Multicultural is the antithesis of uniformity.  Most Canadians of all linguistic backgrounds prefer a country that's culturally rich and diverse IMHO.

I feel that the current Eurozone crisis is a good example of why the EU is not a particularly good model to follow.  A currency union really requires some sort of political union.  Germany essentially gets to dictate the monetary policy for the entire EU, which isn't particularly fair to people in Italy or Spain or France, nor would it be fair for Quebec in this context.

I do agree that some model of a looser federation is worth considering at least.  I think it's a model we may have to craft ourselves though."

I'm back and forth in a couple different threads). God obviously felt faith was necessary, and he knows better than us. 

God has given no evidence at all that he exists. I don't think it was me that said anything about Paul and faith, but I see no logical point to requiring that people believe without evidence. Why? How is that a moral virtue?

&gt;No, you don't want the supernatural to explain them because you feel like we as a race have evolved beyond the need of God in our lives. 

No, in fact, there is no NEED for the supernatural. I don't think we have ""evolved beyond the need for God,"" because there was no need for God in the first place. Evolution is not a hierarchal procession like that any way. Humans are not ""more evolved"" than fruit flies. If you can't show anything in biology which couldn't have happened by natural processes, then there is no reason to posit magic.

&gt;I can find the answer, but why would I take hours and hours to look up all that information on my own when it is compiled on one page that I can link to? I understand you wanting to put down a source that consistently shows credible reasoning and Biblical text to support it when it is contrary to your argument, but it's just a vain attempt to avoid responding to the valid points it makes. 

It's just non-responsive for you to keep punting to it rather than trying to do your own debating. Do you not know what your own beliefs are? If you want to use that site as a resource, then at least quote whatever you think the strongest point is and I'll respond to that.

&gt;When I refer to ""God's Word"" I am referring to the Bible. As for proof that it is the inspired word of God and not just crazy ramblings of man, here you go. :-)

Let's go through what you linked to:

&gt;1) Fulfilled prophecy. God spoke to men telling them of things He would bring about in the future. Some of them have already occurred. Others have not. For example, there were more than 300 prophecies concerning Jesus Christ's first coming 2,000 years ago. There is no doubt that these are prophecies from God because of manuscripts and scrolls dated before the birth of Christ. These were not written after the fact. They were written beforehand. Scientific dating proves this.


This is a bare assertion with no support and, in fact, no truth. There is not a single genuine example of fulfilled prophecy in the Bible (or in any other book or ever in history in any form). 

&gt;2) The unity of Scripture. The Bible was written by approximately 40 human authors over a period of approximately 1,600 years. These men were quite diverse. Moses, a political leader; Joshua, a military leader; David, a shepherd; Solomon, a king; Amos, a herdsman and fruit picker; Daniel, a prime minister; Matthew, a tax collector; Luke, a medical doctor; Paul, a rabbi; and Peter, a fisherman; among others. The Bible was also written under a variety of circumstances. It was written on 3 different continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Yet, the great themes of Scripture are maintained in all the writings. The Bible does not contradict itself. There is no way, apart from God the Holy Spirit supervising the writing of the Bible, that this could have been accomplished.

This is false in several ways. None of those authors are really the authors and the Bible is wildly inconsistent theologically. It contradicts itself constantly. Whoever wrote this page is exceptionally misinformed and possibly brain damaged. 

&gt;Contrast this with the Islamic Koran. It was compiled by one individual, Zaid bin Thabit, under the guidance of Mohammed's father-in-law, Abu-Bekr. Then in A.D. 650, a group of Arab scholars produced a unified version and destroyed all variant copies to preserve the unity of the Koran. The Bible was unified from the time of its writing. The Koran had to be unified through the editing of men.

The Bible has never been anything close to ""unified,"" and has undergone a hell of a lot more editing, redaction and syncretization than the Koran,  and bashing the Koran does not make the Bible true. The Bible has no more going for it in terms of theological consistency than the Koran does. It probably has less 

&gt;3) The Bible presents its heroes truthfully with all of their faults and weaknesses. It does not glorify men as other religions do about their heroes. 

Ridiculous special pleading and completely inaccurate when it says other religions don't do the same thing. Homer certainly does it, and all mythologies are filled with flawed heroes and gods.

&gt;4) Archaeological findings support the history recorded in Scripture.

Complete and total bullshit. Archaeology has obliterated historicity for many of the Bible's most crucial claims. like, for instance, the entirety of the books of Genesis and Exodus.

&gt;A good example is Isaiah 40:22, which declared that God “sits on the circle of the earth” long before scientists claimed the earth was flat.

The Bible thinks the Earth is a flat disc sitting on top of pillars, that the sky is  solid metal dome, that the stars are stuck to the inside of the dome and that there is a bunch of water on top of the dome. The Bible thinks that there are gates in the dome and that God opens the gates to make it rain. Trying to argue that the Bible is scientifically accurate is not going to be convincing. It describes a Sumerian cosmology. It does not think the earth is a sphere, it thinks the earth is a disc.

&gt;The stories are out there, it's just a matter of finding them. I'll try and find a few for you in the next day or two. 

Stories are not evidence. In point of fact, there has never been a single verifiable ""miracle"" in all of human history. Confirmation bias about cancer remission is not evidence.

&gt;Wow, way to take something and jump to some far off conclusion that has nothing to do with what was said. God didn't kill anyone; a sinful man did. And I know what you're going to say next: ""Well God created him so therefore God killed them."" Wrong. You as an arguer of logic and fallicies should be able to see the number of things wrong with that argument. 

I notice you didn't bother to say HOW I'm wrong. Nothing can logically happen without God's will and all God's will is preordained. Every act of man or Satan is a *de facto*, pre-planned act of God.There is no way out of this logical box. The free will defense is not adequate because an omniscient God can choose not to create people he knows will shoot up grade schools. God is also the one who gave that guy his mental illness in the first place. It wasn't like he really had true free will, his brain didn't work right. 

&gt;If you actually research before you make your statements, you'll be incorrect a lot less often. There are countless examples of students being told by school officials they can't wear a cross necklace because it is offensive, or they can't have prayer vigils on school property. You're correct that they can't govern secret, inner prayers, but they certainly try to govern audible or public ones. Just watch what they do if a student tries to pray at graduation.

I've been a teacher myself, and this is all bullshit. Teachers cannot proselytize students and students cannot use school events and microphones to proselytize. The assertion that people can't pray audibly has no truth to it at all. They can't disrupt classes by talking, but that has nothing to do with content. Kids can and do organize *audible* prayer groups all the time. It's only the *government* that is constrained, not the students. Would you want schools leading kids in Muslim prayer? Hindu prayer? Satanic prayers? Or would you rather that the government just stay out of it? 

&gt;God is not punishing anyone. We told God we don't want him in our schools. Well, we have to take the good with the bad. The good (for the world) is that they don't have to hear about God in schools. The bad is that if they don't want God around, he's not going to be around, regardless if good or bad things are happening. Now once the tragedy started, as Mike Huckabee spoke about, God did show up in the form of first responders and in teachers doing what they could to save their kids.

This is so fatuous, I don't think I even have to address it except to say that your premise is false, and it's logically inane to say that God allows psychopaths to mow down 1st Graders because he is sulking like a jilted teenage girl in the parking lot.

&gt;Right, he could. But you completely ignored my point about the great things that can come out of tragedies. 

No they can't. This is fumbling rationalization. Whatever God can achieve by allowing tragedy he can just as easily achieve WITHOUT allowing tragedy. It's not logically possible for an omnipotent entity to require tragedy as a means to an end, because omnipotent entities don't require any means to ends at all. They can just will the end. Thy need no plan or process. Any allowance of suffering is gratuitous and can never be logically necessary.

&gt;First, it was not just a human sacrifice. Jesus was God and man. 

If he was God, it was no sacrifice at all, but this still doesn't explain why it accomplished anything. Why was ANY sacrifice necessary? What could God do after the crucifixion that he couldn't do before the crucifixion? Did the crucifixion give him extra superpowers or something?

&gt;So hypothetically, if I could prove God existed to you right now and that he created you, would you then say you have no responsibility for your own actions since God created you knowing you would do those things?

Correct. If God is omnipotent, then all acts of humanity are necessarily conscious acts of God. That is the problem of evil in a nutshell."

George VI, his son, married the daughter of the heir to a scottish earldom.  And of course George VI's older brother Edward VIII had to give up the throne when he married a divorced American.

Everything tends to taste the same in the same style across all restaurants. And this is true not just for restaurants in Chicago but all over US (I grew up in India and have lived in US for 14 years, and in Chicago for past 7 years). Hopefully someday regional Indian restaurants will be as common as regional Chinese restaurants have become in the past 10 years.

That being said, there are a few restaurants in town that put in the effort to rise above just the generic, and have pride in their cooking.

* Hema's Kitchen on Devon (I would not recommend the one in Lincoln Park)

* Udupi Palace on Devon - This is is the only South Indian restaurant in town that rises to the quality of a good such restaurant in India

* Gaylords on Walton near Michigan  - Weekend lunch buffet usually has a number of perfectly spiced, flavorful dishes, their cook definitely has a excellent idea of how to blend and combine Indian spices. The dishes ordered off the menu have been hit or miss for me.

* India House on Grand near Dearborn - Lunch buffet is an excellent example of Americanized Indian food done right. Again, the dishes ordered off the menu have been hit or miss for me.

* Gareeb Nawaz on Devon - does an excellent rendition of cheap roadside eateries in the subcontinent. The food is very oily and sanitation might be iffy, but the flavors are excellent.

* Hakka Wok on Golf Road in Schaumburg - good Indian-Chinese.

* Usmania on Devon or Sabri Nehari on Devon - both good Pakistani cuisine specialists. I would lean a bit towards Usmania.

You also need to take VAT issues into consideration.

In principle, Germany only taxes you for income you have earned in Germany. If you are performing work in the UK for German clients, then this would be a within-EU service performance which would probably fall under the ""reverse charge"" proceeding (look it up if you are brave).

But your income would be earned and reported in the UK.

Remember that ""Arbeitgeber"" is for employer, not ""Auftraggeber"".

Please inform me briefly whether you are engaging in self-employed contracts or whether you are also an employee of a German-based company, i.e. is your software work freelance?

If by ""working for a German company"" you mean as an employee, then any answer would need to address whether you are employed by them in the UK with a UK contract or employed by them in the UK as a ""foreign worker on assignment"".

Red Brick got famous for literally one beer- their blonde.  Which is actually pretty good, but it is a blonde so it isn't really a popular variety of beer with ""beer people"".  Their Cherry Chocolate Porter they recently did was awesome- bourbon barrel aged, really good.  Most of their stuff is kind of meh for me though.

Sweetwater is a social event now, not a brewery.  Their limited release stuff is really good, (The Dank Tank series) just really hard to find.  I commend their year rounds for just being very drinkable, and readily available (420, IPA, Brown).  Blue is all my girlfriend's tap in the kegerator ever has on it, and is a great hangover cure.

Monday Night Brewing is a newcomer doing a lot of traditional european styles.  Good stuff for the most part, the IPA sucks in my opinion, although the 2xIPA is awesome (weird I know).  The scotch ale, drafty kilt is very good, and relatively widely distributed.

Wild Heaven is really small and great.  Only had two of their beers, Ode to Mercy and Invocation.  Both are incredibly good, complex flavors, and great american takes on european styles - a Belgian and an imperial brown.  They come in 4-packs, and aren't widely distributed. If you get the chance to try this, do.

Terrapin is simply the best, but their good stuff is hard to get a hold of.  Their only mainstream beer that is worth mentioning is Hopsecutioner, it is as hoppy as the name implies.  The others are OK, but just are nothing special.  This is a brewery who actually does creative stuff in limited release and seasonal beers.  I don't want something everyone else does that is similar, I want a beer that can blaze a new trail.  A keg of Hop Karma currently resides on one of my taps, and it is awesome.  They refer to it as a Brown IPA, it is a great brown, with a lot of bitterness added.  The interplay between the sweet carmel taste and the heavy hop load is impressive.  All of the Side Project Beers ( http://terrapinbeer.com/brew/side-project/ ) are really unique, and this is why I appreciate Terrapin so much.  Find a seasonal or a side project that sounds good to you and either custom order a keg of it or go to Athens and do a brew tour, you will not regret it.

You also have to consider what the universal plan would be willing to pay for.  There would be less development of follow-on pharmaceuticals and products because the current ones in existence would be deemed good enough.

I worked as staff on Capitol Hill for a little while.  I was fully in support of universal single payer until I started taking meetings with doctors about Medicare reimbursement rates.

&gt; And what's wrong with ""Stealing humanism""? Don't you want to encourage people to be generous? 

I think humanism is amazing.  But what religions do is slap their own name on humanism and then claim it to be special.  Everytime someone complains about the church, the response is that the ""church does so much good!""

Yes, it does good because *the people are good*.  If everyone changed from Christianity being secular humanists the world wouldn't skip a beat.  

The good would continue to do good and the bad would continue to do bad.  And religion would fall away.  It's happening right now in Europe.

-------

&gt; Religions get reformed all the time, humanism was one of the elements that got added in. **Humanism does have bad, look at all the bloodshed** that has happened because of humanism, I mean, the advances humanism made have been for both good and evil. 

WHAT?

*Humanism is a group of philosophies and ethical perspectives which emphasize the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers individual thought and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith (fideism). *

Please name me a humanist who has committed an evil act due to his humanism.

This trend would include stories, films and television shows about vampires, werewolves, zombies and other monsters who are either complex in their villainy or who inspire social change and complex emotions in others. 

The monsters usually represent a manifestation of social anxieties. For example, zombies are often seen as a manifestation of anxieties over mass consumerism/consumption. In the same way, Dracula (1897) was a manifestation of anxieties surrounding both masculinity (There are several instances of rape imagery and power struggles between men and women in the book -- a result of the fact that women were becoming more socially independent following the women's suffrage movement.) and an increase in the number of foreigners and Jewish people in Great Britain (There are several aspects of Dracula's appearance that were stereotypically ""Jewish"" qualities of the time.).

Though there are always stories of this nature (monster and villain stories), they tend to be quite popular in the decades surrounding the turn of the centuries, and they very often reflect the social issues that are prevalent in each era because the turn of the century is naturally transitional, and anxiety often stems from transition.

So, darkmood, I think your guess is actually a pretty good one. I don't know if parasites will be the next ""big thing,"" but recent events surrounding surveillance and increased government control could definitely result in something like that, at least in the U.S. and Europe. But I could be wrong. Heck, something unforeseen could arise and it could be completely different.

tl;dr Monsters are popular at the turn of the century. The next popular thing could be related to parasites, but it will likely reflect anxieties about surveillance/government power or other relevant issues."

Fairly sure Europe is not getting into debt because of their healthcare. Nearly all developed countries have universal healthcare - Its proven to be effective simply by comparing costs to those that don't have it. The US for example right now spends much more per capita on healthcare than other developed countries, if anything it may lower the cost.

One cool part of that letter was, as Marx wrote, ""The bourgeois papers are still holding it against us that of A. Lincoln’s replies to the various messages of congratulations on his re-election, only the reply to ours was more than a formal acknowledgment of receipt"".  I don't know from Lenin, but there's a lot of cool stuff about about other pre-WWII Marxists admiring America, particularly Lincoln and ""the Great Anti-Slavery War"". My favorite anecdote is that the leftist Americans who fought in Spanish Civil War organized themselves into units like ""the Abraham Lincoln Brigade"" and ""the John Brown Anti-Aircraft Battery"". (After World War II especially there was a running joke that the Socialist criticism to any American achievement could be ""[But in America you lynching negroes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes)"")

Europe is getting into debt because of its healthcare, its generous welfare programs, its generous education benefits, and other ""free"" things it provides to its citizens. Now, the only way to save Europe is to make cuts to some of, if not all of those things, and nobody wants to do it.

Umm... Theres a bit more to it than that. The cause of the crisis wasn't because of its social policies - The suggestion of cutting them is a solution to the situation they are in not the cause of the situation.

Here you go:

globalisation of finance

easy credit conditions during the 2002–2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices

the 2007–2012 global financial crisis
international trade imbalances

real-estate bubbles that have since burst

the 2008–2012 global recession

fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses

approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders
 
assuming private debt burdens or socialising losses.

&gt;If that is the basis on which your argument rests, then there should be no problem! No need to look at why those costs differ or anything, or even to bother looking at the general trend for Europe's healthcare (which, by the way, is that costs are going up, and quality is going down).

Europe isn't the only place with developed countries... Also proof? If it is true I would blame it on the tightening of budgets more than anything else. 

&gt;It certainly will lower the cost! For you and I, and even for the government! For awhile, anyways. But, once we get into the groove of it, and single-payer just becomes ""the way things are done here,"" costs will go up, and quality will go down until we face the same crisis. The only way to fix it, by my estimation, is to introduce some cost controls -- but the only cost control that actually works is competition. In order to have competition, you have to have a market. A free one.

Prove to me that this a trend for universal healthcare. And you do realize that these countries do have mixed systems where a private option is offered to those who can afford it? 

Just give me some evidence to back up your claims of Healthcare costs eventually increasing whilst quality decreases"

_________________________________________

[Over the past year](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/8481098275), we've
made some changes to our account rollback policy for players in the Asia,
Americas, and Europe regions. These updates were an added step in protecting
the in-game economy from the noted rise of false compromised account claims by
players attempting to duplicate items. To date, these policy changes have been
effective in helping to reduce the number of duplicated items in the game.

  
**On August 6**, we'll be further updating the policy to include a cap on gold and commodities that are restored as part of the process, adding further protections for the game economy.   
  
**[What's Changing Starting Tuesday, August 6]**  
  
_All character equipment (including weapons and armor) restored via the Diablo
III rollback service will continue to be bound to the restored account._ The
restored items cannot be traded with other players or posted on the auction
house, but they can still be shared with other characters on the account and
sold to merchant NPCs.

  
Additionally, the below changes to gold and commodities restoration will also
occur:

  

  * **Gems:**
    * Each gem type (Amethyst, Emerald, Ruby,Topaz) up to Perfect Square will be restored up to a total maximum count of 500 of that type (e.g. 500 Flawless Amethysts). Marquise gems will be restored in full, as they are Bind-on-Account. Higher level gems will be restored up to the following limits:
      * Radiant Square – 250
      * Star – 100
      * Flawless Star – 50
      * Perfect Star – 25
      * Radiant Star – 10
  

  * **Crafting Materials:**
    * Each type of crafting material will be restored up to a total maximum count of 500 (e.g. 500 Subtle Essence).
    * Each type of training material will be restored up to a total of 500 (e.g. 500 Tomes of Blacksmithing).
    * Each type of crafting plan will be restored up to a total of 1 (e.g. 1 plan for Cain’s Fate).
  

  * **Gold:**
    * Gold restored will be limited to 10 million.
  
  
As always we are committed to continuing to monitor the overall health and
economy of the game and make additional tweaks if necessary.

  
**[Protecting Your Account]**  
  
Considering that the rollback service is intended to help players whose
accounts have been compromised, we obviously wish that no one ever needed to
use it. The best way to help protect yourself from account compromise is to
secure your PC and Battle.net account, for example by adding a Battle.net
Authenticator. While no security measure is completely foolproof, we've often
found that _many accounts are compromised a second time simply because players
do not take any action to protect themselves after being compromised the first
time_.

securing your PC against viruses and malware, check out the links below.

On December 19, 2008 under the 44th session of the GEPA (Group Aeronautical Project Evaluator) is authorized 224 new frequencies nationwide. Likewise, the Department of Transportation approved on March 25, 2009 at the airline's flights from Barranquilla, Bogota and Cartagena to New York and Fort Lauderdale. On July 24, 2010 indefinitely suspended its operations in Venezuela given the continuing low traffic and strained relations with that country.

Edit 2: También podrías considerar a TAM Brasil, ya que de hecho ahora son LATAM, luego de unirse con LAN:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAM_Airlines
The company is currently the largest Brazilian airline company by market share and fleet size.

Before the takeover, TAM was Brazil's and Latin America's largest airline.[5][6] Its headquarters are in São Paulo,[7] operating scheduled services to destinations within Brazil, as well as international flights to Europe and other parts of North and South America. Shares in the company were traded on the São Paulo Exchange (BM&amp;F Bovespa) and New York Stock Exchange as ""TAM S.A."".[8] Prior to the merger with LAN, the company closed its capital, transferring its shares to Latam Airlines Group.

&gt; The emergence of Hebrew as a spoken language was **not the revival of a dead language, but the creation of a new language**. Even the people active in that idealistic movement of introducing Hebrew use into the new Zionist agenda realized that the emerging Hebrew vernacular was a new system...

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23241444

&gt; Recent sequencing of modern Caucasus populations prompted us to revisit the Khazarian hypothesis and compare it with the Rhineland hypothesis. We applied a wide range of population genetic analyses to compare these two hypotheses. **Our findings support the Khazarian hypothesis** and portray the European Jewish genome as a mosaic of Near Eastern-Caucasus, European, and Semitic ancestries, thereby consolidating previous contradictory reports of Jewish ancestry. 

http://eelhaik.aravindachakravartilab.org/ Eran Elhaik, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health:

&gt; On December 14th 2012, my paper was published in Genome Biology and Evolution. The Missing Link refutes the Rhineland Hypothesis, which is the basis of all genetic research done on European Jews, along with 63 years of Jewish population  genetics that emerged at the early 50′s.
You may ask, how is it possible that so many people followed the wrong path for for so long?

&gt; In 2003, Dr. Kirsh’s work (Kirsh 2003) may provide some answers. She reviewed papers published between 1951-1965 by Israel, Jews, and non-Jews about Jews. She concluded that “During this period the Israeli human geneticists and physicians emphasized the sociological and historical aspects of their research and used their work, among other things, **as a vehicle for establishing a national identity and confirming the Zionist narrative.**”

&gt; Dr. Kirsh was very generous and avoid using the term “lied” or “cooked” as bloggers put it. Dr. Kirsh’s study reviewed papers up to 1963, but this practice never stopped.

&gt; With time, the bad science practices (i.e., lies and misconception) became more sophisticated (it took me months to figure it all out) but with time the amount of data grew rapidly and **the lies became harder to conceive. Kirsh (2003) filled two pages with the bad practices of Israeli and Jews geneticists in their attempt to manipulate the data and the results so they will not conflict with the Zionist narrative.**
&gt; I didn’t find it necessary to do a similar project because then I would run out of space. Instead, I focused on the supernatural element of the Rhineland Hypothesis and the fact that it was completely made up to support the narrative. …

&gt; I hope one day someone will study the huge cost both in tax-payers dollars and health that the adoption of Zionist narrative (Rhineland hypothesis) cost the American people. Myths and religions of any kind are better left outside of science.

One day I sign us up to a throw away LAN tourney in So Cal. Nothing big, 5,000k tournament, 3 Cali teams including JMC (Jax money crew), CoL (original Complexity) and U5 (United 5, worst team in cal i LOL) and a cal P team West Coast Puggers (really good pub stomp team, aggressive as fuck.)

Me and another team mate watch their demos, make strats for two days then go to bed at 9 pm to be up early and fully of energy only drinking water. My other team mates got drunk and played World of Warcraft lol. 

Anyways, we go up against the one cal p team there first, my partner and I manage to hold our spots and take atleast 1-2 with us each round, everyone else had 1-0 on our team by the end.... Next team was CoL.

1. Darth Revan: simply because he was able to withstand himself against the Emperor back in Old Rep, which no other jedi knew about but he was able to discover and find him, along with his over Force feats.


2. Darth Sidious/Plageuis: I count both of them because they were both good with each other as well as separate, though Plageuis became too confident in his abilities of manipulation midi-chlorians and eventually died at the hands of Sidious.  They were both able to deceive the entire Jedi Order and concealing their true natures even to Masters such as Jedi Yoda, who theoretically was born shortly after the fall of the last Sith Empire.

3. Exar Kun:  Though there isn't any movies or games based around him, there are some books that talk about his lore and his abilities in the Force to conquer death itself, making him an immortal Force Ghost that can actually affect matter (unlike Obi-Wan's Ghost, which doesn't seem to affect matter).

4. Marka Ragnos: again just like Exar Kun, he was a powerful Sith Lord and still affected the Jedi thousands of years after his death.

Darth Caedus:  I did not read the books about Darth Caedus (or Jacen Solo), but from what I have read about what he has done in the EU, he really revolutionizes strategies and attacks on the Republic and other Jedi openly, bringing the New Republic Order to be openly attacked like in The Old Republic Era."

One thing I will say is that the accuracy buff since 0.8.6 has NOT been kind to the KV5.  The gun is terribad without gold and kinda defeats the purpose of being a premium.  The accuracy buff, great big weakspots and terrible gun only make this an even more lucrative  xp pinata for other tier 8's and if you toon, you'll probably regret it.

If you must have it then I guess why not, but don't expect this to be an easy money maker if you are average or below as it's an unforgiving bitch in the wrong hands.

0.8.6 imho has really crippled this tank and there is a huge thread now requesting for some part of it to be buffed.  I personally find it rather gauling that WG are putting it back in store without some modifications to make it more competitive.

One fantastic thing about the tank is that you can train 6 crew, the IS6 only supports 4 and the tier X IS-7 needs 5.  So it could be a good crew trainer for someone working that line.

**TL;DR**  The KV5 is a challenging tank to play - but certainly not an easy or lucrative tank compared to the other more expensive tier 8s.

http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/179654-petition-kv5-to-get-a-better-gun-sign-here/

**EDIT:** I found this page... http://www.flamesofwar.com/hobby.aspx?art_id=1325

&gt;	The KV-5 was a true monster of a tank. Nearly three times as long as a T-34 medium tank, and over twice as high, it dominated the battlefield in more ways than one. While it is slow, the gigantic KV-5 is almost immune to all enemy action and can destroy any enemy tank at long range.

&gt; The gospels details Jesus's lineage back to Adam. Either the gospels were wrong or we are truly in fact a little more than a hundred generations old. 

The Jewish authors of the bible loved genealogies. ""This begat that"" is fairly ubiquitous in the scriptures. It was important for Jesus to be a son of David, and important that Jesus be a son of the first man. We can read it historically and let it simple be an insight into Jewish culture. But the important part of this anyway was to show that Jesus, who was God, had a human history. God didn't simply plop down in spacetime as a newly created human, but was *born* of a human.

&gt;If there was no original sin from eating the wrong fruit, we don't need salvation. We are not born sinners.

The Eastern Orthodox don't accept this Total Depravity and Original Sin doctrine. The point of Jesus coming to earth wasn't to die as an absolution for our inherited guilt that was originally wrought by Adam. Jesus came to earth to be the Tree of Life, to teach, and to redeem the world through his actions. When Jesus died he redeemed death. ""Adam"" can be no more than a symbol representing early homo sapiens - that's all he needs to be.

&gt; I just can't see how you can admit the glaring mistakes of the bible's story but still give it any relevance at all, much less devoting your lives to it. 

Because Christians haven't historically been a religion of a book. They are a religion of history and tradition. The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches hold the scriptures secondary to Holy Tradition. The bible is venerated and seen as important, but that doesn't mean it's read literally as though God wrote it himself. 

&gt;How can you be a Christian without completely detaching yourself from basic scientific evidence? 

I'm not a Christian anymore, but I had no problem accepting science when I was one. It really seems to be only certain segments of Protestants in the United States that have an issue with science. European Christians and Catholics and Eastern Orthodox generally have no issue with science. "

What it says is that basically there's a progressive hierarchy, starting from the basic things like food, water, shelter - and then getting into things like security, feeling as if they have a place in society, and even feeling as if they're accomplishing something with their lives - that dictates someone's psychological ""needs"" to be happy and have a fulfilling life.

&gt; A friend of mine who works for some NGO/IGO groups that often have foreign service elements amongst their ranks due to the nature of their missions woke up at camp in Pakistan the day after the diplomatic cables leaked and found half her team was gone. They had picked up and left in the middle of the night because their handlers fortunately got word to them in time that their cover was probably going to be blown. Had they not been warned in time they could have been taken, the entire operation exposed to local harassment and threats (they were out in some fairly sketchy areas of Pakistan) or even violence. Even so, had word gotten out that these people were affiliated with these groups the remaining people, including my friend could have come into danger. These were not all Americans either, the group consisted of a number of Europeans, and delegation was associated with the UN and private organizations.

So yea, he did endanger people. He also weakened the position of the US and its relation with its allies and created fear and discontent on the international stage where there was no need for it."

Russia is more of a threat. They could do more damage to the European economy just by turning the gas off, than they could by an all out military attack.

These two threats have something in common: they are best met by  drive for energy independence. 

We could cut the military massively and still have enough resources for UN peacekeeping and contributions to UN and NATO operations. Though most of the time we don't bother doing much about genocide, and arguably in Bosnia we did nearly as much harm as good.

The German spending I was on about was from 1945 to 1955 when responsibility for German defence  rested with the Allied Powers.  On 12 November 1955 there was a change of policy, the Bundeswehr was formed and West Germany joined NATO. 

After that, they did indeed have a very large military, though due to conscription it wasn't as expensive as a comparable British force would have been.

Human rights. Equal rights for women. The right to develop and express your personality freely, especially regarding sexuality. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of faith. Freedom of speech. Gay rights. Democracy. Market economy. Condemnation of slavery and racism. All these values are not in the slightest Christian. On the contrary. Most of our values had to be fought for against the fierce opposition of Christianity. 

The dark age of Europe is an example for how a society based on Christian morals looks like. Suppression of women, merciless pursuit of minorities and disbelievers, selling of indulgences, torture and death penalties during the Inquisition, crusades, burning of ""witches"". Those are Christian morals. Western societies had to get rid of religious morals before they could become humane, just and social.

I think it's you who behaves hypocritically and a has serious set of blinders on when you enjoy the fruits of our secular morals and values, while trying to relabel them as Christian and attribute them to Christianity. Our morals are based on humanism, enlightenment, reason and experience and change over time as our society reaches better agreements on how we want to live together. Society gives itself moral laws like it gives itself juristic laws. For example, 100 years ago, we did not have equal rights for women, didn't have equal rights for all races, didn't have sexual freedom. Our values improve, and they improve as we kick out religious influence. Whenever Christianity forces itself back in, our society becomes less moral. For example when the religious right tries to take away the human right of women to have full control over their body and reproductive system."

No, it's not a bad thing. It's just that it's then a fools' errand to try and then aggregate power at the central level. Thus to bring the analogy back to the EU level, it's foolish to try and create further EU integration.


&gt; We were equally mystified at the UK governments attempts to block the protection of worker's rights and the increased compliance with basic human rights and dignity. This is clearly an issue which we cannot agree upon.

I see you side-stepped the barriers to free trade and the CAP (possibly the most damaging policy in the Western world)! But on the two issues you brought up:

1. Worker's rights. I'm all for worker's rights - Britain was one of the first countries in the world to do them. But there's a level of 'protection' which is just economically harmful. I work in a job I love and work about 60 hours a week. I also get paid more because I work so many hours. Why on Earth should this arrangement, which both myself, my company and my people are on board with, be made illegal by other nationalities with different preferences for the money-leisure trade-off?

2. Human rights. I'm sorry but when we're dealing with criminals, there are some human rights, like that of freedom, that we accept are infringed as punishment for their crimes. There is absolutely nothing wrong with making sure the perpetrators of the most sickening crimes give up their liberty for the rest of their lives. Just so you know, we find it somewhat crazy that the ECHR sticks up for such things yet continues to allow clear abrogations of free speech across Europe when it comes to genocide denial, banning certain political parties etc. Britain has led the fight for human rights and democracy at great sacrifice to herself, alone when necessary, even when allies were surrendering to the most tyrannical regimes. We know very well how important human rights are, but the Charter we set up post-war was to stop mass murder, not to allow people who commit such acts out on the streets.

&gt; Since I see the UK as not even really being in the EU because of all the clauses, and opt-outs, I can only say that the Brits would probably appreciate what the EU does for the common citizen substantially more if you actually just once tried to be a core member like Germany/Spain/Slovenia that enjoys freedom of movement, common currency etc. 

We have freedom of movement. Right now it means huge uncontrolled low skilled immigration to the UK, which disrupts local communities, suppresses wages for the native low skilled, causes education shortages and puts an expensive housing market even further out of reach for the middle class. I think immigration is a good thing, but it needs to have limits in its scale and it should be channeled towards the high skilled.

As for the common currency? You have to be kidding me. We'd be Ireland right not if we'd have joined. A massive devaluation in sterling and huge monetary easing by the Bank of England is the only thing that prevented our economy getting totally screwed. As I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread, how bad a crisis do europhiles need to accept their project was a bad idea? 25%+ unemployment is unheard of in advanced democracies. Greece is going to be the first country ever to move from developed to developing status. For me it's a classic case of one of those policies that seem nice to educated liberals that are far removed from the huge negative effects it's having on the lower classes, who are always the ones that get it in the neck. Ask yourself what evidence you would need to believe the Eurozone was a bad idea. If the answer is 'nothing' then you should accept your view is one of an ideologue.

&gt; Again, sorry we can't come to terms on this!

No worries. But what I would say is that our views are broadly reflective of our wider societies. The fact that two amicable and intelligent people can't come to terms on stuff when speaking directly like this shows what madness 
it is to try to do the same thing for two entire peoples.

The fact that we're using the same term in the same language to describe two totally different things is the biggest issue in this discussion, this is made more complex due to the fact that both usages *also* include the same thing as well.

The US generally doesn't recognize what are called positive rights.  Not only that, but the term ""right"" in both legal and layman usage doesn't recognize positive rights at all either.  To say that ""free healthcare is a right"" to an American results in dismissal because to Americans you cannot have a right to another person's labor, and that is what that statement means.  Note: all of our rights in the US guarantee inaction by the government, not action by another person.

Of course meanwhile you get people saying completely stupid things comparing positive rights from European governments to the negative rights of the US.  For instance, comparing the right to bear arms to the right to healthcare is impossible and to judge either group positively or negatively because these rights do or don't exist is such a hasty generalization that it's borderline insulting to both parties.

[Wikipedia page on Negative and Positive Rights.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights)

As for my opinion of the original statement, under the US use of the term ""right"", healthcare doesn't begin to approach a right.  This is completely separate from a discussion of whether it should be provided, but it's clearly not a right."

The Irish aren't the MOST oppressed group, but it was pretty bad, and some of it lingers on.

The Irish were conquered and subjugated repeatedly throughout history.  Mass murder was frequent.

Irish slavery ran rampant through the 1600s.  By about 1665 there were more than 2x more Irish slaves traded than African, and Ireland's population was depleted by 69% (!) from mass murder and the slave trade.  In the 1640s alone there were roughly 300,000 Irish slaves traded.

Irish have frequently been described by British politicians as subhuman.

In the US, Irish discrimination and racism was extremely common through the 1800s and into the 20th century.  Irish were considered dirty, ill-mannered, subhuman.  Parents would ban their daughters from marrying an Irishman.  The term ""Irish need not apply"" was coined.  Laws targeting Irish were enacted.  Political cartoonists commonly depicted Irish as buffoons or animals.  Irish were *systemically* discriminated against in many areas around the country.


The ""Ginger"" term is meant humourously but is usually meant in a derogatory way, especially in Europe where it implies an inferior person.  It comes directly from old time Irish racism.


So yeah, it's not like there's not nothing there.  There's no firehoses but you can't tell me the Irish don't meet all the checkboxes for systemic oppression and racism.  


But the Irish have flippin' great senses of humor about it.

Or you can download [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/) on your notebook and carry it outside. Make sure to toggle Night Vision modus! This is a great tool to learn about the sky. Or you can download Google Sky View on your smartphone, which is also a nice tool, but for the first times, I prefer a notebook.

Starhopping like it is shown on your webside is imo the best technique to identify constellations. From the Big Dipper, you can easily find many other constellations, f.e. Bootes, Dragon, Ursa Minor, Canes Venatici. It's really like exploring an unknown territory! You know one familiar place like the Big Dipper, and from there, you begin exploring the surrounding areas.

Another good place to start is the constellation Lyra. It's main star is called Vega and is one of the brightest stars on our night sky. You will see it already early in the dusk because of it's brightness and find it near zenith at midnight (assuming you live in North America or Europe). From there, you will be able to locate the constellation Cygnus and Aquila, they both have a bright main star (Deneb in Cygnus, Altair in Aquila). And from there, .... you get what I mean. And stellarium will be a very helpful assistant on your exploring tour!

Over the time, you will become familiar with the night sky and can impress your friends by pointing out the various constellations in the sky, their main stars and many other interesting things. If you have further questions, just ask!

And, yes, these are self reported. Most people I know will have a family tree going back to original immigrants. It's very hard to trace down and almost everyone is a mix. Of course, it's this way in Europe also, but less of a deal is made about it there. You could be of 80% German descent but if you're born in France... you're French. 

But, regardless, a *lot* of Germans came over. I think a part of it was, due to the reasons for immigrating (political) most were well educated and were from higher levels of society than the Potato Famine driven farm workers that the Irish sent over at the same time. This made it easier for them to Anglicize and assimilate so their names don't really stand out. 

That's why it surprises most people to see how many Germans there are here. It shouldn't surprise anyone either. Germany was in a huge amount of political/religious upheaval from the mid-1800s on. After unification it was almost a constant stream of wars to boot.

Strategically remove parking on avenues of high throughput. I hate to draw even more fire by looking to Europe for example, but at this point, there are few American cities with European streets and similar transit facilities for Boston to look for solutions. London is the closest relative to Boston streets, but Paris is a closer relative to job and resident distribution.

Because of the height restrictions imposed by law on Paris and the artificial ones imposed by fear of repeating the 1950/60s urban renewal movement and 'Hizzoner', we have had similar development of business parks on the periphery of urban development, but even Paris' suburban density is closer to the average density of Allston. That said, reverse commuting is the only real reason I can see why people *need* a car in Boston.

Adults with children call me unsympathetic citing they *need* a car to drive their kids around to things. This would be even less of an issue if transit were safe, frequent, and robust enough for families to take it to their everyday things and we can get close to that with dedicated bus lanes, even if only during rush hours so cars have a place to waste space at night. Zipcar and services like it are even more likely to continue driving down car ownership as people get over the hipster appeal and start realising its practicality.

Businesses criticise dedicated bus lanes, EVEN IN NEW YORK where the majority of those businesses' clients WALK to the venue. I SLAM my head on a wall every time I see some business person on Newbury or Boylston Street speak out against taking away a street space for bike parking citing that the space lost will reduce revenue.

For millennia, none of the Northern European societies had produced anything of note in any major category of development. If you had told a civilised Hellene (Greek) or a Roman that people from Germanic tribes would one day be artistically, intellectually and technologically advanced, they would have laughed. And yet today these former barbarians are at the pinnacle of human development.

At the same time, the pyramids are very nice but a matter of many millennia ago. Today's Arabs are so primitive and underdeveloped that their religious dark-ages makes Zimbabwe seem progressive. So, don't so easily dismiss the people of sub Saharan Africa. Things may change.

And don't, furthermore, mix ""culture"" and ""genetic lineage"" withing the same argument. Decide which of the two you are referring to.

Switzerland would have no chance of forcing themselves on anywhere but there aren't many countries that could defeat them (all jokes about army knives aside) and its been that way for centuries.

Not that I'd suggest Switzerland is the best country in the world (although I'm sure its not a bad place to live if you're a Swiss citizen).

Also I take contention with the latter statement. Its arguable that without the two world wars America wouldn't be the country it is today because of how much they benefited. WW1 saw the start of transfer of power over the Atlantic as Europe bankrupted themselves blowing each other to pieces only to rebuild with American credit. And WW2 saw the massive investment in the military-industrial complex that stimulated the way out of the Great Depression. Not to mention the same rebuilding of Europe with American credit.

In fact the massive industry based around the military and the pressure they can influence is one of the reasons I'd argue America isn't the best country in the world. The power isn't what makes you great it's how it's used. And unfortunately in my opinion there are too many vested interests that means what is best for America (or at least those in power) isn't always best for the rest of the world.

&gt;So far as the sentiments expressed by it are personal, they are accepted by him with a sincere and anxious desire that he may be able to prove himself not unworthy of the confidence which has been recently extended to him by his fellow citizens and by so many of the friends of humanity and progress throughout the world.

&gt;The Government of the United States has a clear consciousness that its policy neither is nor could be reactionary, but at the same time it adheres to the course which it adopted at the beginning, of abstaining everywhere from propagandism and unlawful intervention. It strives to do equal and exact justice to all states and to all men and it relies upon the beneficial results of that effort for support at home and for respect and good will throughout the world.

&gt;Nations do not exist for themselves alone, but to promote the welfare and happiness of mankind by benevolent intercourse and example. It is in this relation that the United States regard their cause in the present conflict with slavery, maintaining insurgence as the cause of human nature, and they derive new encouragements to persevere from the testimony of the workingmen of Europe that the national attitude is favored with their enlightened approval and earnest sympathies.

With that being said: The Director's Cut is the version of the film most responsible for its current acclaim, and I'd say you can't go too far wrong starting with that.

A brief history lesson: At the eleventh hour, the studio altered Scott's edit of the film and added a voice-over narration of dubious quality.

Several years later, a film festival requested a copy of the film. The studio unwittingly shipped them a copy of Ridley Scott's work print. The response was huge and when word got out that this thing existed, other festivals and art houses began specifically requesting the work print.

The studio realized they had something special on their hands and decided to release a ""Director's Cut"" of the film on home video. This would have been the work print, but Ridley Scott got wind of it and basically said, ""You're not putting out my rough draft."" So the studio agreed to bring Scott in to do a proper directors cut instead. But Scott was busy filming in Europe. So what happened instead was that he gave copious notes, the unicorn footage he wanted restored was instead yanked from *Legend* (because, IIRC, the footage he shot was lost), and the result was released as the Director's Cut. (And that's the version of the film that most people are now familiar with.)

Fast forward another decade and the decision is made to do a *proper* director's cut with Ridley Scott actually present for the edits. This would coincide with the film being restored. This is the version referred to as ""The Final Cut"".

In addition, there's also an international cut of the film that differed slightly from the American cut in several ways.

Ridley Scott's decisions in revisiting the material are also controversial because either he and Harrison Ford had very different interpretations of Ford's character OR Scott changed his interpretation of the character after the film was originally released. Some of the changes Scott made -- particularly in the Final Cut -- are, therefore, arguably pushing an interpretation of the film that's significantly different from what Ridley Scott circa-1982 believed."

It really comes down to how well he fits in this possession-style scheme, which is where I'm incapable of making a judgment.  If it came down to it, I could see Sturridge getting the nod early on just due to familiarity, with Costa becoming a more regular starter when he gets comfortable (though I could also see Costa playing alongside Sturridge, and possibly rounding out the top 3 with Suarez back since he's another of those players than can play all the roles up front).

And I do think that whether or not chareidi judaism is ideal, it was in fact necessary for the survival of torah judaism.  However the chareidi leadership made many critical errors in decades past which are a direct result of their world view.  Particularly what happaned in europe in WW2

In america the majority of jews who immigrated rejected reform judaism, they wanted a more traditional judaism.  This is why conservative judaism became by far the most popular denomination.  And in conservative judaisms beginnings they wanted to be a part of orthodoxy somehow, but orthodoxy rejected this, orthodoxy in america was not essentially chareidi at that point, but I think they were isolationists to a degree.  This was a major error, I think it would have been much better to have a watered down secular permissive orthodoxy, seperate from chareidi and even mainstream MO. Conservative judaism, although in principle adhere's to halachah, pratically speaking the constintuency has mostly abandoned any form of torah judaism.  Now in Israel we have a similar situation, most jews are 'traditional' but are not comfortable with the strigencies of the orthodox community, and at this point are resentful or religion.  I can't blame the jews who reject an overly strict lifestyle, to embrace a restrictive lifestyle flys in face of good torah middos in a lot of ways.  The chareidim can have their place, but the mainstream religion should be MO, with branches to accommodate the very secular.  The only way this can happen is with strong MO leadership, which is 1) not deferential to the chareidi gedolim 2) not essentially 'chareidim lite' as I was talking about before, that they are committed, but less strict because they are influenced by the secular world.  They should recognize moderation as a virtue, have emunah based in reason that is strong enough that they are not swayed by secularism.  They should be the ones setting the agenda for Israel and seen as the pinnacle of torah judaism, not the leaders who are amongst the most extreme as is the case today.  I do not see that type of leadership though in general in MO I see 'chareidim lite'

consider these answers from the [Condom FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/13v7cu/a_condom_faq/)?

**Q. What are redditors favourite condoms?**

Quite a few threads about favourite condom:
[1](http://tinyurl.com/bvtrz5e), [2](http://tinyurl.com/bo3sl88), [3](http://tinyurl.com/ct3l9m7)

make the condom **fit** and that's most of the battle won. Think about shoes - your favourite shoes to wear aren't the ones made from a fancy material etc but the ones that **fit** you the best. Fit, comfort and pleasure go hand in hand. It's extraordinarily similar when it comes to wearing a condom &amp; a penis. This [image](http://tinyurl.com/d3g8qaj) explains the importance of fit. So, there isn't ""a condom"" that *all people* will enjoy, because each person has a different sized erection (length and girth). Things like dots, ribs and spirals? Flavours? Thin? Mostly marketing nonsense (effective, though!).

**Q. Which condoms do the LADIES prefer?**

A neat experiment is to not tell your lady which particular type of condom you are using, and see then if *she* can tell the difference. It's hardly science, but can be fun! On the other hand, if the **guy** is enjoying his condom, he's likely to put in a good performance. Then that in turn will likely satisfy your partner too.

**Q. Which brand of condom is the SAFEST and least likely to break? Do condoms break? Why?**

All condoms sold in the EU/US (and other developed countries) have to undergo **normalised** testing during manufacture (as dictated by the ISO and other regulations, which also dictate what sizes/thickness they can be).

So if you're buying condoms that are legally available (inc. free) in your country, you can rest assured they have been tested to a high standard and will be safe to use. Over large enough sample sets, all brands/variants of latex condom are of statistically **equal** reliability, although it's easy to see why if you've had a particular type break (can be quite traumatic) you might differently.

One myth is that 'ultra thin' break more often than regular condoms do. In clinical studies this isn't the case, and when you understand that the difference in thickness between ultra thin condoms and standard ones is approximately 1/5th of a human hair (20 microns), you start to understand why. One study found that extra thick condoms fail just as often as regular condoms too.

We (as an industry) don't fully understand what causes breakage. Secondly we consistently witness ""breakers"" - that being people who experience much higher than average breakage rates (average being about 1.5%). The best theory is it's something to do with their technique.

It was ultimately defeated due to the alliance of Marco's fascist forces, Russia, as well as most of Europe at the time. It's difficult to defend something when your existence is a threat to the rest of capitalist society."
