I know your feeling.  I was there too.  This issue was what caused me to leave Islam.  I know how you just know that there must be some explanation.  But here's how I see it.  Mohammed was a man of his time.  And during those times, slavery was just the reality.  And when a man owns a female slave, of course he had a right to have sex with her whether it was in Rome, Persia, China, and even in the State Mohammed ruled.  The PROBLEM is we can do better.  YOU KNOW we can do better, and we have done better.  WITHOUT the Islamic Sharia and the Quran and the Ahadith.  Now Muslims will talk about how the slaves should be treated well, and how there are ways to work for their freedom(If the master approves), or how if a Man has sex with a female and she has a child from him that she becomes Umm Walad and can't be sold.  But yes indeed this was a normal part throughout Islamic History.  As you mentioned, Mohammed had slaves, Umar ibn al Khattab had slaves, so did Uthman.  Harun Al-Rashid The Abbasid Caliph was the son of another Abbasid Caliph and his Yemeni Slave Girl.  Where do you think the concept of Ottoman Harems came from?  Ottoman Sultans and people who could afford it at the time, had HUGE buildings where they would buy and house dozens or even hundreds of women for his sexual pleasure.  And there are of course no limits to the number of female slaves.  In the Ottoman Empire, they even build their armies through slavery.  They had a system called the Janissaries where they would take young east european christian boys from their families around when they were 10 years old and convert them to Islam and raise them to be soldiers.  And that was the official Army in the Ottoman Empire for hundreds of Years.  And what ISIS is doing today to the Yazidis(with respect to slavery) was common practice not just in the islamic world, but the WHOLE world just 300 years ago.

Now you may be saying ""Alright I see that Slavery has been a normal part of Islamic History but how do I know this is actually allowed by Allah?  How do I know this isn't just Cultural traditions that have infected the perfect and Just Laws of Allah?""  Well here is the proof.

Please read these following Ahadith.  From the Quran, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim only.(I am ofcourse assuming that you come from a sunni background.  Sorry if you are not, I don't know Shia Islam too well, but atleast the Quranic verses still apply).  JUST READ the following and analyze it objectively.  Just Try.  Keep in mind that ""what your right hand possesses"" is just a euphemism for slave.  And *Coitus interruptus* means pulling your penis out from a woman's vagina before ejaculating.

1) Quran (Surah 4:3)
&gt;If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or that **which your right hands possess**. That will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.

2) Quran (4:24)
&gt;Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those (slaves) whom your right hands possess.

3) Sahih Muslim ([8:3432](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3432))
&gt;Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that at the Battle of Hunain Allah's Messenger sent an army to Autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and **taken them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women because of their husbands being polytheists**. Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that:**"" And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess (Quran 4:. 24)""** (i. e. they were lawful for them when their 'Idda period came to an end).

4) Quran (Surah 23:1-6)
&gt;**Successful indeed are the believers**. (1) Those who offer their Salât (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. (2) And those who turn away from Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allâh has forbidden). (3) And those who pay the Zakât. (4) And **those who guard their chastity** (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). (5) **Except from their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame** (6)

5) Quran (Surah 33:50)
&gt;O Prophet (Muhammad SAW)! Verily, **We have made lawful to** you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), and **those (slaves) whom your right hand possesses - whom Allâh has given to you**, and the daughters of your 'Ammat (paternal uncles) and the daughters of your 'Amm (paternal aunts) and the daughters of your Khâlat (maternal uncles) and the daughters of your Khâl (maternal aunts) who migrated (from Makkah) with you, and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, and the Prophet wishes to marry her; a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers. Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them about their wives and those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, - in order that there should be no difficulty on you. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (50)

6) Sahih Bukhari ([5:59:459](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.459))
&gt;Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: ""I entered the mosque and saw Abu Khudri and sat beside him and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu said, ""We went out with Allah's messenger for the Ghazwa (attack upon) Banu Mustaliq and **we received captives from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on us and we loved to do coitus interruptus**. So when we intended to do coitus interruptus we said ""How can we do coitus interruptus without asking Allah's messenger while he is present among us?"" We asked (him) about it and he said ""It is better for you not to do so, for if any soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist.""

7) Sahih Bukhari ([5:59:637](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.637))
&gt;Narrated Buraida: The prophet sent Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus ([one fifth] of the booty) and I hated Ali, and Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave girl from the Khumus). I said to Khalid, ""Don't you see this (i.e. Ali)?"" When we reached the prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, ""O Buraida! Do you hate Ali?"" I said, ""Yes"" He said, ""Do you hate him, for he deserves more than that from the Khumus.""

8)Sahih Bukhari [5:59:512](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.512)
&gt;Narrated Anas: The Prophet offered the Fajr Prayer near Khaibar when it was still dark and then said, ""Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned."" Then the inhabitants of Khaibar came out running on the roads. **The Prophet had their warriors killed, their offspring and woman taken as captives.** Safiya was amongst the captives, She first came in the share of Dahya Alkali but later on she belonged to the Prophet . The Prophet made her manumission as her 'Mahr'.

9)Sahih Bukhari([3:46:717](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/046-sbt.php#003.046.717))
&gt;Narrated Ibn Aun: I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my letter that the **Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning** while they were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. **Their fighting men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives**; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that Ibn 'Umar had told him the above narration and that Ibn 'Umar was in that army.

Alright now that you have read this, I imagine you are feeling mind Fucked like I did when I read this.  ""HOW? WHY? There must be some Hikmah(Wisdom) from it that my puny brain doesn't seem to understand?  I should not cause Fitna because I am not an Islamic Scholar.  Maybe what we don't understand that Slavery was very deeply entranched system and Allah abolished it gradually(like he did Alcohol)""  To that I say, the position that slavery should be abolished is better that Allah's Laws on slavery""(BLASPHEMY)  But it is.  You have a moral compass.

Look at the following verse of the Quran:
&gt; Oh you who believe!  Today I have made unlawful unto you the taking of peoples into Bondage.  How could it be that a man is a slave to another man, while all men are the slaves of Allah?  And if someone from amongst you asks to be compensated(for freeing their slave), then tell him to await a reward greater than the world and everything in it.  That is your promise of your Lord. The Merciful.  The Just.

And you know why you have never heard of this Ayah?? Because it doesn't exist in the Quran.  YOU KNOW, that an Ayah like this is missing from the Quran.  WHY?  Because the Quran is not the book of God.

I know how it feels.  I went through this already.

Just Remember.  Most People around the world are following the wrong religion.  And you might just be one of them.

&gt;__National Bolshevism__ is a political movement that combines elements of radical [nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) (especially [Russian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_nationalism)) and [Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik).  It is often [anti-capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism) in tone, and sympathetic towards certain nationalist forms of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) [*[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words)*]. Nevertheless, National Bolshevism is separate and distinct from [National communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_communism).

&gt;Today, [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) is considered to be the center of National Bolshevism, and almost all of the National Bolshevik parties and organizations in the world are connected to it. Amongst the leading practitioners and theorists of National Bolshevism are [Aleksandr Dugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin) and [Eduard Limonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Limonov), who leads the unregistered and banned [National Bolshevik Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bolshevik_Party) (NBP) in Russia.  Influenced heavily by the idea of [geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics), current [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) National Bolshevik movements propose a merger between Russia, [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and parts of Asia, in a union to be known as [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia).

&gt;The [Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)-[Belgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) *[Parti Communautaire National-Européen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Communautaire_National-Europ%C3%A9en)* shares National Bolshevism's desire for the creation of a united Europe, as well as many of the NBP's economic ideas. French political figure [Christian Bouchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bouchet) has also been influenced by the idea.

...the fuck?

&gt; Although this says a lot about the retarded idea to make women combat soldiers (if a physically mediocre, 36yo castrated man who has been on estrogen for years can easily outfight the toughest women, why does anyone take women in combat seriously?), it also speaks to the farce of women’s sports in general.

That maybe contains a misunderstanding. The idea of the EU is that of an economic and political union, but this economic and political union is in the first place mean and not goal - the main goal was from the beginning to make war between the members unthinkable and materially impossible and to promote peace (and later also democracy) also outside its borders. It can be seen as a direct reaction to the two world wars.

Some of the struggles of the EU finding proper reactions to the current developments are a result of that. The EU, was unlike most other similar constructs - not meant to be a unity of states to defend each other against an outer enemy, but to built strong inner ties and friendship between the members to prevent another (world) war between them.

Some quotes from the Schumann declaration (1950):

*""It is no longer a question of vain words but of a bold act, a constructive act. France has acted and the consequences of its action can be immense. We hope they will be. France has acted primarily for peace and to give peace a real chance.*

*[...]*

*Europe will be born from this, a Europe which is solidly united and constructed around a strong framework. It will be a Europe where the standard of living will rise by grouping together production and expanding markets, thus encouraging the lowering of prices.*

*[...]*

*World peace cannot be safeguarded if constructive efforts are not made commensurate with the dangers that threaten it. An organized and revitalized Europe can make a contribution to civilization which is indispensable for maintaining such peaceful relations.*

*[...]*

*It will be built by concrete achievements, which* **create de facto dependence, mutual interests and the desire for common action**.

*The gathering of the nations of Europe demands the elimination of the age-old antagonism of France and Germany. The first concern of any action undertaken must involve these two countries.*

*[...]*

*The pooling of coal and steel production will immediately assure the establishment of common bases for economic development as a first step for the European Federation. It will change the destiny of regions that have long been devoted to manufacturing munitions of war, of which they have been most constantly the victims.*

*This merging of our interests in coal and steel production and our joint action will make it plain that* **any war between France and Germany becomes not only unthinkable but materially impossible**. *The establishment of this powerful unity for production,* **open to all countries willing to take part, and eventually capable of providing all the member countries with the basic elements of industrial production on the same terms***, will cast the real foundation for their economic unification.""*

A lot of gentrifies are young and don't have families so most of their money goes to having a good time, eating out, events, music etc which is nice for everyone, but even then as someone who lives here it is unaffordable for me to get coffee from one of those fancy shops or to go to a restaurant. Also a lot of people who gentrify don't realize that the rent prices they are willing to pay make rent rise everywhere. 

A friend said to me that it was a real estate. but problem, but in reality it is you who are moving here who is taking those offers. I have a friend who lives in a studio apartment in Bushwick and pays 2,400 a month. This is twice the rent I pay for less rooms, a dangerous and relatively poor neighborhood. I think in reality the most annoying part of gentrification is that only when it happens then does the city decide to invest in local areas as if the people here before didn't deserve things. 

Spike lee complains about gentrification in Bk and its effects on the minority communities, but he is ignorant. The people who were forced out of Greenpoint and Willamsburg were mostly Polish and of other Eastern European descents. Another problem is that old people who live in apartments are forced out as well and this forces them into retirement homes. It is really a shame what some young people selling over priced coffee and beer does. 

Where I live is originally European, but working class. Its an industrial area. While we have had various groups ranging from Puerto Rican and Dominican to Albanian and Chinese live here, we have all mingled and gotten along. However these other people come here and to them it is just fun and games while many people who have a family or obligations are left to simply figure out what is next for them. It has made me grow a certain hate for Manhattan. I'm all for moving around, but the influx of fad areas is the problem and it is moving down the L and M train lines in Queens and Brooklyn. The next stop is always the next gentrification destination. The MTA only with the incoming influx of hipsters decided to renovate our train station and while this is good it angers me because we deserved this prior to them.

&gt; SK shared much more in the way of culture with NK

Absolutely not! They're eons apart now, centuries apart even. Even physically they're dissimilar. North Koreans are very dark, especially regular people on the streets. Their skin is leathery from being out in the sun for too long. They're shorter over average by about 3 inches. 60 years of NK culture has morphed them into something completely different. Even their food is different now. 

The South Koreans are allied with the US because the US under the UN auspices stopped the North Korean invasion and saved them from the communist North. Without the US there would be no South Korea, quite literally so. That's a pretty good reason to be allied with the US. 

&gt; The US, for example, was much closer to France than to the UK for much of it's early history, despite being only a generation away from being English themselves.

That's because the US had on and off wars with Britain and they needed a ""superpower ally"" to aid them. France served that purpose for a few decades. The last war was in 1812, and that's pretty much settled all land issues and set the scene for a future friendly relationship that's lasted to this day. The Americans are our major trade partners, our economy depends on them, and their economy depends on us. Nobody would vote for a Canadian government that would promise unfriendly relations with the States. That would be unthinkable. 

&gt; It would seem logical that states would align with distant and less threatening states against closer and more threatening states.

The English and France were allied against Spain, and Spain and France were allied against Britain. This is more circumstantial than it may seem.

Our style of play is heavily based on possession and patiently crafting the best chances possible, which starts at the back with a stifling defense.

A lot of really off the wall stuff happens in those twelve years, some of it really interesting.  Technically none of it is massively relevant to the story at hand because it's a standalone novel, but it all helps set the background, yeah?

For Western Europe, this ""tradition"" has been suspended so far only for one generation, in part due to the creation of the political institutions we call the EU. Few thoughtful people think it couldn't happen again, and many thoughtful people consider it important to avoid the recurrence of ""traditional"" wars.

In the 1990's Europe saw a re-emergence of local belligerence in the former Yugoslav republic, and saw again how destructive it could be. This conflict was settled primarily by military action, but the peace will be held by other means, as it has held in more northerly European countries after WWII.

The strength of the EU, and the reason for its current success (which isn't guaranteed for the future), isn't found in it's military capabilities, but in its philosophy and politics. In this, the long term view is always given priority over immediate concerns.  It's political philosophy is to undermine reactionaries and extremists by providing economic and political support to their opponents.

In the current context, the approach of the EU would be to prepare for a loss of Russian gas (which would take a year or two at least), so as to eventually not be held an energy hostage by Russia, while at the same time providing grass roots support for more democratic and economically efficient practices in Ukraine.

None of the EU's approach is headline-grabbing, but it has proven extraordinarily successful in drawing most of Eastern Europe into the ""Western"" sphere of influence, with very little bloodshed (compared to WWII or Yugoslavia).

From a European point of view and keeping it as simple as I can:

The Jet-Stream is a line of strong winds created by the contrast of temperature, that's why in the summer it's far in the north and in winter it can go as low as Spain.

[Image of Jet Stream in winter](http://modeles.meteociel.fr/modeles/reana/2013/archivesnh-2013-12-31-0-5.png)

Now lets see the same but with lows, highs and the 500hpa temperature

[Image at 500hpa](http://modeles.meteociel.fr/modeles/reana/2013/archivesnh-2013-12-31-0-0.png)

As you can see, the low temperatures are north of the jet stream. Well, the cold temperatures at 500hpa reflect inestability in the atmosphere, because of the temperature difference between the sea temperature and the temperature at 500hpa. Because of that, many lows are created in that area, mainly in Terranova, thus creating a big cloud cover all over the north.

The Jet if strong creates a quite straight ""belt"" around the north hemisphere, but if it's weak it starts to be wavy, changing that pattern, something like this.

[Big European Freeze in 2012](http://modeles.meteociel.fr/modeles/reana/2012/archivesnh-2012-2-5-0-0.png)

Funny enough, it shows one special thing that happens in my zone. As you can see in OP's map there is a zone in northen Spain that gets lower sunshine hours than the rest. The image above gives an example of one of the reasons for that.

West from Spain we can see a high of 1040hpa, with orange colour, giving stabilty to the atlantic. At the same time there is a little low at the east, with blue colours. As the high moves clockwise and the low anticlockwise, they create a ""tunnel"" bringing to my zone winds from the north, that are enough to create clouds and give as a little bit of rain. Something similar to what happens in the lake-effect

Your argument that because someone's circumstance pushes them to commit wrong, makes that action any less wrong pushes the ethical repercussions onto the one who makes the decision, not the one who suffers.  The first problem with this is that, you're excusing murder of a child (even out of grave necessity) because that child will otherwise suffer horribly in the future.  By that logic, we should all be put to death because life is hard and heavy and always ends up in death anyway.  You also assume that circumstances won't change, even in the modern world.

The biggest problem with your argument is that it hinges on the moral neutrality of the intentions of the mother--that she just doesn't want her child to suffer, so she ends the child's life before suffering has commenced.  But, if she wanted the suffering to stop, especially since she's seen first-hand how horrible it is, she could've taken a much less ethically debatable action like, oh I don't know, having her tubes tied, not having sex, using a condom, etc, etc.

I believe (read: know) that as a human being, I'm responsible for attempting to alleviate the suffering of others, because as a biological creature, I am connected in the animal kingdom to other animals.  I know this because nature tells me.  Yes, I don't have proof, but I know in my bones.  I will not let what I believe is natural law to be upended by anyone who uses their head not as a servant but as a master.  I believe David Hume was correct in saying that reason is a slave to the passions; that is, we understand *what* without necessarily understanding *why*, at least when it comes to dealing with people.

I also agree with John Donne, in his Meditations XVII:  

&gt; No man is an island,  entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were;  any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.",t3_2f3i8o,videos,t1_ck5wypn,-1,1427261660

lolwut.  You really can't tell the difference between NYC and San Fran?  Let alone someplace like Tokyo?

&gt;So your idea is, what exactly? Let's not let the Asians into the LCS because we give a shit about what a bunch of xenophobes think?

""Let's not smother a growing scene and stop people from even trying in that region by letting a more developed region come in and grab all the prize money"".  If the region becomes dominated by foreigners, then it's just a glorified LPL.  People who love NA aren't going to watch it because it's not really NA and people who just want high level League aren't going to watch it because there are more competitive regions.  If all we care about is who is the best at League, why don't we just dispense with the different LCS regions and just watch OGN?

&gt;I've traveled so much that I don't identify with any one culture. I think with the internet and everything this stuff isn't going to fly for much longer. Just 1 generation ago communicating across the oceans wasn't nearly as convenient as it is now. Even a decade ago it wasn't as easy.

Yes, globalization is huge.  People are far closer than they ever were before, now someone from the US, EU, and China can exchange stories and look into each other's cultures and can relate to each other, being brought together by communication.  But it's going to be a move to a more unified, world culture, not the collapse of the idea of culture altogether.  Right now, the cultures are still divided, and people from the NA culture want to be able to root for the NA culture in League.

&gt;Fuck 'em, they're a tiny market compared to China anyway. If I was a gaming company I would be a lot more worried about seizing the absolutely HUGE emerging market in China that will steadily migrate off of games like a meh CS copy like Crossfire that has like a billion in profits every year to something that takes a better computer and internet connection and I'm going to fucking pounce on that shit.

Or perhaps we can let all regions develop, because no region is gonna be bigger than all the regions.

Regardless, i never mentioned what Riot should do.  Nor do i think, if Riot did somehow bar foreign competition, it would affect the Chinese scene.

&gt;I don't want to see Little League in the States just because some people have a hard time relating to someone that doesn't look like a distant relative.

Again with the racism?  Really?  There has to be a cap on how many times you can throw that accusation in one argument.  If you wanna accuse me of racism again, go ahead and try to talk about what i said on that subject earlier, not stupid sly comments that completely miss the point.

People have a hard time relating to things that are not similar to them.  And looks can be an element (considering the current LCS rosters though, i doubt it), but more important is how they act and what they do.  And that is *heavily* influenced by culture.

And go figure, *most* people want to see people similar to themselves doing well.

&gt;A bunch of hopeful Chinese dudes come to the US, form a challenger team, kick serious ass, and then qualify for worlds in the FIFTH GAME. Woo, American Dream, baby!

The narrative that people are getting is ""bunch of Chinese players think the Chinese scene is too tough, come to the US to try an easier route"".  And that's not a narrative that people are going to root for.

&gt;You know, saying ""you have better infrastructure, so we're not letting you compete with us here because you'll make us look like bottom-feeding amateurs"" is a really shitty bandage to stick on a shit as fuck scene. Maybe if 3 more LMQs kick out the ""popular but we kind of suck"" teams there will be more C9s in the NA scene.

No, there won't be.  Look at how CLG and TSM decided to compete with LMQ this year.  Did they pick up new players that they thought would do well with developement?  Did they step up their recruiting game?

No, they grabbed some Koreans.  And *that* more than anything else, is what i'm worried about.  That great NA players are never going to be given the chance to develop.  Why would the eighth best top in NA try as hard as possible to develop his skills when any team recruiting is going to pass him over for someone that requires less work?  What organization is going to fund a challenger team with everything they need if they are just going to get knocked out by a foreign team in the first round?  Wanna know how NA teams stepped up their game?  Because 8/15 of the best players aren't from the region.  And that's out of 12/40 foreign players.  With a success rate like that, why would any team want to try developing local talent?  And since everybody knows they don't have a chance, less people try, and those that do try have a lot more trouble getting the help they need to become as good as they can.  And eventually we're left with 9 foreign teams and C9.

So if you think that people don't care about where the teams come from, it will be fine.  Then again, if people just wanted to watch the highest level of League, why not watch the OGN?  Why does the NA LCS draw a larger crowd than the EU LCS, despite featuring weaker teams?",t3_2f4fel,leagueoflegends,t1_ck5xd86,1,1427261469

I think it would have. Why? Because occupying countries is very hard work, and the Soviet Union would have required a lot of effort. It also would have been bad for morale because the French were not considered ""untermench"" by any means, and as such they couldn't be dealt with nearly as harshly as the slavs. And fundamentally I think it would have been Hitlers worldview, where the European Empires striding globally was all good (he was particularly fond of the Brits doing this), even if he (correctly) believed that future power lied with continental Empires like the United States, and hence wanted to make a super one going from the Rhein to the Pacific while leaving controlling Africans and stuff to the French and the Brits.

&gt; I just think Russia was unconquerable.

Why on earth would it have been that? It was burning through its manpower at a completely unsupportable pace. It had a 2:1 population advantage against Germany before the war, and then it lost land where 25-30% of those people lived, dropping the advantage to 1.5:1 or 1.4:1. And it took 4 Soviet losses to get rid of a German soldier.

Without being able to ignore remarkable chunks of their economy (due to lend lease and other support), this was COMPLETELY unsustainable. And of course, Germany was constantly engaged at least slightly in the West via occupations etc which sapped a LOT of German strength, particularly in the air.

Quite telling are airplane losses in the critical months of June/July 1943: Mediterranean (1032), Eastern Front (1030) &amp; Western Front (1151).

This is VERY, VERY big (actually, I expected around 1 to 1 split on the losses myself, I'm quite shocked that it was 2.11 to 1)

&gt; I just don't see that happening. So they'd probably take Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad, but the issues that plagued the German army still would

Yes, but the USSR would have very little strength to punch back with. Germans would be able to start consolidating quite happily, as the resource game would be so thoroughly won at that point (with the huge population centers under German control, Soviet total manpower would almost certainly be lower than German manpower alone).

&gt; a substantially lower production base than Russia

Where the hell do you get that one? Russia could produce certain things in vast quantities because it could ignore a lot of basic stuff it was getting via lend lease.

&gt; Given enough time the Russian bear would keep on growing while Germany depletes itself of its power

What power? With the cities you mentioned lost, the Soviet bear has maybe 60-70 million people to call upon, a HUGE need to focus on logistics (since no US gravy train), completely lost control of the skies etc. There's just nothing they could really do. Soviet resources were driven to the ground in WW2 - it was an absolutely amazing feat of will, but one that would have fallen far short of what was needed without Western assistance.

&gt; And this last point is definitely speculation, but it's possible that if Britain wasn't in the war Stalin would not have kept thousands of planes straight up on the front lines.

This is certainly possible, though considering the general ineptitude during the first few months it's quite likely those would have gone down anyway. Perhaps they would have taken down the equivalent of the planes now lost in the West, but probably not much more.

I actually think they might have stopped the Germans in front of Moscow even without the UK being in the war. It's not like having 25% more troops would have really helped Germany - the problem was more logistics than anything, and more troops might have even made that worse. They probably would have even managed the winter offensive (the Germans really were not well prepared for that winter). However, the spring of 1942 would have been devastating to the Soviets without UK (and US) around.",t3_2f3rge,worldnews,t1_ck5xmf6,1,1427261351

For example, when they talk about the ""failure of multiculturalism"" they're really talking about how much they hate people of other cultures. And when they say things like ""European culture is being threatened"", they're really talking less about the culture than about the races themselves.

For example, in a thread in which a commenter claimed that the British government has a responsibility to put the people who have lived there for hundreds of years first, I pointed out that there are people of other races who have been in Britain for generations. I was told that it was a ""complicated"" part of the issue and that if it were *my* country I would understand (blatantly ignoring that many minorities have no connection to their ancestors' countries). When I asked whether he feels the same way about America given that whites were not even the first ones in America, the poster revised his statement to say that he meant the race of the government, not the original race. This, to me, sounds like mental gymnastics.

In another thread about the Icelandic name registry, I was told that anyone who wanted to live in Iceland had to assimilate completely to the culture of Iceland and that multiculturalism has failed. Apparently, immigration from other countries to what Redditors consider pristine white countries is ""reverse colonialism"" and is destroying white culture.

I really hope that the systematic racism of /r/worldnews is an exception and not the rule, but I worry that the fact that European countries have not until now had to deal with immigration from other racial groups means that the culture of tolerance that we mostly strive toward in the United States is not seen the same way in Europe, and racism is instead seen as acceptable.

Russia is trying to wrest Ukraine *back* from the Americans and the Europeans after what essentially was a coup in Kiev. It's not an expansion.

""But destabilize internally? How? NATO has clearly little to no influence over Russian public.""

An external military threat *always* cause some internal instability, whether among the populace, or the government of the state in question. Just think about the shit storm that would erupt in the US if  Chinese bases were placed in Hawaii, Alaska, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.

"" I don't think that Latvia joining it was the tipping point and now Russia is suddenly outlawed by it""

Yes it wasn't because 1: it is not as strategically significant to Russia, and 2: Putin and his team were nowhere near as powerful in their position in 2004 as they are today.

""As.long as there isn't dangerous number of NATO forces on Russias borders""

That doesn't matter because the very fact that you got forces in whatever country already (regardless how many) makes that country's territory almost inviolable for fear of an escalation of war.

So, for example, if there are 500 NATO soldiers in Ukraine, they are *not* meant to attack Russia but rather to ensure Russia doesn't attack Ukraine. That's because Russian soldiers would likely have to engage those 500, after which time NATO would reinforce them with thousands -- and *that* would be the real threat to Russia.",t3_2f3qni,russia,t1_ck5xx42,7,1427261213

Most people will probably be familiar with Wienerschnitzel, Sachertorte, Apfelstrudel, rum balls, and goulash (the Hungarian variety is more famous, but there is a distinctly Viennese variety as well).  People also probably know Manner ""Neapolitan wafers"" and Mozartkugeln as well.  There are a few other things I'd recommend:

 * [Vanillekipferl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanillekipferl): small crescent shaped cookies covered in powdered sugar.  The finest accompaniment to the famed Viennese [*kaffeeklatsch*](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kaffeeklatsch).

 * Speaking of coffee, Vienna has a distinct [coffee culture](http://www.vienna-concerts.com/en/viennese_coffee).  Of these, my personal favorite, and in my mind the most distinctly Viennese [though again, I wouldn't be surprised if this is also popular in Budapest, Prague, and Bratislava], is the *Brauner*.  A *Schwarzer*, literally ""a black one"", is the Austrian way to order an espresso.  A Brauner, literally ""a brown one"", is roughly equal parts espresso and cream.  You can order a kleiner (one shot) or großer (two shots).

 * [Palatschinken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatschinke) are like crepes, but slightly thicker and more hearty.   Like crepes, they can be sweet or savory, though apricot is perhaps the best.  Unlike crepes,   Like many Viennese dishes, they are common through Central and Southeastern Europe.

 * [Knödeln](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del) are delicious, hearty dumplings and can be found in a stunning variety.  But even better than Knödel is [Spätzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle), a very small dumpling that is an irresistible side dish.  Presumably these were once made by hand, but I have never tried to do this.

 * [Liptauer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liptauer) is a spreadable, spiced cheese and something that makes all forms of bread better.  I am leaving out all the specifically Viennese breads, but know that there are many types.

 * [Sturm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federweisser) is wine that is not yet fully fermented, and a deliciously refreshing alcoholic summer beverage.

 * Finally, while apple strudel dominates the American strudel landscape to the point where the modifier ""apple"" is almost unnecessary, in Vienna, Apfelstrudel competes with Topfenstrudel, filled with delicious soft cheese, for the most beloved type of strudel (apple always wins, but it's competitive).

It's beautiful but a little lacking in culture that some of the bigger cities like Montreal and Toronto have.  Still some great festivals and concerts in some cool venues around town.

Expensive city to live in though and the two main universities are a little ways from the city proper.

You might like Victoria - smaller city, bit of a college town with UVIC campus near the downtown - close enough to the larger Vancouver that you can visit and check it out if you want. 

Toronto is kind of like Canada's New York.  Largest city in the country and one of the largest in the continent so if urban density isn't your thing then maybe consider somewhere else.  There are some college towns nearby which might appeal - hamilton, london, waterloo, and guelph are all an hour or two outside of toronto have some good schools to check out.  

Montreal would be one of the most interesting places to live simply due to the language and the european feel.  IMO, it's my favourite city in Canada, but the winters are super-harsh.  Great music/art scene and lots of cool places and neighbourhoods to check out.

Make North American Native diplomacy more interesting. Make it much more difficult to actually conquer tribes, and especially so to convert their cultures.

Make European colonization something the player actually has to think to overcome, rather than just sit back with 3000 monarch points and let Portugal colonize 1 province in Canada.

Get rid of Lucky Nations being required for Ironman. Make France and Russia actually suffer serious internal strife. Make the French Revolution not a railroaded event, but something that could really apply to any nation in Europe/westernized nation, with some (restrictive) conditions.

Diversify rebels. There was a great illustration of how this might look somewhere on these forums, with a three-estate system and clear demands from each faction.

* People a long time ago characterized African music as inherently rhythmically more complex than other (presumably Western) music
* This ""topos"" (topic) continues to exist in present day [article was written in 1995]
* Agawu presents more evidence of people claiming a ""uniquely black rhythmic sensibility"" (382)
* Even African scholars have accepted this topic that African music is more rhythmically complex

2nd half of article:

* Others dissent against idea of ""Western fantasy about African rhythm"" (383)
* African music is not homogeneous - many different subcultures
* [Extensive footnote on how author grew up in Africa where there were no drums: ""Why set yourself up as an expert on European cookery when all you have tried is Dutch?"" (384)]
* There is resistance to learning about Africa because of how different language/culture is...outsiders tend to then group as ""African"" (i.e. square is a rectangle isn't a square situation)
* If independent researcher examined Western music vs. African music, they would find Western music is more rhythmically complex (think comparing Brahms to Reich to Stravinsky to Carter)

Author then proposes how ""African"" music came to exist in the mind of scholars...

This is purely speculative and if the Palestinians actually bother with development:

""The area has great economic potential, with possibilities for agriculture, Dead Sea minerals exploitation, stone mining and quarrying, construction, tourism and telecommunications, according to the report.""

This states basically that through business that could be potentially created if the palestinians could more freely move and control the West Bank there could possibly be a speculative loss of 3.4 Bil.

If I were you, I'd spend the following number of days (with descending ranking based on how interesting the place is)

- Stockholm - 4 days - a week because there are LOTS of things to do in Stockholm :)

- Copenhagen - 2/3 days

- Oslo - 2/3 days

- Helsinki/Talinn - 2/3 days.

However, I would also recommend you to head to places like Bergen to see the majestic fjords, Turku to visit the Santa village and also Iceland, perhaps? Since you'd be in Scandinavia anyways.

For European trains, **book** them way in advance. Otherwise, get a rail pass (Eurail/Interrail). Otherwise, I would just recommend you to fly.

That was the case when France asked NATO and American military personnel to leave; the only thing that didn't leave were the tens of thousands of Americans who were burried in French soil.

For $20k, there are pretty much *too many good options*. When it really boils down to it, almost all the models in their respective segments get give/take the same fuel economy, have similar standards for reliability and dependability, and offer similar options for similar amounts of money.

Ultimately it comes down to a lot of what you value most in your car. Do you want something that's a lot of fun to drive? Do you want something that has the best technology available at the moment? Do you want something with the most space? The best fuel economy? Best styling? Etc, etc, etc...

To answer your questions vis-a-vie the Honda Fit, the simple answer is that we really don't know. The car has been out a grand total of about a month, after a lengthy delay due to production problems. A lot of the cars in that segment have had diminished cash scores due to changes in the NHTSA testing procedures, but relatively speaking, they are still exceptionally more safe than regular sedans produced even five/six years ago.

As for CVTs, we're pretty far away from the first-generation units that became popular about a decade ago. Those units were temperamental, and had design issues, but a lot of engineering has gone into making them significantly better - and that certainly shows with the competition from Nissan, who has almost entirely replaced their automatics with CVT units. With Honda making a massive bet on CVT technology with the new Accord and the new Fit, one would think that it wouldn't be an issue. Still, Honda hasn't been without a track record on iffy transmission quality, particularly the units that had been paired with the V6s in the Odyssey, Accord, TL/CL, and others. This still ignores the general problems with CVTs - hesitation from a stand-still, loud NVH issues when accelerating, and severe differences in MPG. Does that mean that your fuel economy will be better or worse? Not necessarily. The last Altima (2014 2.5S) I drove for a week with a CVT did what was advertised, and that's about it.

I do think you are selling the Chevrolet Sonic and Ford Fiesta short, here. Both pack in a lot of value at a great price, and depending on what your performance or practicality goals are, you can get a fantastic model for the price. 

The Ford definitely scores high on the mechanical prowess scale for me. If you want to maximize the fuel economy, something like the new 1.0L EcoBoost model is worth looking at, capable of 43 MPG on the highway. Recent re-tuning of the PowerShift dual-clutch automatic apparently have made it much more responsive when it comes to driving and performance, as it was a major criticism beforehand. The car is a strong seller because of its ride/handling balance, and overall, its great quality. It out-Fitted the Fit, to be honest. Honda wasn't expecting that.

The Sonic on the other hand is still my choice in that size segment. Although it lacks a lot of the mechanical complexity that the Ford has, the Chevrolet is more straightforward in its design, and a good bit more European in its tuning execution. On point, it has the best overall ""feel"" in terms of steering input, brake pedal, gear change, ride, handling, and NVH that I've experienced in the segment - far more like a VW than a Chevrolet.

If you're looking for a bigger hatch space, I'd suggest looking at these models as well:

* Kia Forte5/Hyundai Elantra GT

* Hyundai Veloster

* Fiat 500L/Jeep Renegade (2015)

* VW Jetta Sportwagen (Golf Sportwagen for '15)

In those options, the Kia Forte5/Hyundai Elantra GT pack in a lot of standard equipment, but they start give/take right at your $20k max. But, they're a good size, and if that's what matters most, they may be worth a look. The Veloster is a little smaller, and based on an older chassis, but still is a pretty decent size, and has pretty decent performance, all things considered. That being said, the Kia/Hyundai lineup isn't without its flaws. Residual values aren't always that great, but they will frequently back it up with a guarantee that, if you trade it back in when your financing is complete, it will only depreciate so far. That means you'd have to get another, however...

The Fiat 500L and Jeep Renegade share platforms, but will be vastly different efforts by the time both are on the market. The Fiat is currently available, and has been pretty well-regarded despite the lowered expectations when it arrived on-market earlier this year. The Fiat offers a ton of interior and cargo space for not a ton of money, and Fiat frequently throws *massive* incentives on top of the cars to get them off lots. Problem is, the 500L is a bit expensive to start. Even though they do offer good equipment ""for free"" on 2014 models, as a value proposition, it gets cloudy on some levels. Plus, if you are committing to getting an automatic, the dual-clutch unit in that car is largely regarded as pretty lackluster. The Jeep version on the other hand, which will be available closer to the end of the year, will use their new 9-speed traditional automatic, and will be available with a wider variety of trim and performance levels. Automatically it becomes the better option, regardless of whether or not you're in the city or in the bush.

Lastly, the VW Jetta Sportwagen (soon to be Golf Sportwagen) is otherwise the standard worldwide when it comes to wagon size and performance. Although the car's underpinnings for 2014 date back all the way to 2007, it is still a competent performer, and comes with a wide variety of engines and transmissions to meet your needs. The MKV chassis was solid, no doubt about it, and its standard equipment is still reasonable today. But, the 2.5L I5 is disappointing, and won't help your fuel bill. The 2015 model rides on the newer MKVII chassis, and will use the new 1.8TSI engine - and will absolutely be worth the wait.",t3_2f51u4,whatcarshouldIbuy,t1_ck60obt,6,1427259886

They had experienced Holodomor where millions of Ukrainians were starved to death by Stalin. 

If they use some symbols and relics from that era and Wehrmacht stuff, it is in the Ukraine historical context just like Russians using Stalin and Red Army stuff as a combinieng thing. Any concentration camps in Ukraine yet? Anti-Judaism? Yellow stars?

And if you transport the wood any appreciable distance to the pale it's burned you must take that into consideration for the carbon cost, like how forests in the U.S. are currently being chopped down so they can chip them up, ship them over the Atlantic, (on bunker fuel propelled ships) and burn them in Europe as ""green"" fuel.

[This is a map of estimated total fertility rate (TFR), around the globe in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Countriesbyfertilityrate.svg). TFR is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime within a population/environment. See the difference between countries in Africa compared to countries in Europe?

Also, from Wikipedia:

&gt; Developed countries usually have a much lower fertility rate due to greater wealth, education, and urbanization. Mortality rates are low, **birth control is understood and easily accessible**, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, **contraception becomes affordable**. In countries like Iran where contraception was subsidized before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined. Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. The result is the demographic-economic paradox. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility. In undeveloped countries on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. **Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to contraceptives**, stricter adherence to traditional religious beliefs, **generally lower levels of female education**, and lower rates of female employment in industry. 

In conclusion, I'm not saying that birth control wouldn't help certain people, just that pouring resources into sex education and birth control would not make as drastic a difference in ""developed"" countries compared to ""undeveloped"" countries, and those resources would be better used in other capacities in ""developed"" countries.",t3_2f2y10,AskReddit,t1_ck60tua,2,1427259815

They have a way of filming just one person (or a group of people) at any one time so that the focus is on them and nobody else around them.

Not sure what country you are coming from, but most of the Europeans we saw there were all quite fit and slim in comparison to a lot of the Americans, English and Australians there.

They weren't raped, and one widow you just cited (Rayhana bint Zayd ibn Amr) wasn't a sex slave she was taken in to be a handmaid and the prophet (PBUH) offered her to become his wife (which she later refused), yeah there were drifts between them like her refusal to wear the hijab for example but various hadiths say they reconciled, if you want both a nonIslamophobic or Islamophillic (whatever that means logically speaking) I got some really bad news for you (unless you are going to twist around and say OXFORD islamic studies is by no means a credible source):

http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1990?_hi=0&amp;_pos=9

As for Maryam bint Shamoon al-Quptiya, She later converted to Islam and became his wife as many comments before us have explained, if you are going to try say that their arguments are wrong why don't you go argue with them? I'm sure that your shitty arguments and propaganda could get them to answer what ever questions you have. But like I said you are clearly not here to ask any meaningful questions but just to bash the prophet (PBUH) by saying that he was the cause of all the problems we have in the world when the U.S, U.K and European governments have not only done the same thing to pursue power but funded the very governments in the middle east which the western governments have been saying are a threat to stabilization in the middle east. 

And another thing, Taqiyya is talking about religious dissimulation. Now assuming that you haven't failed at english as well as religious studies or world history, religious dissimulation is talking about lying about your faith is to protect yourself from persecution and it is mainly a shiite point of view and many Muslims I know would rather die than deny their faith so yeah that ""act of lying"" talking point doesn't work on me or anyone else who followed your handy how to guide for google searching. 

Yeah looked at those hadiths there and google gave me these results 

""Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah's Apostle (May peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old""

-Sahih Muslim Book 008, Hadith Number 3310

""The Prophet (ﷺ) wrote the (marriage contract) with `Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).""

-Sahih al-Bukhari 5158

The other Hadiths you mentioned have different translations even though they share the same story where Aisha married Mohammad (PBUH),  assuming that Aisha was in fact just  a child and a victim and that the prophet really just wanted sex and nothing more from her then maybe you can explain to me if he had been a man driven by desires, wouldn't that have been known from his life during the days when he was young, at which time he had only one wife, Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid, who was older than him? And also why Aisha is she such an important and respected figure in Islam and to Muslims if the prophet ever thought of her like that?

I know he married 11 wives. I didn't argue that, it is that you turned the purest of intentions and turned it into improper context is what I had issue with. Look at the prophet Solomon (PABWH) in the bible for example it even says that he had about 700 wives and 300 concubines so by your logic Solomon (PBAWH) is a bigger pervert than Mohammad (PBUH). And Lot another prophet(PBAWH) who had warned Sodom and Gomorrah and their impending doom and was seen as a righteous man even by Christians was described in the bible as getting drunk and having an incestuous relationship with his own daughters, how do you explain that to me?

Where does 9/11 fit into all this? I don't know why don't you tell me? I found myself asking the very same question when the U.S invaded Iraq and the answer i got was God told him to invade Iraq (which was not responsible nor had any connection to 9/11) and as a result killed +100,000 of civilians, now given all the previous horrific things that happened in Iraq because of those people that I just mentioned to you in another response, isn't that fitting more into the criteria to gain power in the name of religion? Also the Scholars who have been condemning terrorism (here are the sources since you clearly suck at following your own instructions of google searching 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/11_10_07_letter.pdf' 'http://www.dawn.com/news/755908/fifty-muslim-scholars-issue-fatwa-against-taliban' 
'http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Hyderabad/Ulama_endorse_fatwa_against_terror/articleshow/3689923.cms') might have done more research to their own religion than you obviously. Just because you are ignorant of that doesn't mean that Islam or Muslims as a whole don't condemn terrorism which even before 9/11 America was killing people in Vietnam under lies that the Vietnamese attacked them. America even blew up an Iranian plane decades ago killing 300 people and even armed Saddam and the Ayatollah. If we are using modern examples then I don't really see any difference between what the terrorists were doing now and what America has done only in the past half century.

I just remembered that the ones that got arrested for being part of the 9/11 plot were going out drinking before the attack, if they indeed took the Quran literally and are overly religious zealots how in any way does the part that they were drinking before their ""Jihad"" make any sense? ISIS also blew up a sunni mosque in Mosul which contained Jonah's corpse, if they really symbolize Islam in all it's form why would they do that even though doing that is clearly against Islam?

It's also the violent revolutionaries who created totalitarian dictatorships instead of actual Socialist worker states. Killing the ruling class and putting Marxists in power doesn't create class consciousness. Sure, Cuba has fared better in terms of human rights and longevity than many Communist regimes (although they're far from democratic), but the Cuban Revolution was a war fought much more like the American Revolution rather than a swift seizure of power whose main accomplishment was the assassination of the ruling family like in Russia.

I'm actually a big believer in evolutionary progress, i.e. that evolution is more effective than revolution. Historically, Revolutions in the violent sense have generally not proven long-lasting: the English Civil War, the French Revolution, and the October Revolution all ended in dictatorship. That's not to say that violent Revolution is always useless, but for the most part, evolutionary progress such as the various agricultural revolutions and the industrial revolution had far greater impacts on society. It was not the French Revolution, but the *ideas* of the French Revolution that helped bring democracy to Europe.

The fact is that no major Socialist Revolution has involved the true creation of proletarian consciousness and a class movement (note the word *major*--small movements such as Revolutionary Catalonia involved heavy influence of trade unions and much more popular involvement), and I'm of the opinion that no major Socialist Revolution will succeed until a Leftist Front builds class consciousness among the working class. That's not to say this will be slow, as such a class consciousness really needs to be attained within one generation, as once a class-conscious working class generation leaves the workforce, all the effort of consciousness-builders is lost. The key, however, is that it is not simply the uprooting of one government and replacing it with another, better one, but the *evolution* of society into a new frame of mind that supports a new relationship of production. In such a scenario, while violence would probably ensue on a local scale in certain areas, violent action would not be required on the whole. If workers change the system themselves en masse, capitalists have no choice but to accept their new roles as mere employees of workers' collectives. That's the goal, after all. Killing people and burning things doesn't create Socialism, even if it could get rid of capitalism in the first place.

Clearly all that SJW bullshit is wearing us all down. Considering that you seem like an okay kind of guy, as I seem to have upvoted you some in the past, I'll still give you a (mostly) serious answer:

&gt;How does that disprove what I said?

You seem to be under the impression that ""positive discrimination"" is an integral part of social justice. I linked the wikipedia article to give you a wider view what social justice is. 

For example, instead of affirmative action, the problem of minorities and disadvantaged people having harder time paying for their college education could be solved by removing individual tuition, and funding everyone's college education with tax funds. This would help a large chunk of the middle class too, and is an investment that would likely pay itself back anyway, since more highly educated people means more employable people for high tech industries and more innovation in the long run.

&gt;The goal of social justice is forceful redistribution of something.

If you consider democratically made decision ""forceful"", then yes. And if you're dead set against that on principle, we can't really have a fruitful discussion. 

If you live in a society, unless you can somehow create a hivemind and wipe out people's individuality, you pretty much live either in a tyranny of the majority, or a tyranny of the few. You will always have something imposed on you forcefully, unless you're on the top of the few in the latter option. Which is probably not something anyone should count on when making decisions on how a society should work.

The thing that's imposed forcefully on you, is called social contract. It demands that if you want to live in a society, you have to live by certain rules. Sometimes those rules require you to pay taxes. Yes, it's unfair, and no, complete fairness can never be achieved, like you yourself said.

&gt;But it's pretty unrealistic to assume we can ever reach a point where everyone has the same opportunities and experiences

Of course we can't. Especially in the experience department, as nobody is demanding, or even talking about that. The whole ideology would be pointless if the idea was to destroy people's individuality, as you seem to be suggesting. 

And, we can probably never give everyone the exact same opportunities. But everyone sane knows that already. The point is a net increase in opportunities for the whole population. No society is **ever** in a point where you can say ""Okay, we're ready now. No need to change anything!"" Constant change has been the theme of the whole written history of humanity, and societies will keep changing.

&gt; and pretty naive to believe that's actually the best situation

We're never going to be in a situation that is best possible for everyone in a society. That's why it makes sense to try to improve the lives of as many people as possible. It's also morally the best choice, if you think about it, since it maximizes the well-being of the people in a society as a whole. Western European and Nordic democracies are a good example of that, as especially Nordic countries tend to lead the scores in overall happiness indexes for their populations.

&gt;It would be pretty easy to formulate a forcefully fair system that is actually not fair at all, it just constantly makes corrections.

No system is completely fair, as we earlier established. And constant corrections are needed in a system the size of a society. That doesn't negate the idea that maximizing overall happiness through increasing overall opportunities for individuals is a good thing.

&gt;Social Justice is a hateful plague that must die, and it's a refuge for bigots who patronize others but want to feel progressive when they're really regressive.

Couldn't make it in China? Go to NA. Their very presence is insult to our region. Yes we know Asian regions is better, but to come over here and take a spot from a mostly NA team is disgraceful. 

Its like those Asian transfer students (from oversees mostly from Korea and China) at my high school who manipulated the system. They changed their grades to all A's and cheated all year long by recording answers in their translators. Normally no one would care but by abusing the system knocked out my friend as salutatorian. Its an awful abuse of power and the worst part is that its not just one or two people, its pretty much all of them(at my school). At first I thought it was an isolated occurrence only at my school, but I'm starting to see it in the culture.

Notice: I'm not saying that all of them are as manipulative, but it seems to be something very noticeable in the culture. I'm really not here to spread hatred or racism, as I'm Black and Asian myself-(BLASIAN). I think its sad that they are representing a group of people who really don't have any connection with, and barely understand our culture. When people say the best of NA, I want them to think of actually NA, even if we lose the entire tournament. I think its the mentality difference in cheering for a basketball team and a olympic team. Your free to choose a b-ball team and bandwagon jump, but come olympics, its us vs the world.

LMQ is not a NA team. THEY JUST PLAY HERE. One or two players is completely different than say A WHOLE TEAM. No one should feel ok with how they qualified for worlds, because maybe 5 years down the line NA and EU will just be the Asian B&amp;C leagues. Its not fair that they took an ""easy route"" to worlds compared to their region. I mean whats stopping any flunky B-team from coming and stomping our region? Maybe its the joke called NA soloque? It most certainly is not the exposure or the money. Maybe they have the pride to actually play for their region. 

Regardless, I cant fault LMQ for coming over here, but i don't have to like them or support them, much less call them an NA team just because they play here. Its really not something to get passionate about, just another one of those things where someone took advanage of the system.

TL;DR: Its ok to not support and to actively dislike people who take advantage of the system, especially if its at your or your regions expense. We shouldn't praise LMQ (if at all) for being a NA team, but for beating a majority of NA teams. They aren't one of us. Its ok to like them for beating us.

Some info about their bites from the UC Riverside website:

&gt; Spider Bites: The bite of a brown widow spider is minor in comparison to that of a black widow.  Although one frequently cited study demonstrates that, drop per drop, brown widow spider venom is as toxic as other widow species, venom toxicity is only one aspect when considering a spider's bite potential. An African study with 15 verified bites demonstrated that the brown widow spider bite victims showed none of the classic symptoms of latrodectism, a response induced by neurotoxins in the venom of spiders in the genus Latrodectus (e.g., brown widows, black widows [L. mactans], Australian redbacks [L. hasselti], European black widow [L. tredecimguttatus], and New Zealand's katipo spider [L. katipo]).  The reason for the weaker effect of brown widow bites on humans is possibly because the brown widow does not have or cannot inject as much venom as its larger relatives.  The two major symptoms of a brown widow bite were that the bite hurt when it was inflicted and it left a red mark. These two symptoms are not much different from the bite of normal household spiders.  However, there is one recent report of a verified brown widow bite manifesting in more severe symptoms that required hospitalization of the bite victim.

[Source]( http://cisr.ucr.edu/brown_widow_spider.html)

Widows are very docile anyway, and typically won't bite you unless you're really messing with them.

From a University of Hawaii website:

&gt; They are shy and will tend to avoid contact with humans. Females are not aggressive, make no effort to attack, and prefer to retreat and lie perfectly still.

&gt; To lump together fascist parties (Golden Dawn in Greece, Ataka in Bulgaria, Jobbik in Hungary, the BNP) with bellicose but essentially constitutional anti-immigration movements (FN in France, PVV in the Netherlands, Freedom Party in Austria) is clumsy. To add in eurosceptic parties of the democratic right (AfD in Germany, Mouvement pour la France, Danish People’s Party, Ukip) is deliberately tendentious.
&gt;
&gt; When someone groups all these parties together under the label ‘extreme right’, he is telling you more about himself than about them. Parties like Golden Dawn are not right-wing in any recognisable sense. They favour workers’ councils, higher spending, state-controlled industries; they march on May Day under red flags. They could just as easily sit at either end of the European Parliament’s hemicycle (our closest equivalent, in its combination of mystical nationalism and loathing for capitalism, is Sinn Féin). Calling such parties right-wing isn’t intended to make anyone think less of them; it’s intended to damage mainstream conservatives by implying that the difference between them and the Nazis is one of degree.
&gt;
&gt; But the Barrosos and Junckers and Rompuys don’t stop there. Their definition of extremism also covers those leftists who have seen through the EU. The euro crisis has led to a revival of communist parties in the austerity-stricken states: Ireland’s Socialist party, Spain’s Izquierda Unida, Greece’s Syriza. Radical socialists argued all along that the euro was a scam that would benefit bankers and bureaucrats at the expense of ordinary people. And — it’s not often one gets to say this — they were spot on. Every successive cut has vindicated their interpretation of the EU as an organised racket in which a privileged caste lives off the sweat of the workers.

On his insistence that China won't overtake America in GDP: I've heard a lot of economists say that America is actually in a very good fundamental position, and I agree. Putting aside the issues of political deadlock and inequality, there's not really a lot of major long-term problems within America. 

Undocumented immigration has kept our workforce young and our population pyramid balanced, our economy is still relatively dynamic and efficient, our mindset is still outward-looking, we don't have a large demographic crisis like Europe, China or Japan. Our educational institutions aren't even bad compared to most of Europe: only the best European countries out-perform us. We have very strong tertiary education, etc. The only negative thing I can think of is that our consumer debt is still quite high.

I agree with him on the middle income trap for China. I think one thing he did not mention is that a modern first-world economy, a service economy, is more productive primary through tertiary education, and so China needs the level of tertiary education that the first-world has. http://www.excellencemapping.net gives them a poor rating in this regard.

On geopolitics: I think he underestimates the Russian threat to Europe. An entire country mobilized by propaganda to defeat something they see as an aggressor is a self-sustaining entity, and a military economy works very differently from a (relatively) peacetime one. That being said, I agree Russia is currently in a downward spiral.

I disagree with him on the nomination of oil trade in Yuan. The status as the largest reserve currency is definitely a larger boon than a bane in my opinion, and this sets the precedent for the end of that.

I don't think we'll ever see currency backed even by 30 commodities. It just has too many downsides economically, in my opinion, for a currency to be backed by a physical good. If it does happen, I don't think it'll have the support of American academic macroeconomics.

I agree with him entirely on the Euro, he's got it pinpoint to me.

The problem I see with 100% reserve banking is that it requires the central banks, which now are the ONLY source of new currency in any real sense, to either produce enough money to keep up with economic events very precisely, or suffer from chronic short-term deflation and inflation like we did back in the Gold Standard era in the United States, and I'm just not sure a single source can ever possibly do that. If you read Freidrich Hayek's essay ""The Use of Knowledge in Society"" I more or less agree with him on this: decentralized systems communicate more information than centralized ones. (http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html) 

I think that a loss of the political independence that he talks about with the Japan 1930's example he gives might give a short-term boost but would be a major step backwards in the responsible management of money.

I have no personal investigation of the ""fiddling with unemployment"" allegation but if you look at independent measures of inflation, they're quite in line with the official Federal data. Energy was excised because it's too volatile.

I agree with his entire line of thought on rate-tightening, but I think Yellen is more honest than he gives her credit for, I don't think she'll tighten soon. Labor is still quite slack in America, there's a lot of room for more demand.

Man those opinions went long.

- I would also make it so that you can have a battle plan given to your troops and have the AI handle the details of it.  Meaning, if I have a stack of 40 guys I want them to put the minimum to siege in all enemy territories while putting the rest in a stack that seeks to take out smaller enemy stacks or defend my sieges from enemy stacks.

- I would make colonization/trade companies a choice, not a set thing by region.  In fact, make any place that is 2 or more provinces away from your main body into a colony, and have it's governing be determined by you, and be able to change it any time for a small amount of unrest.  If you expand to be right next to your colony, it stops being a colony and integrates.  This would mean you could end up with three or more colonies in Europe, but it would make more sense, as these would be semi-autonomous anyway.

- Make mercenary companies and holy orders more a reflection of the world as it is, and less the world as it actually was.  Any Emperor level leader should be able to found an independent Holy Order and Mercenary Company that reflects the religion and culture of their origin, and with some work, they should be able to vassalize them.

In Ukraine's case, the EU demanded that Ukraine desist from participation in the Russian-led CIS if it wanted association status with the EU. For its part, Russia was fine if Ukraine  pursued both trade alliances. The elected president wanted CIS membership now, keeping the option of EU association status open if the EU dropped its exclusivity demands. For this he was overthrown in a coup, which the West applauded. 

Besides pushing further east, NATO pursued an aggressive military course in Serbia, despite lacking any UN authorization. Despite offering assurances that Kosovo would remain part of Serbia, NATO and the EU turned around and recognized Kosovo's independence. 

In Libya, NATO turned a 'no fly zone' UN authorization into an unlimited air campaign. In Syria, the West has been desperately seeking a way to enable regime change. Saddam's Iraq was taken out due to 'flawed intelligence'. Meanwhile, Russia has watched all of these allies being attacked, but so far kept its response very mild. 

Russia has been invaded three times in the last century. Expecting them to sit idly by while they're surrounded by NATO is naive at best. Frankly, I'm surprised they've let things go as far as they have.

The Independent did an [investigation that showed that the supposed mythological status was mostly built on faulty statistics that may have been built on deliberately faulty data collection from official agencies.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/child-sex-grooming-the-asian-question-7729068.html)

The relevant passage from the article:
&gt;Last year, the government's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre launched a five-month investigation into the issue. It took the broadest definition of underage grooming, describing it as any situation where a child or young person receives something in exchange for performing sexual favours.

&gt;The centre identified 2,379 potential offenders who had been reported for grooming since 2008. The vast majority were men. Most were aged 18 to 24. It could fully identify only 940 of the suspects. Of these, 38 per cent were white, 32 per cent were recorded as of unknown ethnicity, 26 per cent were Asian, 3 per cent were black and less than 1 per cent were Chinese.

&gt;These figures were reported in the media with various degrees of sensationalism. The 2001 census recorded 92.1 per cent of the general population as white, 2 per cent as black, 3.1 per cent as Indian or Pakistani, 1.2 per cent as ""mixed"" and 1.6 per cent as ""other"". But what was not prominently noted was that the centre's findings were heavily qualified by phrases such as ""where ethnicity was recorded"". What about the cases where it was not? The overall data was poorly recorded, inconsistent and incomplete, expert academics say.

As one final thing, I wanted to add that I broadly agree that the specific Islamic cultural attitudes towards sex within their own communities is driving this trend. They would never think about doing this stuff in their homelands because over there if you touch someone else's daughter, you have a significantly higher chance of having your face smashed in. 

Britain and the rest of Europe really need to think twice about letting huge swathes of people in who are more interested in maintaining 7th century cultural practices than being a part of general society. The Muslim community as a whole needs to do more to combat this stuff if they want to be taken seriously. I know that not all Muslims are like these gangs, but when you see news articles about things like [Operation Trojan Horse](http://www.bbc.com/news/education-27763113) (where Islamic extremists successfully took over large parts of a Birmingham public school's board and instituted policies like mandatory Arabic study for everyone, among other ridiculous things) it's very hard to believe that these ideas are on the fringe. I get the sense that there is a huge degree of permissiveness/toleration of these activities within the community, so long as Muslims are doing it to other non-Muslims.

Frankfurt, going to Egelsbach, saves me more than an hour, even including driving to the airfield and preparing the airplane.

To Berlin, rail is faster, since GA flights generally go to Schönhagen (EDAZ), from which it is still a lengthy trip to the centre of Berlin. To the ILA Air show it was ok to fly, but I needed to leave early to be back in EDLI by 1800Z.

We haven't done any other business trips yet, but London is a possibility in the future. Since I am not instrument rated, and the aircraft is not IFR certified, it all depends on the weather.


Now for the first part, and here I'm on shaky ground.

Unpaid there is no problem at all. It's probably like taking him along in your private car. Cost-sharing is also fine and as far as I know it is also fine for the company to reimburse your costs.

I am not a lawyer, but here is how I understand the situation:

The EU is trying to introduce a new definition of ""commercial"" in the context of flight crew licensing, which contradicts all traditional and codified existing definitions, at least in Germany. Normally for an activity to be commercial (""gewerblich""), it has to be repeated, its intent has to be to make a profit (regardless of actual profit achieved), and advertising it is also a clear sign of commercial activity. The German government has issued a clarification that cost-sharing is fine, if you take a friend, a colleague, a fellow club member, or if a club or flight school offers sightseeing or disovery flights. Unlike in the US, I think (though I may be wrong) you can share 100% of the total costs among the passengers, with the pilot going free. In FAA country you can only share fuel and oil costs, and the pilot cannot carry less of the costs than any passenger.

The controversial definition of ""commercial"" in new EU regulations states that a CPL is needed if there is **any** remuneration, which would be worse than in the US.

(I think glider towing and banner towing is still exempt from requiring a CPL, and can be done commercially with a PPL. I'm not sure about the current situation regarding aerial work, e .g. photography, crop-spraying, the latter being extremely rare in Germany anyway. Flight instruction does (so far) also not require a CPL here, but quite a bit of extra training and qualifications.)

Stalin viciously suppressed dissent and built a cult of personality around himself as the strong savior of the Russian people - much like Putin.

Stalin's only saving grace was that he happened to benefit from industrialization which by the 20th century was long overdue in Russia - much like Putin's best factor is that he is presiding over the gas exploration boom.

Therefore, even if the licence agreement prohibits a further transfer, the rightholder can no longer oppose the resale of that copy.*

However, Steam clearly does not allow you to resell your games. I'd love it if I could. You also can't return your games. Frankly, it's *very* anti-consumer; and great deals don't change that, they just make it tolerable. But it is what it is: Massively limiting, intrusive and anti-consumer DRM that totally strips us of our usual rights of ownership, that we tolerate; even like; because it's *cheap* and *easy*. 

Edit: I'd like to highlight a particular statement in the EU Court's press release, *""Such a transaction involves a transfer of the right of ownership of the copy""*. Look at that, ""right of ownership"". *Ownership*. I'm a Canadian, and many of you are Americans. In North America, as far as I can tell, we have nothing like this, in either country. We cannot own software, unless we develop it ourselves. Even physical media, we don't technically own, it's still just ""licensed"", but at least with physical media we had de facto ownership, if not actual de jure ownership. I'm not sure how it got to be this way, but its a little worrying to me that it did. I honestly hope that Steam; and all other digitally distributed goods; one day recognize consumer rights of ownership. But I don't see it happening. And I don't think that's a good thing. But I can't deny the hypocrasy of my words either, as I sit here typing this, with 69 games in ""my"" Steam library. It's too easy. Too cheap. ",t3_2f5g5v,pcmasterrace,t1_ck63vwa,2,1427258323

For any possible collateral damage? I think not. Preach all you like about amnesty and what-not, but the fact of the matter is, they're a burden and a hazard to the taxpaying citizen, who was either born here or came here LEGALLY (keyword, pay attention). 

And another point: why should they be absolved of their crimes with just a few strokes of a pen?  How would that make the legal immigrants that went through the process of naturalization feel when they find out that somewhere between 11 and 20 million criminals' records became expunged?  That would negate the whole point of having an immigration policy in the first place.  

But I digress...

Back to the abuse thing:  All of the rape, and low pay (I don't see how that's abuse, but whatever) etc. could've been prevented had they not broken the law and sneaked into the country.  You want to give them rights and better pay?  Then secure the fucking border and enforce the laws that are in place and allow people to legally enter the country and do whatever it takes to deport those that have broken the law.  This isn't the European Union; we don't have a treaty with Mexico or Canada that grants free, unlimited access, as well Constitutional rights and liberties.  Why? Because they're not citizens and haven't earned the right to claim them.  So, back to what I said earlier, the misfortunes that befall them are a direct result of their actions. If they didn't want to be treated like chattel and be horribly exploited by terrible people, then they shouldn't have broken the law.  They made an active choice to come into the country illegally, stay illiterate to the primary language and in doing so have forfeited any possibilities of gaining a better life for themselves and for their families.

It is possible that the flood caused a social crisis, wiping out many ecologically productive coastal areas and forced the people north of the Black Sea to give up hunting and gathering and become semi-nomadic cattle, goat, and sheep herders (interestingly, they never went through a farming stage, they went straight to pastorialism).

Einstein vorbeste despre cadre de referinta inertiale, cu alte cuvinte, cadre de referinta in care legile lui Newton se aplica. Cadrul de referina cu pamantul fix nu-i inertial. Nici cel in care tu esti punctul fix nu-i inertial. Acum nu spun ca un cadru de referinta non-inertial nu are utilitatea lui, e util in anumite cazuri dar nu in momentul care vrei sa argumentezi pentru o realitate in care soarele se invarte in jurul pamantului.

The French plan actually makes a lot of sense if you remove your hindsight.

The French planned to meet and fight the Germans in Belgium, defeat them there and then continue into Germany once the best and brightest of the German army had been ground down.

The French based their plan on their experiences in world war 1.  In that war, not only had the Germans occupied large swaths of northern France and the coal and iron mines and related metal industry (vital to the war effort), the defensive had proven much stronger than the offensive due to the ease of moving reinforcements by rail to any threatened part of the front, while the attacked had to move by foot and horse through the former front line to exploit a breakthrough.

The German had built the Siegfried line along the border, a decent set of fortifications and defensive structures, which the French, with experience from ww1, thought too expensive to try to force their way through.

The French plan 1939 was as follows;

1. The Poles are to resist as long as possible. If they are succesful, the French army will launch an offensive against the Germans 14 days after the declaration of war. If not, the Poles are to retreat to the southeastern part of the country and will be supplied by the French through Romania, which was friendly towards both countries. Like the Serbian army and the Salonika bridgehead in ww1, the Polish army will keep being a threat to the Germans, and will be ready to break out once the main German force has been destroyed.

2. France and Britain was negotiating with the Soviets right up to the start of the war for an alliance. Stalin strung them along and kept demanding their support for demands on Poland and Romania, which the allies did not want to grant. In reality, they had already signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with its secret protocols. The Poles were in the process of retreating what was left of their army to the Romanian brigdehead when the Soviets declared war and invaded on the 17th of September 1939. This cut the Poles off from the intended bridgehead. Combined with the devastating defeat of the Bzura counterattack and the destruction in that battle of the Poznan and Pomorze armies, the Poles were pretty much done. The French then cancelled their probing attack into the Saar region and their intended offensive, as it would do them no good. They then revised their plan.

As opposed to the common misconception, the French did not rely on the Maginot line, nor did it cost them that much. The basic idea of the Maginot line was to dissuade the Germans from attacking Alsace-Lorraine and instead funneling them through Belgium - a job it did quite well. The intention was also to save manpower, as France had only about half the population of Germany - far fewer men was needed to man the fortifications than would be needed to man the border as regular infantry units. The whole line cost about 5 billion francs 1930-1939 - about 2% of the French military budget at that time.

As Poland fell, the French revised their plans. Now, they wanted to fight in Belgium. There's several reasons for them waiting. Attacking the Siegfried line on their own (the British BEF was nowhere near ready in Autumn 1939) without the Germans distracted by the Poles or the Soviets seemed folly. Belgium had withdrawn from the allies in 1934 to declare itself neutral, and the French wanted to have the Belgian 650 000 man on its side rather than the opposite - it meant waiting on the Germans to attack Belgium. Also, by Summer 1940, the British would have their BEF fully ready, including an armoured division.

So the French dug in, preparing for a long war where resources and industry would count. They ramped up tank production, ensured their supply lines to their colonies and set their society up for war production.

The new plan was;

1. Wait until the British have their army in order before doing anything offensive. The Royal Navy will strangle the Germans out of vital supplies, such as food, tungsten (needed for metalworking), chrome (needed for armour), copper and oil. Trying to get Sweden to stop exporting iron ore and Finland to stop exporting nickel was also on the table. The whole affair in Norway and the threats of an expeditionary force to help Finland was more about strangling those exports to Germany than any other issue. The Germans simply got to Norway first. The Germans had been re-arming at neckbreaking speed (and were close to bankrupcy several times, only bailed out by seizing the Austrian and Czechoslovak gold reserves and foreign assets) and the French were only beginning to catch up when the war started.

2. If the Germans attack, it will be through Belgium. The best of the French army will then rush north together with the BEF and link up with the Belgian army. Together they will grind down the German offensive on Belgian soil, either through vicious attrition or a decisive battle. This keeps northern France, with a lot of population and industry, not even mentioning coal and iron mines, safe and free from occupation. Once the best parts of the German army have been destroyed in Belgium, the French will lead the offensive from Belgium that will flank the Siegfried line and punch into Germany's vital Ruhr industrial and coal producing area. After defeating the German army there, France would have crippled the German ability to conduct war and thus won, with minimal casualties and devastation to France itself.

The French were reinforced in their belief that their plans were correct in the [Mechelen incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechelen_incident) in which a German liason plane carrying the full plan for the invasion of France crashed in Belgium on the 10th of January 1940. The event caused the Germans to scrap their plan and go with von Manstein's daring attack through the Ardennes instead.

The French considered the Ardennes impassable for large mechanised forces - their cavalry was screening the forest (5 divisions and 3 colonial cavalry brigades, however, most of their attention was to the north, towards the Belgian part of the forest) with a force of infantry behind them at Sedan (2 infantry divisions). The Germans managed, despite massive traffic jams, to get a force of 3 Panzer divisions with 771 tanks through. They brushed the cavalry aside and crashed through the French infantry. The rest is history.

The French prepared for a long war - they were right in that, it is just that it turned out to not be very long for them. For example, the French limited their air force to 1-2 combat missions per day, intending to keep them fresh and ready for continued combat for a long time, while the Germans managed to get 4-6 combat missions per plane and day, resulting in much more effective combat usage, but crews exhausted and prone to mistakes and accidents reducing their strength. By June, the Luftwaffe was almost completely worn out and needed more than a month of rest and refit before they could launch the Battle of Britain. The French also retreated parts of their airforce out of range of German fighters in order to protect them from attacks on their airfields, to allow them to rest and repair planes in peace - which meant that a large part of the French air force was in the process of moving bases and unavailable at the decisive moment.

The French knew that the Germans would come through Belgium and rushed their best forces north to link up with the Belgians once they did - however, the Germans punched a large armoured force throught he Ardennes forest, between the Maginot line and the Franco-Belgian positions in Belgium.

The Belgians had build fortifications in eastern Belgium, but they were not coordinated with the Maginot line, and since Belgium had withdrawn from its alliance with France 1934 to become neutral, the French could not cooperate with the Belgians on defence and fortified lines.

The Belgian fortified line pretty much fell apart when one of the key elements of it, Fort Eben-Emael was seized by a handful of German paratroopers in a daring operation.

[See this map, where the Ardennes forest anchor both the Maginot line and the Belgian fortress system and the key part Eben-Emael plays in the easternmost angle of the Belgian fortress system](http://www.globeatwar.com/media/136/download/Northwest%20Europe%201940_Allied%20Defense%20v%20German%20Invasion%20Plan.jpg.)",t3_2f5h9b,AskHistorians,t1_ck64dvn,112,1427258089

I asked something along these lines to a chaplain once I was at uni. I asked him why they didn't follow the rules in the Old Testament, and his response was with a question ""Do you think life was the same 3000 years ago when Moses was around?"". Its actually a good question, back in the time of Moses life was tough, and the rules that were put in the Torah and Old Testament were really harsh, to govern the people according to those conditions. For example a lot of the kosher rules, not mixing milk and meat, and dietary rules during Passover were to conserve the limited food they had at the time. There are still Jews that adhere to the Torah fully, the Hasidim Jews, but they are a minority. 

Now I think the same thing applies to Islam, it was harsh times back 1500 years ago. We are talking medieval cut-throat kill or be killed life in the desert. I believe that the brutal verses are actually quite normal if we look at the context during which they were revealed, which is medieval times.

Actually by medieval standards the Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) wasn't at all aggressive, do you know about the [Achtiname](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtiname_of_Muhammad)? Its a charter that grants safety to Christians within Muslim lands. It even contains the lines: ""If a Christian woman shall happen to marry a Muslim man, the Muslim shall not cross the inclination of his wife, to keep her from her church and prayers, and the practice of her religion.""

Nowadays we have ISIS cutting peoples heads off, so much for progression.

We can see that Europeans have been able to undergo reform, mainly during the Renaissance, there was a time when Christians imprisoned Galileo for claiming the earth was not the centre of the universe. But Christians have overcome this, and now we have the situation in Europe, the understanding of the Bible has evolved.

Our understanding of Islam has also evolved, great thinkers such as Cellaludin Rumi have interpreted Islam in a much more peaceful manner. 

But unfortunately there remains rigid-minded folk who refuse to even accept any other interpretation(""Tefsir"") of the Quran, other then their own cemaat, or tarikat. They will go so far as to tell you NOT to read the Quran, but to read or get told about Tefsir.

Similar thing with ultra-conservative xtians who love to take out verses from the Bible, just to fit their conservationism.

The bottom line with my beliefs is that they are much more open and not as conservative as others.

I think also that there is a cultural element to me being a Muslim, I don't come from a very religious family(only grandparents are religious), and I'm not very religious myself(I'm sure you would have guessed:)) So I was never intimidated by Islam, and I am able to accept it as a part of my identity.

From [my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2c4wmf/misconceptions_on_indias_colonial_past/)

So on the India had the highest share of the global economy thread I saw a lot of misinformation floating about and wanted to address some of these. In no particular order, here it goes.


** Europe was united, India was a bunch of warring kingdoms after the Gupta’s and had no political administrative or cultural cohesion.

Both tropes are FALSE. **Europe was a united entity** : This is true after the 1800’s, but till then Europe (the countries that comprise Western Europe) were as fragmented as India in the 1800’s.

The UK for instance is not one united place. It comprises of England, Ireland, Wales &amp; Scotland. A country the size of Andhra Pradesh (and a little more) had 4 warring states for most of it’s history. England &amp; Ireland have fought 3 major wars, 2 wars of independence and a freedom movement. England &amp; Ireland have in other words been in a constant state of war from 1200 (the Norman invasion of Ireland) till 1920 (the Easter rising). Likewise England &amp; Scotland have also fought 2 major wars, multiple rebellions and were ‘unified’ only in 1700 after the Union of the Crowns pact. Even now the Scottish identity supersedes the British identity and Scotland would most probably secede in the referendum coming up in November.

Germany at the fall of the HRE (in 1800) comprised of 500 independent small states. Bismarck completed the unification only in the late 1800’s.


**India after the Gupta’s had zero cohesion and comprised of a thousand warring states**

To give you an idea of the cohesion and thought process of medieval India, here is an example. The armies of Mohamed had by 750 AD completed most of it’s early conquests however India fell to Islamic invaders only by 1200. A gap of 500 odd years. If we had a 100 warring kingdoms, we should have fallen to these earlier right?

We had in this same period 2 major empires – The Gurjara Pratiharas (in size, they ruled over an empire as big as the Gupta) and the Chalukyas. These two combined ruled over you could say 80% of pre-partition India. While they were constantly at war, when the Arab armies invaded, they stopped their own fights, made an alliance and soundly defeated the Arab armies in the Battle of Rajasthan. So not only did we not have a 100 petty kingdoms who only fought against each other, we had 2 Pan Indian empires who formed an alliance to defeat a common enemy. We have had huge gaps when we did have the scenario of petty kings fighting over the spoils of the previous empire, but this is not an Indian failing, but one that is common across human history, but that being said, we have almost always had a huge empire stabilize and take over large parts of this country. The Pariharas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Cholas, Kushanas, Mughals (400 years, territory comprised of almost all of pre partition India) are but a few of these. Most of these empires lasted 200-400 years, so it is not like they are short term in nature.


**India was this super rich place, everybody lived in prosperity and the Brits made it an impoverished place**

While India was a super rich place, the lot of its peasants was about as bad as it was / is now. So this would be a partly true, partly false.

At the time the Brits came in (Mughal empire and after), we had as we have today two India’s. One was the very very rich Mughal aristocracy, the landowners (Zamindars), the mercantile class (mostly Hindu bankers &amp; traders) who were arguably amongst the richest in the world and you had the impoverished peasants who worked the land of the aforementioned aristocracy / landowners. If you were a poor peasant in 1800, 1900 or 1950 you wouldn’t have literally noticed any difference in your standard of living.

The logic that “India had the world’s largest economy” is very misleading. It is like America today but with 70% being on par with an African farmer in terms of per capita income. Sure, it would be the largest, but the income / wealth disparity would be something that cannot even be imagined. 


**The Brits impoverished us.**

True.

On this there can be absolutely no doubt. The balance of payments became very lopsided with money leaving India despite it showing a massive increase in it’s exports and agricultural production. Why, during WW1, India “gifted” Britain 250 MILLION GBP (would be equivalent to billions today) to support it’s war effort and this was a one time payment.

That being said, the Brits had one positive effect on the Indian economy – the tax burden of the peasants went down from 25% during the Mughal era to 2% in 1947. The Brits progressively removed the concept of taxing the peasants, introduced land reforms (Ryotwari system), destroyed the power of the big zamindars and did a lot to evenly spread out incomes from farming. For this, we do need to be thankful that we had the British as our colonial masters and not Spain or some bloodthirsty nation (relatively) that would have just taxed the hell out of the peasants. I for one do not see any benefit accruing to Britain because of these reforms, and they did this to truly reform the Indian system.


**Britain was able to conquer us only because of advances made in the Industrial revolution or the Industrial revolution made Europe wealthy**

False.

The timelines don’t bear this out. Britain’s conquest of India (and other European powers conquest of their empires) was almost complete by 1800. The industrial revolution came about in Britain around 1790.

Secondly, one needs to understand how the Industrial revolution worked and why without the colonial empires it would have collapsed like a house of cards.

•	The industrial revolution was designed around economies of scale. The vast textile plants in Manchester for instance need two vital things.
o	A cheap (close to free) source of raw materials and assured supply of these
o	A vast market in which the finished products could be exported to

The above was provided only by having access to the raw materials supplied by the colonial empires and the vast guaranteed markets that the empires provided. In a way we have a parallel even today. China is doing EXACTLY this in Africa. Sourcing raw materials for cheap and exporting finished goods. Any country that goes against this is faced with a  lot of Chinese soft power (like Nigeria for instance).  So as you can see, the colonial empires aided and supported the famed Industrial revolution without these empires, this might have just failed.


**We have absolutely nothing to be thankful to the British for**

Now before I get into this, let me clarify I am NOT a neocolonist, I am not an apologist for the British empire (or any empire for that matter), I in fact hate British rule in India with an absolute passion but all that being said, looking at it objectively there are a few things we need to be thankful to the brits for and to say that literally zero positive came out of their 300 year rule is incorrect…national pride notwithstanding.

**United India**

•	After the Mughal empire fell, we had multiple smaller empires all fighting for supremacy. We had the Rajputs, the Sikhs, the Muslims in the Hyderabad region (remnants of the Bijapur / Golconda sultanates). Going by past history, these would have fought until we had 2,3 major bigger empires ruling over most of what we know as modern India. Going by that logic the British did unite as, and gave us the sense of “Indianess” (thanks to the freedom struggle). This spirit certainly did not exist before the British.

**Land reforms**

•	 Land use laws in India had remained pretty much static for 2,000 years. It needed the British to kickstart the reform process (Ryotwari act), and this has helped modern India immensely.

**Social reforms** 

•	They did push to end terrible social practices like Sati or the Thugee menace, pushed for modern universities (these were started in 1850 and was not done because they needed people for the ICS – the ICS was exclusively for the Whites till around 1910) and did a lot of work to create social mobility within the lower castes (the land reforms for one ended the Zamindar menace and created new (smaller) landowners from the lower castes) and other such social reforms.

Many Muslim families emigrated from two relatively small towns – Sylhet in northern Bangladesh and Mirpur in Pakistani Kashmir, both “conservative” places in “rural backwaters”.

If US stations troops anywhere, that is a very clear way of saying that the US is protecting the area.

I don't subscribe to the opinion that Europe depends on the US for military protection. American military makes any potential conflict a lot easier, but there is no military threat that European countries wouldn't be able to handle - if there was a more united military. This is another area where I feel we're being held back by the whole nation-state business, if the EU had a single military, it would easily be more powerful than any non-US military in the world, even with current spending levels. Of course politically, there is not a chance in hell of that happening anytime soon.

As for actual US presence, I would rather see it shifted geographically a bit. The US Army has a ton of bases in Germany and Italy. The Navy has facilities in Italy. The US Air Force has more combat capability in its German bases than many European states have themselves. Look at USAFE-AFAFRICA, the command has HQ in Germany, with its main bases located in Germany, UK, Italy.

There is an obvious pattern - US has a large presence in countries that are already capable of defending themselves, and face fewer geopolitical threats. The UK is not on the continent, Germany is surrounded by allies, and these countries have significant combat capabilities. At the same time, there are no US bases in Poland, which is militarily weaker and close to (and on bad terms with) Russia. There are no US bases in the Baltics, where the three countries have a combined regular military size of some 15 thousand troops and no air forces of their own, and of course the Baltics are right next to Russia.

Had Bismarcks successors did as he said - ally with Russia, there would have been no need to build a navy and UK wouldnt step in to defend France. Instead Europe would have been the USA of 20th century - a continental super power instead of a water based super-power.

&gt;

&gt;The __Hispanidad__ (English: Hispanics) are the community formed by all the people and countries that share a common [Hispanic heritage and cultural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_culture). The 23 nations that are included are all [Spanish-speaking countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanophone).

&gt;The community can be classified into three geographic areas: *Hispanic Europe* ([Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain)), *[Hispanic America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_America)*, and *Hispanic Africa* ([Equatorial Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea) and [Western Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara)). A few countries in the Asia-Pacific region also have historical Spanish influence, although they no longer have Spanish as their official language.

&gt;Various countries celebrate 12 October as the *[Día de la Hispanidad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%ADa_de_la_Hispanidad)* (""Day of Hispanicity"" or ""Hispanic Day""). Since 1987 [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) has celebrated this holiday as its *[Fiesta Nacional de España](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiesta_Nacional_de_Espa%C3%B1a)*. In the other nations of the community, the day is also celebrated as a commemoration of the date in 1492 when [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus) discovered the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas), marking the beginning of the diffusion of Spanish language and culture as well as its lasting impact on the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World).

**[Spice and Wolf:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou)**

* *Trailer:* [English dub]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMPPrw_hVfM)

* *What it's about:* Kraft Lawrence is a travelling merchant making his living by trading between towns in a facsimile of medieval Europe. One day, as he passes through one of his regular stops during a traditional festival, the local harvest deity (a ""wolf-goddess"" named Holo) uses the opportunity to take her leave. The show follows Holo and Lawrence as they engage in a series of mercantile adventures while making their way north to Holo's homeland. 
* *Why watch it?:* Generally it's sold as a ""slow-burning romance"" but, honestly, it's more about relationships in general. The protagonists act like a bickering/flirting married couple from the start; it's not a ""When will senpai notice me?"" dynamic. Faithfully adapted from a hugely popular series of Light Novels, Spice and Wolf's heart is in the friendly banter between Holo and Lawrence, and seeing each of them play off the other never fails to entertain. The show takes an unusual approach to establishing the necessary tension and excitement for the episode-to-episode storylines. Where many anime fall back on swords and shouting, the conflicts of Spice and Wolf arise from Lawrence's life as a merchant - impressively, it manages to make the concepts of *short-selling* and *arbitrage* both interesting and relevant to the plot.

* *Caveats*: While many enjoy learning basic economic theory, it's not for everyone. And if, after two or three episodes, you find that you can't stand either of the two protagonists, drop the series. They're the core of the show and if you don't like them, you're not going to enjoy the rest of it. While it doesn’t end on a cliffhanger as such, the show is deliberately left open-ended to encourage watchers to pick up the light novels (which are highly recommended).

* *Theme(s)*: Trust. Relationships, both business and personal.

* *Similar works:* **[Maoyuu Maou Yuusha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14833/Maoyuu_Maou_Yuusha)** has the same director, similar setting and theme, and even uses the same two actors for the lead roles.

___________

**[Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!)**

* *Trailer:* [Fan-made for the English Dub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EunfWKyWxvc)

* *What it's about*: A series of inter-related storylines weaving back and forth between three ""focal points"". Set in Prohibition-era America, the story follows an ensemble cast of gangsters, psychopaths and immortals and the various intersections of their lives at different points.

* *Why watch it?*: Simply put, it’s a fun story. There's enough action to keep you watching *this* episode, and enough mystery to make you want to watch *next* episode. Baccano! is also that rare animal where the dub is actually *far superior* to the subtitled version, with the authentic New York and Chicago accents adding a lot to the experience. 

* *Caveats*: The first episode is overly confusing and jumps around *way* too much, even in a series that does a lot of that later on - to the point of doing little to actually make you care about any of the characters. Honestly, I generally recommend people to skip straight to episode 2, where they provide a solid foundation (the train journey) to give context to the rest of the storylines. With the non-linear style of storytelling, you can always go back and watch episode 1 once you're hooked.

* *Theme(s)*: ""A life well-lived"". It's not how long the journey is, but what you did along the way, and how you determine for yourself your own goals, your own relationships and your own identity. How a single event can be viewed as the centre of a thousand different stories, providing a thousand different causes and an infinite number of repercussions. 

* *Similar works*: **[Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!)**, (Non-anime) Cloud Atlas, Pulp Fiction

**[No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)**

* *Trailer:* [PV Trailer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqMCYf1FibU)

* *What it's about:* A pair of game-obsessed shut-in siblings, Shiro and Sora, are transported to a world where everything, from settling a trade to the fate of nations, is decided by playing games like chess or poker. Humanity, as the only race unable to cheat using magic, is at a severe disadvantage. But it doesn't take the protagonists long to adapt to their new reality, and the show follows them as they set about rising to the top of the pile.

* *Why you should watch it:* By all rights, this show should not be as entertaining as it is – it has all the hallmarks of an awful show: unbeatable protagonists, ridiculous levels of fan-service, and a crapton of cheesy referential humour. But somehow it comes together to be something more than the sum of its parts. It’s so ridiculously fun to watch that you find yourself enjoying it despite the out-and-out silliness that it’s based on, and the utterly gorgeous art and fantastic soundtrack only add to the experience. It was without a doubt one of the strongest shows to come out of the Spring 2014 season.

* *Caveats:* This is not a serious show in the least. If you're looking for ""mind games"", they're definitely here, but they're not played straight - the solutions are rarely going to be something you can (or are expected to) predict.  It's also very indulgent when it comes to fan service, with more than a few lingering boob shots or straight-up ecchi. The humour tends towards the referential – picking up on all of the allusions to other anime series and pieces of Japanese culture is a game in itself.

* *Similar works:* NGNL is something of a blend between **One Outs** and **Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren’t They**. Also to some degree, it shares similarities with shows like **Log Horizon**, **Kaiji** and **Akagi** 

______________

**[Mirai Nikki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/Mirai_Nikki_(TV\))**

* *Trailer:* [Subbed version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U0uD-NODhM)

* *What it's about:* Yuki Amano is a loner, and lonely. He spends his days obsessively cataloguing everything he comes across in his diary, and daydreaming about an alien figure he calls ""Deus Ex Machina"". One day, Deus offers him a gift - the diary that Yuki so obsessively records his present in will instead show entries from his future. But it comes at a cost: eleven other people are given variations of the ""future diary"", and are told that by eliminating all of their peers they will ascend to godlike power

* *Why watch it:* The lynchpin of the entire series is the relationship between Yuki and his obsessive stalker/girlfriend Yuno. Alternating between creepy and funny, adorable and horrifying, she's one of anime's most memorable characters. The show itself maintains a good level of tension, with action scenes every episode and constantly shifting alliances and betrayals as all the actors seek to win the battle royale. It's a thriller in the purest sense of the term.

* *Caveats:* Logic has no place in the storyline. Things will happen at convenient times for convenient reasons, and you more or less have to learn to roll with it. Yuki's character is ridiculously passive, mostly in order to highlight the difference between himself and Yuno.

* *Themes:* Struggling to find any really. This is an entertaining work, but not a very deep one.

* *Similar works:* For more battle royale, try **Fate/Zero**. For more yandere, try **Denpa Teki na Kanojo**.

Anyways, we had one in march, one in june, one we get in october for example. We can train with groups from other cities.
Btw yes i m a girl.
I discussed the issues i had with the teacher, but he only said i needed to be patient. And i m just a beginner.

The stupid thing is. In my group we have only 1 player with my rank but he doesnt know at all what he s doing. Everything he can do wrong. He does wrong. So we are mixed in pairs and i m always with him matched up. So i asked the trainer if its possible to mix the pairs every now and then because we are more standing still as we dont know what to do. But higher grades usually dont want to train with me.

About acrobatic stuff. I dont get it either. They expect me to do things i m really scared to do. Like au s with head on the floor, au s 1 hand. Well i simply cant do them since i m not strong enough.

The singing i like. Most people on my group dont sing. I learned entire songs but no way they let me sing the entire song. Same for instruments. Its always the same people who can play instruments. If i ask, i need to wait till i get a higher rank.

So i just came for advice here as i thought maybe i m wrong and its every where the same. I live in a small city so to change to anthor group its not possible. And its hard to find people who practica capoeira. I searched internet but i couldnt find just forums to meet other capoeira players.

Anyways, i dont mind my cord. But it just hurts if i cant do anything im class besides clappung and the chorus thing... And that people dont help me more to get better. I mean ifin ur class a beginner is having problems with some movements, i would believe people help u or not? Or its common they put 2 beginners together and they just cant do the.exercise correctly?

So, here is my idea, I think by having a ""shield"" looking type mirror, like the one [here](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.antiques-atlas.co.uk/dealer-stock-images/georgianantiques/Victorian_Adams_Style_Dressing_as178a689b.jpg), and if you are able to find one that closes perfectly and covers the shield, you can engrave a motif of your choice (Like if it were me, I'd put the Hufflepuff crest on it since all the Sorting Hat quizzes I take put me in Hufflepuff), and when it closes, it also helps to ensure that dust doesn't collect on the mirror. I find that that's generally pretty big issue, so this helps to make things pretty, and also perform the practical function of keeping dust away from the mirror! (Though I can imagine dust will collect on the outside, but its better than getting on the mirror.

Given that you don't actually have that much space in your house though, I would think that the table with the ""shield"" mirror is a bit too big, and generally inefficient in the way its shaped, so I would think something like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ye0A0mTuU2w/T8G_ITcb2tI/AAAAAAAAAo8/_huxiLrKY0g/s1600/v0_nr3ujcfiu1.jpg) is slightly better. But just imagine that the middle of the table is slightly closer to the mirror, while the sides of the table overlap where you'd be sitting, sort of forming a ""C"" shape around you, which basically still gives you the size of a table, but its easier to fit into places, and you don't have to worry about having extra space for the chair, since the chair will fit into where the table is. Just make sure everything is colour-coordinated to the colour you like!

I also think that since there's a ""shield"" mirror already, you can't go wrong with antique trophy cups like [this](http://image0-rubylane.s3.amazonaws.com/shops/molotov/5201.1L.jpg) one here, so in a sense its really like a ""Battle Station"" where your numerous trophies, and even your ""house sigil"" or whatever you'd like to call it is there. Like if you'd like, maybe you can even get antique swords and daggers and use them as decoration! I'm not sure if you're already following the thread of my thoughts, but in a sense, my idea is that since there's already the moniker of ""Battle Station"" for what otherwise is a simple vanity, we might as well decorate it as a literal battle station, complete with what would represent a sigil, flag, or otherwise symbol that represents your side of the ""Battle"", and the trophy cups can extend that by making it seem like you're one that has won lots of ""Battles"", thus the numerous trophies. I don't think they actually give out trophies for winning a war or something like that though, so its kind of a stretch, but I feel like it can really give a nice atmosphere and also just give the sense that you're a winner with your battle station. (((: 

Also, another idea I have is that if you're going to put the makeup that you generally use on the table and not just in the cabinets provided, ammo cases such as [these](http://p2.la-img.com/567/14344/4502069_1_l.jpg) would also be a nice touch, which again goes back to the same theme of ""Battle Station"" as well, though I would think ammo cases probably work best with lipsticks. Otherwise, I think display cases like [this](http://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;docid=f6yQagGIVqu55M&amp;tbnid=g9q0mvAWiqtM_M:&amp;ved=0CAIQjBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fi26.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc101%2FOffrande%2FKnives%2FDaggerDisplayCase.jpg&amp;ei=PEAEVIDuB4exuATvvoDQAQ&amp;psig=AFQjCNHLYOiM_3FHotViR8sUc7ezREOxRw&amp;ust=1409651119633029) would be very nice for putting little eyeshadow pots and eyeliners, I think! =D This is of course assuming that you have space for everything on the table.

Lastly, I just want to say congratulations on the move! I hope you have fun moving into your cottage and that you'd enjoy your new house as much as I probably would! I dream of having a cottage some day because it looks like it'll be a very cosy and inviting home, so I sincerely hope that you'd be happy with your new home! Honestly I think that's the most important thing when moving - That you love your home! =D Good luck with everything! 

XOXO

Edit: In my excitement I forgot to say that the trophy cups are for storing makeup brushes, or even other things like mascara, lip glosses, maybe even foundation tubes/bottles! Like if the cup is big enough, just put it there, of course, if you're going to put some makeup on the table, and not in the cabinets that generally come with vanities.

While I believe it is true that European nations, with very few exceptions, don't live up to the level of military investment that would ensure our security, the NATO (apparently soft) requirement of 2% of GDP is a weird measure when you think about it.

GDP varies wildly from year to year, and many countries' public budgets aren't strictly proportional to their GDP. For instance, the GDP of many countries in Europe went down dramatically during the financial crisis, but military expenditure remained relatively stable.

&gt;In December 2013, for example, Switzerland had 26 free trade agreements in force, while the EU had 25.
&gt;Switzerland has six agreements in force with no EU counterpart: Singapore, the South African Customs Union, Japan, Canada, Ukraine, China and Hong Kong.
&gt;The EU had agreements with five countries with which Switzerland does not: Syria, San Marino, Algeria, Central America and Andorra.

Yeah you want to know where these go? A heck of lot of them don't even go into the council nor parliament but are **""Commission Regulations""** and by-pass voting by member nations altogether!!

1. Ukrainian artillery fell silent almost immediately. They are no longer shelling residential districts of Donetsk and Lugansk. This is because their locations had been pinpointed prior to the operation, and by Thursday afternoon they were completely wiped out using air attacks, artillery and ground-based rocket fire, as the first order of business. Local residents are overjoyed that their horrible ordeal is finally at an end.

2. The look of military activity on the ground in Donetsk and Lugansk has changed dramatically. Whereas before it involved small groups of resistance fighters, the Russians operate in battalions of 400 men and dozens of armored vehicles, followed by convoys of support vehicles (tanker trucks, communications, field kitchens, field hospitals and so on). The flow of vehicles in and out is non-stop, plainly visible on air reconnaissance and satellite photos. Add to that the relentless radio chatter, all in Russian, which anyone who wants to can intercept, and the operation becomes impossible to hide. 

3. The Ukrainian military has promptly vanished. Soldiers and officers alike have taken off their uniforms, abandoned their weapons, and are doing their best to blend in with the locals. Nobody thought the odds of the Ukrainian army against the Russians were any good. Ukraine's only military victory against Russia was at the battle of Konotop in 1659, but at the time Ukraine was allied with the mighty Khanate of Crimea, and, you may have noticed, Crimea is not on Ukraine's side this time around.

4. There are Russian checkpoints everywhere. Local civilians are allowed through, but anyone associated with a government, foreign or domestic, is detained for questioning. A filtration system has been set up to return demobilized Ukrainian army draftees to their native regions, while the volunteers and the officers are shunted to pretrial detention centers, to determine whether they had ordered war crimes to be committed.

5. Most of Ukraine's border crossings are by now under Russian control. Some have been reinforced with air defense and artillery systems and tank battalions, to dissuade NATO forces from attempting to stage an invasion. Civilians and humanitarian goods are allowed through. Businessmen are allowed through once they fill out the required forms (which are in Russian).

6. Russia has imposed a no-fly zone over all of Ukraine. All civilian flights have been cancelled. There is quite a crowd of US State Department staffers, CIA and Mossad agents, and Western NGO people stuck at Borispol airport in Kiev. Some are nervously calling everyone they know on their satellite phones. Western politicians are demanding that they be evacuated immediately, but Russian authorities want to hold onto them until their possible complicity in war crimes has been determined.

7. The usual Ukrainian talking heads, such as president Poroshenko, PM Yatsenyuk and others, are no longer available to be interviewed by Western media. Nobody quite knows where they are. There are rumors that they have already fled the country. Crowds have stormed their abandoned residences, and were amazed to discover that they were all outfitted with solid gold toilets. Nor are the Ukrainian oligarchs anywhere to be found, except for the warlord Igor Kolomoisky, who was found in his residence, abandoned by his henchmen, dead from a heart attack. (Contributed by the Saker.)

8. Some of the over 800,000 Ukrainian refugees are starting to stream back in from Russia. They were living in tent cities, many of them in the nearby Rostov region, but with the winter coming they are eager to get back home, now that the shelling is over. Along with them, construction crews, cement trucks and flatbeds stacked with pipe, cable and rebar are streaming in, to repair the damage from the shelling.

9. There is all sorts of intense diplomatic and military activity around the world, especially in Europe and the US. Military forces are on highest alert, diplomats are jetting around and holding conferences. President Obama just held a press conference to announce that “We don't have a strategy on Ukraine yet.” His military advisers tell him that his usual strategy of “bomb a little and see what happens” is not likely to be helpful in this instance.

10. Kiev has surrendered. There are Russian tanks on the Maidan Square. Russian infantry is mopping up the remains of Ukraine's National Guard. A curfew has been announced. The operation to take Kiev resembled “Shock and Awe” in Baghdad: a few loud bangs and then a whimper.

Armed with this list, you too should be able to determine whether or not Russia has invaded Ukraine last Thursday.

Reading comprehension son. **Or** not **and**  

That insinuates that United is not on the same level as these teams, not that these teams are on the same level. Go back to school.

&gt;Make no mistake Liverpool is a shitter team than last season

I find it hilarious that you have the gall to use the term shittier for Liverpool, United have been absolute shit for over a year now. You don't have license to call teams shit.

As I said, the crucial difference with Liverpool than any Liverpool team over the last two decades is depth. United fans should have learned by now that just because you have star players in your team doesn't mean you'll be automatically successful.

How did a team consisiting of Mata, Rooney, De Gea, and RVP work out for you last season? It's the overall quality of the team that matters. Adding more attacking players such as Di Maria and Falcao will end in failure when you have a league two ""quality"" defense and defensive midfield.

&gt;Man United however don't have to deal with League Cup or Europe so they actually have a much better chance of Top 4 in my estimates 

This is the delusion and arrogance I see day in day out from United fans. It's why they're the most hated fans. Not because you were very successful for 20 years it's because you feel entitled to everything. The pure arrogance is incredible.

What have you done on the pitch in the last **year** that makes you think you will get top 4. The truthful answer is nothing. United have been playing worse than the mid-table teams around them. Worse.

By your logic Newcastle have a better chance at top 4, as do Swansea, Sunderland and Burnley. No extra European games for them!

But guess what? All those teams have played far better than United so maybe you should be looking down the table instead of up it.

Your ""estimations"" are laughably off. Have a conversation with me if you ever touch down in reality.

I think another season of mediocrity is needed to humble United supporters.

She was unfortunate enough to preside over three major football-related disasters involving English clubs (Heysel, Bradford, Hillsborough) and small other smaller ones, but only saw it as a way of reining in sport and hooliganism (you can look up her mandatory ID laws). She did ask for the FA to withdraw English teams from international football but UEFA went ahead and banned them before the FA did anything.  
    
Heysel was largely the fault of Liverpool fans involved, on top of the very unfortunate fact that most stadiums in Europe (but particularly England) were in terrible condition and poorly policed on gameday, given the herding policy most forces seemed to use at the time, treating people like cattle and not segregating fans properly.  
  
Liverpool fans I've found to be quite cagey about Heysel - it's understandable to some extent given how much Hillsborough has overshadowed the events of Heysel, but it's worth noting that Liverpool have never officially apologised (as far as I'm aware) but attempted to make amends emphatically when they teams met at Anfield in the UCL several years ago. I think there's a degree of shame, and a lot of mitigating factors. Ultimately, the club need to accept that Heysel is a loss of life on par with any other stadium disaster and accept that its fans did the club a gross disservice and try to help others' grieve for their loss no lesser than their own.    
  
I do think Heysel (and most stadium accidents really) are mostly down to those who run the stadium and manage it on game days. You can't not plan for hooligans or safety (Wooden stands and cigarettes don't mix? Really?) as an event manager - it's sad that hooligans and rulebreakers exist but you can't throw your hands up and say, shit, I wasn't expecting *that*.   
  
This makes Heysel all the more troubling for me - that the people in charge of the event got away scot-free. From a [CNN article on Heysel](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/31/sport/football/football-heysel-hillsborough-juventus-liverpool/index.html):  
  
&gt; UEFA president Jacques Georges and general secretary Hans Bangerter were threatened with imprisonment, before being given conditional discharges.  
&gt;   
&gt; Albert Roosens, the former secretary-general of the Belgian Football Union (BFU) and Johan Mahieu -- who was in charge of policing the stands at Heysel despite having never supervised a football match before -- were given six-month suspended prison sentences for negligence.  
&gt; ""Heysel is the tragedy of the century,"" said Caremani. ""UEFA and Belgian institutions are the guilty ones -- they chose that stadium and it was the worst stadium in Europe for a final of the European Cup.  
&gt;   
&gt; ""UEFA, the Belgian institutions, England and Italy try to forget about it. They don't care about the victims. It is only after Heysel that UEFA took responsibility for stadium safety.""  
&gt;   
&gt; Conti added: ""The Italian state, the Italian Football Federation and Juventus took little interest in the case.""  
  
  
I think Everton fans are pretty bitter about the ban because Everton were the best club in the land at the time and were denied several years of European football due to the ban. There's a lot of ""what ifs"" in there in terms of where they may be today if they had the chance to play in Europe. 

Liverpool have never really apologised (Ian Rush did, and the club used his name to apologise indirectly to visiting Juventus fans) to Juventus, the families of the fans or other English clubs for what happened. Hillborough changed everything but then it didn't really. The fans of some club lost their lives, nobody can be fully blamed for everything, things are better now, this won't happen again - but we need to remember that a thoughtful, heartfelt sorry is something that, as Hillsborough families found out last year when Cameron apologised for the government's systematic failings, can help the sadness feel like the bearable sadness of saying goodbye rather than the unbearable sadness of never letting go.

First he goes:
""The Celts/India should be removed because they're different civilizations mashed into one"", bashing generalization.

Secondly:
""Sweden and Denmark aren't different enough to be considered seperate"", making a huge generalization right there.

Has the blogger forgotten that Sweden and Denmark are the two nations that has waged war against eachother the most throughout human history? That the line of danish-norwegian kings that ruled England (Descendents of Harald Bluetooth and kings of what would be considered the historical viking nation) didn't actually rule Sweden? Denmark and Sweden was only united during the reign of the Kalmar Union of Queen Margareth I, which didn't last long because *Sweden did not want to be under danish rule*. That Gustavus Adolphus, who was absolutely not danish and not a viking, changed gunpowder warfare for decades to come with his military reforms? And did he not conquer a good chunk of the holy roman empire? Napoleon admired him about as much as the romans admired Alexander the Great; totally Sweden is undeserving of being it's own civ, for they never did anything great, and are just another scandie-danish civ. Gosh, to throw Sweden in as another viking civ when it's glory days were under Gustavus Adolphus half a millenium later is just stupid, and Sweden and Denmark have been one nation for about as long as the British Empire and North America.

In short:

1. Sweden and Denmark were not one during the viking ages, and thus a scandinavian viking civ is utterly hilarious and historically inaccurate.

2. Sweden and Denmark have two very different histories that often involve warring against another, and have historically only been part of the same nation during the Kalmar union... after the viking age. In short, a Scandinavian civ would need to be from around that time, with Margareth I as the leader... And then you've kinda thrown the whole viking theme away. Not to mention the Kalmar Union didn't work well.

3. Sweden -definetely- did enough to be recognized as a major european civ (As did Austria, if you ask me: Austro-Hungary was pretty big in it's glory days), and Gustavus Adolphus was an incomparable badass, who inherited a dying country as a boy, and restored it to glory and power within his own lifetime.

Essentially what is needed is a pot farm used to buy potcoin, as a lossmleader if need be. The investment vs roi is a staggering difference any way you slice it if not change jobs. Thats what canacoin is doing thats why the market cap is up,.... quick breakdown for you guys. This coin is now 100% living on you all and your effort. Great idea, by the way to the creator of the coin. Cannacoin seems to be run by people in the game for real that see a place for pot crypto but see it as more than a novelty no offense to the real potheads here,, intended offense to the vampires and puppet masters.


Obviously a fund would be needed. I dont see the guys supposedly running any show funding anything like that, giving shirts to the team seems to be a better use of funds, it would have to be croud sourced. Sooo, go to a croud funding source site like startjoin or another like it. Proffitts above and beond real costs should be publicly listed and used to suppport buy into potcoin at dips as a stabilzation force. Placed and left in the market at intervals in less than seven in amounts no less than 100,000. Avoid big price spike hype and speculation small spikes are nice for all but big swings deter long term lookers amd users unless they actively trade. Stability and volume is the name of the game. For this year. Ok theres my speal. Day 2 adopter made k's trading only it. Currently buying at 878.. as we speak.

Additionally, most of the 'Chinese' population of Hong Kong are themselves not natives -- 本地人 -- but people who fled here after 49. 

For example: 

&gt;Do you feel integrated with the local community? 

What is a 'local community', when a good chunk of Hong Kong are new imports, both 'Chinese' and non? Suppose there were a 30-something ethnically English man who was born and raised in Hong Kong and who remains in contact with his childhood friends, all of whom born and raised in Hong Kong and who hold Hong Kong Permanent Residency. Those friends may include an ethnically half-Filipino, half-Dutch woman who holds British citizenship; an ethnically 'Chinese' (Han) man whose family fled with their fortune from Suzhou to Hong Kong in the 40s who holds Canadian citizenship; an ethnically half-Japanese, half-'Chinese' (Han) man whose parents have lived in Hong Kong since the 60s and who holds Japanese citizenship; a ethnically European mutt of a man who holds American citizenship; an ethnically eighth-'Chinese' (Han) and rest European mutt man whose family has lived in Hong Kong for two generations and who holds Canadian citizenship; an ethnically Pakistani woman whose family has lived in Hong Kong for three generations and who holds Australian citizenship. All can speak at least a bit of Cantonese -- some more fluently than others -- and some studied Mandarin; only a few can read. Their work is all related to Hong Kong. They tend to keep to their local area, and do not really associate with foreign short-term travellers. Are they locals? Is their community 'local'? And if it isn't, whose is? 

What of the Hong Kong-born ethnically Pakistani girl who made headlines last year when her adopted family -- 'Chinese' (Han) Hong Kongers -- tried to help her get a Hong Kong passport? She has lived her entire life in Hong Kong. Cantonese is her first language. She attended all government schools in Cantonese and English. She even has an ethnically 'Chinese' name. Is she 'local'? Is her community? 

I live and work in the New Territories, where Qing-dynasty era customary law can still be in effect. (I also work for a government institution.)  The elderly woman who lives next door, a native to my village, dislikes a 'Chinese' (Han) friend whose moved here from Guangzhou when she was a young girl more than 20 years ago, because she's a 'new arrival'. My friend speaks Cantonese and associates with mostly Hong Kong-born Cantonese and English speakers. She doesn't really associate with those from the mainland or Taiwan, and her Mandarin is atrocious. Who is she in comparison to the Hong Kong-born group I raised above? 

&gt; Do you feel integrated with the local community?

Who is 'local'? 

Who defines 'local'? 

&gt; Are there any other leisure activities that you undertake that can be considered a part of the identity of your home country (i.e. cricket/rugby if you're British)?

HK was a British colony, are those leisure activities adopted by HKers during that period of HK or GB? 

&gt; On a day-to-day basis do you socialize more with locals or the expatriate community?

Who is a 'local', and who is an 'expatriate'? I socialise with a number of Thai and Vietnamese (including part-'Chinese') HKPRs who have lived in Hong Kong for ages. Who are they? 

&gt; Are there any areas of Hong Kong that you would say cater more towards expatriates?

What of those which cater towards non-Chinese long-term residents? 

&gt; Can you tell me a bit about the expatriate community in general, how accommodating are they to new members?

Which 'expatriate community'? 

&gt; Do you frequent cafe and restaurant chains that can be found in your home country more so than local independent ones?

Most Cantonese restaurants would not be out of place in many other nations, for the Cantonese and Fujianese were those who travelled the furthest outside of China. 

&gt; Do you think that there any causes for contention between the expatriate community and local people?

Who are 'expatriates'? Who are 'locals'? Where are the migrant workers and mainland new arrivals in this? 


&gt; Is there a language barrier? If so how hard is it to overcome and communicate?

The Russians raped and pillaged their way across Europe and Asia like a modern golden horde for a variety of reasons.  Armies of mostly youth who had all lost family in the war, as well as criminals let free from the prisons to join the military as the war dragged on, and just about all of them at least half-drunk as a way of coping with the horror and PTSD (a serious issue as the war dragged on, with troops perpetually on the search for alcohol to loot, and many cases of ignorant soldiers poisoning themselves with industrial chemicals).  Many came from impoverished backgrounds and couldn't believe what they saw as they traveled west (some of the anecdotes and letters (those who could write) are quite tragic/humorous in their amazement) and felt justified to loot and pillage - to take what they felt was theirs be it sexual or treasure (of course, *how* they planned to get the larger treasure home often wasn't given much thought).  That they had all grown up with the famines and uncertainty of the 30's in mind is probably worth mentioning.  Most hadn't seen women for years and thought ""I'll probably be dead in a week, fuck it"" or ""Occupation whore/ we just liberated you so reward me"" or ""Everyone else is raping her, peer pressure"" or ""This whore deserves it"" (I'm paraphrasing, but there was some gut-wrenching research done into the rapes committed by the Red Army by a favorite historian of mine).  The use of rape as a tool of subjugation really is quite unsettling.

Of course, the hatred for Germany alone doesn't explain things like Mukden - there we get a lovely batch of racism, revenge for the humiliation of 1905, bloodlust that is so characteristic of their armies, and a complete lack of discipline.... also characteristic of their armies. 

That last part has to be the most unsettling part of the Red Army - there are many times in its history during WW2 where one has to wonder - was the brutality ignored as an extension of calculating state policy, or were their own soldiers so out of control that at times the higher-officials were unwilling to contain them?  Evidence suggests both.  There are many cases where it seems that the military overlooked the treatment of civilians because it served their purpose, yet there's also information that points to numerous efforts to rein in the actions of its soldiers, especially as they neared Berlin.  After spending an entire war working their men into a bloodlust they now suddenly found they had gone a bit too far with it and actually tried to crack down on the drunken violence and looting, often through capital punishment.  During the rape of Berlin there are several curious reports of soldiers threatening or murdering anyone who tried to stop them - including superior officers. 

The Russians raped and pillaged half of Europe because they were angry, because they could, and because they were alive when so many were not.  It's awful, but that's what it was.

La agencia europea que autoriza los aditivos es la [EFSA](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/). La ECHA se encarga de los productos quimicos no alimenticios. Me colé, pero su forma de trabajar es la misma.

Si te informas sobre el Aspartamo, veras que lo que hay es un intento interesado de un grupo de presión para atacar un compuesto seguro.

En Wikipedia tienes un buen resumen de lo ocurrido.

&gt;El aspartamo ha sido declarado seguro para consumo humano por las agencias de más de noventa países y la FDA lo describe como uno de los aditivos más estudiados de la historia y afirma que su seguridad está más que confirmada. Más de 100 organizaciones nacionales e internacionales han evaluado la inocuidad del aspartamo.5 El Comité Conjunto FAO/WHO de Expertos ha establecido un nivel de ingesta diaria admisible (IDA) de 40 mg/kg de peso corporal,6 mientras que la FDA lo establece en 50 mg/kg.7 Existe, sin embargo, polémica entre ciertos sectores, entre los que han surgido numerosas controversias y bulos a su alrededor.[cita requerida]

&gt;Algunos estudios han referido que el consumo masivo de aspartamo aumenta en ratones la sensibilidad a drogas que inducen epilepsia.8

&gt;En 2005, Morando Soffritti, de la **Fundación Ramazzini**, reavivó la polémica sobre lo peligroso del aspartamo. Después de un estudio con 1800 ratas durante ocho años, el equipo de investigadores que él lideró en la ciudad italiana de Bolonia concluyó que el aspartamo podría tener efectos cancerígenos.9 Los estudios de la Fundación Ramazzini fueron evaluados por la Autoridad Europea para la Seguridad Alimentario (EFSA) y por la FDA y fueron desechados por sus numerosos errores metodológicos,10 11 manteniendo que el aspartamo es seguro para el consumo humano.12 Su informe estimó el consumo máximo teórico de aspartamo en los adultos en 21,3 mg/kg de peso corporal por día. Estos valores están de nuevo sujetos a revisión por la misma Comisión (2012), ya que todos los aditivos alimienticios son revisados periódicamente.

&gt; De nuevo en 2010, **Soffritti** y Halldorsson publicaron dos artículos en los que concluían de que el aspartamo era un agente cancerígeno.13 14 La EFSA volvió a evaluar estas investigaciones,15 concluyendo que no hay una relación causal entre el aspartamo y el cáncer (además alega que el diseño experimental fue deficiente). Descartó reconsiderar las evaluaciones de los edulcorantes que ya fueron declarados como seguros y por ello autorizados en la Unión Europea; en esta ocasión tampoco se tuvieron en cuenta los estudios que manifiestan la peligrosidad del aspartamo, al carecer de rigor científico.

&gt; En junio de 2011, el Instituto Ramazzini emitió un comunicado en su web16 en el que se informa que, debido a los resultados obtenidos en sus investigaciones, algunos científicos del Instituto fueron recibidos por varios parlamentarios europeos. A raíz de esto, los parlamentarios han conseguido que la Comisión Europea haya solicitado a la EFSA que comience un nuevo proceso de reevaluación de este compuesto en 2012.17

&gt; En diciembre de 2013, la EFSA publicó un informe en el cual se decía que la actual ingesta diaria admisible para el aspartamo, cifrada en 40 mg/kg al día, no necesita revisión alguna, al considerarse segura para la población en general (incluyendo a los bebés, niños y mujeres embarazadas). Los expertos concluyeron que el aspartamo no daña el cerebro, el sistema nervioso, ni afecta el comportamiento o la función cognitiva en niños o adultos, y descartaron que cause cáncer o daño en los genes.18

Como puedes comprobar, la unica informacion en contra del Aspartamo, proviene de la Fundacion Ramazzini.  Que ha intentado en varias ocasiones colar estudios que muestren que es aspartamo no es seguro. Pero los analisis de estos estudios han demostrado que  contienen errores metodologicos. (Los experimentos se han diseñado intencionadamente erroneos para obtener unos resultados determinados). Por eso los resultados de sus estudios se han desechado. Si te interesa el tema, puedes encontrar en la EFSA, los informes detallados de las revisiones, donde se explican los errores metodologicos que han llevado a desecharlos. 

Pero la Fundacion Ramazzini,  ha seguido presionando, haciendo lobby con los europarlamentarios y ha conseguido que se vuelva a revisar... los resultados han sido los mismos.... Es Seguro.

Es un ejemplo, de como la EFSA esta sometida a presiones y como ha sabido aguntarlas.
La Fundacion Ramazzini sabe perfectamente que no va a poder colarsela a la EFSA. Que en una revision de sus estudios, se verán sus errores y sus engaños. Pero sabe que solo con crear controversia, han ganado. 

¿Y quien son la Fundacion Ramazzini?
Su nombre completo es ""European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences"" un nombre que suena super oficial, serio y riguroso. Pero si buscas informacion sobre ellos te sera dificil encontrar que algo que no tenga que ver con el Aspartamo.
Al parecer su unico cometido es elaborar estudios y hacer lobby en contra del Aspartamo.
¿Como se financia esta fundacion?
Pues a través de donaciones privadas y anonimas.

Pero esto es una guerra perdida, a pesar de todo el royo que te he contado. Apesar de que exista una abrumadora cantidad de informacion que muestra que el Aspartamo es seguro. Y que sea evidente que quien lo relaciona con el cancer lo haga de manera interesada. Seguiras pensando que ""algo habra si existe la controversia"" y que por lo tanto que hay que prohibirlo.
También pensaras que yo debo ser parte interesada o que me debe haber comprado monsanto o el sector de los aditivos, ya que defiendo que es seguro. Pero nunca  se duda de quienes dicen que algo no es seguro.

Resulta muchisimo mas facil fomentar la Quimiofobia que luchar contra ella.
Basta poner en el bote gel de baño :""Libre de Parabenos "", para que la gente considere que los Parabenos son ""malos"". ¿Porque sino pondrían esa etiqueta?
Lo paradójico es que los Parabenos son inocuos... mientras que el Fenoxietanol, (el conservante que sustituye a los parabenos) no lo es tanto.
 
La gente suele pensar que las presiones que reciben las agencias son para que se autoricen productos que no son seguros. Pero la mayor parte de las presiones, son para lo contrario. Buscan atacar productos que son seguros. La razón es que resulta mucho mas fácil. Ya que no necesitas conseguir que la agencia cambie sus conclusiones, basta con que se cree controversia, para que la sociedad de por hecho que es no es seguro.

It seems like the German ruling class has decided to spread German efficiency in Europe not by military force, but by demands of austerity. Because austerity should work. If you have less to spend, you have to spend it more efficient, thus being forced to become more efficient in pretty much everything. It can catalyze long needed reforms etc. That's the theory.

As I am sure you are aware the above are all bastions of separatist sentiment, so you are right not to trust them.

The set-up costs of independence are neither here nor there when considering the prosperity of the country as a whole, because that money is not being sunk into a black hole. *It is being invested back into the country*, taking the form of new jobs and facilities. Exactly what those set-up costs would be is hard to say, but we should get a pretty good idea over the next two and a half years should Scotland vote yes in a little over two weeks. Regardless, it's hard to see how money remaining in Wales could possibly harm the Welsh economy. 

Concerns about EU membership are overblown in Scotland's case and would be in Wales' too. Yes, automatic accession won't happen. Yes, negotiation will be required for entry. Both Scotland and Wales are signed up to a raft of EU conventions on everything from water quality to human rights, as parts of the UK. Both Scotland and Wales are fully functioning democracies which respect the rule of law. Both Scotland and Wales have much to offer as trading partners in the single market. There are no ground upon which an attempt at accession could be blocked, and an inherently expansionist EU is not about to revoke the citizenship of millions of individuals living in either country. Sure, it would take time, and sure, there would be sticking points, but really, the eventual EU membership of Scotland is not in doubt and Wales' wouldn't be either if we were seriously pondering independence. As for the UK's famous negotiating power - I'll happily leave it behind, thanks. A small voice on the world stage pursuing the economic and political interests of Wales is preferable to a big boomy voice that doesn't give a shit.

Now, I know you don't like numbers, but it would perhaps be helpful to avail ourselves of the level of taxation in other countries before declaring that tax haven status is the only way forward for small countries.

 [**Hondt method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hondt%20method): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __D'Hondt method__  (mathematically but not operationally equivalent to __Jefferson's method__) is a [highest averages method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_averages_method) for allocating seats in [party-list proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation). The method described is named after Belgian mathematician [Victor D'Hondt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_D%27Hondt), who described it in 1878. There are two forms: closed list (a party selects the order of election of their candidates) and an open list (voters' choices determine the order).

&gt;Proportional representation systems aim to allocate seats to parties in proportion to the number of votes received. For example, if a party wins one-third of the votes then it should gain one-third of the seats. In general, exact proportionality is not possible because the divisions produce fractional numbers of seats. As a result, several methods, of which the D'Hondt method is one, have been devised which guarantee that the parties' seat allocations are whole numbers that sum to the correct total, while aiming to preserve proportionality as far as is possible.  In comparison with the [Sainte-Laguë method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method), D'Hondt slightly favours large [parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party) and [coalitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_coalition) over scattered small parties. 

&gt;Legislatures using this system include those of [Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil), [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria), [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia), [Cape Verde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile), [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia), [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia), [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic), [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark), [East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor), [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador), [Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland), [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary), [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland), [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg), [Republic of Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia), [Republic of Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Moldova), [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro), the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands), [Paraguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay), [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland), [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia), [Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), [Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay) and [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales).

&gt;The system has also been used for the 'top-up' seats in the [London Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Assembly); in some countries during elections to the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament); and during the [1997 Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Constitution_of_Thailand)-era for allocating party-list parliamentary seats in [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand).  A modified form was used for elections in the [Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory_Legislative_Assembly) but abandoned in favour of the [Hare-Clark system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare-Clark_system). The system is also used in practice for the allocation between political groups of a large number of posts (Vice Presidents, committee chairmen and vice-chairmen, delegation chairmen and vice-chairmen) in the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament) and for the allocation of ministers in the [Northern Ireland Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly).

Our advancements in medicine came through the help of the islamic world, mainly through the crusades and the fall of Constantinople. Islamic countries were the first to heave modern hospitals which were far better than the Askelpios' that were found in the Greek and Roman world which were focused more on superstition than medical science. (Admittedly these were different ages, however after the collapse of the roman empire and the advancement of the dark ages, Europe fell into disrepair and it was just the works of Galen that were practiced.)

During the dark ages and medieval period, the church controlled much of the medical world within Europe, with anyone whose ideas dissagreed with Galen were banned. It took a further 500 years until the Renaissance for the western world to create ligatures (Ambrose Pare), which had been found in the islamic countries much before. 

The fall of Constantinople meant that scholars fled to Europe and so much knowledge was brought alongside, including ""The Canon of Medicine"" by Aviccenna, who I feel that you wrongly do not give enough credit too. Islamic countries also had the idea of infection much before western civilisation, which can be seen in how hospitals were positioned.

Meat was hung around Islamic cities, and depending on how long the meat to to rot, depended on whether a hospital was positioned there. This idea was not known in medieval Britain, where years later people were still contracting diseases from cesspits, as well as the much later cholera outbreak which was determined to be caused by bacteria by Dr John Snow in the 1800's. I hold islamic medicine in high regard when considering that western cultures were too busy destroying what we had and plunging ourselves into the dark ages, where as medical knowledge pioneered in other parts of the world.

China doesn't see any point in sending more fleets across the Pacific, but they do invade and conquer Japan, and some Japanese refugees flee across the Pacific.

&gt;And--this is by far the most important--Germany is becoming more European every day now because the majority of immigration is European, mostly east- and south-European.

So? The exact same thing is true (and always has been) for Belgium. See ref.2, (p12 for a nice graph if you don't speak dutch), &gt;50% of our immigration is of EU (EU15 or ""new EU/east EU"") origin, only ~15% is of African (including marocco) descent.

The AM1 class is nifty for low-powered things. First off, avoid ZFS in these minor NAS boxes. It'll up the requirements for CPU and RAM where the cost/benefit doesn't add up. You'll need at least 1GB RAM per TB for that, as well as something like a i3/i5, depending on your system.

I use UFS for my home storage, and you'll probably be just fine with that. ZFS is for more industrial usage. Also consider NAS4Free as opposed to FreeNAS, as that is more directed towards home users.

Note that the AM1H-ITX board is a bit pricier than other AM1-boards, but it has the advantage that it can be run off a normal power brick, with an extension available to power the HDDs. This makes the machine pretty much noiseless (some HDD noise should be expected), and very easy on the power bill.

WD Purple drives are tailored for 24/7 Surveillance camera, but they're cheaper than the WD Red which are normally suggested for NAS.

It's not a question of race, but of ideals, values and visions for the world (those of democracy, human rights, human equality, the rule of law) in the 21st century.  You mention Asia : Many Asian regions, much like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, arguably the Philippines espouse these paradigms as well. 

The conflict in Ukraine has become quite clear that a large chunk of the Russian population either doesn't care for those values or simply doesn't share them at present times. Rather, an authoritarian strong man is allowed to reign unimpeded and at the cost of important democratic and human rights pillars. These are not European values but those of another civilization. From a pure relativist perspective, there isn't necessary anything wrong with accepting that Russia is not European (Although I wish it were). 

&gt;am really going to love it when the currently-forged Sino-Russian alliance will finally wipe the arrogant smirk of perceived superiority off your fat, inbred, eurofag faces and put an end to your wretched ""Western"" civilization, which has been nothing but a bane on this world for way too long, once and for all.

Will this be *before* or *after* China tries to claim Manchuria back ? 

&gt;Savage as I might be, I am not talking wiping you out as a peoples, but about breaking your racist hegemony and making you irrelevant.

Considering that History has shown as that more and more peoples of the world are aspiring to those democratic ideals seen in Europe and North America in trying to rid themselves of those peddled by corrupt authoritarian strong men, I doubt the world will lead in the way you predict it to lead. I think China and Russia will themselves want to democratize, and its not a question of if, but of when.

As far as I know, many people in reddit have their own definition for the word gypsy. If in your world gypsy means 'criminal thug' then of course it's not racist to call a gipsy a criminal thug. But in the real world, gypsy is an ethnic group - roma.

I'm a gypsy. In my country it was legal to hang gypsies up until about 1900. During ww2 my grandfathers were suddenly perfectly equal citizens and were drafted to fight in the war. After the war, fuck equality, many gypsy children were taken by force by the state.

In 1970's the best social program in the world ensued, which offered gypsies with housing. I got to be raised in a safe environment with no criminal record. So the situation in my country has been probably one of the best for gypsies, yet I have similar feelings towards the police as I imagine american blacks have, for same reasons.

The situation in eastern and southern europe has been much much worse for gypsies, so imagine the distrust they must have for the authority does not go away any soon. That plus living in a slum is the biggest reason many of them are criminal. Not some gene in our blood.

FYI: Michael Caine didn't stop being a gypsy when he moved out from a slum.

As another poster said, the first charge is almost laughably mild compared to similar things that have been in the news which include anti-Palestinian incitement and faced no legal challenge. 

Just before this last war, there was lots of racism against Arabs from Israelis on Facebook, but nobody got arrested for incitement.
      
""Two girls took a picture as they held a sign saying, “Hating Arabs is not racism, it’s values.” Others posted messages threatening Arab members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.""
http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2014/0702/Why-36-000-Israelis-joined-Facebook-campaign-calling-for-revenge-video

""Photographs have even emerged of pro-war protestors dressed in t-shirts with “Good Night Left Side” prints, a slogan usually used by European neo-Nazis. Violence from these groups has reached unprecedented levels. Last week in Haifa, a city usually presented as a model of liberal co-existence, an anti-war rally was attacked by 700 people carrying weapons"", and all this incitement, predictably, did lead to racist violence. 
""The worst is reserved for Palestinians. Four weeks ago in East Jerusalem, a group of Israeli men, acting in revenge, poured gasoline down the throat of Mohammed Abu Khdeir and burned him alive."" 
http://www.vice.com/read/israeli-racism-gaza-kleinfeld-511 
And intifadas have featured violence in the past, and at other times have been nonviolent civil disobedience campaigns. They don't have to be violent in themselves.      
     
So, the other reason they give is more interesting, and in context is probably the real reason this guy was arrested. He was an activist with the BDS movement, which uses grassroots boycotts, divestments and eventually sanctions to isolate Israel diplomatically and in public opinion. They hope to pressure Israel's government to end the occupation, allow refugees to return and stop discriminating against Arab Israelis.
http://www.bdsmovement.net
    
However, Israel passed a law making it illegal to advocate a boycott of the country. As the article notes, other people have already been arrested for this, mostly Arab citizens of Israel, who are legally and socially discriminated against and thus more easily arrested. This case is unusual more because it happened inside the West Bank.

&gt;[Historical] The road to the Second World War

&gt;[Image](http://warthunder.com/upload/image/! 2014 NEWS/September/ww2start/news_september_1_logo_com.jpg)

&gt;[1280x1024](/upload/image/!%202014%20NEWS/September/ww2start/september_1_1280x1024_logo_com.jpg) | [1920x1080](/upload/image/!%202014%20NEWS/September/ww2start/september_1_1920x1080_logo_com.jpg)

&gt;Whilst on paper, the 11th of November 1918 brought peace to Europe by formally declaring an end to ‘The Great War’, the greatest conflict in the history of mankind was yet to come, with aggression still smouldering over the horizon.

&gt;[Image](http://warthunder.com/upload/image/! 2014 NEWS/September/ww2start/640px-William_Orpen_-_The_Signing_of_Peace_in_the_Hall_of_Mirrors,_Versailles.jpg)

&gt;[**The 'Treaty of Versailles' is signed, June 28th, 1919** ](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)

&gt;The former Central Powers collapsed, with the German Emperor yielding to two revolutions proclaiming a democratic Germany and the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires being dissolved. The former Tsarist Russia finalized it’s transformation into the Soviet Union and new nations emerged from the political ruins of old Europe, with countless kilometers of territory changing its owner. Europe looked different now, and while many people were happy that the war was finally over, revanchism grew in many others, laying the foundations for the political instability over the following years.

&gt;The young democracy in Germany was shaken by the violent misbelief of the so-called “Stab-in-the-back” myth, claiming civilians - especially republicans - stabbed the undefeated German army in the back by accepting a peace serving only their own cause. Italy saw the birth of modern Fascism, dreaming about a Roman Empire of the old days and feeling betrayed by their former allies Great Britain and France for the territorial claims they laid on their defeated neighbor. The French Republic itself, after having endured most of the fighting of the war on its own territory, received back the old territories of Alsace-Lorraine, but was unable to press any permanent claims further up the river Rhine.

&gt;[Image](http://warthunder.com/upload/image/! 2014 NEWS/September/ww2start/austria.jpg)

&gt;**In the so-called 'Anschluss' the German Reich

&gt;annexed the Republic of Austria, 1938.** 

&gt;The ‘Treaty of Versailles’, signed on the 28th of June, 1919, between the victorious powers and Germany was created to guarantee a lasting peace in Europe. Many officials of the victors regarded the treaty as incapable of doing so, and upon inspecting the document the French Marshal Foch said in a remarkably accurate quote: *“This is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years.”* 

&gt;In Germany, the treaty was fuel to the flames of revanchism and eventually in 1933, the first democratic Germany fell into the hands of the National Socialists and Adolf Hitler. Disregarding the “Slave Treaty” of Versailles, Hitler ordered the rearmament of Germany by creating the Wehrmacht and annexed Austria first, then the Czechoslovakian Sudetenland and eventually the entirety of Czechia.

&gt;The Empire of Great Britain, which was brought to the zenith of its power by the end of the ‘Great War’, followed a strict policy of ‘Appeasement’, trying to avoid another war at all costs. Hitler, now under the belief that the western powers were too weak to offer any opposition, had soon after laid his eyes on Poland, demanding the annexation of the Free City of Danzig and other political concessions. And although France and Great Britain guaranteed the integrity of the Polish borders, Hitler demanded that a Polish representative with power should finally settle the Danzig question, calculating the reaction of the Polish government. As expected, this move was met with fierce resistance and the ultimatum lapsed.

&gt;[Image](http://warthunder.com/upload/image/! 2014 NEWS/September/ww2start/sleswig_firing.jpg)

&gt;**The KMS Schleswig-Holstein, firing the first shots

&gt;of the Second World War near Gdańsk (Danzig)** 

&gt;On the 31st of August, 1939, German agents received a phone call, saying ‘Großmutter ist gestorben’ - ‘Grandmother has died’. Disguised as Polish irregulars, the Germans attacked the Gleiwitz radio station in an operation called ‘Unternehmen Tannenberg’, a false-flag operation to blame the start of hostilities on Poland. Soon after, the German radio brought news to almost every German household, claiming countless border violations by armed Polish personnel, albeit the desperate German attempts for a peaceful solution. *“This time we will not do the error of 1914. Everything now depends on blaming the other side”* , recalls Albert Speer the words of Hitler, who proclaimed on the 1st of September, 1939, as a conclusion to his pre-war propaganda: *“Since 05:45 we are shooting back.”* 

&gt;On the 3rd of September 1939, France and Great Britain honoured their alliance with Poland and declared war on Germany, much to the disbelief of Hitler, who again counted on their unwillingness to wage war. For the following, almost six years, Europe again would be plunged into the abyss of another ‘Great War’, the greatest mankind ever had to endure.

What...? you are defining population as two entirely different things to support your point... Why is america as a whole a population made up of various races. Meanwhile PNG and the Central African countries are a political entity made up of different discrete populations? If so then you cant take the American population as a whole, but must instead look at both by the same parameters. That is what it is done to measure diversity. Why do you think Canada has such a higher index of diversity in comparison to America. That is because its population is made up of different ethnicities within the same political boundaries. 

In America you have the opposite. Yaaa there are states with a high percentage of diversity such as New York, California, Florida, etc. However, you also have many states where the majority of the population are all American citizens, english speaking, born and raised in the states, etc. What you consider race are the heritages of people or their skin colour; that is not necessarily race. Any anthropologist with tell you that skin colour has nothing to do with race. Similarly, just because someone has European, latin american, middle eastern, african, or asian ancestry does not make them, ethnically speaking, part of those cultures. For many who have spent several generations retired from their place of ancestry their costumes will be seen as Americans and not as part of a different ethnicity (in comparison to Canada where immigrant populations are still new and spread across the country so you see more people belonging to actual different ethnicities inhabiting the same physical landscape). This is why America has a lower diversity index in comparison to an African nation made up of different tribes. There, the communities have different customs, beliefs, and languages; this is why they are actually considered different races. 

If you wanted America to be more ethnically diverse then you would need more immigrants speaking more languages, carrying different customs and religions, etc. However, you have been complaining about how illegal immigrants fail to assimilate to the American culture. So even in your own statement you refute the idea that America is a mosaic of multiculturalism (note: as stated before, the levels of multiculturalism and religion vary depending on where you live in the country. However, when taking as a whole, America has a more homogeneous image of race as opposed to other countries where variations is more equally distributed leading to a higher index of ethnic diversity).",t3_2f4wev,JusticePorn,t1_ck672ij,2,1427256836

I am talking about the fact that every single American is a recent to a almost-recent immigrant but the US has one of the most restrictive immigration systems in the world. This sort of irony. I know it's an old joke but ask an Indian about their opinions on immigration....

As for the UK it's a bit different. The ""xenophobia"" you talk about comes mostly from the working class.The rest of the country more or less got over it and just feels unease when dealing with Islamic migrants simply because they are the most different ones. As for the principles behind it... well... Britain like most countries in Europe have an established culture which is not as flexible and immature (not settled) as American culture. When immigrants come to Europe they come into an old  rigid framework that was not built by anyone generations away from any notion of settlement. It's different from Americans who can claim something similar only in the oldest places - Boston, NYC, Philly but then again they were bombarded by migrants ever since. The US never grew in absence of immigration. Europe had a couple of centuries where it was culturally irrelevant.  It's not xenophobia as much as uncomfortable reaction to a culture shock. Notice that the ""xenophobia"" is different when the migrant is from Europe, Australia or America. It gets dialed up to 11 when it's someone from Muslim countries. 

&gt;You (in the UK) have been sold a pack of lies that says it's all the immigrants' fault and not the systematic failure of the government to provide for and protect all people within its borders.

You have surprising issues with the English language for an American. Read again what I wrote.

&gt;But what about the teachers who reported nothing? Surely that is a failure of professional responsibility with very little to do with race or immigration.

See... I'm thinking now you have a warped view of social problems in America to begin with. It has everything to do with race and immigration - not as a cause - but as the way in which a society responds. The problem was that ""race and immigration"" are such a big deal politically that people are willing to shut up rather than risk problems. It is political correctness at work here. It's like Sweden whitewashing ethnicity in pictures so as to avoid accusations of racism.Howver *everybody* knows that when you see a white silhouette it's a black or brown dude.  I am guessing I am more comfortable with calling out the bullshit here because I grew up in a mono-ethnic country without a  colonial past so we never had to deal with ""white guilt"" and all the relevant guilt by association bullshit.

If you want to say that the way race is treated in UK (and in America too) is a systemic problem then sure. It is a failure because the response to racism in the UK is anti-racism - a selective blindness. They're not addressing prejudice, they're replacing one prejudice with another.

You have to be seriously naive to defend that.

&gt; Advocacy Journalism is a genre of journalism that intentionally adopts a non-​objective point of view, usually for a political or social purpose. Advocacy journalists have an opinion about the stories they are writing which can be shown discretly through the use of tone or on a larger scale such as the facts and opinions stated. However, due to the fact that advocacy journalism is still fact-​based, it cannot be considered propaganda.

&gt;Traditionally, there is a belief that all news reports should be objective and unbiased (the approach mostly used in the USA). However, most advocacy journalist believe that true objectivity is impossible. They claim that no matter how objective someone claims to be, there will always be some form of implicit bias whether political or personal, intentional or subconcious. They also claim that even if a report seems unbias, the presence of corporate sponsors in advertising can reveal the lack of objectivity. Advocacy journalists feel that public interest is better served when people have diversity in their media outlets and a variety of viewpoints to choose from.

&gt;Media in many Western European countries have traditionally focused on advocacy journalism in favor of one political party or another. This type of journalism is more common in countries where strong and unified political parties have existed for centuries versus other European countries that were ruled by dictatorships or repressive governments that suppressed views that differed from the ruling party.

Additionally not every country has secure passport system. 

The passport system in Western countries works because every birth, every marriage and death is officially recorded. This is not true for small villages in the third world countries. If there is no official record of birth, it is easy to go to the capital of a country and claim ""I was born in 1985 in village X in country Y."" The officials have no way of checking that your claims are actually true. Additionally they often don't care if the bribe is large enough.  

In many African countries you can therefore buy a new passport and a new identity for 50 USD. 

Imagine a guy from Benin who lives close to the border with Nigeria. He has committed a serious crime in France. He gets deported and is banned from travelling to France ever again. He goes to Lagos in Nigeria, claims to be from Nigeria, gets a Nigerian passport with a new name and is now free to go back to the EU, say Belgium or Germany. Unless he gets stopped by the police and has his fingerprints taken and his old french record pops up with a photo, there is no way to link him to his previous identity.

Happens very frequently and it is a big problem for immigration officials. Moreover it is usually the people you most definitely don't want in your country who are abusing the system like that.

Israel was not Asian or Indian, and, of course, not Islamic. The popularization of stabbed marriages in the middle east is not an ancient one. It's relatively recent, being tremendously popular in very conservative Islamic movements.

I'm sorry, but the belief that romance is new to marriage is just ridiculous. The current view of romance didn't even exist as a concept until the Romantic era of literature in the 19^th century.

People didn't live very long for the vast majority of human history. That being true, most people couldn't wait around for a soul mate. Love wasn't a feeling you were suddenly overwhelmed by, it was something that grew out of interactions with people.

Courtship was the standard practice of the day during the old testament. A woman would live with a man without having sex (well they weren't supposed to) for a few months, and if they liked each other they would get married.

That's how it worked.

Arranged marriages (parents deciding for their kids without input from the kids) were not the norm in any way.

As such, marriages were not just about creating families of wealth and influence. That view comes from looking at the last 500 years of European history and the traditions of Asia and India and extrapolating backwards.

As for homosexuals, they were stoned to death for the same reason disobedient children were stoned to death: for being open and defiant.

The death sentence was only reserved for those who were deemed stubbornly sinful, but those who repented (even if only publicly) were not killed.

Being gay was deemed ""unclean"", just like the rule that says women on their period weren't allowed in the temple, or even out in the street. If a woman was on her period and caught in the temple, she was stoned.

That's how purity laws worked.

If something was dirty, anyone caught being defiantly unclean was killed. So YES, just being icky was enough to get you dead. 

As to why it's anti-Semitic, the people who loved to point out the strict laws of the Torah without mentioning how they were enforced, were Nazi's, fascists, and other openly racist European philosophers.

So, when bringing up the old testament's strictest rules, realize you're walking a fine line. You can very easily stumble into arguments with a very terrible history.

 It's easy to point at the rule and rail on their apparent ridiculousness, but understand that these were laws. They had jurisprudence behind them. Just because it said ""death"" didn't mean everyone caught doing them died. Only that death was an acceptable upper bounds of punishment.

If you want to look at the reasoning behind laws, the economics is just one lens. You can't use one lens and decide it's the only one the people who lived in that time viewed it from. We don't do that now with our laws. They didn't do it then.",t3_2f2u62,AskReddit,t1_ck675fd,1,1427256798

That's painting with a pretty broad brush. I lived in south east Germany for a few years, and that doesn't ring true to me. I've known plenty of Germans who were very much into nude people... exceedingly into nude people.

As a matter of fact, [Germany occupies the number two slot for most youporn visits in 2012](http://visual.ly/youporn-2012-big-numbers-hard-facts) with approximately 1/2 the visits... [we outnumber them 4:1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population#Countries).

1. 'rights' are not a gender thing. they are a power and money thing. If you have money and power, regardless of your gender, you get away with anything. even murder. In lots of these countries, the problem is not a men's or women's right problem but more of a corrupt justice system problem

2. Tribes, sects, etc play a huge role in everything and honor, which leads to many men killing their sisters, daughters, wives etc, is a real thing that has gone on for ages in both old and current Afghanistan. It just isn't highlighted as much.

When war came to Afghanistan, the rich and powerful had the means to flee to USA and European countries, taking their modern ways with them. That left the people who you see today in charge of things. They are religious people but religion is an excellent tool to use in both politics and war. It was used freely and the masses who are mostly illiterate and rely on a single person per village to read to them and write everyday letters trust religious clerics who can preach what they want. 


This isn't simple about a country doing a 180 on women's rights. Men suffered just as much if not more. They were killed, wounded and left unable to support families which is the death of any honorable Afghan man in itself. They say their children die or be tortured. Women were raped, yes but no one talks about the TTP's preference to rape young boys. 

In short, this isn't about a country changing how it treats women. It's about people deciding who does and who doesn't deserve to be treated as a human.

No. While this was a major intelligence failure on the part of the U.S. and many European countries, all the countries involved thought the others had independent verification from other countries.

rUK will bring their A-game and won't be looking out for anyone other than those choosing to remain in the UK - i.e. the UK electorate.

No way on earth would rUK simply 'give Scotland' historical oil revenues.

So many lies and falsehoods from Yes campaigners.  Sure independence is possible, but come on, real-politik will win the day.  Scotland is small country with low population.  No amount of 'too wee too poor blah blah blah don't tell me what to do, so pessimistic, so depressing' will change the reality.  Just as rUK doesn't have anything near the influence of Russia let alone the USA; Scotland too will be arguing from the position of an obscure tiny nation on the fringes of Europe.

If Independence goes ahead, Scotland will be a viable state.  It will be ok.  Quality of life likely broadly the same as rUK.  There will be an initial dip due to events such as the  brain drain beginning as research money stops hitting universities, and the financial services industry re-locates to rUK or Ireland.

But once this is dealt with and the economy has some chance to recover, Scotland will be ok.  But it's certainly not _desirable_ to be independent.  It won't 'fix' poverty or provide huge income streams from oil wealth.",t3_2f5or7,Scotland,t1_ck67e17,4,1427256687

This is not a new story and it isn't some experience specific to Latin American immigrants. This is the story of emigration and immigration for centuries. If you only wish to discuss the root causes of the Latin American immigration issue, let's do that. 

Native people are pushed to the side by an influx of European settlers and the slaves they bring with them. Over several generations a class system throughout nearly all of Latin America is born based on religion, heredity (due to inter-racial offspring), and political favor. As economies around the world grow, exploitation of a broken Latin  America takes place and false promises are offered. Churches and other world states back leaders that only serve their purposes, namely the Catholic Church and the US. Latin American people, in almost every country, are persecuted by their governments during times of unrest.

http://www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/other-health-conditions/eye/plain-language/our-review

&gt; Professors Fred Hollows and Hugh Taylor have found Aborigines in Western Australia, whose average vision is 6/1.5 ! This means that they can see at six metres what the average person can see at only 1.5 metres.

http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/trek/4wd/tinykids.htm

&gt;As a group, the Aborigines have significantly better visual acuity than the Europeans. This was true for both monocular and binocular vision. Some Aborigines have acuities below the previous postulated threshold levels. Aborigines as a group also have the previous postulated threshold levels. Aborigines as a group also have less myopia--in particular, less high myopia--and less astigmatism than Europeans.

With the massive arsenals every nation had, and the entangled web of alliances they had woven, all it took was for one small domino to fall and the entire continent would fall to shit. Just because it was Germany's ally doesn't mean it was there fault when every nation was setup like this. How else did a small conflict balloon into a World War after all?

The Treaty of Versailles made Germany a poor, destitute shell of a nation with neither pride nor the ability to feed itself. It was disgusting. It was a tragedy. It was the winners taking advantage of the losers without concern for its future impact. 

Germany started the Second World War. The First World War was an inevitability, not at all started by Germany. They protected their allies. Then the allies of those nations declared war on Germany and one by one the dominos fell and poof... suddenly a small conflict became World War One. 

No other nation killed six million Jews, sure. But no other nation was burning its money for fire at the time. Throughout history the worst people have risen from the most hopeless and destitute of circumstances. All of Europe hated the Jews. The German people were in the most dire of circumstances so their solutions to their problems were the most extreme. It sucks, but people don't think straight when they are starving.

2. Russia expects energy sanctions and is prepared for them.

To take a concrete example, the country where I live has a rather well-developed and extensive transport network (even by EU standards). Nevertheless, the network is insufficient to handle the transit needs, such as they are. A recent report by the American Chamber of Commerce estimated that traffic jams and train delays around the capital are so bad that they actually cost 2% of the country's GDP. 

Given that the capital is certainly going to be growing in size over the next decade, it would be reasonable to suppose that a series of transit, rail, and road expansions would break even if they manage to resolve the problem at the cost of 1% of GDP (given local tax rates). If they manage to wholly resolve the issue at less cost than that, then the ROI of the entire project would be positive. Based on that sort of thinking, the rail network has spent the past few years laying down more lines of track, while the capital's transit authority has begun expanding its tram network, with new metro stations also in future plans. 

Now....when you read about the US, you often read about how traffic is much, much worse than it is here, meaning that similar sorts of calculation should be rather straightforward, and most major cities in the US probably have such studies sitting on the shelf.

""The economic playbook is surprisingly clear, surprisingly straightforward, in the short term especially. The robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two, so the classic Econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine: Encourage entrepreneurship, double down on infrastructure, and make sure we're turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills.""

""But over the longer term, if we are moving into an economy that's heavy on technology and light on labor,and we are, then we have to consider some more radical interventions, for example, something like a guaranteed minimum income. Now, that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable,because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth. I did a little bit of research on this notion, and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists Friedrich Hayek, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman. And if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent, you might be interested to know that social mobility, one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States, is now lower than it is in the northern European countries that have these very generous social safety nets.

Stvar je vrlo jednostavna, u Istri živi mnogo pripadnika manjina, Muslimana, Slovenaca, Talijana, Srba, Roma, samim time je i logično da će glasati za neku od ljevih opcija, pa su i manje religiozni.

**Rules**

* We do not like quitters! When you seem to lose, play until you are completely gone, there is always room for a comeback in Multiplayer! If you can't lose a war, please don't join! If a player is completely gone he is allowed to rejoin and pick any free country he wants. Rejoining happens when the host is fine with it (end of youtube episode)!

* Flaming+Trolling+Insulting+Selfkilling = Kick+Ban from future games (Blacklist!)

* If a player is away for one day and could not find a sub (I will search two!) no one is allowed to attack nor to get out anything from him in a defensive war - that also includes vassals and unions under the player! This only becomes law if the player itself or one of the others let's ME know that he/she can not show up. If you miss without letting me know - you are free to be attacked!

* If you feel you have been severely mistreated by another player, contact ME discreetly.

* If you cannot get a good connection to Europe and/or you have other technical issues that causes you to constantly crash, lag behind etc, please do not sign up. We use speed 1+2. If we notice that you're consistently desynching the game you will be forced to leave. Temporary issues do not apply of course.

* Strictly NO pausing, unless you are on the losing side of a vs. AI war and need to negotiate peace before they cap more provinces. Real Kings didn't get to halt time, and neither will we, for the sake of getting more than 22 years in per session!

* If you crash or come late there are 2 rehost times where you can rejoin: 20:00 pm and 21:00 pm

* Ranking pickorder at the end of the game! The higher you get ranked the later you pick in the new season. But your picks are still favoured over newcomers or those who got utterly destroyed before the gamed ended.

* **I keep the right for myself to kick anyone who I feel is not suitable for our group of EU 4 players!**

1. reduce the US's influence ( things that make it look bad like NSA spying on Germany helps)

2. get western europe to agree or just not get involved ( ie germany not agreeing with having nato bases in the east is a sign of that) just build ties with putinists, appeasers, all the useful idiots that see Russia as an alternative.

3. get politicians and media on his side. The media is highly biased so if you get the politicians ( by bribe and blackmail which can't be hard here) then you get the media too. Looks like it's already working in some countries.

For sure, but hopefully you got a taste of the dark side of the force...

&gt;*So I'd say the HoC needs to reform AND the EU needs to too, whether we stay or not.*

But bear in mind you can have your cake (Reform) but not eat it atst (EU) because one direction the EU is moving is Centralism and the other direction of UK Reform is Localism:-

&gt;*""and never the twain shall meet""*

Here's the conundrum, Cameron wants ""reform"" in the EU. If you understand the Treaty Structure, it's like spaghetti tying different nations together that creates a heavy-soggy ball that's going sink like a stone. IE the Treaty Structure is deeply flawed so the way to reform is to leave the EU Political Union. This is backed up with the intractable EZ Crisis; which the UK is not going to join whereas the EU has to save the EZ to save itself which is antagonistic to where the UK wants to go as a non-EURO member: ""Rowing in different directions"".

&gt;*even if only because I view it as inevitable (""it's gonna happen, it's the least bad option for the future, we should get on an lead it"" pretty much sums me up*
