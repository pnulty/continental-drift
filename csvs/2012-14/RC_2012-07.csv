Loyalty was great in the 60's - 80's when the economy was booming and the people's long hours were paying off. Families were rewarded with great prosperity. However, those long hours took a toll on Japanese families and created the present familial culture: wife stays home and focuses all her energy on the children while the husband puts all his energy into work to provide for them. You now have a group of amai people who no longer want to work full-time and a growing number who don't even want to get married. It's also created a rise in divorce amongst the retired generation as women who never saw their husbands are suddenly faced with having to spend an entire day with them. Japanese culture is changing, but the traditions aren't which is leading to problems.

Japanese business traditions have taken their toll on the country. Suicide rates have escalated as well as mental health and stress related diseases. Lifetime employment is no longer the norm, high salaries aren't the norm and companies are faced with trying compete against an increasing pool of global competition. Doing the same thing over and over expecting better results isn't tradition, it's insanity.

Japanese economy has been stagnant for almost 20 years and is quickly getting passed by China and possibly India. The population is aging faster than it is being replaced. The fact that they have [a clock](http://mega.econ.tohoku.ac.jp/Children/) that basically counts down the days until the culture because extinct would tell anyone that something has to change. Strenuous work circumstances may have helped the country for the first 20 - 30 years, but it no longer seems to be working for Japan. 

It has nothing to do with whether or not they're better off than China or the US, and everything to do with whether or not they are doing what it takes to adequately care for their own people. I love living in this country and it would be devastating to see it go the way of the US or Europe for the sheer fact that people in charge stubbornly cling to traditions that no longer serve their purpose and the rest of the population can do no more than say,""shoganai.""

The coffeeshops are a must. I went to Barney's and Abraxas. Barney's SUCKED. We had just gotten off of the plane, so no lighter, and they charged us 3 euros for one. Anyway, we bought a gram for 16 bucks, then they had no pieces to smoke out of. Bring your own cheap dollar store type pipe if you cannot roll (like myself). Plus if you are mediocre, the europeans laugh at you. They never visited the table, not even once. Also, NO PICTURES ALLOWED.

Abraxas was AMAZING. I bought three pre rolled joints, and a hot chocolate (which I did not know had weed in it). I went upstairs and chilled for about an hour. Someone checked my table every fifteen minutes to see if I needed anything. Then on my way out I bought 2 space cakes and was on my way.
I did the canal tour, skip it. Boring as fuck. Hit up the Anne Frank house instead. Something I wish I would have done.

The VAT rate in the EU varies from between 15% and 27%, which is a 12% variance.  In the US, sales tax varies from 0% to 13%, so the variance is only slightly larger than the EU.

But more importantly, in the EU, VAT varies only by country (correct me if I'm wrong about that), whereas sales tax in the US is generally a combination of state and local taxes, so there are about as many different tax rates as there are *cities* in the US.

For example before the financial crisis when oil prices where high and the growth of the EU was slower than the US. Sarkozy tried to pressure the ECB to focus more on growth rather than inflation. The Germans immediately shot him down. At the same time Sarkozy (oh god how I hated him) tried to create a Mediterranean Union that uses EU money and facilities but would only have members that border the mediterranean. That way France would have it's own little club of nations that it could influence and using money from the UK and Germany without having them part of it. Germany shot him down again.

i bought my copy from the website, and it is in russian, so you' have to convert it to english by downloading the files.And premium is also on sale here, but only for 3 dollars less.

edit: I forgot i saved this to my reddits.

http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/ukhkz/english_files_for_the_russion_version_of_bf3/

that's all the files you need for the conversion from russian to english, please use this as this was from the last major patch in beginning of june (around the same time as E3).
the thing about having the russian version is that every time they have a patch, you will need to find someone with the standard NA or EU version of the game with the correct language files.

You want to look for these 3 files.

If you are sniping from wayy too far back you are usually a detriment to the team unless you are using a tank specifically designed for sniping (some german/french tanks, most TDs). Generally speaking you want to engage  under 400m unless there is nothing else on the field to shoot at. I don't recall if by default it shows the distance to target when you put your crosshair over them but if it doesn't and you aren't using any sight mods might I recommend [J1mb0's Crosshair Mod](http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/56831-074-j1mb0s-crosshair-mod/)? It will give you the distance to the target you are looking at, reload times, and the angle your turret is facing relative to your hull at the bottom. And if you play arty it gives even more info such as shell travel time and a visual representation of the cone in which you can move your gun. You would be surprised at how much having that info helps your game as WoT is largely a game of numbers. For any other mods if you do get into modding your client (which i highly recommend since it's one of the best features of this game) look on [mirtankov.com](http://mirtankov.com/) for skins, mods, and other goodies.

P.S. Since i didn't know where else to put this I wanted to add that you should always try to get your circle to fill as much of the tank as possible. Doing so not only gives you the best chance to hit your target but also is useful for determining what ranges you should be using your tank at. Shells can land anywhere within the circle but have a roughly 67% chance of landing in the inner most half of the circle and rather often (maybe 20-30% if i had to guess) will land directly in the center of it.

[We have such a ridiculously high GDP, the only ""country"" to bet us is the entire EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29), and the entire EU is a much larger mass of people, with about [130.5 million more people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), so basically we have the premier level of GDP.

Also most of our debt (around 73%) is owned by the US public, in stock bonds, etc. So we can continue to add debt, and foreign buyers will continue to buy it, because they know that we can at any time pay off most of our foreign debt in about 10 years.

And then finally, it's because we are the US. We are the most trusted nation when it comes to finances, and we are the global glue that holds the global market together. If we can't sell our debt and we have to cut a huge chunk out of our spending, we will cut out GDP by so much that China will see such a drop in their currency that they will go in a recession, and the ripple waves from that will kill the EU and GB.

Nope:

&gt; In July 1999, after three years of mounting tensions between the group and the government, the Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership initiated a nationwide crackdown and multifaceted propaganda campaign intended to eradicate the practice. In October 1999 it declared Falun Gong a ""heretical organization"" and began banning Internet access to websites that mention Falun Gong.

From the [main wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong):

&gt; Foreign observers estimate that since 1999, hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in ""re-education through labor"" camps, prisons, and detention facilities for refusing to renounce the spiritual practice. Former Chinese prisoners, many of whom are not themselves Falun Gong adherents have reported that Falun Gong practitioners consistently received the ""longest sentences and worst treatment"" in labor camps, and in some facilities, Falun Gong practitioners were the substantial majority of detainees. At least 2,000 Falun Gong adherents have been tortured to death amidst the persecution campaign, with some observers putting the number much higher.

Or, as the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz's main gate famously stated, ""Arbeit Macht Frei""--Work will Make you Free.  And again, we haven't even talked about Josef Stalin, the Khmer Rouge, or any of the other more historically communist branches of militant atheism, mainly because their death tolls are so high as to be laughably ludicrous, outstripping the numbers of victims of every single religion's crusades, pogroms, witchhunts, and heresy trials *put together*, and again--that's just in the 20th century.  Not even a hundred years with atheism, and they've racked up a *hell* of a body count.  But I digress.

&gt; Christianity was the cause of many wars. The fact that they were christian was not a side issue, it wasn't a coincidence. It was the very reason behind it, the driving force without which no reason would have existed. You can't say the same for atheists throughout history.

No, it actually *was* a coincidence; as I've said before, the vast majority of wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_wars) have not been fought on religious grounds, but usually territorial grounds, often with one power expanding into a new area.  [Religious wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war#List_of_major_religious_wars) are actually relatively few and far between; the Crusades in medieval Europe, the early Islamic conquest of Africa, a few isolated conflicts in central Eurasia, etc.  In comparison, WWI was fought almost entirely between members of the same religion (Christianity) over a tiny patch of land in Alsace-Lorraine (I think there was a murdered arch-duke in there somewhere), and the numbers of dead easily rival the Thirty Years' War or any other of the *most egregious holy wars ever*.  And that was just WW*I*--those same Christian nations had a sequel only thirty years later, with three times the death toll!  Again, if you have evidence contravening the widespread and obvious opinion that holy war is a relatively miniscule subset of the actual wars that have been waged in the past 3000 years of recorded history, please provide it.",t3_vop5h,False,atheism,0,1429270571,,,0,0,0,mean0dean0,t1_c57xkif,False,,t5_2qh2p,0,

You can call competitive TF2 is a lot of things opinion wise, saying it is 'niche' is not one of them. At this point of the game's lifetime the population of people who play TF2 competitively in some way is probably close to almost half of the community who plays this game regularly, if not more than half. 

If it was truly so niche, Valve wouldn't bother doing remotely anything for it (would be a waste of money + time for them with no real gain). Just because they do not balance around it and exclude everything else does not mean it is niche, it means that Valve is willing to cater to multiple people at once. While no item change has been made SOLELY because of competitive play, there are item changes that have been made with it in mind, just like every weapon change keeps pubs in mind, and Highlander, etc. No one smart wants Valve to balance around just competitive play since if pubs get unfun then people quit the game and you don't have anyone going into competitive, likewise if your competitive high level play sucks when people get good and transition into that they get an unrewarding game and quit. Both have to be good and thought about and made sure they are both tight.

There is no society that is entirely happy. That would be a utopia and is only found in fiction. I am perfectly fine with government but it is getting out of hand. We are losing freedoms daily step by step and people are defending it. There is a reason people say liberals hate America, it's because they dislike what it is and trying to turn into something it has never been before.

50 million people being uninsured is not the same as 50 million people dying from lack of health insurance.

&gt; the correct answer you want is an effective government that works. the size of the government is irrelevant.

Our federal government has never proven effective what makes you think they will suddenly become effective. You really think it's easier for the people to control a federal government than a state government. That is the point of giving power to the states. It's smaller so people have more influence over it. It's not to give a middle finger to the other states, it's so you actually have a voice in your government.

With this model, it's possible to price European options analytically - i.e. you get an explicit formula for the price of the option given the current asset price, the strike, the volatility and the duration.  This explicit formula is the celebrated Black Scholes formula.

Monte Carlo is a method of repeatedly generating random simulation paths to evaluate a given price.  e.g. you can generate N paths, obtain N prices, and take the average of these to obtain a ""mean price"".  Unlike the BS formula above, MC can be used to price any contingent claim, using any underlying model (i.e. not just assuming the BS model).

1, Usually, it is determined how agressive you can get by the opposing champion. Knowing which champion you can go agressive against, and which can outtrade you is a great way of controlling your agression. You'll learn more and more about this as time goes by, but just for some basics you could use http://championselect.net/ , more specifically in this case http://championselect.net/champ/Cassiopeia

2, Okay, since you are lvl 15 and haven't really met with the mate (I guess), ppl ALWAYS take flash, and when playing Middle lane casters they pair Ignite with it (such as with Cass). Try it out, because sooner or later you'll pretty much have to adapt to it.

3, I can't really explain this in detail, but usually, in lane ranged champs counter melee ones (especially on top lane). If you might find it hard to pick up melee champions for laning, try starting with the mroe sustained ones, who can stay on a realtively high health pool (as Warwick).

4, If you build straight to lifesteal, you lose out on a great amount of durability and potential tankyness. Sure, it works if you are stomping people, but once the enemy focuses you, you won't go a long way healing yourself by 100 / second while receiving 800 damage / second. Usually, if you intend to stay longer in the fight, you should build some tanky items with health and resistances, such as warmogs armor, guardian angel, etc. Full regen is not a great thing especially in the later stages of the game, where it woN't do too much in the course of a teamfight, etc. It might be a good idea to pick regeneration up early tho, as it helps you in laning (laning is constant, and you constantly heal back, as opposed to teamfights where it is mcuh shorter and regeneration woN't do much.)

Interestingly, probably the most overlooked part of washing, is drying your hands. The most hygenic way to dry is to use a disposable paper hand towel. If you use an electric hand dryer *DO NOT RUB YOUR HANDS TOGETHER*. When you rub your hands you open up all your pores and just start rubbing yourself in bacteria. If you're going to use a hand dryer, shake your hands first, then dry under a hot air stream without rubbing. Rubbing your hands while drying will cause an overall *increase* in levels on bacteria on your hand, some say by up to 250%, while disposable paper towels are generally regarded to reduce levels. While there aren't any numbers, often regarded as even worse are re-usable hand towels - they're warm and moist and a bacterial paradise. [source 1](http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf) [source 2](http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090402-2008%20WUS%20Westminster%20University%20hygiene%20study,%20nov2008.pdf)

But to answer your question, I think yes you're better off having washed your hands. More important than the volume of bacteria present, are the strains of bacteria, and faecal bacteria have the potential to cause some bad shit. I don't want to speculate, so I'll leave it there, but I'd say wash your hands.

Le voi lua in ordinea in care mi le amintesc.1. Prestatia cu ora. E bine asa, ar fi de dorit o modalitate mai flexibila de a cuantifica timpul petrecut cu o femeie contra cost? La prima vedere, un barbat prefera ora ""dilatata"", garantia ca nu va fi dat afara dupa o ora. Chestia cu ora nu e romaneasca; din proprie experienta, la fel e si in Germania si in majoritatea cazurilor in Olanda. Contorizarea ""finalizarilor"" este si ea la mare moda, fie ca se spune dinainte sau nu. E foarte interesant sa ajungi la discutii daca ai finalizat sau nu exact in momentele alea. De ce doriti mai mult de o ora? Sa fim sinceri, putini barbati sunt in stare sa performeze o ora non-stop si eventual si cu mai multe finalizari. Am o banuiala ca fetele va pot spune ca sunt unii care din ora aia lucreaza efectiv cateva minute si dupa aia nu stiu cum sa plece mai repede si abia nimeres usa de ce bulversati si rusinati sunt. Deci, e ora cu adevarat o limita din punct de vedere al sexului? Dar numarul de finalizari? Cel mai probabil, nu. Ce se cauta de fapt este apropierea de acea femeie. Acea cafea, acel suc de care se spunea, tigara dinainte sunt lubrifiantul creierului, sunt ceea ce ajuta un barbat ordinar (in sens statistic) sa poate lucra in pat si sa se si simta bine. Cei din industrie numesc asta ""GFE"" daca nu ma insel, adica ""girlfriend experience"". Pot sa pun pariu ca de aici provine dorinta de mai mult timp. Problema e ca sunt extrem de rare cazurile in care si femeia vrea asa ceva. Lasand la o parte curvele ordinare (in sensul nasol al cuvantului), prostituatele de cariera au invatat sa detaseze actul sexual de implicarea emotionala. Astfel, devine extrem de usor sa faci sex chiar daca nu vrei sa ai de-a face cu persoana care transpira pe/langa/sub tine. Pentru vagin exista lubrifiant, pentru creier, mult mai greu. De aceea majoritatea refuza sa sarute clientii. Acele ore petrecute impreuna pe care le vor clientii, acea apropiere inseamna o investitie psihica enorma din partea celei care presteaza. De multe ori un calcul arata ca pur si simplu nu merita. Exista modalitati de a realiza aceasta apropiere? Costa mult? Sa trecem la punctul 2:2. Clienti statornici, weekenduri, femei pentru sex in deplasare; poate cea mai reusita forma de sex pe bani este cea care duce la o apropiere intre client si prestatoare. Aceasta se face in timp, dupa muulte vizite, se face in weekenduri. Un caz particular al clientilor statornici sunt cei care ""fut in deplasare""; ei au des afaceri in alt oras si leaga o relatie cu o prostituata de acolo. E o relatie reusita pentru ambii, totul se petrece repede, el pleaca multumit, revine cu urmatoarea ocazie, dupa un timp deja se cunosc, se leaga o relatie. Deh, si barbatii si prostituatele sunt tot oameni si sufera de aceeasi slabiciune catre relatii sociale.Un caz interesant sunt weekendul/vacantele. La prima vedere e cea mai tare chestie: iei o femeie superba, pleci intr-o vacanta luxoasa, faci sex ca in filme, te mandresti cu ea la restaurant. Sex efectiv vei face de cateva ori, mai un oral din cand in cand. Ce te excita cel mai tare e gandul ca vei fi cu acea femeie frumoasa, ca te vor invidia alti barbati, ca toti vor intoarce capul dupa picioarele ei. Ei bine, toate astea costa. Costa pentru ca:* e un serviciu de nisa; vacante de weekend nu are orice muncitor/student/pensionar care alcatuiesc majoritatea populatiei* implica acea implicare afectiva a prestatoarei; fara o asemenea implicare penibilul vacantei e evident dupa primele ore. O vacanta numai cu futut poate fi apreciata numai de manelisti care oricum culeg curve de pe strada. Implicarea afectiva e un efort mare, asa cum am spus mai sus.* durata in timp e mare, trebuie compensat cash flow-ul zilnic SmileCu acestea in minte, 600 euro, suma vehiculata pe aici, nu e mare. Pe langa aceasta suma se mai adauga: deplasare sa zicem 400km dus/intors - 50 EUR carburant/cafea/suc, hotel 3-4 stele intr-o statiune, doua nopti - 250 EUR, restaurante/plimbari/altele - 200 EUR. Deci, mai costa inca 500 EUR. Marele total: 1100. Cati is permit in Romania asta? Dintre cei care isi permit, oare au ei de unde alege? Care e garantia ca de banii astia nu te alegi cu o pupaza stridenta, analfabeta si retardata.3. Site-urile romanesti. Recunosc ca le-am strabatut in lung si lat de ceva vreme. De cele mai multe ori ma surprinde stupiditatea anunuturilor. Cum poti sa cauti ""domni eleganti si stilati"" cand nu stii sa scrii, cand in poze apari cu lenjerie de taraba? Cum poti sa ceri 100EUR/ora cand tot e ai de oferit e mediocritate, mahala si mizerie. Da, stiu, tarifele sunt aliniate la vest; in Germania, Olanda, Franta, o ora cu una de pe strada costa 80-120 si cele cu apartament, clientela si pretentii sunt la zona 400-500. Cele adevarate nu discuta cu ora ci cu intalnirea/weekendul. Dar la noi oferta e scumpa si extrem de mizera. Nu vreau sa jignesc fetele de aici, nu am avut ocazia sa le citesc vreun anunt sau sa le vizitez, dar in marea majoritatea a cazurilor e asa. De cealalta parte sunt clientii sau doritorii. Sunt de mai multe feluri: cei copii si credului care scriu review-uri exaltate, posturi admirative, isi lasa adresa de yahoo, de parca una din femei o sa ii contacteze si sa-i spuna ""esti minunat, te ador, cata sensibilitate, hai sa ne futem gratis"". Sunt apoi cei macho: ""am fost am dat cea mai tare muie, se fute extraordinar, i-am bagat, i-am facut""; ei au platit de fapt aceasta senzatie de futut. Putea foarte bine in loc de femeie sa fie orice, ei isi cumpara momentul de glorie; ei sunt genul care trebuie neaparat sa faca sex in fata oglinzii. Mai sunt bineinteles si pestii care pozeaza in clienti: ""merita, e cea mai tare de pe site, am avut multe si asta e cea mai buna"". Reclama ieftina.De ce am oare senzatia ca adevaratele femei care presteaza pe bani nu se gasesc pe internet? Ma insel? Ar mai fi multe de spus, dar deja ma simt penibil pentru toata aceasta expunere. Multi veti spune ca ""uite un alt labagiu care nu fute si vine sa ne explice noua"". Puteti sa credeti ce vreti; din punctul meu de vedere, industria sexului trebuie luata foarte in serios. Majoritatea barbatilor inseala, doresc alte femei sau pur si simplu alta companie. Va veni un moment in viata cand veti vrea sa dati un ban serios dar sa va bucurati de servicii extremde bune. Ca in orice industrie, pana la urma cererea regleaza oferta; daca clientii se vor complace in mediocritate si vor accepta orice, oferta va fi pe veci slaba si scumpa.

In the EU, it's is the law. Apple in fact knows this like other manufactures based outside the EU.

Just as the banks have been fined and forced to reimburse for miss-selling mortgage insurance protection, I expect Apple could be seen in exactly the same light for miss-selling Apples protection plan effective after one year when it was not needed until start of year three.

By not making it clear and disputing when someone complains, Apple just banks the money against all those saps that do not know their rights. You may think ""buyer beware"" and if the customer gets it wrong, then it's no fault of Apple. Problem is that they have been told that that is not good enough and have to fix it. They don't, they get fined.

Again, this is the law. You cannot take people's rights away from them by having your own idea of what you think is right. You have a contract when you purchase a ticket to get on a bus. It does not give the company the right to stipulate where you sit based on your colour.

Are gypsies counted as Caucasian or Asian for Census purposes?

I understand the Turks once held a huge empire into Europe but it doesn't seem like they stayed in those areas after independence. For instance I just goggled Turks in Bulgaria and came up with this from wikipedia.

 ""According to Aubaret, the French Consul in Ruse in 1876 in the Danube Vilayet (which included the territory of the post-1878 Bulgarian principality without Eastern Rumelia, and also Northern Dobruja and the Niš region) alone there were 1,120,000 Muslims and 1,233,500 non-Muslims of whom 1,150,000 were Bulgarian. Between 1876 and 1878, through massacres, epidemics, hunger and war a large portion of the Turkish population vanished. The flow of Turks to Anatolia continued in a steady pattern depending on the policies of the ruling regimes until 1925 after which immigration was regulated. During the 20th century Bulgaria also practiced forced deportations and expulsions, which also targeted the Muslim Pomak population.[23]""
The biggest wave of Turkish emigration occurred in 1989, when 310,000 Turks left Bulgaria as a result of the communist Zhivkov regime's assimilation campaign, but around 150,000 returned between 1989 and 1990. That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt Christian names and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign was unclear; however, many experts believed that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor.[24] During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would be issued only in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity removed. Mosques were closed or demolished. Turkish names on gravestones were replaced with Bulgarian names. According to estimates, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were sent to labor camps or were forcibly resettled.[25] During this period the Bulgarian authorities denied all reports of ethnic repression and that ethnic Turks existed in the country. The official government stance was that the Turks in Bulgaria were really Bulgarians who were Turkified and that the entire Turkish population voluntarily chose to change their Turkish/Muslim names to Bulgarian/Slavic ones

As for build, this my build I have used for solo play in ACT3/4 Inferno:
http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/wizard#blXROQ!dfb!bbabYY

It isn't huge dps but for solo play you don't need more.

Tips about the build:
- use Blizzard to create a patch between you and mobs
- recast Hydra if the previous one is out of range
- each time you are getting hit for more than 15% you will have teleport ready (good for some pesky champion/elite packs)
- diamond skin each time you can't avoid dmg

When you feel more comfortable with this build you might want to switch some defensive abilities for more dps (ditch diamond skin and teleport for Force Weapon and 12% dmg Familar - this will make Illusionist and Evocation useless and you can use Paralisis and Blur there/). I've tested this build today farming ACT1 Inferno - it eats thru everything :)

True,c580dfz,t3_vvl8x,1341150138,"**How come its there:**

* Its all to do with surface pressure. If we imagine a ball on a plank of wood, if you lift one side of the plank the ball moves down the slope towards the lower side of the plank. The same can be said of pressure, if we take the plank to be the surface pressure, as we raise it in one place the wind (the ball) tries to move to the lower pressure.

* On the surface of the earth, the sun is working like your hands holding the plank. As the sun hits the surface which causes air to warm up and rise, in doing so the surface pressure becomes lower (as you are taking air away and moving it higher into the atmosphere). You can imagine this like you are lowering one hand on the plank, the ball will roll towards you, in the same sense, once the pressure drops the wind blows towards you. 

* So: Sun -&gt; Temperature change -&gt; Air rising or falling -&gt; Pressure -&gt; Different pressure in different areas = Wind

* Please note: I haven't mentioned the ""Coriolis effect"", this isn't vital (I'm my opinion) to understanding what makes wind. If you want I can try answer it later.

**How come it is sometimes there, and sometimes isn't?**

* Usually, its always there. If you happen to be in an area where the sun is making the air rise, then you don't feel wind as the air is only rising, not blowing sideways. (This used to be a big problem for sailors trying to navigate the equator, as the air rises a lot there, they are known as [Doldrums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doldrums) )

* Its usually less windy at night because there is no sun to cause temperature changes, thus changing pressure and causing wind.

**How come it is more windy in some places compared to others?**

This depends on where you live. In my case, I live on the coast in the windiest nation in Europe (Scotland). Why is it so windy here? 

* Well, on the surface of the globe we can imagine two main regions: warm areas, and cold areas (lets not complicate things with too much temperature variation). Now, where the warm air(areas close to the equator) and the cold air (areas close to the poles) come together, there is more of a difference in pressure, and it just so happens that these two temperatures meet at *about* 60°N/S of the equator (right where I live). Causing larger variation in temperature, thus more wind, and shitty weather.

* I also live on the coast, which causes more variation in wind. This is because land and sea warm up at different rates, and are usually known as ""sea breezes"". They occur when the sun shines on the coastal region, hitting both the land and the sea, but the sea tends to warm up far slower than the land. Again, causing there to be a large variation in temperature across a small region. As the land warms the air rises and causes the pressure to lower... But as the pressure at the surface wants to remain in balance it tries to pull the air from the sea, causing wind.

**tl:dr:** Sun → Temperature Rising → Air Rising → Pressure Changing → Pressure wanting to equalise → Pulling air from different regions →→→→ WIND!",t3_vvl8x,False,explainlikeimfive,0,1429271892,,,3,0,3,originalprankster1,t1_c580dfz,False,,t5_2sokd,0,

*Caveat: massive amount of baseless speculation follows. I'm probably talking out of my ass but that's never stopped me before...*

Historically you had to go into a country's territory to commit a crime. If you could flee across the border, you were safe. To combat this, they came up with the concept of extradition. ""Hey, if you return accused criminals to us, we'll do the same for you."" And that worked well for a long time. Without that concept, any border town would be crazy-dangerous to live in since crooks would know they just needed to dash across the border and they could flaunt their crimes.

But in the 21st century you don't have to be physically present in order to commit a crime. If you're in country X and break into a bank's servers in country Y, it makes sense that country Y will try to extradite. Otherwise it's just anarchy: as the world gets increasingly computerized, you could engage in lucrative crime with absolute impunity.

Now, *I'm not defending US intellectual property laws or the prosecution of Mr. O'Dwyer in this post*, but I can certainly see him falling into this category of being accused of committing a crime against US assets via foreign computer.

Without speaking to O'Dwyer's case specifically, I actually hope that the international extradition agreements in this realm get much much tougher. I like the idea of someone who breaks into my Paypal/bank/credit card/whatever account being picked up by his local authorities to face prosecution even though his crime wasn't against a server inside his own country. It's a new world of technology and we need our laws to reflect that.

Because this case is likely bullshit, it's easy to get outraged and just rage against the entire concept of extradition for computer crimes. But I think the concept is not only valid, it should be strengthened. There's also longstanding case law that a nation will refuse to extradite for something that they deem should be legal. So what the petition should be about is to encourage the UK and EU not to extradite for copyright infringement, while still agreeing to extradite for other intellectual property crimes like identity theft, password theft, etc.",t3_vvhj5,1341153030,technology,0,1435704508,,,26,0,26,acog,t1_c580ouq,False,,t5_2qh16,0,

Socialists believe the government should run everything to protect the people, and that people should be equal. We have never had pure socialism, with complete government control and a mostly equal utopia, but many countries in Europe and Northern America are a mix of socialism and capitalism values, like Germany, Canada, and the UK. Communism is a specific form of socialism derived from Marxism - we have never had pure Marxism either, but Marxism is the idea of a man named Karl Marx who believes that a society made of the working men (proletariat) need to rise up and revolt against the people in control and enact a working class paradise where everyone is equal and the workers are in charge. What has actually happened in in Communism is that men like Lenin and Stalin took control of a government and ran everything, letting the main form of communism that we've seen - Stalinism - emerge. Stalinism is where the working man's paradise from Marxism is subverted so that there is still one person in control (generally with a cult of personality surrounding them) and the equal state looks more like a pyramid with a majority working class and very small group of leaders under one ultimate leader. When Stalinism happened, it looks a lot like Fascism. Fascism is the political ideology we've seen with Hitler and Mussolini, where one dictator retains absolute control over the populace, the state is in charge of most things (producing items/agriculture is often one of those). One of the small differences between Stalinism and Fascism is that religion tends to be used within the state in Fascism, but all Communist sects do away with/officially discourage religion. 

Capitalism is a system based around private ownership, private means of production, market supply and demand, and the  exchange of goods and ideas for profit. There are many subsets of this, and most developed countries today are a mix of socialism and capitalism - in the UK, for instance, government runs health care but individual citizens still start up businesses to sell commodities like clothing that might be in demand.

Every year our laws restrict even more for mostly lazy reasons (You can't have exotic pets! Unless people have had them for a long time...Weasel? Illegal! Venomous lionfish? Sure. Oh, you fed a deer on your property for a while? Big fine for captive holding of wild animals!) - that's just one of the many. You should see the mess the firearms laws are in...(airguns are not considered firearms and kids can have them, but take a copper tube, use it like a blowgun, and fire a clay pellet from it, and that's 2.5 years in prison?)

And then there's the politics. Have you seen the news here? Half of it is American news, 1/4 of it is useless fluff about Toronto banning dogs from being sold within city limits, or someone donating money to some shit town in northern Quebec to make it seem like first nations are doing just fine. One time, while I was studying hardcore, I missed an election. I didn't even KNOW about it. I was isolated on the quiet dorm on campus, and I studied constantly that entire semester. No one talked about it because the elections here aren't exciting, expensive (which has a positive spin, too), or on any channel other than CBC and CTV (where I am). There are no political satires that even make it enjoyable to wonder about Canada's current state (22 minutes makes fun of politicians, but who they are not what they're doing - also, it's not funny). I have basic cable, and I can learn about what's going on in America on six different channels, whereas only two talk about Canada. This nation also throws money away in student loans, grants, and other monetary parts of social security programs without any checks to make sure the money isn't squandered (though that's a complex situation and putting the checks in might cost a lot). And I've got 4 different garbage bins for recycling that I must have, or I get fined. Don't forget our phone contracts are ridiculously expensive and last three years. The town where I live doesn't help. It's the home of Acadia University, and it's full of stupid hipsters who only shop at the farmers' market and I've been approached countless times with petitions of ""Move the new cell tower because we don't want cancer, or to destroy the environment!"" ""But isn't it on already zoned residential land? The environment's already gone there..."" ""B...b...but the cancer!"" *facepalm*

Now these are just some personal grievances of mine (and there are many more), none of which are better or worse than issues in some countries - no one lives in a perfect nation. I am also acutely aware that this is a single, anecdotal experience and certainly not a strong commentary on the state of Canada. However, I find I dislike calling one nation superior to another, especially when, socially, they're closely matched. I was born here, and I like it here. But I have no pride for Canada. National pride confuses me, there's always a country doing something better than your country is. I know a lot of the annoyingly proud guys who always sing ""Good ol' Hockey Game"" who don't know what the national animals are or the national sports (Beaver prior to 2002, Canadian horse after 2002, LaCrosse is the national sport). Canada has free primary health care, though it's not perfect (Insulin fiasco. Start there). No free tuition, sadly, but at least it's cheaper here. 

I find Canada is stuck between three places. Trying to be progressive and intelligent like much of Europe, though being afraid of socializing too much. Trying to stay true to Father Britain and act like him, but still wary of the economic punishment rebellious big brother America might give him for acting too much like that. It's not sitting on the fence, it's sitting on the fence post where three fences meet, and making laws in accordance to which side of the fence has his attention at the time (usually America. It's loud).

In short, this nation - although a very good, free, and safe one to live in, is not superior to America, or Britain, or Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Australia, Japan, the list goes on. It's not worse either.

Almost all of us on reddit grew up within that period of time and were therefore exposed to a large number of precautions to take within an urban setting to avoid any trouble.

It may seem useless now because crime rates have managed to drop to a quarter of the level they were back in the day in most cities, but the drop was completely unexpected to practically everybody; sociologists/criminologists are still debating the exact reasons for the rapid decrease. Ask any cop or somebody who lived in a major city within that time period and most will tell you that they were all almost certain that things were only going to get worse. So basically, our generations were conditioned to survive within extremely violent urban areas at a very young age.

Although I am arguing that there is some justification for why we grew up with the lessons we learned, I will not deny that it is definitely time to shed those old ways of being overcautious and fearful of others as that time has passed and I do agree that it does damage to the social aspect of our communities. In this case, I think we definitely can put some blame on the media and their sensationalism for our continued belief that things have not gotten any safer.

The Clinton welfare reform did not result in hundreds of thousand homeless. Most of those people became employed and are doing better than the dole now. This [guy](http://www.amazon.com/Scratch-Beginnings-Search-American-Dream/dp/0979692601) started with $25 in a randomly picked city with a goal of owning a working automobile, a furnished apartment, and at least $2500 in savings in one year.

You might have made an argument for post-Soviet Russia until Putin started killing journalists and political opponents.

True,c580xlk,t1_c58004p,1341154365,"As an American who lived in Germany for two years, one of the big differences I noticed is in how Americans and Europeans identify with their nationality. Europeans tend to identify with their respective nations based on culture/ethnicity, which makes sense, because they generally share a common culture/ethnicity that has been developing for thousands of years. Americans, on the other hand, tend to identify based on ideology. This is largely due to the fact that the founding of the US was based on specific political and economic principles popular during the Enlightenment, and also due in part to the fact that Americans don't have a common culture to which they can all belong. If you were to ask a German what it means to be German, the explanation would likely involve traditions, language, and other things unique to Germany. If you were to ask an American what it means to be American, you would likely hear something involving freedom or the constitution (or sometimes capitalism, depending on whether or not they identify as conservative). 

In my opinion, this is the primary reason as to why immigrants in the US generally have an easier time integrating. Generally speaking, most people in the US care little about what culture or race a person is. As long as they ""love freedom"" (and really, who doesn't love freedom? :P), they are considered a ""true American"", and people aren't going to contest that. In Europe (and it really depends on the country, of course), if someone has a different native language, cultural traditions, religion, or sometimes even if they look different, they are going to have a much harder time being accepted into general society as a true citizen. I also think this difference might explain why Europeans are more sensitive to displays of nationalism being tied to racism (as you noted), since nationalism in the US isn't tied to a specific race or ethnicity.

While it might be more beneficial to immigrants, I certainly don't think the preference for ideology over culture is necessarily better, mind you. One major downside to that is that the ideological arguments for what ""being an American"" means are often twisted for the purpose of manipulating the public.

My feeling is that most people who have even the slightest clue know that, if you're a Pakistani man who came to Canada with his family, you probably came because you're well educated, and this is generally a better place to use your engineering degree or medical credentials while raising a family.  In a city which hasn't been historically at all ethnically diverse (save within the European sphere), women coming to the library in [niqab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqab) provokes confusion and uncertainty in some.

It strikes me as interesting how it's kind of flipped the world of black-and-white, Eurocentric racism upside down.  Iran and Pakistan are sending wealthy, well-educated immigrants to perform highly-valued and economically beneficial work, which doesn't even compete with the job aspirations of the lower and middle classes (and so a 'dey took err jerbs' response isn't relevant).  While, in the mean time, the group most despised by immigration skeptics who keep track of such things would likely be Romanian and Czech immigrants from the Roma minority.  The racism of the day would seemingly do well do ditch any black/white antagonisms, and just say what it feels, having embraced the (itself problematic) doctrine of the 'model immigrant', which would have to go something along the lines of ""we don't want any more goddamn freeloading Europeans in our hard-working Asian Canada!""

There would of been wide scale war all over again.  It would be across basically all of Europe and racked up millions of casualties, civs and military.  Remember that Russia was already making its way into the current eastern bloc countries, if not already in them at this point.  Russia might of stopped at the western German boarder, maybe right on into France.  Civilian casualties would probably of been incredibly high, the Soviets were not overly concerned with collateral damage.  It could of last for 6 months, 6 years or 16 years.  This is the western front.

Now remember that the A-bomb effectively nipped Russia's Japan ambitions in the butt.  War with the soviets would of likely been on this side of the world also.  Probably over Japan, but it could of been over in Korea also.  I suspect this side of the war would of been over more quickly though, the war machine the US had built/starting to build up to invade the mainland was massive.  Much more than what Russia was going to use to invade northern Japan.  

TLDR - War with Russia would not of been a major war between 2 superpowers with limited casualties.  It would of been world war III  (maybe 2 1/2), and they call them world wars for a reason.

My Father was run over a truck when I was in sixth grade. He throw into an area of the road where turning cars would be unable to see him. The first sign that God was with him was the only two witnesses of the accident were two off duty paramedics.  they kept out of their car, called the ambulance, and set to work keeping my father alive. The nearest hospital was over 40 minutes away, and the doctors estimated that if it had taken more than 30 minutes, he would have died. That night the roads were so clear that ambulance was able to get there in under twenty minutes . My father died twice that night, each time saved by the doctors. He broke 9 ribs, his neck,  several parts of his spine, and shattered his pelvis. The greatest showing of God's love came from the outpouring of love from others. My Dad's workplace continued to pay him full thoughtful his recovery, people would send food, so much food that we had a dinner for an entire year. People from places I have never been too, like Canada and Europe, we're calling in and saying they are praying for us and asking how they could help my family. Friends would always ask if I needed a ride home. The love that came was overwhelming. God truly showed his power when my father, a man who had a broken pelvis, spine, and neck, completed the San Antonio Half-Marathon, 10 months after an horrible accident. 

Through this troubling time in my life, I matured immensely. With Mom dealing with the hospital bill, I was basically left on my own. With prayer and comfort given to me by God, I left the sixth grade with straight A's. 

When I was at my lowest, God was there. When my father was on the brink of death, God was there.

Of course history is full of wars with people migrating from one region to another as a result; your example is analogous to wars fought between the native peoples of North America. A better example might be the British colonizing India and Africa, and what's the situation now? The Europeans were driven out and the native cultures came to dominate. And please don't try to point out how unstable and dangerous the situation is in many of those places; that's not the point. The point is, is that unlike in the US, India for example is governed by descendants of the original cultures, not the European invaders.   
  
&gt;You would interpret it that way.
&gt;A small amount of Mexicans are returning HOME, probably due largely to the fact that states in the US are passing laws to crack down on illegal immigration. Americans aren't leaving the US in droves for a better life elsewhere, and they certainly don't number nowhere near the amount of Mexicans that still hop the border every year.  

Yes, I would interpret it that way. I never said that the immigration laws weren't the reason for the swing in numbers, nor did I say that 'Americans [are] leaving the US in droves', so please don't try to put words in my mouth. Since you didn't seem to bother to read *any* of the articles (and I tried to link to both left- and right-leaning publications), I'll go ahead and post a couple of quotes, starting with The Washington Post:
&gt;The reversal appears to be a result of tightened border controls, a weak U.S. job and housing construction market, a rise in deportations and a decline in Mexican birthrates, said the study, which used U.S. and Mexican census figures and Mexican government surveys. Arrests of illegal immigrants trying to enter the United States have also dropped precipitously in recent years.  

'..tightened border controls' is a another way of saying 'crack down on illegal immigration'.  

The Fox News article is pretty sparse, only a couple of paragraphs and [a link to the Pew Research Center study.](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/04/23/net-migration-from-mexico-falls-to-zero-and-perhaps-less/)  

Outside The Beltway quotes the Post article, but also adds a summary of some of the key findings from the report, including one I find rather interesting:  

&gt;Looking back over the entire span of U.S. history, no country has ever sent as many immigrants to this country as Mexico has in the past four decades. However, when measured not in absolute numbers but as a share of the immigrant population at the time, immigration waves from Germany and Ireland in the late 19th century equaled or exceeded the modern wave from Mexico.  

I'm of German descent, my wife of Irish. My family has owned and run [a local company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leupold_%26_Stevens) for the last 100+ years, we currently employ a few hundred people directly in manufacturing and engineering-type positions, and offer above-average benefits as well as profit-sharing. Should we close up shop and move our business to ol' mother Germany? Of course not.  
  
Now, I'm going to speak slowly and enunciate, so you don't misunderstand. I don't believe that illegal immigration is ok, or that we as a nation shouldn't take steps to curb it. It is wrong, however, to take a shotgun approach and just assume that everyone who is here illegally should be rounded up and shipped back to where ever they were born. I would also say it's hypocritical at best to overlook the importance of immigration to our society, and the benefits we have reaped as a result of people of other cultures coming here to build a better life for themselves and their own.",t3_vvinl,1341163027,politics,0,1429272832,,,3,0,3,jackasstacular,t1_c582d9r,False,,t5_2cneq,0,

So what does happen after a collapse?

To understand this, we first have to understand what will happen to our environment in the absence of civilization. The answer will not be human extinction. Instead, we see a rapid decline in the complexity of our civilization, towards a level that is more similar to the level of complexity that we have evolutionarily adapted to survive in.

The level of complexity that we are adapted to differs depending on the type of environment that our ancestors evolved in. As an example, many Indigenous Americans are not evolutionarily adapted to agriculture. For example, they have no genetic resistance to many of the illnesses that occur in human societies that live under high-population densities. Their immune system is less adapted to illnesses that spread from person to person. Hence, many of these tribes are wisely xenophobic.

Similarly, Australian Aboriginals and other recent hunter-gatherers are poorly adapted to a diet that is high in easily digestible carbohydrates. Such diets lead to obesity, early puberty and epidemics of diabetes in these people. On the contrary, Europeans and especially East-Asians are relatively well adapted to agriculture.

Part of the difference in evolutionary adaptation to agriculture can be found in differing rates of schizophrenia. Only two schizophrenics were found amongst 65.000 people in New Guinea who did not practice agriculture. Low gluten diets appear to benefit schizophrenics. Furthermore, a link has been found between schizophrenia and celiac disease. Immigrants to Western countries often suffer from elevated rates of schizophrenia, and so do their children, both when compared to their country of origin and their current host country. It is likely that they are poorly adapted to our diet.

Considering this, it may be interesting to ask ourselves what will happen to human agriculture after the collapse. The first thing to note is that through our burning of fossil fuels, we have raised levels of CO2 to levels that did not exist anywhere in the past 20 million years. As hinted at earlier, although this will be disastrous for us in the short term and will likely disrupt our civilization, in the long term it was essential for survival of life on our planet that the human species increased the amount of bioavailable carbon. Although the short and medium term effects should be clear to all, it remains to be see whether on the long term scale it may benefit our species.

The reason is because carbon as an element has a tendency to slowly seep away from the biosphere. A small fraction of carbon compounds of dead organisms during various time periods for various reasons is not metabolised by other organisms. This carbon is stored in various forms in the Earth, and known to us under names such as natural gas, coal and of course, oil. In the case of coal, it appears that many plants were not being digested, but instead turned into bitumen, also known as brown coal. Eventually a fungus emerged that was capable of digesting these plants, and hence the deposition of coal into our crust ended.

The effect this ""seeping"" has is to force life to evolve to adopt to conditions of increasingly little atmospheric carbon. If the coal depositing had continued it would have been a disaster, as our planet would have eventually had massive coal depositions but no life. The low atmospheric carbon concentrations recently led to the evolution of a new type of plant that is capable of getting carbon out of the air in a more efficient way. This is called the C4 carbon fixation mechanism, and it allows certain grains to grow under conditions that would otherwise make plant life difficult.

Scientists disagree on whether climate or CO2 concentrations play a bigger role, but agree that grasses (which make up 85% of our agricultural crops) grow comparatively better under low-carbon concentrations. In fact, grasslands did not exist for much of our planet's history, due to higher CO2 concentrations back then.

Hence, we can ask ourselves what the human species function in our environment as a whole represents. Our function as a species to the rest of the biosphere is to function as ""carbon liberators"", to form a counter-balance to the general trend on our planet of CO2 concentrations declining. It is grasses that make our civilization possible, because in environments with few grasses, modern civilized lifestyle does not emerge spontaneously.

Even if we decided to stop all of our activities today, kill most people on the planet and return to a hunter-gather lifestyle, this would not end our CO2 emissions. The reason is because our digging in the Earth has exposed large number of underground coal mines to the dry atmosphere. It is estimated that 3% of global CO2 emissions every year come from underground coal mine fires.

Even with our current technology, coal fires are difficult and expensive to put out, and many fires have been burning for more than hundred years. Coal mine fires in deep underground mines can emerge due to exposure to the atmosphere through ventilation, which would not occur without humans. Importantly, rising temperatures and reduced moisture in the air increases the risk of coal mine fires emerging spontaneously. Hence, when human civilization collapses, coal fires will continue. Our rapid and short burst in global CO2 emissions will be followed by a long ""tail"" of CO2 emissions that will consist of coal mine fires and will continue for a very long time. Luckily, if those CO2 emissions are spaced out over time instead of being rapid and intense, the biosphere will be better capable of adjusting to them, and the effects will be less disastrous than our current ""carbon burst"".

A similar human interference that we have seen is our rapid liberation of phosphate from rock. We used to mine Guano to fertilize our fields as it was rich in phosphate, but eventually ran out of it and become forced to mine rock phosphate. This rock phosphate is mined in countries like Morocco and used as fertilizer. Animals used as food by humans then eat the plants that grow on the fertilized fields, and their manure eventually seeps into the water. Hence we suffer from eutrophication in the water and algae blooms. Although in the short term this is again disastrous, in the long term, it will eventually allow an increase in biomass in our oceans.

Similarly, elements that currently occur mostly in dense deposits are spread over the crust of the planet by the human organism, allowing their incorporation into other species for which they are currently a limiting factor. As an example, our mining of iron is used to make iron tools that eventually rust. This rust will end up in the soil, where it will eventually be incorporated in plants. Iron is an important element for life, and often a limiting factor for certain species (algae). Hence our mining of iron will likely also increase the total amount of biomass on our planet.

All these rapid changes occurring now will be met by another trend, namely, rapid evolution. Organisms, both human and non-human will have to rapidly evolve to enter new emerging niches. In the short term we are witnessing many extinction events, but this current decline in biodiversity will be compensated for in the future with an increase in biodiversity. We will temporarily live in a planet of weeds, but these weeds will be forced to adapt in various ways to their new environment, and will simply serve as the ancestors for a new branching of life into various directions.

Our cities are currently unique ecosystems, and will continue to be so in the future, serving a variety of unique lifeforms. Many of our concrete structures are overly strong, being constructed to be able to maintain more than their own weight without having to fear collapse. Lifeforms will evolve to inhabit the tunnels we have created under our cities. Already, a type of mosquito has evolved that only lives in the underground metro systems of European cities.

This is a new species of insect that has evolved in less than hundred years. Assuming that we do not destroy our underground structures (and we will have no incentive to do so), the persistence of these underground structures for the coming centuries will allow the evolution of new underground cave-like ecosystems.

The reason humans eliminate other lifeforms from their shelters is because failing to do so invites other lifeforms to join them, to the point where the shelters become dangerous for us to enter. Rats, bats and pigeons can carry diseases, fleas bite us, and ants steal food.

In the future we will be unable to eliminate these ""pests"", because there will simply be too few of us to eliminate ""pests"" from all our deserted structures. Furthermore, we will not have the pesticides that we currently use for such purposes.

Buildings will become overgrown with fungi and plants, birds will build nests in them, and animals in general will use them as shelter from extreme weather, while bats will hide in them during the day. Instead of seeing themselves as powerful destroyers of ecosystems, humans will finally understand that their true role was to become creators of new ecosystems, whether they want to or not.

Knowing what happens to the biosphere we live in allows us to make some predictions about the future world that we will inhabit.

The most important point to understand is the following:

-Authority will be rare and little.

Contrary to what we believe, modern humans spend far more time ordered around than our ancestors. Medieval peasants spent a minority of their time working for their lord, and most of the time worked on their own land. In total they spent less time working than modern humans.

The reason for this is obvious. Authority is inefficient. In an ant colony, order exists without authority, because the most efficient system is one in which every organism does what it enjoys the most. Societies based around authority are inefficient, and are either destroyed from within, or destroyed by more efficient outside societies.

Modern society is incredibly inefficient, but we get away with this as a result of our large fossil fuel subsidies. As our society revolves around being paid to do things we do not want to do, humans spend much of their time pretending to be working. Humans also spend much of their time doing surrogate work, in an attempt to be able to receive jobs that they do like when they grow up. Hence we see trends like unpaid interns. Although we need plenty of people to clean toilets and work in factories, most people don't want to do so, and hence spend their lives competing for access to the few jobs that are fun (politics, entertainment).

Technology also has the effect of reducing the proportion of jobs that are fun. As an example, in a society with little transportation and communications, we need a larger number of musicians and journalists than we currently do. Making a shoe or a chair by yourself is more fun than operating the machines that make thousand identical shoes and chairs per day.

The reason authority is necessary in our society is because people will voluntarily work for kin that also provide services in return, while only force will cause us to work for people unrelated to us. The reason we have to work for people unrelated to us is because technology causes centralization and the destruction of natural communities.

Not a single species besides the human species practices authority. It is true that dogs for example have alpha-dogs that are the only ones in their group that breed, but other dogs in the pack voluntarily chose not to breed, and do not suffer from this, because the alpha dog is closely genetically related to them.

Hence, in the future, communities will again be based more around voluntary cooperation than around competition.

-Humans will be more feminine than they currently are.

The evolution of the human race represents the evolution from masculinity to femininity. Female chimpanzees are more muscular and hairy than human males. Even compared to our hunter gatherer ancestors, our muscles are small. Humans sacrificed their strong jaw to be able to grow a brain large enough to survive in our modern world.

The reason humans will be more feminine is because cooperation is a more efficient survival strategy than competition, as mentioned earlier. This is especially so under agriculture. This leads to the spread of female traits, because women are more dependent upon cooperation than men. During pregnancy, women are vulnerable to predators and poorly able to autonomously gather food, and hence are dependent upon allies. For this reason, women are inherently more social than men. Male communication revolves more around sharing information that benefits our survival, while female communication revolves more around communicating for the sole purpose of forming social bonds. Hence when women talk about problems to men, they are simply seeking to form social bonds, while men are simply seeking to respond with solutions.

Agriculture requires cooperation, because during short periods of the year, a large amount of work is required that a single individual can not accomplish by himself. Harvesting and sowing are for example short periods that require a large amount of work, while large parts of the year have no work, and are hence known to us as ""holiday seasons"". This compares to hunter-gatherer life, which requires a fairly equal amount of work throughout the year and can be provided by individual humans.

In agricultural societies, intelligence is a very important trait, because intelligence enables cooperation and the formation of strong social bonds to the exclusion of others. Intelligence is less required in many (not all) hunter-gatherer societies, where tool use is not absolutely essential, and where it is possible to hunt animals by simply chasing them to exhaustion.

A large amount of land on our planet will always be unfit for agriculture, and will hence only be populated by hunter-gatherer tribes. However, the majority of humans will always live in agricultural societies, because agriculture enables far higher population densities.

Intelligence will hence be a trait that will be maintained throughout the human gene pool. The ability to entertain and manipulate people is an ability that requires high intelligence and is most useful in agricultural societies.

The future of human reproduction

Polygyny, one man having multiple wives, as found in certain cultures is a temporary trend in many countries. It is capable of rapidly increasing intelligence, by allowing a minority of the most intelligent men to gather all women at the cost of everyone else.

The downside of polygyny is that genetic diversity rapidly declines. Every generation, only a minority of men pass down their genes to the next generation, hence causing a decline in genetic diversity, which is very important under high population density, because disease spreads rapidly in agricultural societies when compared to other methods of food production.

Polyandry will always exist to a certain degree, but will not become very widespread, because it spreads sexually transmittable diseases that cause infertility that can not be treated without antibiotics. Polyandry will however be the most popular reproductive strategy amongst hunter-gatherers, where everyone will be able to freely mate with one another, as under low population density and small isolated tribes, sexually transmittable diseases will be rare and limited in number.

The most widespread form of mating will be the ones that maximize genetic diversity, while keeping the spread of sexually transmittable diseases relatively low. The most popular reproductive strategy will be serial monogamy. Serial monogamy is the Western reproductive pattern. Under serial monogamy, people spend a few years with one partner. These few years can be extended if children are born, to allow the father to help raise them. Eventually, the two partners grow bored of each other, and both find new partners with whom to raise another litter.

Sexual behavior that encourages cooperation will become more likely. Examples are attraction to the same gender, which is very common amongst non-human Bonobos. Homosexuality is likely rare amongst humans when compared to Bonobo's, because amongst humans it was punished with the death penalty under many religions. It is known that amongst the Romans bisexuality was widespread, with heterosexual Roman emperors being a minority. Besides sexual attraction to the same gender, romantic attraction to the same gender will likely become very common, as it will encourage humans to be able to sacrifice themselves for those related to them. Homosexuality manages to survive in our species, because homosexuals increase the number of children that are born to their relatives. As an example directly observable to us, homosexual men understand better than heterosexual men what makes a man attractive and hence are capable of increasing the reproductive success of their male friends and siblings.

Human speciation

Speciation benefits an organism, because a lack of reproduction between two groups means that sexually transmittable diseases do not spread between them, and furthermore every sub-group can maintain genes that are only useful for that specific group (as an example, the Sickle cell gene is only useful to people exposed to malaria).

Amongst humans, speciation will also occur unless we rapidly go extinct, which is unlikely. There are various ways by which speciation can occur, but the most important for humans will be assortative mating.

Assortative mating means that individuals only mate with other individuals that are similar to them. Over time, this separates a species into two groups, because individuals that fall between two stereotypes and have intermediate characteristics will be unattractive to either. As an example amongst humans, being an average musician and an average military leader doesn't increase your reproductive success, while being excellent at either and horrible at the other does.

One form of speciation that is likely is speciation due to a difference in intelligence. It is already known that the most important factor to intelligent people in a mate is intelligence, and people in relationships have comparable levels of intelligence.

Hence, humans will split into different species not because we are isolated from each other, but because we will find each other disgusting. Humans are naturally intolerant to people who are different from them, and it takes strong social conditioning to teach people to tolerate people from other groups.

This current trend of tolerance will be temporary, and in the future, different groups will avoid conflict between each other by isolating themselves from one another.

Hence, humans will continue to dominate large areas of the planet, but we will not be the homogeneous blob that we currently represent.

True,c582n32,t1_c5828te,1341163817,"You don't really lose much velocity going to a shorter barrel, is the thing - Remington estimates that a .308 gun will gain or lose about 20 fps per inch of barrel added or removed (within the range of normal, that is) [(Source)](http://www.chuckhawks.com/rifle_barrel.htm). Cooper called for a length overall of less than 39 inches, and a barrel length of 19 inches. Over a normal hunting length barrel, you're losing between 60 and 100 fps. That's... pretty small, really. It won't effect the performance of a big .30 like the .308, unless you're trying to wring more than 1000y out of the gun. That's about a 3% change in velocity, for reference. 

I think, though, you're confused on terms here - none of the things you're talking about actually seem to apply to a Scout Rifle. The ""Cartridge"" argument, in particular, is odd - since the Scout Rifle concept does indeed call for a full-power .308/7.26x51 loading. 

For reference: 

A Scout Rifle is a concept laid out by Jeff Cooper, calling for a full-power .30 cal rifle in a compact package (or .270 for smaller shooters, and jurisdictions prohibiting military calibers), with a large magazine, a quick-acquisition scope, a ching-sling, and iron sights. 

An Assault Rifle is a Select Fire weapon chambering an intermediate (.223 or 7.62x39 most commonly) cartridge. 

A ""Light Rifle"" is a category primarily used in Europe - a smaller, light-weight bolt-action rifle in the traditional hunting style, chambering an intermediate cartridge. The CZ527 falls very neatly into this category, and has won several awards for that category. 

A carbine (and your friend is most likely referring to some amalgam of this and Assault Rifle), is any rifle which is otherwise substantively shorter than what would be considered proper for a full-length rifle. This is a very general definition, and is best explained with examples: The m16 calls for a 20"" barrel. In the military, a Carbine (M4) then typically has a 14.5"" barrel. In the civvy world, we call 16"" barrels ""Carbines"". When you start dealing with .308 class rounds, a longer nominal barrel is called for - 22"" - 24"". A carbine, then, could be anything shorter than that... but typically not less than 18"". The German issue rifle from WWII, the Mauser 98K, was considered a Carbine in it's time with a full 24"" barrel. This is because it was derived from the Mauser M98, which used a 29"" barrel.

Finally... Citing your friend as a leatherneck really does nothing to enhance the argument. Without wishing to ruffle too many feathers, I have found the Marine Corps to contain an usually high percentage of very foolish people who do things like drop a knife point-first on a sleeping comrade, simply because a senior NCO told them they have No Balls. Their sense of judgement, then, must always be questioned. :F",t3_vvrlb,1341164582,guns,0,1429272959,,,11,0,11,SgtKashim,t1_c582n32,False,,t5_2qhc8,0,

True,c582onz,t3_vvrrq,1341164032,"All religions, and I would go further as to say all methods of inquiry (including religion, science, philosophy, art, and plain just thinking or 'life philosophy) stem from a common desire to understand our world and our place in this world. We are curious; we ask what is going on, and in our questioning we develop paradigms or systems of beliefs. In that sense, Christianity, Buddhism, realism, modern science and occultism sprout from the same 'seed' of curiosity and need to understand. They are of course very different systems of belief in the end, but still come from the same place.

Spiritual revelation is about something very intangible and difficult to communicate. Words and symbols can only go so far when trying to describe the ""Truth"", and in the end you have to experience it for yourself. But traditions develop in an attempt to communicate the experience or unlock the experience in others. Over time, these traditions can become rituals in themselves and lose their initial meaning, to become corrupt institutions, just like the United States was founded on strong principles which have become, to some extent, corrupted and almost meaningless over time.

You can make the same argument regarding music: all forms of music come from the same desire to explore the musical space, to express ideas and feelings in auditory form.

And just like different regions tend to have the same kind of folk music, different regions tend to have the same belief system when it comes to this spiritual experience. So if you grow up in Saudi Arabia you're most likely to be an orthodox Muslim, if you grow up in Japan, a Buddhist, in Canada, a Christian, etc. But these are only flavours of the same desire to understand. The folk music in all these areas are all different, but they express the same themes in the end.

The same can be said about language. And yet different languages have the same use: to communicate with one another and to express thoughts and feelings. But it doesn't mean that one language is better or worse than any other, and it doesn't discredit languages as a whole just because you can say that the language you speak mostly depend on where you grew up. If you claim that your language or your religion is inherently superior to all others, then yes, you have a problem, and I don't see how you can argue that English or Christianity is *The* language and religion, and all others are mistaken. But if you say that all languages and religions lead to the same thing in the end, then you don't have to ""deal with the fact"" at all. It's not even an issue.

As societies and cultures converge, you see religions spreading to the point where they are not geographically limited. All major religions are represented in almost all major countries. In this process, many religions change, a good example being Oriental religions which adopt a different flavour when they are imported to Europe and North America.

New Thought and modern science are methods of inquiry with an international flavour, not limited to a geographical area. But even science will be interpreted or used differently across countries, though the differences are much more subtle than with religion.

The map you posted only shows the more prominent religions in each area, but it is far, far from a true representation of global beliefs, which mingle and blend in a somewhat organic fashion. There are somewhat defined 'lines' of separation between certain countries, but they are not as clear cut as what this map seems to say.",t3_vvrrq,False,DebateReligion,0,1429272980,,,2,0,2,what-s_in_a_username,t1_c582onz,False,I am God and so are you,t5_2snuc,0,

&gt; How has your understanding of what the average American (soldier or civilian) thinks of the current war efforts changed? do you think most agree with the level of occupation of and interference with foreign sovereignties?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/vvlui/_/c580h6p?context=1) (Hobotobo):**

&gt; Most of them have a pretty pragmatic mindstate regarding the war, its´effectiveness and the cost of it (not just financial cost). Nearly everybody i asked was of the opinion that interference though sometimes necessary should be the last resort. Concerning the ISAF missions in the balkans nearly everybody thought the involvement to be right and a positive influence. Regarding Afghanistan opinions spread quite widely.

&gt; What preconceptions of the US army did you have before you did this and how where they changed?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/vvlui/_/c580nt3?context=1) (Hobotobo):**

&gt; I was never an army/america basher to beginn with, but getting to know these guys under these conditions still changed my mind. 
&gt; I still had this preconception of ""american superficial politeness"". The very first time i worked as a terp i was pretty afraid of how i would fit in the unit i was designated to. Will i be the civilian outsider? What topics should i better not talk about and how will i included.
&gt; From the moment i was given over to my unit everybody was very  friendly if somewhat reserved. I took a few days of settling in. The turning point was when we went on a 15 mile on foot patrol and i was given the opportunity not having to carry full battle rattle and refused because i didn´t want special treatment. When we came back i guess i had earned a bit respect and soon i was considered part of the unit, an experience i wouldn´t want to miss. Beeing together 24/7 on deployment (even if its just a simulation) quickens getting to know each other a lot!

&gt; Buffalo Chicken:
&gt; Hot, tangy and acidic. Love it! Not recommended when having diarrhea

&gt; Pork Rib:
&gt; Tastes like the McRib patty. McRib is quite popular in germany

True,c582yku,t3_vv466,1341165378,"I can't see mandarin becoming the number 1 language for a number of reasons (I didn't read the article but a few in the comment thread have brought this up). 

1. English is the de facto world language. 2.2 billion people speak english as a first or second language although I cannot say how fluent those people are, that's a heck of a lot of people. Most of the world use the latin alphabet (or related alphabets) so english is a lot easier to learn than say, chinese, which uses a completely different alphabet.

2. English is spread more diffusely across the world. If you go to china people will speak english. If you go to brazil, people will speak english. The same cannot be said about Mandarin.

3. A linguist told me that people who live in the countryside in China have a very different interpretation of what Mandarin is, and can sometimes be as different as different languages in europe.

4. China may be the most populous country now but because of the one child policy we can expect to see a dramatic drop in its population. By 2030 (I think) China's population will begin to decline and I imagine it will rest eventually as policies change. English speaking countries (Canada, Australia, the UK and the US) expect increasing populations, and I think the US could actually reach 500 million people by 2050 (if memory serves me correctly).

5. The anglicisation of european languages cannot be ignored either. Loan words are common throughout other european languages, not to mention the increasing use of english at university level (post grad at the moment, although I have heard tales of undergrad programs in just english). I would not be surprised if in a generation or 2 english became the de facto EU language similar to how english is the world language. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if something like the irish language shift happened in some of the more english fluent countries. Many of my English as a second language friends say they find themselves accidentally using english instead of their native language. This is called code switching, it's very interesting actually. 

6. The code switching thing is very interesting, I was watching an Indian talk show a day or two ago and the host welcomed in english. He then introduced his guest in english an then suddenly, mid sentence, switched to hindi. It was only then I realised that hindi was the primary language and the host had been speaking english to supplement his hindi. The increase of english in India is probably the main reason why english is likely to remain the primary world language.

7. It is impossible though, to compare the current situation to any in the past. Latin died out because latin was born in a time when mass media did not exist. Why is english in the US and english in the UK so similar? Because of globalization. Sure, people could start speaking a weird dialect of english which we couldn't understand, but they would not understand the media or be able to partake in society. 

8. If you're interested, Singapore is quite a cool example of language shift. Roughly 35% speak mandarin and 32% speak english. You might expect a gradual shift to chinese as china grows in power and the fact that it is so close to china, but the opposite is actually happening. There is a gradual shift to english as a first language and in the last 20 years the number of people speaking english at home has increased by effectively 14%, from 18% to 32%. Mandarin, on the other hand, has stayed stable in the last 10 years at about 35%. I always think Singapore is sort of an example battle ground of which language would prevail if both were put head to head.

That doesn't even make sense. Soccer is more popular due to shear numbers. It's popular in every continent, not just one country. Nobody measures a sports popularity on the basis of how many people follow a particular sport in any one country - that's fucking retarded! And anyway, if that WAS the case soccer would still be #1 due to it being the most popular sport in china and cricket would probably be 2nd because of it's popularity in India.

As for your claim that soccer is only popular because you think people are poor, unfortunately for you the IMF, the World Bank and even the CIA list the European Union ABOVE the US in terms of GDP (both nominal and purchasing power parity)... So even though the EU has more money than the US, hardly anybody plays basketball in Europe. Why? Because it's fucking shit.

Cisco/Avaya/Nortel/Mitel/Siemens are the only enterprise-grade solutions worth anything.  Avaya is still stuck in the 80's, but they have been steadily improving with System Manager.  Nortel isn't an option any more.  Mitel is pretty good, but it hasn't got a lot of online support resources.  Siemens has the worst looking phones I've ever seen and the solution is geared around European protocols.  I've had issues getting US protocols working as they were sort of added in after the fact.  Cisco has been the best solution I've ever installed for enterprise.  I will admit I'm not a big fan of Callmanager Express though.  For that, I would recommend a Cudatel or Shoretel solution.

I am an undergraduate student who has been studying about obesity and the effects of it on Cardiovascular risks/disease for some time.

Once you lose weight and go back to normal weight levels, your cardiovascular risk is still the same because your plaque levels in your arteries will still be the same even if you are back in normal weight levels. HOWEVER, because you are back at normal weight, there is less oxidative stress and less blood triglyceride levels. This means that the rate of plaque formation in your arteries is less at normal weight levels than at obese levels. This is if you are looking at heart attacks, COPD, and stoke. cardiovascular risks will be higher at normal weight if you have hypertension, higher triglyceride blood levels, blood glucose levels.
Funny fact: normal weight but obese people have a higher cardiovascular disease risk than metabolically healthy but obese weight people evidence: 

Lentzas, I., Gamiri, V., Katsanaki, A., Tsiros, G., Matzouranis, G., Panagopoulos, P., Chatzopoulou, E. (2009) Metabolically obese patients with normal weight have greater degree of cardiovascular risks than metabolically healthy but obese patients. Atherosclerosis (supplements) (Component). 

Answer reference:

P. Andersson; R.L. Sjoberg; J. Ohrvik; J. Leppert. (2006) Knowledge about cardiovascular risk factors among obese individuals. European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. vol. 5 (4), pg. 275-279

After the Young Turks split between the Muslims &amp; the Secularists, and after they were properly motivated by **Auguste Comte**, they started committing terrorism against their own citizens. I'm sure they had some legitimate grievances (Abdul Hamid wasn't sticking to the new Constitution), but their methods were treacherous.

Interestingly here is part of Comte's letter to Moustafa Reshid Pasha (among the last remaining great diplomats), indirectly asking him to help Europe against the Ottomans:


&gt;*Since you have been removed from the office you held so successfully, the free time you now have on hand gives rise to my hope that you will invest time into considering my positivist philosophy, which I present to you in general terms, and the universal positivist political system it will create… For many hundreds of years the West as well as the East have searched for a universal, unifying religion. Faith in one religion engages the human emotions and gets a hold on them, whereas experience and reason prove that such hope is unfounded. While progressing from Islam to Positivism, without any need for a metaphysical transformation period, Muslims will soon understand the real maintainers of such elevated thoughts as peculiar to their great Prophet who will systematize religious faith and humanitarian understanding with universal victory*.

&gt;**If the Muslims could be distanced from such an unnecessary sense of political unity, they won't feel sad about the Ottoman Empire's inevitable collapse. On the contrary, they will see that their temporary rule actually limited their society's social development**. *As for the Ottoman chiefs still engaged with the occupation of their lands by lesser nations and the like - once the inevitable takes place, their imaginary fears will disappear and the people will be freed. The political implication of accepting humanitarianism instead of a universally believed God will bring a sense of unity among the people, which Islam's core philosophy so desires. Once the Ottomans replace their faith in God with Humanism, this goal will quickly be attained.*


I believe Reshid lost his position after their friendship &amp; co-operation was discovered.

True,c583v5v,t1_c583no8,1341169697,"Aha, great question. four major caveats to this whole crazy thing. 

First, dual criminality is a typical requirement written into extradition treaties and considered an element of the jurisdictional analyses.It is in the UK/US treaty very explicitly. The act needs to be considered a crime in both countries, or else the other country will just say no and move on. 

A second, and related element, is that if the criminal act is constitutionally protected in one nation they will just ignore extradition requests, this also applies to civil claims and is much more distinguishable from the dual criminality idea in that regard. The US will quite frequently ignore requests by other nations for crimes committed in its territory against foreign states and citizens (crimes according to the foreign laws) because of the 1st amendment (free speech). It is easier to understand from the civil side, say a US journalist commits defamation against an Australian (this is a real case), the Australian sues and basically wins his case because the American refuses to show up in Australia (in real life he sued Dow Jones, parent company of The Wall Street Journal). The US will just ignore the judgment (extradition for civil suits is not an option but recognition of foreign judgments is the civil equivalent) and refuse to coerce the American to pay out the damages. 

Third, if a nation considers that human rights will be violated if they extradite to another jurisdiction they will not do it and their is precedent to support this. Most of Europe does not like the death penalty and refuses to extradite murderers in the US unless the prosecutor agrees not to seek the death penalty. 

Finally, a country can consider if the other nation has appropriate due process protections before recognizing foreign jurisdiction over a criminal act. Does the accused get a trial? Is he free from coercion? Does he get counsel? Does he have the right to remain silent? Justice systems vary a great deal and they find differing ways to achieve the same result of due process, but if the requesting nation is not up to snuff legally the nation holding the accused might just say, 'no dice'. 

Oh, and for Assange he was posting classified US information. All States take diplomatic secrecy really really seriously and consider stealing/receiving/transmitting secret information a crime. Now, Assange has made human rights appeals and that is how he has managed to evade US hands. He is hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy and says that as a journalist he should be protected from unreasonable prosecution for legitimate activities. I believe Ecuador is concerned over the possibility of a death penalty and they are reviewing asylum applications for Assange, but the whole thing is monstrously political and not a lot of sense can be applied to it.

But islamization isn't *only* some problem trumped up by racists complaining about that ""Ground Zero"" mosque. Sharia anti-woman and anti-blasphemy conduct is not isolated. It's been a real problem in Europe. 

* Minarets have been constructed for prayer-callers to wake up everybody (non-Muslims as well, since it's loud) at 6 in the morning. 

* In France, people have literally been assaulted for trying to get to their houses in streets where Muslims are out praying. 

* Muslims will take justice to their own Sharia courts instead of the legal system. The problem? The Sharia justice system doesn't frown on abusing disobedient children and wives. That's been a particular problem in Germany and Sweden. 

* Low-income immigrants + fundamentalism = self-rationalizing violence. The crime rate is rapidly increasing in central Europe. 

**Look, I'm not saying that all Muslims are bad.** I'm *certainly not* saying there should be a pogrom against Muslims by politicians. *But this isn't exactly a power-asymmetric relationship.* Millions of Muslims are currently entering and settling in Europe. And in terms of *your* familiarity with them, I'll just say this: Well-established Western Muslims are generally much different, culturally-speaking, from many of their immigrant cousins in Eurasia. Imagine a rednecky Christian fundamentalist group like Westboro, and then imagine them being willing to commit actual violence if their prophet is insulted or their religion is not *specially* catered to. Remember the reaction against the cartoonist by Muslim immigrants for his depiction of Muhammad? Now imagine a huge mass exodus of those sorts of people from North Africa and the Middle-East. That's the situation we're talking about. 

**Edit:** I know Reddit has a special dislike of Christianity and a special regard for Muslims, but let's be self-consistent here. Rationalizing violence is not a good thing. The Swiss politician rationalized violence, but so does a large proportion of the religion he's against. That doesn't justify violence from either side, I'm just trying to make Americans understand the situation and sentiment. 

Imagine the Mexicans coming over the Texas border illegally and how riled up the rednecks get over that. Now imagine that a large proportion of those are people who 1) rationalize violence against you when you exercise your *free speech right* to criticize their catholicism, 2) violate city ordinances because of their own cultural practices, 3) many don't pay taxes, and 4) many rationalize hurting their wives. Now you have an analogous circumstance. It's not all of them, but it's enough to provoke a reaction from residents, however inappropriate that reaction might be. I'm explaining the reaction, not justifying it.

By that token, any foreign language would be par for the course in terms of difficulty, for the average American.


I don't understand your assertion that a European language would be just as hard for an American to learn as any other language. Most Americans are more likely to be familiar with English, Spanish, French, or German than with other languages, so they would naturally have an easier time learning other European languages than learning something that is completely linguistically different. I had an easy time learning French, and a much more difficult time learning Arabic. Learning a language that has similarities to something that you already speak is obviously easier than learning something with a completely new alphabet and vocabulary. 

And, have you not read any of this thread? The OP's husband hasn't bothered to learn her familial language, either, so I don't know why you would only fault *her* for not bothering to learn a new language. In addition, he insults her family for being less educated than his, he doesn't recognize that she has any right to privacy in the marriage and will tell his mother anything she tells him, he and his mother make fun of her. From the information that she's provided, we have many indications that her husband is acting like a dick. Obviously we only have one side of the story--it's Reddit, we never get all sides.

Let's look at Japan. On the face of it, the Tokugawa seems to fit your model: Established in 1600 (or so) to 1868, then collapsed in favor of the Meiji. But why did it collapse? Because of the introduction of foreign influences. In order for your model to be applicable, it would need to be able to summon European colonialism to deliver its timely execution of the bakufu.

And what of China? You say it renews itself through civil war every 200-300 years, but let us examine that. In the past one thousand years, China has suffered exactly one ""dynastic collapse"" so to speak--1911. The Song were conquered by the Mongols, the Ming were conquered by the Manchus, and the Yuan--well, that is complicated, but it wasn't quite the civil war you require. Again, it needs to be able to summon forth Genghis Khan, which I do not believe is within the power of a theoretical model.

Then we look at Rome. We can safely ignore the monarchy, but the 200-300 years doesn't work with either the Republic (five hundred years) or the Empire (200, 400, or 1400 years are three potential counts).

But the biggest problem is that it ignores the enormous changes occuring within these periods. No society is static. The bakufu of 1800 would be unrecognizable to Ieyasu Tokugawa.

Switzerland is the ONLY country in the entire World where the people are in power. The people can initiate a binding referendum at a federal level. What does that mean? The Swiss people can on their own start a nation-wide vote. For a federal law they need 100k signatures to start it. The outcome of the vote is what goes. It's binding. It's not a recommendation for politicians.

Switzerland has a very high standard of living and it's surrounded by countries that are much lower down the scale. What does this mean? A bit like Mexico and the USA, everyone wants to come in.

People have to understand that immigration is a one-way road. Except for illegal immigration, you can't deport. You can't turn the wheel backwards. So it is imperative to be very careful with immigration. Sweden has been so careless. We've tried to be the ""good guys"" that just lets everyone in. What happened? There are huge social problems. Sweden let too many people in too quickly. So all the immigrants live together. You can get citizenship without even speaking the language and then just live off welfare. Any politician in Sweden that tries to get some type of immigration reform gets crucified and called a racist who doesn't like ""difference"".

Most countries in Europe are tiny and the countries where the immigration comes from are huge. Opening the door isn't going to solve any problems in those countries but it will screw up countries like Sweden.

Switzerland has had to open up the boarder due to the Schengen agreement. Violence in Geneva has skyrocketed. Geneva used to be a really safe city a decade ago. Today, I'm always careful when I walk out at night and I most definitely wouldn't do it if I was female. Before, there used to always be a patrol at the border controlling people who came in. Now everyone can come in and the criminality (in the Geneva area) has mainly come from Lyon in France.

Switzerland isn't close-minded about culture. A large part of the Swiss economy is tourism and international organizations are always welcome. Where you think Switzerland is close-minded is when it comes to the country itself. No one changes or touches Switzerland. Switzerland is proud of its country and doesn't want it to change. They even restrict themselves! They voted to restrict the amount of secondary homes there can be in each region. The thought is that there are too many houses being built destroying the landscape of several beautiful resorts.

People aren't racist (sure you'll always find some that are). It's just that they want their country to stay as it is. If you want to come and visit you'll be treated like everyone else. If you want to move to Switzerland and take up the Swiss culture that's also great. Switzerland has seen the issues that come up when you don't restrict immigration.

As for the Minaret ban...how can that not be expected? First of all, it's voted by the people. Why shouldn't the people be allowed to choose as long as it doesn't go against the constitution? Minarets broadcast prayers loudly every week. The speakers are at the top of the ""tower"" aimed to the outside of the place so everyone can hear. It's not exactly racist or lack of open mind to not want that...

&gt; There's a lot of difference between linking and embedding

If you examine the HTML of a site that embeds video, it's clear that embedding **is** just linking; it is the client browser that gathers all the material and assembles the page, and copyrighted material is neither hosted on nor passes through the server. The intermediary site is assisting an end-user in finding and accessing copyrighted material on a third-party site, which is exactly what search engines do - his site just lays out the results more nicely.

&gt; To compare, the founders of thepiratebay were found guilty of ""accessory to copyright infringement"" for similar accusations.

Indeed, they were found guilty under various European laws. ""Accessory to copyright infringement"" sounds like an applicable charge, except that there's no such crime in the U.S. The U.S. is charging him with [""criminal infringement of copyright, and conspiracy to commit criminal infringement of copyright""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jun/24/richard-odwyer-extradition-threat-tvshack-net). I think they'll have a tough case, and it wouldn't surprise me if this falls apart just like the [Kim DotCom](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/mega-victory-kim-dotcom-search-warrants-invalid-mansion-raid-illegal/) case is falling apart.

People hear ""Socialism"" and they think ""Communism"", and when they think ""Communism"" they think about the cold war and gulags and countries with gigantic militaries and starving people.

If your thoughts on socialism don't extend beyond Communist dictatorships, then you really don't know socialism.

[Thomas Jefferson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson), America's third president, felt that the moose was so impressive it would serve as a rebuttal to those who claimed that America was the home of degenerate specimens of life.

E.g., here's a description of [Mr. Jefferson and the Giant Moose: Natural History in Early America](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-5295646-10524481?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecampus.com%2Fbk_detail.asp%3Fisbn%3D9780226169149%26referrer%3DCJ&amp;cjsku=9780226169149N) by Lee Alan Dugatkin:

&gt;In the years after the Revolutionary War, the fledgling republic of America was viewed by many Europeans as a degenerate backwater, populated by subspecies weak and feeble. Chief among these naysayers was the French Count and world-renowned naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, who wrote that the flora and fauna of America (humans included) were inferior to European specimens. Thomas Jefferson—author of the Declaration of Independence, U.S. president, and ardent naturalist—spent years countering the French conception of American degeneracy. His Notes on Virginia systematically and scientifically dismantled Buffon’s case through a series of tables and equally compelling writing on the nature of his home state. But the book did little to counter the arrogance of the French and hardly satisfied Jefferson’s quest to demonstrate that his young nation was every bit the equal of a well-established Europe. Enter the giant moose. The American moose, which Jefferson claimed was so enormous a European reindeer could walk under it, became the cornerstone of his defense. Convinced that the sight of such a magnificent beast would cause Buffon to revise his claims, Jefferson had the remains of a seven-foot ungulate shipped first class from New Hampshire to Paris. Unfortunately, Buffon died before he could make any revisions to his Histoire Naturelle, but the legend of the moose makes for a fascinating tale about Jefferson’s passion to prove that American nature deserved prestige. In Mr. Jefferson and the Giant Moose, Lee Alan Dugatkin vividly recreates the origin and evolution of the debates about natural history in America and, in so doing, returns the prize moose to its rightful place in American history.

[Georges Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon) was a very influential naturalist in Jefferson's day who has been called ""the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century.""

Bill Bryson writes in [A Short History of Nearly Everything ](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-5295646-10524481?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecampus.com%2Fbk_detail.asp%3Fisbn%3D9780767908184%26referrer%3DCJ&amp;cjsku=9780767908184N) regarding Jefferson's attempts to rebut Leclerc's assertions about American fauna:

&gt;Buffon's observations found surprisingly eager support among other writers, especially those whose conclusions were not complicated by actual familiarity with the country. A Dutchman named Comeille de Pauw announced in a popular work called *Recherches Philosophiques sur les Américains* that native American males were not only reproductively unimposing, but so lacking in virility that they had milk in their breasts."" Such views enjoyed an improbable durability and could be found repeated or echoed in European texts till near the end of the nineteenth century.
&gt;
&gt;Not surprisingly, such aspersions were indignantly met in America. Thomas Jefferson incorporated a furious (and, unless the context is understood, quite bewildering) rebuttal in his *Notes on the State of Virginia*, and induced his New Hampshire friend General John Sullivan to send twenty soldiers into the northern woods to find a bull moose to present to Buffon as proof of the stature and majesty of American quadrupeds. It took the men two weeks to track down a suitable subject. The moose, when shot, unfortunately lacked the imposing horns that Jefferson had specified, but Sullivan thoughtfully included a rack of antlers from an elk or stag with the suggestion that these be attached instead. Who in France, after all, would know?

True,c585iiv,t3_vts7k,1341177652,"Marx's analysis of the development of capitalism is global in scope. An essential historical attribute of the capitalist system, which distinguishes it from previous systems of production, is the emergence of a world market. The structure of the world market in the current era, on average that is, is that the east produces and the west consumes. In Europe, there is a similar dynamic albeit on a smaller scale whereby the north produces and the south consumes.

The result of this situation is that the working classes in eastern countries, most notably China, and in northern European countries, most notably Germany, are best situated to provide the leadership required in order for capital to be successfully confronted on a global scale.

Capital has run up against an insurmountable barrier today, which is that the productive economies can only continue to grow if demand in the consumer economies sustains itself. But the consumer economies have lost most of their industry to the more ""competitive"" producing economies. The result is that demand in the consumer economies (which means the overwhelming majority of demand in the entire world market!) can increasingly only be sustained by consumer borrowing (or by public deficit spending which is another form of borrowing).

So this means that every right-wing ""free market"" enthusiast in America and Europe who wants to liquidate all pensions and wages and balance all budgets must really be out to cripple capitalism for good, for that is the inevitable consequence of ""austerity"" at this historically late stage of the game. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening to Chinese production this year, you'll immediately appreciate how dependent growth in the producing countries is on consumers in the consuming countries ""spending beyond their means.""

There is no such thing as a ""post-industrial"" economy under the capitalist mode of production. Americans have a problem with not being curious enough about what happens beyond our borders. Just because our factories have moved overseas in search of cheaper labor doesn't mean that capitalism itself has changed in some fundamental way such that the central role of production and wage labor have been replaced by a ""knowledge economy"" or other focus-grouped bullshit.

Just because Keynesianism failed to permanently solve the contradictions of the system doesn't mean the underconsumption problems Keynes identified problems have conveniently disappeared. They exist alongside the the problem of unsustainable borrowing to maintain consumer demand. As long as we continue to uncritically assume the inevitability of the capitalist system, our public policy disputes will continue to be whether public utility will be better maximized with a rock or with a hard place.",t3_vts7k,False,DebateaCommunist,0,1429274324,,,3,0,3,hegem0nycricket,t1_c585iiv,False,,t5_2t9dp,0,

As to the question of the Manhattan Project, you make the point of knowledge of the goal as being important. I'm not certain that's true. The restriction on knowledge of purpose was due to concerns over security; I don't think that if the every day machinists who worked on fashioning the various parts of the bombs and other material related to the bombs had known what the purpose of their project had been that that would have had any impact on how much is owed to them.

The [total number of people involved in the Manhattan Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project#Personnel) (disclosure: my mom's father was a lt. col. in the Army Corps of Engineers who worked on the project) was definitely greater than the number of pilots serving in the RAF during the Battle of Britain, though maybe not greater than the full population of the RAF at the time.

As to the influence the Manhattan Project had on ending the war, that's a bit of a more debatable issue. The Project was mostly driven by the war in Europe, and its relevance in the Pacific was secondary and only of significance late in the war. Beyond that, you run into the issues of whether the Japanese were willing to surrender prior to the bombings (albeit, not unconditionally), how the Japanese would have responded to the Russians fully entering the war, and just how numerous American and Allied casualties would have been when invading the Home Islands. The war would/could have ended without the bombs, but they certainly helped reach the sort of surrender that the US wanted.

In the larger scheme of things regarding the knowledge and technology produced by the Manhattan Project, I think you're probably right that the influence they had was vastly disproportionate to the number of people involved.

Absolute, 100% lie on your part. I even quoted a left-wing blog. I've included a number of videos, and several more links are mainstream European news sources. 

Let me guess: they disagree with you, so they're automatically right wing? 

&gt;Some marriage agreements are understood at the time of the marriage in the country of marriage.

But I doubt that marriages held under conditions that are historically anti-women's rights would meet EU Human Rights criteria. 

&gt;The blogger is fjordman, one of Anders Bering Breivik's favorites.

Ad hominem. By that logic, Nietzsche and the entire field of genetics are bad because Hitler liked them. Fjordman's views on deportation are extreme, but his anti-concession stance and his cited facts are sound. By the way, I made sure to include blogs that had citations and resource links. 

&gt;Ooh, Sweden has both immigrants and academic freedom. Whoopedey do. The support for the system suggested is likely 0% in the Swedish parliament. Ok, make it 1%, some people are always inexplicable idiots.

Under the heavy immigration Sweden has experienced? You know that Sweden is a Proportional Representation system, correct? You know that there's already a huge pro-[Islamic political organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Sweden) in Sweden, correct? And that not all the suborganizations are the nice type?

Look, I'm not anti-Muslim. And I agree that, at least in the case of Scandinavia, a lot of the anti-Muslim hysteria is overblown. But I am anti-fundamentalist. And unfortunately a lot of immigration is from countries with fundamentalist cultural attitudes, so fundamentalism tends to be heavily represented in the immigrant population.

I have a concern that the general heightened climate of fear due to economic uncertainty and raised terror threats (real or otherwise) mean that we as receiving nations are less willing to be welcoming. This means that newcomers feel isolated, so they don't want to fit in to a culture they perceive as unfriendly.

...what? Do you understand that taxes must be paid for these services to continue? That doesn't come from nowhere, and when illegal immigrants are paid under the table, they don't get taxed. That *is* a drain. It doesn't matter whether you like the idea of immigration or not, because using a service without paying for it causes a negative balance, end of story. 

&gt;illegal is a stupid term because many of them come over through proper channels, but are then put in legal limbo so that they have to work low-wage exploitative jobs for as long as possible until they go to an immigration hearing, hoping to get a chance at citizenship, only to be straight up deported all along, because the immigration regulations and procedures are designed for 'illegal' immigration to happen

...is there a citation for this? I looked it up, but I'm not finding much. I was aware about legal limbo associated with illegal immigrants having children here, but I haven't heard about any *deliberate attempt* to attract them here and then keep them in legal limbo. It sounds like a number of migrant and labor laws have been made to stem that particular practice. 

&gt;They are often promised higher wages in an attempt to get them over here, and are screwed but deign to stay.

Who is promising them? Are you just talking about rumors of the American Dream or Egalitarian Europe in other countries, or are you saying that companies foray out of the country and deliberately make deceptive offers in other countries? And is this behavior systematic in global economy or is it just the work of isolated criminal companies?

&gt;If you don't like them raising livestock and living in tight quarters, then you should support 100% amnesty so that they are granted full rights and can't be exploited for shit labor.

I do support 100% amnesty. And this family wasn't deported. But I don't support unsanitary conditions in my neighborhood. Look, I'm not going to just view this as a socially deterministic system where disenfranchised people get to do bad things (like raise goats and children in unsanitary conditions in the middle of a city) because bad things have happened to them. That's not a *moral excuse* for that behavior. That's like excusing a bully's behavior because he was abused when he was a kid. In other words, I can *understand* why the behavior happens (which is good for helping fix the problem, certainly), but I don't condone or endorse it. And it feels like you're asking me to condone the behavior of the neighbors in this situation just because they've been through a lot.

Regardless of where we stand on the table of gross greenhouse emissions (it varies depending on source) most statistics show that Australia produces between 1% and 1.3% of the worlds greenhouse gases; in comparison with China (16%+), the USA(15%+), the EU(12%+) at the head of the list.

As I understand it, the goal is to reduce Australia's total emissions by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020, and ultimately reduce carbon pollution by 80% below 2000 levels by 2050. 

Noting that carbon is not the only source of greenhouse gas pollution, that means that, at best, *if* this tax is effective, we would reduce world emissons by 0.065% by 2020 and 1% by 2050.

Wow! Excuse me if I am underwhelmed at the gains from such a divisive and economically risky piece of legislation.

I highly disagree with Turkish policy on this matter, and it's one of the main reasons I believe they shouldn't be admitted into the EU.  It's very anti-democratic, anti-multicultural, and anti-freedom, and the concept of forced name changes stands for the opposite of what I would regard as a free and modern society.

I don't even think you should have to learn the local language!  I'm just saying that there's advantages for the individual in trying to conform to your local society as much as possible, particularly when there's social inequality toward immigrants (as there often is, pretty much anywhere).

I do not think cultural assimilation is something that people should have to do at all, so I can't say I appreciate being painted with a brush that has me defending myself against inferences that I believe foreign-born thinkers, scientists, doctors, professors, athletes, musicians or artists are somehow less legitimate because their names are funny sounding.  That was rather insensitive of you, and it missed the whole point of my part of the discussion thus far.

You know, I live in a VERY multi-cultural metropolitan area (I'd reckon more-so than yours).  My immediate neighbors are Africans, Indians, Central Americans, and Asian, and all of whom kept their surnames, and all of whom are as American as baseball, McDonalds, and obesity.

This whole time, I have been discussing why people would want to change their name, but you are seemingly becoming defensive, and suggesting I think people should be required to change their names to assimilate.  Not at all - it's just a choice - and one I happen to make for myself differently than you did.

You asked why people would, and I told you not only why, but I gave you various reasons and examples.

Assimilation means different things to different host cultures, and the degree to which one assimilates is and should be entirely up to the individual.  The cultural implications of assimilation in New York City is entirely different than in Fargo North Dakota.

Sometimes, assimilation can be for a non-natives in a nation, like for S. Koreans - who's culture gives their own children ""American names"" to make it more pronounceable to American foreigners.  Jewish people, as well, tend to have Hebrew names as well as their nationally recognized name.  They don't do this because they are forced to - they do it because it allows them to keep their racial identity as well as conform to a different national identity in a simple way.

As for me, I plan on doing it when I move to Germany - to change it back to what it used to be before my predecessors left.  For me, it's a matter of identity (plus my German surname is way cooler than its Americanized version).

## clubs/bars/restaurants

as for restaurants/cafés/bars: on the one hand it depends on your taste, on the other hand - imho - there's no strict boundary of local and non-local venues. just be extra careful in the first district, there are some tourist-trapsy restaurants there.

some of my favourites and/or notables:

**note:** name, [district,] nearest subway station(s); district doesn't say much, and remember, the subway map doesn't resemble reality in the least. gmaps and common sense is your friend.

### clubs/bars:

note that most [tables the outside of the establishments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schanigarten) have to be closed at 10pm (some have special authorization) because of noise issues.

### kebab

* [kent (several, e.g. 1150 wien, u3 schweglerstraße)](http://www.kent-restaurant.at/)

### cafés &amp; eatery in the museumsquarter (MQ, u2/u3 volkstheater or u2 mariahilferstr.): 

* [café leopold](http://www.cafe-leopold.at/)
* [kantine](http://www.mq-kantine.at/)
* [mq daily](http://www.mqdaily.at/)

### cafés &amp; eatery naschmarkt:

there are a lot of cafés and restaurants on the naschmarkt (between u1/2/4 karlsplatz and u4 kettenbrückeng.)

e.g. [deli](http://www.naschmarkt-deli.at/)

### ice cream

* [eis greissler, 1010](http://www.eis-greissler.at/)
* [tichy, 1100](http://www.gastroweb.at/tichy-eis/)
* [zanoni (several)](http://www.zanoni.co.at/)

of course there are a lot more, e.g. the bars near the donaukanal (badeschiff, hermans strandbar, ...) or in the prater or *whatever*

i'll stop here - there are way too many. those are some that came to mind, but i guess most of those links aren't worth much without a review.

ps: as for the clubs/bars, i guess i'm a bit on the gritty (but not too gritty) side there. no fête blanche stuff, thanks, but no. and, of course, i've to admit this is biased in favor of those near my place of living.

## supermarkets, buying food

supermarkets: billa, merkur (mostly big stores in prominent locations), spar, hofer - they all have their cheap(er) budget brand lines. also penny and zielpunkt. some of them also have high quality bio (=natural) brand lines. there are several smaller supermarkets/stores dedicated to bio/whole foods.

also, you can get (fresh?) fruit and vegetables at small, mostly turkish or eastern-european owned grocery stores and at kind-of farmers markets (naschmarkt has everything from local and forgein specialities, meat, cheese, sweets; there are several other smaller markets).

and bakeries, of course; there are classical viennese ones and at the turkish ones you can get cheap &amp; tasty white bread.

**remember:** store and supermarkt opening times are restricted in austria; most likely from ~8am to 7:30pm from monday to friday and until 6pm on saturday. there are individual supermarkets at train stations (not subway!) that are open on sunday. also, some of the grocery stores ignore opening times (or do they have a special licence?) and keep open until 11pm. some bakeries are open sunday until midday.

## transportation

as for getting around: public transportation (subways, trams and busses) - buy one ticket, get around in all of those almost everywhere as long as it's in vienna (so, not the airport). subway are operated from around 5am to a 0:30am (depends on the line), trams and busses differ. on fridays, saturdays and days where the next day is a public holiday subways are operated all night (not busses/trams though). if you're not too far from the city center it's almost always possible to walk home from the nearest subway station. if you own a smartphone, get [qando (sic)](http://www.qando.at).

as for taxis, in my experience the fare is almost always 10 euros; sometimes it's 2 euros more or less. i rarely use them though.

alternatively: get a bike! but be careful: crime rate in vienna is very low, but bikes are always in danger of being stolen (even crappy ones). don't let your new, expensive fully out overnight and get a really good lock. also, riding a bike inebriated could cost you a lot of money and your drivers licence. vienna isn't an exceptionally bike-friendly city, but i know at least one person who gets around exclusively by bike, at least during summer.

## sports and [activities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BlHY69ZsZ0)

oh man, where to start ... i have no idea what you're interested in.

* swimming in the danube; there are several places you can go (e.g. donauinsel), and, of course, several public pools (outdoor and indoor)
* wakeboarding!
* several climbing walls
* jogging, biking, walking, hiking: prater, donauinsel, schönbrunn ... several locations that are easily reachable with public transportation (e.g. steinhof/wilhelminenberg)
* if you're into skating and biking, there are events for that - like [friday night skating](http://wien.gruene.at/skater)
* if you're a nerd, visit the [metalab](https://metalab.at/) (super nice people!), if you're a jock ... and into football (what? you said you're american!), pay a visit to the vienna [raiffeisen vikings](http://www.raiffeisenvikings.com/).

the donauinsel is very popular for jogging, biking, inline skating, nude sunbathing (if you're into that).

remember kids: austria is small, so is europe; rent a car, take the train or a plane and you'll be in a different city in a heartbeat. be it hiking in the alps, bratislava, prague or munich, or a mediterrane weekend in croatia, it's up to you (and your wallet).

----
## *warning, here be dragons!*
----

this means i'm not sure what i'm talking about.

## reddit meetups

* just subscribe to /r/wien and be ready to get drunk on short notice twice or trice a year. i guess we've reached a stable equilibrium of about 10-15 redditors/meeting in average. not a big crowd, but imo they're all very nice guys and gals :)

## vienna &amp; foreigners 

some people harbor slight populistic anti-american sentiments (bush wasn't exactly popular over here), but nothing serious - in any case, those people are idiots. most people speak at least enough english for you to get by. i don't know about any problems if you're black (and a student - working is, sadly, a different case), but (i hope) there shouldn't be any problem in the clubs/bars/restaurants mentioned above.

## drugs/narcotics

the legal limit for beer, wine and tobacco is 16, hard liquor 18, but it's not enforced too strictly (if you look really young bouncers might ask you for an ID). weed is *technically* illegal, but - imo - socially accepted (IANAL!). don't do hard drugs, just don't. 

## sex

look up age of consent online. simplified, but IANAL!!!: i think it's 14, but ewwwww. male homosexual relationships are ok if you and your partner are at least 18yo (don't ask me why it's different for male gays). except for the 14y rule there are no age restrictions for lesbians. don't know much about it, but prostitution is legal, for the well-heeled bachelor there are strip clubs and brothels en masse.

## police &amp; cops

be nice; they're mostly reasonable guys and girls as long as you're not a total asshole. you'll probably not gonna be shot for a wrong gesture (popular media tells me that's how it is in the u.s.). 

**don't take my word on this, i've never really had much trouble with the law**

you might get in trouble with the law because of ... 

* 90% noise complaints from neighbors (if you plan to partaaaaaaayyyy all night long, try to invite the neighbors over)
* drunk driving or biking
* riding a bike on the sidewalk
* littering

## crime

supposedly vienna is one of the safest cities in the world. i can only agree, never had serious problems here except having my having my wallet stolen once and an attempted burglary in ten years (might differ if you're a girl).

True,c5877aa,t3_vvvvv,1341186065,"The earliest meta I really know of is the poke-heal meta where Soraka and Ezreal were used constantly. Ezreal had an ally heal on his W, which made it impossible to trade with him realistically. Teams would just have all 5 members in a lane poking the shit out of each other until one team got too low. Kinda a horrible meta because it wasn't just boring, it was agonizing when one team had Soraka. 

I joined during the AoE meta where you would have teams with 5 AoE ults (Morgana, MF, Galio, Amumu, Fiddles, etc.) and they would stack them all.

That got nerfed and it turned into tanky-dps meta during the nerfing period because they could survive the AoE and deal damage (also release of Irelia and Jarvan).

Tanky-dps meta led into a sustain meta where you would stack 2-3 philostones and 2 HoGs and never leave lane for every lane. Soraka was really common (as was Sona and Taric). This was accompanied by a short interval of split-pushing when TRM hit #1 with Teemo. It wasn't really a meta as it was just abusing the fuck out of Teemo.
 
Edit: Oh yeah, and supports weren't 0 cs yet, you would commonly see Soraka getting Death Cap and other supports getting big items and you would pair them with mages or tanky-dps.

This led to the roam meta where you'd have a supporty-ganky character like Taric, Alistar, Poppy, Gragas, **EVE** stack gold gen items and gank every lane constantly. This was the first meta which really stuck the mage mid, tanky-dps top, and AD carry bot.

This held its own for a while until an NA/EU tourney came along where EU teams had 0 CS support bot with AD, mage mid, tanky-dps top, and some jungler and crushed the roaming comps. An AD carry just couldn't lane by themselves when faced against 2 laners. This has been the most stable meta we've ever seen and has had only a few variants which still fall in the category of mage mid, 0 cs support + AD carry bot with some top and some jungler.

Top is still almost always tanky-dps, and jungler is usually a tank/initiator. But we've seen in recent tournies, Jax and Kayle tops (and even Lulu), and some crazy junglers.",t3_vvvvv,1341186680,leagueoflegends,0,1429275121,,,2,0,2,[deleted],t1_c5877aa,False,,t5_2rfxx,0,

Another tool you mentioned is simply good judgement and being a good rider.

But accidents will always happen.  Some of them will be avoidable and some of them will not.  You can't account for all the factors of life - you are surrounded by other people making mistakes, animals, unknown road conditions, unknown weather conditions, etc.  

Gear helps when the *inevitable happens*.  Those boots and pants may help you not become a limping gimp.  Those gloves may be the reason why you don't scrape off a few fingers on the pavement and don't look like a freak that has to type with one good hand at the office.  Etc.  Looking at it from this perspective, I would say that gear is just as important as helmet saving one's *life*. 

BTW, there is a local rider who lowsided and hit some boulder on a local twisty road.  He even has the accident on video.  He wore all his gear, didn't pass out, and since the bike was rideable, he continued with his ride buddies.  In the evening time, he started passing out.  He went to the hospital and it turns out that he was bleeding internally and already lost a ridiculous amount of blood.  If he went to sleep that night, he would've died with 100% certainty.  Who knows what the situation would've been if he didn't wear leathers and all that armour... 

Quality armour is rated in EU based on how much impact it can absorb, just like helmets.  So even against impact, it helps quite a bit.  Try standing and then dropping on your knees on concrete and see how that feels - then try doing it with quality armour...

Obviously, it wasn't from Chinese to English, but used a range of intermediary languages. The Chinese had knowledge of Persian and a variety of Indian languages, and so did the Europeans, so they met somewhere in the middle and basically worked out the equivalents in Latin, from which they furthered translations to Portuguese, Italian, and later, English. However, English translations of Chinese words didn't really come into play in a big way until after Macartney in 1793, who wasn't even able to find someone to explain to him how important kow-towing is to the Chinese, in English.

As for your specific imperator/rex designation, it was because rex = 王, or sometimes translated as hegemon, because 皇帝 denoted the coming of a unified China in the Qin dynasty, instead of the more local hegemons and smaller states of the Spring/Autumn and Warring Nations periods. In fact Qin Shi Huang specifically made his title greater than the standard 王. So it's comparable. Yaoguai, if you break it down, 妖怪, they both carry the definition of evil and strange, so it's also analogous. I think for two very disparate language systems, there are a surprising amount of words that match up fairly well. Normally it's the very specific things that are region-specific that you'd have a harder time translating.

A lot of the more modern concepts also gets in from Japanese, everything from she hui 社会 for society to dian hua 电话 for telephones. I don't speak Japanese so I can't say for how they get their loan words, except their titles of nobility after the Meiji era were named in correspondance to British titles (Baron/Viscount/Earl/Marquess/Duke) and derives from some very, very ancient Chinese words that meant similar ranks (the __爵 construction)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan#Resistance_concerns

&gt;An article coauthored by Dr. Stuart Levy in the August 6, 1998 issue of Nature[19] warned that triclosan's overuse could cause resistant strains of bacteria to develop, in much the same way that antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains are emerging. In 2003, the Scottish Sunday Herald newspaper reported that some UK supermarkets and other retailers were considering phasing out products containing triclosan.[20]

&gt;It has since been shown that the laboratory method used by Dr. Levy was not effective in predicting bacterial resistance for biocides like triclosan.[21] At least seven peer-reviewed and published studies have been conducted demonstrating that triclosan is not significantly associated with bacterial resistance over the short term, including one study coauthored by Dr. Levy.[22]

&gt;Some level of triclosan resistance can occur in some microorganisms, but the larger concern is with the potential for cross-resistance or co-resistance to other antimicrobials. Studies investigating this possibility have been limited.[23] The European Commission Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) concludes that to date, there is no evidence that using triclosan leads to an increase in antibiotic resistance. However it is too early to say that triclosan exposure never leads to microbial resistance, as there is not yet enough information to make a full risk analysis.[24]

What's happening in Africa is due in no small part to the [exporting of religion from Christian evangelicals in the US](http://prospect.org/article/exporting-anti-gay-movement). Our history is replete of witches being burned, homosexuals being slaughtered, atheists and pagans being put to death because Christians were intolerant bigots. Secularism has tempered Christian influence so such things aren't tolerated in Western culture any longer, but that video was a demonstration of what we can expect should secularism fail in the West.

It's not that Islam is an inherently more violent religion than Christianity as you appear to be claiming. It's that most Muslims don't have secular societies to reign in their religious fanatics. You don't see this sort of fanaticism coming out of secular Jordon, for example. By way of contrast, Christian fanatics have stepped up their campaign to reverse the progress created by secular government in the US and in Europe. They're trying to undo social safety nets, reverse civil rights milestones, write discrimination of homosexuals into law and re-write history to claim that separation of church and state is a lie. If you think the wars the US have instigated in the Middle East don't have Christian components to them, you are sadly mistaken.

So as I said for the moment there is more violence in the Muslim world than the Christian world. But that's not for lack of trying on the part of Christians.",t3_vweys,1341196110,atheism,0,1429276012,,,0,0,0,spaceghoti,t1_c5893kv,False,,t5_2qh2p,0,

&gt;I think your problem is that YOU have to pay for YOUR coverage.

Where did you get this from?  Nothing in the post you replied do had anything to do with this.

&gt;I want Universal Health care and would pay for it, but only if it's fair, which it will never be.

So you want it, but only under impossible conditions?  I think that sentence contradicts itself.

&gt;...what is the percentage? 85%? 85% of Americans have health insurance... that leave 15%, that 15% is not made up of simply poor people. If it were there would be no ""tax"" or ""penalty (or whatever you want to call it) for those who choose not to cover themselves but can.

&gt;200 billion is the estimated revenue from this new ""penalty"". that's a shitload of money and it's ONLY being asked of people who could have afforded health insurance in the first place but choose not to.

&gt;This is against everything this ""free"" society was built on. What is next? we all have to chip in for your housing that you decided not to spend your earnings on? Your education? where does it stop becoming a free society and become a taxation nanny state? That is it all too expensive is not the issue, if people really cared, they'd try to find a way to bring costs down, not get the money from their neighbor.

It seems like you're misunderstanding the purpose of the penalty.  It's not a random tax to syphon money from people who choose not to have insurance - it's a necessary sidekick to[ the provision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Provisions) that guarantees coverage for people regardless of pre-existing conditions.  Due to the guarantee of coverage, people could theoretically forego insurance until only when they need it.  The penalty is there to discourage this.  It's a trade-off - PPACA makes sure everyone can get insurance if they want to buy it, but if you choose not to, the penalty is there to make sure you don't take advantage of the system.

&gt; But after the penalty, what does the percentage drop to then? 1-2%? and where does that money go? did we get some kind of universal care? Nope, nothing was added, a guy who pays the penalty still gets medical bills, so what's changed? The insurance companies bottom line that's what.

Yes, unfortunately some people will still be uninsured, but it is still a step in the right direction of universal healthcare.  If by ""that money"" you mean the penalty for not having insurance, you are wrong in saying it goes to ""the insurance companies' bottom line"".  It goes to the government via income tax returns.

&gt;don't you think our fund would be better spent making sure those people had access to care rather than those who can afford it but choose not to?

PPACA *IS* focused on getting insurance to people who cannot get it.  Regrettably, it doesn't cover everyone, but if your goal is universal coverage, it's way closer than the GOP's alternative.

&gt;when you guys speak you make it sound like no one is covered, no one at all. 

um, OK.

&gt;OR you tell us it's too expensive (which it is) but do nothing to reduce the cost, just say we need to get other people to pay more... we say wtf? where are the caps? where is the regulation to drive costs down? where are the ideas? Nowhere, the only idea dems seem to have is to make other people pay for ""you""

Back to [those provisions I mentioned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Provisions)... many of them are for this exact purpose.

&gt;why aren't you out there representing the middle class saying you'd pay for an increased share? I know you are middle class.. you have a computer, internet access etc... surely you can afford 10.00 extra a week no?

&gt;The republicans viewpoint is that you want more.. for nothing.

&gt;That to us, is not fair. I don't want to see you die because you can't pay for meds.. not at all but if you have a job, you need to pay something. Not just me.

No, no, no.  As I stated before, PPACA isn't about making others pay for freeloaders.  It's about making it more affordale and guaranteed to people who want to pay for it.

&gt;I do not know a single republican/conservative that thinks someone who is destitute simply die of their illness and that is severely overblown, all we ever hear is people like you on a pedestal saying how we want you to all die.. yes that'll work for getting us all together, call us evil and stupid every day.

&gt;Please spare me the hyperbole ok? this is not how we think.

Yeah, you guys just trash the idea because of the penalty spin the GOP has latched onto, without looking deeper into the whole PPACA.  And then you offer no viable alternatives, which was the entire point of the OP.  DID YOU WATCH THE VIDEO???  How is that not worthy of ridicule?

&gt;If you're on board with making 50 million people join insurance companies coffers instead of real change, that's on you. Me, I want reform of the system itself, the rates are outrageous, fees are ridiculous and it keeps going up, with no oversight, now Obama just handed them 50 million new subscribers, do you think costs are going to go down??

Again...[ you may want to read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Provisions).  There are provisions to reduce cost of healthcare.  Please show me a viable republican alternative.

&gt;***I vote republican*** because I believe that you must have some sort of responsibility for this lush life we all have, no one is tilling the corn field, no one is pickin cotton.. you all have flat screen TV's and iPhones.. stop whining. If you want real change, make it happen and trash this stupid bill and *start over with Universal Healthcare* where everyone (who can) pays. When it's a choice between living and a a new shiny iPad, the best choice is the meds, not joining a protest line after you've visited the apple store.

And finally, you vote republican but want universal healthcare?  Maybe you missed this little tidbit IN THE TITLE OF THE OP:

&gt;WALLACE: I just want to ask, what specifically are you going to do to provide universal coverage to the 30 million people who are uninsured?

**Mephedrone**

&gt;4-Methylmethcathinone is a synthetic stimulant with empathogenic effects. Between 2007 and 2009, it became available for purchase online, was used increasingly in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, associated with several deaths, and, as a result, was controlled in some countries. Because of the similarity in names, it is sometimes confused with 'Methedrone' (4-methoxymethcathinone) or 'Methylone' (bk-MDMA).

**MDPV**

&gt;MDPV is an uncommon stimulant with a short history of human use. It is known for its tendency to cause compulsive redosing and some users report sexual arousal as an effect. MDPV has been found in products labeled as ""bath salts"" and ""plant food/fertilizer"".

IQ is not a Genetic attribute which keeps on getting averaged everytime a mother and father with different IQ mate, if that were the case then we will all have a tendency to average out and become 100(the average IQ). Even if super selective and high IQ people decided to mate with only those who are high IQ, they will too average down and start leading towards 100 IQ(although they would move there slowly).

This not even genetics, this is simple Mathematics. Even if IQ worked like you said it does, the Mathematics doesn't follow. Unless a kid has an ability to have an IQ higher than of either of the parents or lower than either of the parents, you would never see an IQ like 140, 130 or 80 etc.

IQ(if it is a real thing, and is genetic) and almost every genetic attribute we have is carried over either by dominent or recessive traits or through mutations. To put it simply, if you have a genetic characteristic such as blue eyes, it could either be both or one of your parents having blue eyes(dominent), or both or one of your parents carrying it over their their parents(recessive), OR it could be that you had a genetic mutation(that you developed it as first of your kind).

White people have white skins because they lived in a cold weather. That doesn't mean cold weather turns your skin into white, rather when someone in cold weather had a pale skinned kid as mutation and a dark skinned kid as mutation, the pale skinned kid survived better. Same thing goes with Black people.

Since the mutations which existed in these places sustained for a time long enough to have major skin color differentiation, it means that there must be mutations in european people which does not exist in Africans and Asians and vice versa, but since we are not animals, and our whole world runs on reason than animalistic desires, if a mutation affects us in a way that we become more 'animalistic', you would have an equal chance to be killed by the society in Africa for being a serial killer or a psychotic murderer than you would in Europe.

To put it simply, since we have used the ability of reason to tame weather, the physical traits don't matter, that is having a pale skin is no more of an advantage in colder regions than having a dark skin in hotter regions, your kid wouldn't survive more or less if he is black or brown or white. 

Similarly, any other non-physical genetic traits you may think humans 
may have, you have an equal chance of creating a crazy mass murderer baby with a white woman as much as with a black woman. 

Finally even if somehow you could figure out that there is a certain genetic trait more prominent among Asians, and not found among whites, having a baby is playing gentic lottery, you have no idea where you may land.

&gt; Looking at their material over the last two months, their position has consistently been that Assad should be overthrown by a revolution of the Syrian working class - and that they're opposed to the US-backed regime change effort precisely because it's hostile to that project:

&gt; In [US war provocations against Syria](http://www.wsws.org/mobile/articles/2012/feb2012/pers-f06.shtml), they argue that ""the task of dealing with the Assad regime belongs to the Syrian working class, not a right-wing armed opposition acting as a proxy for Washington and its European allies, who are preparing to unleash a bloodbath in the country. Assad must be overthrown as part of a struggle of the entire Arab and international working class ... directed first and foremost against imperialism."" 

&gt; In a piece criticizing the [NPA's endorsement of foreign intervention](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/mar2012/npas-m08.shtml), they reject the US-backed rebellion on the grounds that it's ""not a struggle by the Syrian working class, the only force that can overthrow Assad on a progressive basis, but a struggle against it."" 

&gt; An article [calling out the SWP's backing for the Syrian opposition](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/feb2012/bswp-f15.shtml) (which also does a good job with the idea that the LCC is the 'good' opposition vs. the 'bad' FSA/SNC) concludes by denouncing the SWP's position as ""disarming those workers and oppressed peasants in Syria that are opposing Assad’s brutal regime as to the fate being planned for them and all those throughout the world who seek genuine revolutionary change in the Middle East rather than a Libyan-style abortion.""

&gt; Again in [US sends drones over Syria as fighting spreads](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/feb2012/syri-f20.shtml), they argue the Syrian opposition's failure to win mass support ""only underscores that the task of fighting the Assad regime falls to the Syrian working class, which alone can overthrow it on a progressive basis, while fighting against the imperialist forces that are now trying to conquer Syria.""

&gt; In [another article](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/feb2012/pabl-f13.shtml), they indict a number of 'left' European parties supporting a Syria intervention for not ""warning the Syrian workers of the role of the SFA and demanding a struggle of the working class against both the pro-imperialist forces and Assad. ... The WSWS insists that Assad must be overthrown, but this task belongs only to the Syrian working class as part of a struggle of the entire Arab and international working class."" 

&gt; At a public meeting, the US SEP's [presidential candidate argues](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/mar2012/noca-m15.shtml) ""it is the task of the working class to deal with [Syrian president] Assad, not imperialism."" And so on. 

&gt; Going back even further in the coverage, we can see that your narrative of the WSWS' political attitude undergoing a drastic shift once the prospects of foreign intervention came out is also pretty spurious. Throughout the articles last year, including the ones you cite here, the possibility of the imperialist powers refashioning the Syrian opposition as a proxy for their own interests (which, by definition, means such an opposition would be hostile to the interests of the working class) is brought up again and again.

By culture, I mean the whole package, from religion, to values! There are parts of Paris, or northern Paris, where the only difference between there and north africa/africa: is the surrounding architecture and the climate. In some places (and not only the ghetto, but even Paris intra-muros, you can get spat at/beaten up just because you're smoking a cigarette during Ramadan. North Africans have quite bad press in Europe because they (not all of course, but a majority) are imposing their culture with (and this is the important part here:) very little regard to how the French live. A good example ""the other way round"": imagine if we were to go to *pick any strict middle eastern country* and start setting up churches, strip clubs, coffee shops, bars, pubs, porn cinemas, pork, started walking around half naked like we do in the summer or when going out, etc... and shoved all that in their face with now regard to their local customs/traditions/values and telling them they are fucking racist because they don't let us do what we do back home? 

And here is one very good example you'll hardly be able to argue: Imagine I or you or any other person form outside Asia in this case (just for not constantly picking the African continent, as this example goes for everybody): say my parents work and live in Hong Kong (and FYI: I'm pretty much telling my story here!), I'm born and raised there but I don't go to a chinese school, I do however have chinese classes, meaning I can speak, but I'm clearly not as good as a true chinese. My diet consists of local dishes but also food from home on a regular basis. I'm a christian, and follow christian festivities. I only go home (Europe) during school vacations, my friends are nearly all from ""the west"". (One of) my passports is chinese, but I'm 6""3, blond hair, blue eyes. My parents are German and French.


Now I'm asking you the question, what am I? Chinese? (but this could be any other country in the world) or am I German/French(European)? And just FYI: I went to Europe for my studies, but I'm back working in Asia now. So, does being born and raised in Asia make me Asian? I personally don't feel one bit asian! Hell I've never even had sex with an Asian, it's just not my thing! But I accept, and live by the rules of culture surrounding me and try not to be an ""idiot expat"" thinking I can do what ever pleases me just because my pay is better. 



I hope you see what I'm trying to tell: if you're born and raised in a country, this doesn't make you a countryman until you embrace its values and culture, or at least accept to live surrounded by them. Racism in Europe, is usually (don't get me wrong, ""color-racism"" does exist, which is a shame) a cultural thing, not that it's ok either, but let's say it's a little more justified and understandable. I doubt you'd be ok if we cut a man's hand if he stole something from a shop or perform clitoral excision on women, just because that's what we do back home.


And just for the record: Europe has far less ""problems"" with sub-Saharan africans which keep their ""culture"" to them selves or go around with it more discretely and are generally speaking way more ""integrated"" to European society. So it really (usually) isn't racism based on the color of the skin but more a cultural thing.



So back to our ""Athlete"": you can tell by the way he talks and acts during the interviews available on the web that he clearly isn't a ""French"", but a douche bag Algerian living in France, who won't give a fuck about what's going on around him. He's the kind of guy who give a bad image to North-African cultures, who fuels hate and racism towards these cultures.
You would not believe how different a North African living in his country is different, compared to the unthankful douche-bags who came to Europe because of the welfare system. 

I was once honestly asked in a bar: ""what would you do, benefit from 900€/month in welfare, or work 7hrs/day and be paid 1000€?"" (I'm not sure about the amounts but they are pretty close).

However, I think we also need to be careful of the good we try to do, for example, there are two sides of the issue for even the things you mentioned. You mention the positive concept of ""civilizing"" society....we must be very careful here in discussing this. Sure, Christianity introduced a lot of medicine to peoples, but in a sense, much of that ""civilization"" is closely linked to ""colonization"", which is often negative in many ways (think white Europeans forcing Bibles on Africans and Native Americans before killing/enslaving them, and creating a legacy of racism).

I will also say that Christianity did a good job at retaining and even advancing knowledge during the dark ages. Even today, Christians have a tendency to help others, and even though I am no longer Christian, I have respect for the more moderate Christians and the good work they do.

That being said, I still think Christianity (as well as other applicable religions) should be called out when they do stop progress. Like look at the whole Galileo thing. The Catholic Church, if I remember right did not admit they were wrong on that until 1992. You know, 400 years late to the party and all. And let's face it, Christianity is dead wrong about sexuality...they also need to stop being so obsessed with it. While teaching abstinence is okay, abstinence only like many Christian groups like to push actually leads to more problems than it's worth (higher teen pregnancy rates...so much for abstaining). Churches also need to stop focusing on contraception so much...the misinformation they present is ridiculous. And honestly? Yeah, Africa should start using it...idk why the Catholic church is so obsessed with standing firm against it. And then there's the whole anti-intellectual movement you mentioned, etc.

I don't deny Christianity's positive impact in the past and even today, but at the same time, I have to say the societal costs of religion are beginning to outweigh the benefits. Many of the benefits can still be accomplished in a secular society (see: Europe), and many of the teachings are just too rigid. The biggest problem with religion, when you come right down to it, is its rigidness, it DOES NOT ADAPT WELL TO CHANGE. As I mentioned with the Galileo post at the beginning of my post, religion often opposes progress in many ways, and is sometimes several hundred years late to the party...if it ever modernizes at all.  Probably the biggest problem with religion is so many of the teachings are outdated and while they may have made sense hundreds (if not thousands) of years ago, they don't apply today...even though we still have people pushing them today....in many ways religion is stuck in the past...and I'm not just discussing Christianity here, it's many other religions too...including, say, Islam. I think this is why so many people are deconverting (and it has a role in my own deconversion as well)....the younger generations are beginning to see how horribly outdated many religious teachings are and jumping ship.",t3_vwre6,False,atheism,0,1429277241,no-knight,,1,0,1,JonWood007,t1_c58bpgb,False,Agnostic Atheist,t5_2qh2p,0,

It used to be that we Christian Europeans were a bunch of ignoramouses who thought the way to cure diseases was to whip ourselves than to actually cure people. I'd argue scientific and social progress is at least partially independent of church. Many societies throughout history who were not Christian were at the forefront of progress....it just so happens that the way the world is now is correlated with Christianity.

If anything really spurs on progress, it seems to be a lack of religion. The first modern democracy (US) was founded on religious freedom and keeping church and state separate. Many scientists were silenced by the catholic church when they reported their discoveries. Some of the least religious countries nowadays have the best social welfare programs.

Look at team fortress 2: one of the most popular team based shooter games for years. The game does not portray any females except the voice of an announcer who mocks you and orders you around. The men in the game are nothing but mildly offensive stereotypes: Brooklyn street punk, tough as nails sergeant, pyromaniac, black Scottish drunk, big dumb Russian, gun toting Texan, mad German doctor, Australian wannabe crocodile hunter, and a European spy. Still the player demographic feels like it's split 10:1 *at best*. Left 4 dead does not fare any better (and it has much more reasonable characterization). 

How about real time strategy games? Starcraft 2 contains two fully androgynous races along with the human Terran which still includes prominent females (Kerrigan, banshee pilot, medivac pilot, female ghosts.) The player base is again feels 10:1 and is even worse at the highest levels of competition. 

It's almost like male/female engagement has little to do with how their respective genders are portrayed and more to do with the game play. Incredibly competitive games (where the players interact strongly with each other) seem to be much more popular with men. The more violent a game gets the more it puts women off.... I am not saying this as a judgement of the female condition: rather an observation of reality. 

The gaming industry in a way has grown too big. The fan base demands nothing but triple A titles from big developers which cost millions of dollars to make. In order to turn a profit these titles cannot just succeed but have to sell amazingly well: if not the investment for one game can bankrupt a studio. As a result publishers have been taking the easy way out: produce sequels, do not challenge the status quo, do not take risks. There are too many examples of games that took risks, got positive reviews, but cost their studios money because they just didn't sell. Trying to change the appeal of an IP can be a great way to go bankrupt. ",t3_vvvz4,False,Feminism,0,1429277313,,,0,0,0,throwaway6432,t1_c58buym,False,,t5_2qr7i,0,

So in other words, you don't know anything at all about the country, and you've never visited, but  you want to plan your life around moving here?  Ooookay.  Go to university and study for a career doing something that other people will pay you lots of money to do *and* that is internationally mobile.  Don't get some ridiculous bachelors degree in 18th Century American Literature if you want to move to another country.  Engineering or computer science would be the best.  Graduate and work for a few years.  While you're working, visit Germany.  Don't just visit Berlin, visit *Germany*.  Also visit other countries, so you can compare them.

Germany is far from perfect, and it is definitely *not* whatever it is you're imagining it to be (""the weather""?  What the fuck?).  It is a conservative and sometimes racist country, wages are stagnant (and employers are pushing more and more for wage-dumping laws like the recent Blue Card), there are massive demographic problems that are coming up in the next few decades that no one knows how to fix, the EU and the Euro may not be around in 2020, and our eastern states are locked in a perpetual cycle of not having enough jobs to keep people living there, and not enough people to attract employers.  The weather is not that great, being in central Europe and all, and the government is full of incompetent fools.

My point, in short, is that you won't get anything approaching a full picture just by reading things or worse, talking to a teenage girl.  You may spend a week in Germany and discover you hate it here (many foreigners do, particularly Americans), but the next week find that the Côte d’Azur is perfect for you.

- (This is the electrical outlet used in Finland)[http://0.tqn.com/d/goscandinavia/1/G/_/2/-/-/europeanoutlet.jpg] I have a portable outlet converter which allows me to use my electrical devices in UK, US, and other places. Was very cheap, bought from some airport many years ago.

- Usually Visa cards should work OK. Of course, carrying some cash is a good idea; tickets to public transport and small things such as some ice-cream are generally easier to pay with cash.

- Round-trip ferry ticket price varies heavily. If you want to get to Estonia as fast as possible, there are 'speed boats' which only takes ~2 hours to reach Tallinn. Those are cheap, like 20 euros. If you want to take a more luxurious trip with an over-night Ferry, ticket costs more, depending if you take the cheapest cabin or a more better one.

- Stockholm can be reached via ferries (not very efficient, but especially Silja Serenade / Silja Symphony are ferries worth seeing with an inside city-like street (""Promenade""), many varieties of restaurants and night clubs, a spa and stuff like that. 

Of course you can also hop to a plane and fly from Helsinki-Vantaa airport to Arlanda, Stockholm. From Arlanda airport you can take the Airport Express train, which takes you to Stockholm downtown in around 30 minutes or so.

- St. Petersburg can be reached by ferry, too, but then there's a fast train called Allegro, which goes to St. Peterburg in four hours (if I remember the time right).

- No idea about your driver's license validity.

- At least your passport should work fine for bars, clubs etc. My general impression is that bar staff is very foreigner-friendly, at least if you are not completely wasted. :-)

- If you visit Helsinki, take a short boat trip to (Suomenlinna)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomenlinna]! Ticket costs only couple of euros, the boat trip takes perhaps 20 minutes, but the Suomenlinna island is a very surreal place for you to see. Might want to visit it on a sunny or at least non-rainy day. 

- While I type this, it's cloudy, a bit rainy and windy and around +15C here in Helsinki. The magazines are trying to tell us it's getting warmer this week, I don't believe it before I see.

- Helsinki pubs/bars/coffee shops: for a sunny day, in downtown there are terraces mbar and Lasipalatsin Laituri which are both very nice. If the weather is not nice, then Storyville has some nice Jazz background music and a very nice atmosphere. Teerenpeli has its own beer brewery.

In addition for the past 60 years or so colleges ( and history in general for that matter) has been moving away from the political/military side of history which had previously dominated towards social history.  If you are are totally committed to teaching the history of the civil war then focus on something unique such as the role of blacks in the civil and reconstruction or the role of women or Hispanics or native Americans. Specializing in something outside of the strictly political or military realm will greatly increase your chances of employment, while still allowing you to teach the occasional military history class.

This includes not just the military service and arming of all men of military age with assault rifles(!), but also an extensive bunker system throughout their mountains and plans for the blowing of major infrastructure (tunnels, bridges) that would make it extremely difficult and slow-going for an invading army to advance without fear of getting cut off from supply lines.

Sure, they have a small population and would eventually be overwhelmed by a large and determined foe, but their intention is to provide a deterrent by ensuring that any invasion would be extremely costly for an attacker. They would play to their strengths, have mountain-specialized troops and contingencies for guerilla warfare using the ""home advantage"" of incredibly rugged terrain and a well-armed population. There are many valleys that are virtually inaccessible during winter even in peace time - imagine how easy they would be to defend by local troops who know every chokepoint and every little escape route. Tanks, in particular, would be useless in many of these places.

Of course, another more traditional way they have avoided getting invaded by evil dictators is by providing them with anonymous banking services...

An interesting historical side-note. The Swiss weren't always neutral and did get involved in European wars (medieval and renaissance era). Several greater powers tried to invade them and generally got their asses handed to them. The Swiss were considered the scariest mercenaries in Europe.

There is a large subsection of the Arab population in France that is completed assimilated into French culture, and while they may have Muslim backgrounds they are like many French people with Catholic backgrounds, in that they identify with but don't practice their religion. Most of these people come from the first large generations of arab immigrants (and their kids) from Algeria after the French occupation ended. From this particular group you won't find many women wearing veils, for example. 


Also I think that the more recent wave of immigration from Arab countries over the last 20 years is slowing down considerably. The inequalities between life in many arab countries and Europe is equalizing so the desire to immigrate is diminishing. 


Furthermore, for better or worse, depending on how you see the issue,  that if the population of muslims really did start to get that high, that France and other European countries would really start to crack down on immigration to the point where almost no one is allowed in.

Te rog eu fain. Asta ca sa nu ne prefacem in victime cand nu suntem.

Cat despre partea cu Basescu, apai imi pare rau, ori ai trait intr-o pestera ori esti basist convins, din moment ce inca trebuie sa mai intrebi de practicile neconstitutionale ale lui Basescu.

Normal ca nu e chiar atat de idiot incat sa incalce pe fata, mai ales dupa ce l-au suspendat prima data, insa numai cine nu vrea nu a observat in ce hal s-a bagat peste guvern in ultimii ani, cum l-a renumit pe Boc de vreo 3,4 ori chiar daca, in spiritul Constitutiei, existau alte variante mai normale, cum isi baga coada in justitie la fiecare ocazie.

**PARANTEZA.** Stiati ca seful DNA, precum presedintele, are drepturi la doar doua mandate? In cazul de fata, Moraru. Daca ne uitam la istoria sa, a fost numit de Basescu pt un mandat. Dupa ce i s-a terminat, a stat cateva luni ca interimar, dupa care a fost renumit ca sef pt al doilea mandat. CARE I S-A TERMINAT LA INCEPUTUL ANULUI. De atunci, a ajuns deja la al doilea ""interimat"", sustinut fiind de fiecare data de mister president.

Asta ca sa vezi cum se joaca Basescu cu legile. **Nu le incalca, insa le umileste.**

Si pana la urma nici nu e vorba 100% de faptul ca incalca legi. De cand a venit presedinte, nu am mai avut o singura zi normala la varf. Toti premierii au avut de munca cu el.

Let me open with the fact that the Armée 21 (the modern army enacted in 2006) is a drastically reduced force intended to preserve the institution of the army more than anything else.  For example, they slashed funding, cut the term of service from 25 years to 10, and cut the number of effective personel from 500,000 to 200,000.  This was done because inteligence and political analysis suggests that switzerland is safe from invasion for at least 30 to 40 years, barring major socio-political upheaval in europe.  Were a major exigent threat to show itself, a referendum to institute some new 'Armée 22' would go out almost immediately to restore the army to a respectable state, which it could realistically do within a year or so: far from the 48-hour mobilization the army is supposed to have, but thems the breaks.

So, for the purposes of this discussion, I'm going to talk about the 'Armée 95' (the numbers are fucking weird, deal with it).  I should note that the Armée 95 is itself reduced from the Armée 61, which was geared towards cold-war threats (and had a few less than respectable projects during its term).  I think that this is fair, considering you're talking about WWII.

The Army during this time was geared around camoflage and artilery.  Every square centimeter of land, habitable or otherwise, is in range of at least one permanent, camoflaged, artillery fortress, often more than one.  There are a respectable number of airbases, some hidden, some not.  I should mention that when I say 'hidden base', I do not mean cammo netting over the runway or cannons.  I mean a bunker dug into the mountain, with a hole for launching aircraft, or an underground artillery installation under a cow pasture. [Here's a video showing some of the decomissioned instalations.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEOLonBfaD8) Its a fair bet in switzerland that you're always next to or on top of a secret bunker, and that's in addition to the mandatory fallout shelters in every civilian structure (this isn't strictly true: every civilian home must have either a fallout shelter or a reserved space in the municipal fallout shelter.  Close enough for an overview though).  Good luck finding the 2m diameter hatch in the forest, or the nondescript door in the city that leads to it.

As for tanks, planes, and helicopters: Switzerland does have a fairly large tank division in Thun, which is a city that has a large, not very hidden army base mostly devoted to armored divisions.  This is mostly for mobile fire support on plains, where unsupported infantry are less effective against a properly mechanized army.  In my opinion, tanks are overrated in modern combat, especially considering nearly half of switzerland is impenetrable to armor, because of mountains and rivers that are no longer crossable by bridge (because the first thing the army does in the event of invasion is to blow every bridge and tunnel in the country).  Add to that the omnipresent artillery cover, and armor is of limited use in switzerland.  Planes on the other hand, are limited to reconnaisance and anti-air capabilities (supplemented by ground-based AAA and AAM, also often camoflaged).  To be fair, we only have 12 fighter jets, but they are again mostly for support.  Air power is heavily weakened by proper camoflage, as you cannot bomb what you cannot see, especially when what you cannot see can see you and shoot you down.  And try doing low altitude bombing in switzerland in a supersonic aircraft: you're gonna have a bad time.  Finally, I will admit that switzerland has a lack of combat helicopters in my opinion.  All of our heli's are transport choppers, but remember that attack helicopters are for direct fire support, which again is supplied by complete artilery cover.

This is the modern army (as of 10 years ago, but still).  No one says it could have defeated Hitler's army in WWII, which was however many tens of times the size of the swiss army, or repelled a russian advance during the cold war, which was (and still is) incomparably enormous.  What it could have done, and did do for all intents, is demand an enormous expenditure by any invading force in terms of manpower and resources, for relatively little gain.  Switzerland is strong for its industry (which wouldn't survive an invasion), its banking, it's tunnels (which would have been destroyed), and its intelligence assets (in the cold war at least, which also would have been unrecoverable).  Switzerland could have easily required germany to dedicate 1 or 2 million troops (5% to 10% of germany's *entire army*) to a swiss invasion during wartime.  For a hunk of barely inhabitable land in the mountains.

That is why switzerland can say it has a powerful army, and why it has never been sucessfully invaded since the Napoleonic Wars.  And this doesn't even touch upon the diplomatic corps, which is switzerland's real defense.

British politicians do not pad their speeches with obligatory references to God, British fundamentalists do not bomb abortion clinics or bully gays into suicide (well, not so much since Alan Turing), and British residents don't ask ""what church do you go to?"" as the first question of new neighbors, or ""have you found Jesus?"" as a conversation starter on a bus. For all of its bishops in the Lower House (?) and a figurehead of state who is nominally the head of the church, England is pleasantly secular like most of Europe.

I am not sure that's how the issue was framed (racist/sexist language/statement =&gt; racist/sexist =&gt; no tolerance for racists/sexists on air)

The statement of the President of NBC News and the CBS President and Chief Executive Officer at that time, didn't even talk about his intentions, but only about the damage his words have supposedly caused.

It's rather seems to be ""racist/sexist language/statement about young black black women =&gt; racist/sexist statement, hurts people, oppresses young black women"".

[That part](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus#Accusations_of_defamatory_speech) of his wikipedia article doesn't give me the impression, as if it was some totally innocent guy, who just slipped up one time, but rather as somebody who walked on thin ice the whole time (sometimes in the name of comedy?). So that might have contributed as well. At least an Chicago Tribune columnist referred to him as a ""repeat offender"".

&gt;Hence my reasoning for supporting using racial slurs in non racist ways to force discussion on context. That might not be necessary in other countrys though.

If you agree with my previous point, the question is rather if the public perception of the harm is correct and that's really hard to tell for a huge country like the US.

You must have done quite a lot of harm, if it justifies to lose your job, even if you apologize.

In Destiny's case, I am pretty sure people overestimated it quite a bit. In my opinion no damage at all would have been caused, if he acknowledged that the way he expressed his rage was too easy to misunderstand as being racist. Internet gaming communities in general just aren't that racist. If he doesn't acknowledge it and others join his ""protest"", I can't tell in front of which audiences they emulate him and if I can blame him at all for that.

I guess we would also have to take into account, how it may affect the perception of internet communities in the eyes of the general public and if it may make someone feel unwelcome and so on and so on. But that's certainly not something that is only restricted to racial slurs as insults, but applies to any form of controversy/offense.

&gt;I think spread of racism was more of a problem pre-internet, when it was much harder to have contact with other races/nationalities. Nowadays most people have had enough experiences with other races to realize that we are all really the same. 

* There is certainly not as much racism based on outdated ideas like colonialism, slavery and weird race pseudo science. But race based stereotyping certainly exists and can make it disadvantageous to be of one race or another, depending on where you live/get your education/work and so on.

* I think it's still fair to say, that it's generally easier to get in jail in the US if you are black/hispanic and that people might find it easier to think of you as a criminal, if you are black/hispanic. Just look at the incarceration rates by race: [4.8 % of black men were in prison, compared to 0.7 % of white men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rate_by_race_2.gif). So even if law enforcement officers aren't racists in any way, if most inmates are blacks, you might stereotype based on that. It obviously also matters if a person is poor or not and so on, but race is something you can't hide and you don't have to checkup on. It might also go like that: ""black =&gt; poor"", ""poor =&gt; criminal"", ""black =&gt; criminal"" (I am obviously oversimplifying stastistical inferences, just read ""=&gt;"" as ""characteristic increases probablity of following characteristic"" ). Clothing plays a huge rule though, because it could indicate that someone doesn't fit into the stereotype.

* [18 % of Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_religion_conspiracy_theories#cite_note-22) are ready to believe that a black (mixed race) president of the US who claims to be christian, is a muslim. As far as I understand that's mostly because of the association of ""black culture"" with Nation of Islam, Malcolm X, Muhammed Ali and so on and not just because of his background (visiting indonesia, ancestry from kenya). I don't think that allegation would work, if a person with the same background was white. It may also be just a way to secretly express their racism, but that's just speculation.

* [Most black people vote democratic (but aren't as supportive of gay rights as most democrats)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29#African_Americans). That could be seen as indicative of a political system divided on issues of race.

* [Interracial marriages are more common than before, but still much, much less probable than same race marriages.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States#Black_and_White)

* [The income gap between races (and sexes)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_gender_pay_gap,_by_sex,_race-ethnicity.001.png)

If you add to all that the immigration issues with hispanics (which are more comparable to race-based issues in europe) it add ups to a picture of a lot of racial prejudice rather than a postracial society.

Having a black (mixed race) president certainly makes it harder to believe that race could hinder pursuing any career paths though, which should make it harder to ""oppress"" someone just by saying some phrase. It's pretty stupid that someone may have an advantage as a candidate, because of his race and because it's a first, but well, it's still a big deal. I wonder if the reaction to Imus would have been the same, after Obama's election.

&gt;I think if someone like Hitler came along again it would be much more difficult for him to convince his people to hate another race.

Thoughts of racial supremacy were still common, mainly because of colonialism ([germany had colonies before WW1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire)) and [racial pseudo science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism), but I think [**this**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth) should give you an idea, that it wasn't just about about the inferiority of one race or another, but also about blaming one group/race of people for everything.

You have to keep in mind that the Weimar Republic was pretty unstable. The country just lost 10 years ago a [war for which it had to pay reparations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_reparations), suffered [hyperinflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_republic#Years_of_crisis_.281919.E2.80.931923.29) and 10 years later another [economic crisis comes along](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_Central_Europe). [The political climate at the end was pretty crazy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic#Decline_.281930.E2.80.931933.29). Many who supported the right wing, only did so, because they were even more afraid of the [left wing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany#The_Weimar_Republic_years).

If another terrorist attack, more severe than 9/11, would happen and people would blame it on some [arabs in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_American) and the US would find itself in an economic crisis, which is blamed on those attacks and destabilizes the political system. Are you really sure, that it would be impossible for someone to come along and to convince the population to hate on [arabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people) and maybe even get elected, based on that?

I put the monk on hold for a while and came back after patch with a very different approach. I use a Thunderclap + Cyclone crit build (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/monk#akYiXg!ZUX!aaccbY), with close to 40% crit chance, 220% crit dmg, 37k dps after Breath of Heaven (defensive stats are: 800@, 6+k armor with enchantress, negligible LoH). It wasn't very cheap gear but not crazy expensive either (somewhere between 20 and 30 mill maybe?). 

I can farm a3 comfortably with a few deaths per run (but the kill speed easily makes up for it compared to tank builds), you just have to realize you are NOT a tank. You have to hit-n-run and kite while waiting for blind and serenity to come up, then burst down a target. On easy packs you can burst down 1 minion / elite at the time and survive by the health globes, on harder ones you have to kite, hit-n-run to keep your wind up and burst.

True,c58de5p,t1_c58cfzn,1341223557,"&gt; You European bastards and your diesel hatchbacks probably had even more LEGO sets that I'm completely ignorant of considering they're produced in your area.

I'm not really sure about that, but I have no way of disproving that. It was probably just as expensive as it is today.

I just remember that LEGO was my favorite toy. Nothing else could beat it. If we went to the mall my mom and dad could just place me in the toy store. I'd spend the entire day in there while they shopped in peace. But lo-and-behold if I didn't get any LEGO all hell would break lose. I'd scream and cry all the way home, complaining how completely unfair it was for them to buy groceries for themselves, while I didn't get anything. I must've been a royal pain back then.

I don't think if I was mindfucked about the shark's mouth, [but this vessel](http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8299) (which is still the only thing I haven't torn apart yet) absolutely amazed me.

I still have most of my LEGO stuff at my moms. I plan on handing it down to my future kid.

Yes, I'm from Denmark, the birthplace of LEGO. Needless to say LEGO is extremely popular here. Everyone has had at least a few boxes worth of pieces at some point in their childhood.

By the way, you should take a trip down memory lane via [lugnet.com](http://www.lugnet.com/), an online forum for LEGO enthusiasts.
