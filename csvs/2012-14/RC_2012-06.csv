Valuations, when not made explicitly public, are often guessed at by the player's wages and release clause - nobody ever shells out that amount of money, the clause is just there to ensure that bids are competitive and that other clubs offer a lot of money for the player. The clubs in the Portuguese league have a tried and trusted method of bringing in young talent (especially from Brazil) and giving them European experience and selling them on at a higher price. Clubs slap unnecessarily high release clauses on players that they think have promise, and nobody does this more than clubs like Porto or Benfica. A player's actual value is more likely to be around half the release clause value or less. The reasons we're paying so much for him are numerous.

1. He has a deal with Porto until 2016. Buying out contracts is expensive.

2. He's not even fully owned by Porto, and therefore we must buy him completely as third-party ownership is disallowed in the UK. They've also paid a lot to get 85% ownership of him as it is.

3. He's a Brazilian international.

4. We just won the Champions' League, and everyone knows we're rich anyway.

5. The media were told that his buyout clause was €100 million. There was no reason not to believe this, release clauses are normally that ridiculous. Therefore the club believed this too and made a reasonable offer, along with the reasons stated above.

&gt;67.0 percent were victims of an offender’s anti-Jewish bias.

&gt;12.7 percent were victims of an anti-Islamic bias.

&gt;4.2 percent were victims of an anti-Catholic bias.

&gt;3.0 percent were victims of an anti-Protestant bias.

&gt;**0.5 percent were victims of an anti-Atheist/Agnostic bias.**

&gt;9.1 percent were victims of a bias against other religions (anti-other religion).

&gt;3.5 percent were victims of a bias against groups of individuals of varying religions (anti-multiple religions, group).

Keep in mind that there are about 10 times less Jews and Muslims (combined) in the United States than nonreligious people, implying that there is much more *actual* hate directed at them than atheists and agnostics.

Not to mention, ***THIS IS ONLY RELIGIOUS GROUPING.*** So many more people are actually victims of hate crimes because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Atheists are at the bottom of the ""most hated"" list by all practical standards.

Atheists are one of the *least persecuted groups in the United States.*

*""Here is the crisis of the universe. God disentangled the primitive chaos; the French will unravel the feudal chaos . . . Kings make impious war on us with slave soldiers and extorted money; we will make a holy war with free soldiers and patriotic contributions.""* -- Anacharsis Cloots

From the beginning of the Revolution there was an onset of emigration from the nation. The émigrés, as they are often known, often were from the borders and locations where an invasion was most feared. In this climate, the émigrés were accused of plotting against the nation in attempting to restore the Ancien Régime. As such, the Deputies from these areas were highly combative. 

On August 27th, 1791 came the first indication of war, as we're commonly taught. The [Declaration of Pillnitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Pillnitz) was a statement from the Austrian Leopold II and Prussian Frederick William II in support of the émigrés and Louis XVI. Though the declaration was made in part to please the émigrés, it was more of a statement of peace than of war. Leopold was occupied with foreign policy issues in the east, hostility to enlightened reforms made by Joseph II and he saw the benefit in creating an enlightened state. While Marie-Antoinette was in a certain perilous position, declaring war to get her back would only have made it more likely that she would be in danger.

Knowing that it was highly unlikely for Britain to join in a war, the document was specifically worded such that Austria would only go to war if *all* major powers did so. This satisfied the need to remain firm in the face of danger to the monarchy, and suitably avoid a war. The above seems to make it even more ridiculous that France would declare war. There was, however, a major miscalculation in this move. Had this declaration been made against any other nation, it's doubtful that war would have broken out. The Declaration of Pillnitz was written in the language of diplomats, but France spoke the language of citizens. This was a language of transparency, honesty, and directness. Read like this, the Declaration of Pillnitz was not only a direct threat of war, but an international insult to the very sovereignty of the people of France.

Added to this was a foreign policy philosophy reminiscent of what later was Manifest Destiny in America. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen were seen to apply universally, not just to those who lived in France. Liberation clubs partially composed of foreigners were popular in Paris. The two political atmospheres combined -- one of fear of invasion, the other of moral superiority -- formed a spirit of ""crusading self-righteousness."" The capstone to this was a speech to the National Assembly on October 14th by Jacques Pierre Brissot.

Brissot simultaneously drew up a list of complaints against the European powers while hinting at plots by them to take action against France. While others had done as much before, Brissot tied it with the direct national interest of France. France's national honor depended upon war.

France's belligerent aspects were now fully engaged. The press and certain Deputies pounced fully on evidence that there were Austrian troop movements on the borders, and the rhetoric of war was printed throughout the provinces. If one reads from prominent figures in the day, it's clear that there was a certain excitement about. As I mentioned, it can very much be compared to Manifest Destiny in America or even the Communist idea of global Revolution. There was no logic or practicality, only emotion and national spirit. 

I think this post is long enough as is that the technicalities of the war against Austria actually being declared are unnecessary, but the major points are as follow. On January 1st, 1792, the émigrés were declared to be traitors and their lands were confiscated. Austria demanded the liberation of the Royal family and some land restorations on the 17th. On February 7th, Austria formed an alliance with Prussia. Government changes in both France and Austria to much more belligerent ministers all but guaranteed war. On April 20th, complaints against Austria were heard and war was quickly demanded.",0,1429042062,[deleted],1338511886,t1_c4urdv8,0,AskHistorians,True,,,False,t3_uejxe,0,t3_uejxe,

I am a pirate, so its not that I condemn the issue of pirating software or content. But I do think there is a requirement for ""justified"" piracy. I think the content has to be one of the below:

 * blatantly overpriced (at $99 or less, windows isn't IMO). Correct example IMO: a movie I'm going to watch once. I'm not paying 25€ for a new cd or DVD. I never watch those more than once. (And yes, if I do, I actually do buy it)

 * has crappy DRM that actually puts the honest  customer at a disadvantage (windows has drm, but it never did anything weird for me: never saw anything of it and I don't have to be online at all times). Example: assassins creed 2 was a disaster.

 * the content/software isn't legally available to you (which windows obviously is since you bought a PC). Example: mostly every single TV show! I live in Europe, but I don't want to wait 1-2 years before I can see awesome series like GoT, Dexter, true blood and whatnot. I'd gladly pay for an HBO subscription if that meant I could stream the content or actually get it within my cable contract. But I can't. So I pirate it.

 * you already bought the content in another form. (Doesn't apply to windows). This IMO is hardly piracy: if for example I bought a book, I think I am entitled to the ebook version. Heck, I even think that if you own a movie, downloading the HD version can in no way be seen as actual piracy.


From what I know for your situation though, I don't think you have any justified reason not to pay for windows. Another reason than 'but I want to spend that money on something else!'.

I vividly recall the plot -- it involved a young girl who was very talented in ballet, and worked very hard. She lived in London (I think?) and traveled by train to perform in France and Germany. This blew me away at age 13, because I hadn't yet really comprehended that our states are like the size of European countries, and it was amazing to me that you could take a day trip to another country like that. I really enjoyed these books, less because of the ballet and more because Drina was so relatable in that she was mature for her age, she had a dream, and she worked hard to always put it first even as she wished to have friends her own age and be normal.

c4urmst,1,1,t5_2qzb6,False,,"No, it didn't come off as creepy.  Since you say you are primarily Spanish speakers, that explains some of it - Latin Americans are much more physical than us WASPy German Irish types.

I looked at the fiancee visa and thought it was a silly waste.  You have to file, do all the waiting, then come to the USA, get married and then file again for still more money and wait some more.  Then two years from now, you have to file again because the first two years her green card is just conditional.  In our case we got married, I waited a while and then we filed and got the green card.  I kick myself in the ass because if I had waited another 6 months, we would have been married two years and we would not have had to file a second time.  I could have delayed my transfer a few more months and saved us a few hundred bucks and the annoyance of filing again.

Our Japanese wedding was freaking huge.  It was in a big wedding chapel that looked like a European cathedral.  It cost a lot - I was surprised - but the guests ended up paying for almost all of it.

My wife's English is not very good and we speak mostly Japanese.  She does understand more than she can say and the time she has spent in the USA this go around has helped her advance even more.  Still, between us, there is a lot of nuance lost in our conversation and sometimes that causes conflicts.  For example, there is a way in Japanese to say, ""I unfortunately ran into my ex girlfriend in the store.""  It's a very simple addition to a verb.  If you don't know how to say it in your more limited Japanese you just say ""I ran into my ex girlfriend in the store.""  Deoending upon your tone, you might even make it sound like you are happy about it - then oooohboy.

Your family is going to have to work very hard to include your fiancee.  If she gets locked out in any way it will mean problems.  She is giving up her family and her friends to come and live with you, if she doesn't feel like she fits she will suffer immensely.

In my case, we have never lived anywhere near my family in the almost 10 years we have been married.  Generally, we move to a new city and start from scratch.  I have a job, but no friends, no place to live, nothing.  One of the first things we do is find the local Japanese society and go to a few events.  Our kids also help us hook into the Japanese community.

The Japanese community is a double edge sword.  It enables your spouse to have friends, learn where to buy special food stuffs, meet other mothers with young kids etc.  The bad side is that the Japanese community is always nosey and will soon be in all your business (for better or worse).  They are also insular, meaning your spouse often won't make friends outside of the group and her English won't improve either.  It is better if you can moderate the amount of time you spend mixing with the local Japanese community.",0,1429042188,[deleted],1338513100,t1_c4urmst,0,IAmA,True,,,False,t1_c4upjs2,0,t3_ubcbc,

They either need more servers to handle so many people logging in, or they need to implement a queue system (which is a bit shitty for a game that should be fully available in single player).  They probably also need to pull Diablo 3 off the shelves like they did with WoW when it first came out because so many people were buying it and clogging up the servers.

c4us08h,1,1,t5_2rb9g,False,,"I worked as a legal assistant before becoming a patent agent - getting that first job in patent or corporate law is very very hard (for any respectable, even very small firm).  This may be regional, but in  Boston/NYC at least, you really need top grades (3.5+, but really 3.8+ to stand out), near-perfect interview skills, and a degree from a top school (or, for a large firm, an inside connection, a paralegal certificate, or a few years experience). 

I would caution against getting a paralegal certification to ""try out"" law before law school.  These certificates are usually expensive and totally unnecessary.   If you want to be a 9-5 paralegal, you can get your way into a large firm with a certificate (you are basically paying money for experience) but you are wasting valuable time and money on something you may or may not ever end up really using if you go on to law school.

As for your grades, they are not good enough to get into corporate or IP law (the most competitive fields with highest pay) as an assistant.  Whereas law schools can be convinced to overlook a bad freshman year, law firms are not forgiving in the least (because they don't need to be) and lawyers are very risk-averse and unwilling to take chances on candidates of unproven quality.  I also think it is very rare that corporate/IP departments or firms will consider a candidate without a BA in-hand already without an inside connection (e.g., a family member that is a partner).  Also, law firms care about where the degree is from much more than other industries - I have very little knowledge about California public schools so I have no idea where UCSB ranks against the other UC schools, but I do think it is really difficult to break into law as an assistant from an average school.   

Also, just like all associate positions are not created equal, all legal assistant positions are not created equal.  You may be able to find work in a PI, immigration, or real estate law, but these positions are a dime a dozen with high burnout rates and poor job satisfaction.  Firms that handle this type of work may take a chance on someone with poor grades from an average school, even without a BA, but you said you wanted to practice corporate law after your JD, so this experience may not be very useful in attaining your goals - you won't get a boost for law school admission out of having experience as a paralegal because US News does not factor this into their rankings schema and law schools, subsequently, do not even consider it.  

As for a year abroad - this is (or can be) a great life experience, but it does not matter for law at all and will not help you stand out.  I'm not saying don't do it (I value my own time spent studying in Europe immensely as a personal memory) just don't expect it to make you stand out as unique or expect it to make up for less than stellar grades.   

Finally, check out abovethelaw and JDUnderground to see the dark underbelly of law before you spend 150K+ on law school and realize that law is a career that really is not for everyone (however much you ""like to argue"") - I think most lawyers will advise anyone who isn't going for free or doesn't have family connections to avoid law school.

In fact, several languages have more than two genders... neuter, vegetal, animate, and inanimate are all noun classes. Gender is really more of a way of classifying nouns than assigning them a sex. English-speakers only think of it that way because we don't speak a gendered language. Think about it: if you're learning a language that's gendered, you won't know that the genders of the words you're learning are ""masculine"" or ""feminine""... they simply have a loose correlation with things that do have biological sex, like names, in terms of affixes. 

The short answer is, no one really knows why language gender came about, but it does have some interesting psychological implications. There's some evidence that Proto-Indo-European was gendered, but it may have been dualistically animate/inanimate rather than masculine/feminine. Somewhere along the way, English deviated.

Morales came in from Chivas, and I got him for a song, frankly.  He was already like 20 times capped for Mexico when I bought him as a 19 year old, and I still got him for $5.5 million.  He's a little injury prone, but he recovers super quick with his natural fitness rating.

Alternatively, lighter skin is considered more attractive in many societies. In Asia, for example, women often bleach their skin. Sexual selection often promotes features that are disadvantageous from every other standpoint; consider, for example, a peacock's tail. If lighter skin were chosen for, if promoting lighter skin promoted freckles, because of close genetic position, and if freckles were not selected against, both lighter skin and freckles would result from sexual selection.

First, there's a substantial difference between Europe, New Zealand, and the rest of the free world v. Syria, it's a wonderful little thing called Extradition.  If a country has an Extradition Treaty with the United States, then the US can arrest criminals wanted in the US in that country.  Nifty, huh?

Second, you admitted yourself that Syria is in a civil war, so you don't have the right to compare the Syrian government to Hitler, because the Jews that were being sent to the gas chambers weren't performing an insurrection in Germany with their own armaments of Mauser rifles.  The victims of the Holocaust were relocated to ghettos, then shipped to camps after having all their valuables confiscated, where they performed forced labor for the Nazis in various forms, including building new structures and producing weapons, munitions and other equipment (which is how Schindler was able to save some).  The rebels are members of an opposing faction trying to overthrow the government, and if they're caught, they're put in POW camps that subject them to torture that would make the CIA members at gitmo blush (I'd personally choose waterboarding over being anally raped).  Sure, they're being abused, but you can't compare this to the Holocaust *until unarmed civilians are being gassed and thrown into mass graves.*

Be realistic about filming a murder: the perps would destroy the film after killing the shutterbug, then they would pay off the federallies, the military and the government.  The cartels have enough reach to avoid being *prosecuted.*  Face it, I picked scenarios that will be infallible when they're applied to the real world.

And lastly, you can't be serious in your claim that proper training is valueless.  Having express permission to report from the government also has it's advantages: the military has to avoid shooting you to avoid a real international incident.

Plus I suspect that the varied experiences you'll have overseas will be more likely to lead to something big (and good) happening in your life Vs going home and getting a regular job.

Some tips:

1) Checkout helpx.net and couchsurfing.org. couch surfing is short term free accommodation. helpx is trading free labour for free room and board and the gigs can last for months.

2) You mentioned that you have bar and service experience. keep your eye out for places with signs up looking for staff. if you come across anywhere that appears to have hired at least one other foreigner ask them if they know if there are any jobs going. (Its harder in places where you would be the first foreigner employed due to language issues and the employer having no prior experience with the legalities of hiring a foreigner)

3) Depending on where you go, English teaching can be a good way to support yourself. This is more about Asia but maybe this will help. http://magictravelblog.com/2011/09/how-do-i-get-started-teaching-english-in-asia/

4) Hostels are frequently after English speaking front desk people.

5) Keep your eyes open for (legal) business opportunities. Are there local (legal) products that you can sell online? Are there any products or services that you can offer fellow foreigners? For example, are there local handicrafts that people in your home country may buy? This is somewhat common in SE Asia. Will tourists pay a few bucks for a walking tour? This is more common in Europe.

Doing some combination of all of the above will give you a decent shot at making a go of it. You will need to be seriously pro-active though. Get on helpx and couch surfing today. Start asking about work in hostels, bars etc as soon as you arrive. Start putting feelers out and getting to know people. When you get a gig, work hard and do a great job. People know people.

Finally, there are LOTS of people with the same idea as you. For whatever reason, many are not reliable hard working individuals. That means that getting a gig in the first place can be tough due to the number of people wanting it.

Secondly, you want to tell me what hegemony means?  I find that entertaining, since my master's degree is from a goddamn IR school (UCSD IR/PS.)  I studied international security, taught international theory as a TA, and wrote both my senior undergraduate thesis on Asian security (Japan's role in military affairs in NE Asia) and my graduate thesis on the role of terrorism in domestic civil liberty erosion.  I think I know what hegemony means.  

Unless you claim to know better than Mearsheimer, Joseph Nye, Susan Shirk, and other leading IR scholars.  There are many forms of hegemony, and what we refer to when we say that the US is a hegemon can mean many things besides hard military power.  The US's hegemonic role in the world is so great not because of its ability to project power with its blue water navy (though it helps), but because its cultural and linguistic influence is incredibly widespread and deep worldwide.  

And US hegemony IS a good thing.  It provided stability worldwide.  Is it always positive in every way?  No, absolutely not.  But it also gave us Breton Woods, the UN, NATO, and other constructs worldwide that are absolute benefits to pretty much the whole world.  US hegemony allowed Europe access to capital after WW2 in order to rebuild.  It provided Japan security in a fractious region, and allowed it to grow as a modern powerhouse economy based on a relatively democratic regime.  The unipolar US-led world saw explosive economic growth, declines in interstate wars, and vast improvements in the quality of life for vast portions of the world's population.  These are numbers that are pretty easily backed up by UN figures. 

Now, regarding the US's military role as a hegemon:  Is the US's military hegemony limited?  Yes, necessarily.  Is its soft hegemony necessarily limited?  Not necessarily.  Even if the US is to reduce its role as a military power in the ME and Asia, it is unlikely to be replaced as the world's premier social influence for decades, if not longer. 

""Leadership means you don't have to hold a gun to someone's head to have them cooperate with you. ""

I'll simply counter with Thucydides:  ""The strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they must.""  What made post-WW2 so unusual was that the US openly agreed to constructs that limited its power and role worldwide, despite being the only fully intact power remaining.  Even today, the US has a relatively significant adherence to international law relative to its predecessors.  

Do I think that has shifted in a bad direction?  Yes.  The US's willingness to play in the ""Breton Woods"" world is certainly waning.  But like I've said before, the US still remains far more committed to international law and constructs than China even seems committed to its own laws and constructs.  

International relations doesn't have to be zero sum, but it usually is.  With China as even a regional hegemon in Asia, it's hard to see how it won't be. ",0,1429043305,[deleted],1338524617,t1_c4uu243,0,politics,True,,,False,t1_c4ucd97,0,t3_uc15q,

The basic principle is a regular skirt that's either cinched with a belt or cut so slenderly that the woman wearing it is only able to walk in a slow, waddling fashion.  ""But wait,"" you object; ""isn't that both incredibly dangerous and irredeemably stupid?""  Oh, but it is.  ""Then why?""  

The answer to that is more difficult, but I surmise it has something to do with an attendant craze - the widespread interest in what was called ""Japonism.""  Essentially, from the 1870s(ish) onward people throughout Europe became really, really interested in ""Oriental"" culture and art, and this interest saw highly stylized adaptations of it filter into western productions across all sorts of fields - think of the success of something like Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's *Mikado* or Puccini's *Madama Butterfly*, for example.

&gt;REMEMBER! Always keep an Eye up. Even if it's the decreased movement speed one or the attack speed one. It all depends on the situation of which one you want to use.

&gt;First of all you start of marking your target with ""Velik's Mark"" Then you use your ""Poison Arrow"". When your ""Poison Arrow"" is used, you'll see a 6 second buff in your right corner. This buff increases the 30% speed on Radiant Arrow, but ignore that for now. After ""Poison Arrow"" use your ""Rapid Fire"" to gain mana and then use your ""Radiant Arrow"" ( You will have approx 2 seconds to get this spell off after Rapid Fire is used) Then use ""Final Salvo"" straight away after the Radiant Arrow to get the 30% chargeup speed on ""Penetrating Arrow"". Then use ""Poison Arrow"" And the rotation starts all over again.

&gt;Velik's Mark -&gt; Poison Arrow-&gt; Rapid Fire -&gt; Radiant Arrow-&gt; Final Salvo -&gt;Penetrating Arrow-&gt; Poison-&gt; And it starts all over again.

&gt;This rotation has a 100% uptime and you'll gain lots of mana by using Rapid Fire and Final Salvo so you dont have to use Combat Attack to gain mana as often. You will also include all your main dmging spells, and you will have an high output dps wise.

&gt;PvP wise: It's all about getting the correct spells out in the correct time or order. This is pretty much something you have to figure out yourselves, because different archers have different playstyles against different classes.

Personally I sneak here a Web Arrow here:

Velik's Mark -&gt; Web Arrow -&gt; Poison Arrow -&gt; Rapid Fire -&gt; Radiant Arrow -&gt; Final Salvo -&gt; Penetrating Arrow -&gt; Poison Arrow -&gt; And it starts all over again.

The Poison Arrow fires immediately after the Web Arrow so I don't see any reason why you wouldn't want to use it, unless it causes you Mana issues.

Even so, the point of political philosophy is to tell that Stalin's and Mao's ideas were bad when they were still just ideas. On that count, the liberals were virtually 100% correct, and the people who claimed to be communists were about 50/50. Of course, liberals have their failings, as well. Those failures haven't nearly been as flashy, but liberals very easily fall into government corruption and acquiescence to rent-seeking, which is what makes extremist philosophies so appealing in the first place.

My issue with the terms is that ""Communist"" and ""Marxist"" carry too much baggage. While the effects of Mao's rule are not the fault of a real communist philosophy, Mao's ability to co-opt the term are the fault of the imprecision of the obsolete Marxian vocabulary. Ideas like nonviolent noncooperation didn't exist, much less an understanding of the social conditions in which nonviolence might achieve positive change. Marx advocated violent revolution in continental Europe at a time when he believed it was the best way to give power to the working class. He admitted that political or social means may be better in the U.S. and England, but most of his work assumes that violence is necessary for real revolution. However, supporting violence, even when it is justified (such as in the American Civil War) can lead to unintended political consequences (such as an increase in the power of the U.S. federal government after the war, leading to the unnecessary Spanish American War), which is also an idea that didn't exist in Marx's time. So while violence may have been an appropriate response to an inherently violent society in the Russian Revolutionary, it instilled political leaders who were too willing to use violence. Today, real communists have the political vocabulary to understand these nuances, and so a violent (so-called) Marxist revolution is more likely to be taken up in order to seize and concentrate power.",0,1429043914,KNNLTF,1338531097,t1_c4uv6hx,0,DebateaCommunist,True,,,False,t1_c4u8rjv,0,t3_tyr3g,

These companies may well be tobacco companies as they already have the resources necessary to produce, package and distribute joints.  I do not think that they would put additives in their joints.  Why?  Well for one they are required to make public a list of all additives in cigarettes, a list of such additives can be found by a simple Google search.  The cannabis community seems to be very concerned about this, and would view this in a very bad light and thus many tokers would boycott the companies that augmented their product with such compounds.  As for the addictive nature, there is no conspiracy with cigarette companies adding nicotine, and while I know the OP did not say this, many folk do think along these lines.  Tobacco naturally contains a high level of nicotine which is a psychoactive and highly addictive alkaloid.  Very few people would smoke if they were not addicted as it smoking cigarettes produces no real discernible mind altering effects.  Cannabis on the other hand produces many effects and those effects are what keep people coming back for more it is more psychologically addictive.  Now what I could see occurring is some companies putting tobacco in with joints, just like many Europeans do today.  This would not really go down too well in the North American market as well.

You also said that the following unsubstantiated claim:

&gt; [...]additives that turn marijuana away from its harmlessness, and into the new ""cancer stick""?

For one smoked cannabis, while not causing the same negative effects associated with tobacco smoke still causes damage to the lungs when smoked.  It causes notable changes in cell structure, such as squamous metaplasia within epithelial cells of the lungs.   It has also been shown that users can develop bronchitis from smoking cannabis.  I would stress at this point these conditions are caused by the nature of smoke itself.  The human body has not evolved to inhale the combustion products of a plant.  All these findings have been published in major peer-reviewed journals and I can source my claims if you wish.  That being said there has yet to be a substantial link between lung, head and neck cancer and smoked cannabis.  The fact that there is no link is rather odd considering the carcinogenic properties of cannabis smoke and the tar produced.  This is a very fascinating area of ongoing research.

I read some of his articles, then one of his books and came out exceedingly disappointed of his reasonings and rather concerned of what would happen if the ideas of this man caught on). Seeing a sentiment proposed here, proposed as if it is Zizek's own and Zizek's clever observation, when in fact half the thinkers in the liberal world know of these specific dangers of doing things like ""defending your culture"" - it may have rattled me too much. Still, the thread title is attributing this very common sentiment to a philosopher who's just late to the party and often not even compatible with it.

So let me explain. He's exceedingly one-sided on the issue. The battle, to Zizek, is the greek people versus European eurocrats (like it is any people versus the powers that be). He takes into account the blunt side of ""austerity"" - the power politics involved - without the least bit of attention to the problem itself. Greece overspent itself dangerously, and apart from the moral implications from letting Greece get away with that (meaning that the rest of the working population in Europe worked for them while they wasted it - this is hardly german propaganda), there is simply a need to fix a dangerously screwed budget. The entire issue of ""what happens if a govermnent refuses to pay its debts - you can't send a collection agency to an entire country"" is a practical and an economic one rather than it is a de nuovo moral / class issue he's making it out to be.

As to my reference to Marx - it was his observation that certain freedoms can only exist in tandem with certain economic developments. The function of democracy and ""bourgeois"" civil rights can only exist in tandem with certain economic freedoms. Zizek would pull these away in a second, saving greeks from austerity measures they might not like, and at the same time further pushing them into a situation where there is little hope for their economy *and* for their future civil rights.

And that's not even touching upon the further nationalist fury that's made possible when Greece makes its own ""screw the world, we are the people"" budget, which will be necessarily *for* greeks by greeks, due to the very notion of the nation-state. How he cannot pick up on that is truly mind-boggling to me.

Dude? Really?

Simplement et avec beaucoup d'évidence, je te dirai que c'est la meilleure façon de réveiller les instincts xénophobes et racistes qui sommeillent en chacun de nous. Ma voisine du haut est originaire de Yougoslavie (elle s'est sauvée durant la guerre et s'est réfugiée à Mtl avec ses enfants), mes voisins du bas sont d'origines colombiennes avec une petite fille qui est adorable, mon voisin d'à côté est d'origine haïtienne. Il m'a aidé à monter un meuble lourd à l'étage. Montréal, le Québec et le Canada sont des endroits multi-culturels et c'est clairement ce qui en fait la richesse. C'est cette immigration qui va nous aider culturellement et économiquement. Particulièrement pendant cette époque de mondialisation que nous vivons. 

Il y a quelques mois, je suis allé chez des amis à Oka - c'est pas loin Oka, on s'entend ? J'ai passé une soirée exécrable à expliquer à des gens qui ne sortent jamais de leur patelin, qui ne vont jamais à Laval, encore moins à Mtl, que les musulmans n'étaient pas tous des terroristes. Ce qu'ils m'ont répondu : *""chu pas raciste, mais moé les mangeu d'sable, j'veux pas les awère dans ma cours""*. 

Depuis les accommodements raisonnables, il y a eu une sorte de montée du racisme ordinaire. Il y a toujours eu un décalage entre les mentalités de villes et de petits villages et l'idée d'instaurer une carte d'identité nationale aurait comme premier effet de créer des citoyens de secondes zones. Des citoyens Canadiens, qui ont passé toutes les étapes du processus d'immigration très sélectif et qui arrivent dans leur pays d'accueil pour se faire dire qu'ils ne sont pas assez ""québécois"" - une nation qui n'existe pas légalement... Des nouveaux québécois qui se font dire *""vous êtes pas pure laine""* (de loin l'expression du racisme ordinaire la plus navrante qu'on entend presque quotidiennement dans la belle province). 

Soyons clair : je ne veux pas de ça chez-nous. Je suis fier d'être bi-culturel, bilingue et même bisexuel tant qu'on y est ! Je suis fier de dire que le Québec est un endroit où l'ouverture d'esprit et le dialogue sont à l'honneur, que l'acceptation de l'Autre fait partie de nos valeurs communes, comme l'égalité entre les hommes et les femmes. Créer un  programme qui soulignerait une différence basée sur une culture, une langue ou un groupe ethnique, c'est la porte ouverte à des dérives dont on ne mesure pas la portée. 

En 95, j'ai voté oui. Quand Boisclair est arrivé à la tête du PQ, j'étais content, puis déçu. Quand Marois est arrivée, j'étais super content, et là, je ne mesure pas ma déception face à un parti qui ne propose absolument rien d'intéressant et de nouveau.

Je rêve d'un monde sans frontière (je ne le verrai pas de mon vivant) où nous mettons l'humain au centre de nos préoccupations.  

Donc, oui, il faut que les politiciens aient peur de nous. Il faut sortir dans la rue taper sur des casseroles, de manière pacifique. Il faut faire front commun et se tenir debout TOUS ensemble pour montrer le ras le bol que nous ressentons face à un parti au pouvoir qui est devenu beaucoup trop arrogant.

http://www.ctcwings.com/ UK based school that conducts much of it's training in New Zealand

All these schools have affiliations with airlines. What this means is that you can apply for a specific airlines program before you start you training. The best one I'm aware of it the British Airways Future Pilot Program. It's currently closed but it will open and close sporadically over the coming months/years. If accepted onto the program you still have to finance the training yourself but they will help you secure it. They MAY accept some of the risk (i.e. course failure or no job available upon course completion) - you'll have to read the fine print. My advice to anyone considering a career in European airline aviation is that these schemes (and particularly the BA one) are as good an opportunity as you can get. Unfortunately, due to them being by far the best option, they are massively oversubscribed and competition is tough.
http://www.bafuturepilot.com/

The Guild of Air Pilots and Navigators (GAPAN) run an assessment day (using the RAF psychometric assessment facility) purely for you own benefit. The cost is around £150 I think, non-profit. It's the only place you'll get a truly objective assessment of your ability to complete flight training. I'd highly recommend it for anyone considering spending a lot of money on flight training. http://www.gapan.org/career-matters/careers-information/aptitude-tests/

Finally PPRUNE is an online forum where all matter regarding commercial aviation (predominantly in Europe) are discussed. There are vast amounts of rubbish on this forum but there is some decent info in there too. www.pprune.org

    Royal Society (United Kingdom)
    National Academy of Sciences (USA) (12 Mar 2009 news release)

A letter from 18 scientific organizations to US Congress states:

""Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.""

The consensus is also endorsed by a Joint statement by the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC), including the following bodies:

    African Academy of Sciences
    Cameroon Academy of Sciences
    Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences
    Kenya National Academy of Sciences

c4uweab,9,9,t5_2qh5b,False,,"&gt;Just to clarify, keep in mind that maximizing human welfare is often accomplished by allowing people to spend their money as they please, without government intervention. There are specific conditions where government intervention can make people better off, and the boss thinks liberal arts degrees doesn't satisfy those conditions. I doubt the boss thinks there's no personal value to having a liberal arts education, but he thinks he shouldn't have to subsidize it. I think there are some promising reasons why we should subsidize a liberal arts education, which would probably be more convincing to the boss :).

I guess I'm seeing things through a more European eye (I'm French)... I don't have this ""issue"" on having an active State participating in the economy. I don't have this liberal view about allowing people to spend money as they please. I see money as a limited resource that we need to share in order to maximize everyone's well-being... so even if I own the money, I would say that I still have a responsibility to spend it wisely. I also understand that being in a society means giving up some liberties to ensure more security (Hobbes) so I don't often have this ""the state is taking my liberties away"" perspective.

That might be why this strictly utilitarian/economic conception is a bit strange to me. Boss is assuming that the goal of education (universities, high school...) is to prepare us for the economy. I understand that opinion since our well-being depends on the money we earn from a job, and we have greater chances to get a job if you are educated. Yet again, education for me is way more than that. Education is progress, it's the key to happiness, to self-development... Education can't be only serving the economy! Education can't only be a formation to allow people to be a part of the economy. I wouldn't see education as a factory where people walk in as children and walk out as architects, economists, business administrators, bakers... Education is not only formation, formation is a part of education though.

Now to come back in a more utilitarian view: I think that education, culture is basically what allows you to make sense out of the world. I think it was Arendt's perspective: transforming the nature around us (magical, we don't really understand what's going on) in environment (science, myths allow us to better explain things and feel reassured). I would argue that the more educated you are, the more sense you can make out of 'things'... and I think this is actually what a leader is... someone that can make sense out of something for other people. Innovation comes out of this process (breaking the status quo). Another argument could be that philosophy and culture in general are really important when it comes to ethics! A man will see himself as more than just a trader when he's about to take a decision in front of a computer. In France, if you want to be engineer or business major (Grandes Ecoles), you are compelled to have at least 2 years of philosophy classes. Not bragging here, but I think this is great when it comes to business ethics!

He wouldn't be executed, because he didn't go to war with India. And India would still have a food shortage, because there was no food send.

And according to the logic that Churchill is responsible for the genocide in India (which, since this wasn't a mass murder of a religious or ethical group what resulted from Xenophobia, wasn't a genocide), the American politicians where just fucked. If they would march into war to liberate Europe, they would be executed because they marched into war. And if they hadn't do anything, they still would be executed because they didn't do anything to prevent the Holocaust, even though they had the (military) power to stop it.

You see the problem? War is a terrible thing. But can you even imagine how bad a situation can be, if war is the only effective response?

He's a bit of a Robin Hood figure in popular Australian imagination, a tragic hero who fought against a corrupt and unjust system. In this context, he represents the white man who was willing to live peacefully alongside indigenous people.

Inflation doesn't hurt if wages rise as well. Like I said, a little inflation is beneficial in an economy and can hurt the rich the most if shit is done correctly. Deflation on the other hand is [full-blown theft against debtors](http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.com/2012/02/endogenous-money-savings-and-inflation.html), who now have to repay their debts with money of a much higher purchasing power.

&gt;Or people use currency exchange rates. It'll slow down trade, but not eliminate it.

That would be incredibly hard to do, especially when so much of the economy is based on trade that transcends national boundaries. Chances are, businesspeople wouldn't want to waste time going through all that shit and would much rather keep a monopoly currency in place.

&gt;I'm just for stable currencies,

Here's the thing: gold and silver are NOT stable currencies. [This blog explains why](http://livingstingy.blogspot.com/2010/02/should-you-invest-in-gold-uh-no.html). TL:DR: gold and silver are commodities, so their value is based on how many chickens or pieces of wheat someone is willing to give you for them.

Also, ever heard of the European Price Revolution where gold and silver lost a huge amount of their purchasing power? Hell, the US and Canada are [already scrambling for Haiti's gold](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/uf4ba/american_and_canadian_mining_companies_rush_to/) (ahem, imperialism), so chances are the price of gold will start going down pretty soon.

&gt;What he's arguing for is to end the practice of printing out huge amounts of cash whenever we go into deficit spending.

Which is very harmful during a recession. Here's the thing: the rich control the state. Every time the state cuts spending it's cutting the shit the working poor depend on rather than privileges for the rich. This creates all sorts of living hells.

&gt;I don't think it's an oxymoron. The proper role of government in the free market is to enforce contracts and protect private property. Stimulating economy activity in particular industries is not one of those roles.

Maybe I've been hanging with the wrong crowd, but I think of the country's contribution to seamanship, navigation and world trade; the foundation of the joint-stock corporation; the country's central place in the Reformation and the Enlightenment; its contribution to European liberalism; the Act of Abjuration and its determined resistance to the Spanish; its tradition of a free press and religious toleration centuries before these were fashionable; the bizarre quasi-republican quasi-federal constitution of the United Provinces; the 1848 Constitution of Johan Thorbecker, which, while much of the continent was torn apart by war, revolution and tyranny, laid the foundations for 150 years of remarkably stable parliamentary democracy; the under-read but still fascinating political theology of Abraham Kuyper; the contributions made to international law and human rights at the Hague (not just the international criminal court, whose record, to be fair, is patchy, but the whole range of Hague Conventions defining war crimes and so forth). 

Yet, despite all this contribution to liberalism, democracy and progress, the Dutch are in my experience a fairly conservative (with very small 'c') people - in the sense that they have figured out what works and want to keep it that way. But they are pragmatic and not stupid about it.

[The Faiths of Our Fathers: What America's Founders Really Believed](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-5295646-10876509?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFaiths-Our-Fathers%2FAlf-J-Mapp%2F9780742531154&amp;cjsku=9780742531154) by Alfred J. Mapp, Jr. has a chapter on him.

&gt;Haym Salomon was one of the most important people in the winning of American independence. Yet today his name is known to few Americans.
&gt;
&gt;Why should he be largely forgotten? One factor undoubtedly was his membership in an ethnic minority. He was by birth and rearing a Polish Jew.... Growing up in Poland and wandering through Europe, he had seen far too much of tyranny. Soon after arriving in New York City, he joined the Sons of Liberty, originally a secret organization formed in the American colonies to oppose the stamp Act of 1765..

He opened his home to colonists fleeing the British and, while acting as an interpreter for the British in their dealings with their Hessian allies, he persuaded many of the German soldiers to desert. He was convicted of treason by the British for his activities and scheduled to be executed, but managed to escape, though a long imprisonment left his lungs permanently scarred. 

He had arrived in the colonies almost penniless, but, because of his financial acumen, multilingual abilities, proven patriotism, and reputation for honesty managed to become wealthy enough to become a principal financier for the American revolution.

&gt;At great personal risk, he assumed debts for the new nation so large that they almost carried him under as a victim of the great economic undertow. He continued in the difficult period after the Americans triumphed at Yorktown in 1781 but did not know until 1783 whether England would renew the fight with its erstwhile colonies or depend on economic disaster to drown them. He personally advanced substantial sums to congressmen so that they might continue to serve the fragile government that could no longer pay them. At least one of them, James Madison, called him ""the good Samaritan.""... At his own expense he also helped to feed British soldiers in American prisons.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Salomon was as truly a martyr for American independence as any man who died on the battlefield or at sea. He deserves to be far better remembered than he is, not only in justice to his own sacrifices and achievements but also as a reminder of the Revolutionary contributions of other Jews.
&gt;
&gt;Their services were numerous. In Georgia, three Sheftall brothers - David, Levy, and Emanuel - were conspicuous for gallantry on the battlefield. Emanuel escaped just before his scheduled execution by a British firing squad and lived to become the sixth governor of the state of Georgia and apparently the first Jewish chief executive of any American state. Major Benjamin Nones served on the staffs of Washington and Lafayette and was cited for gallantry under Pulaski. Solomon Pinto, an officer in the Connecticut line, was one of the original members of the Society of the Cincinnati in that state. In New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Massachusetts, and Virginia, other Jews were commended for their bravery and unselfish material sacrifice in the American cause. Sometimes it seemed that being a Jew was in itself sufficient reason for the British to suspect a man of pro-American activity.

The U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in 1975 honoring Haym Salomon's efforts in building the nation.

&gt;In 1975 the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Haym Soloman for his contributions to the cause of the American Revolution. This stamp, like others in the ""Contributors to the Cause"" series, was printed on the front and the back. On the glue side of the stamp, the following words were printed in pale green ink: ""Financial Hero—Businessman and broker Haym Solomon was responsible for raising most of the money needed to finance the American Revolution and later to save the new nation from collapse"".

c4uxfxc,4,4,t5_2s91q,False,,"I learned to read by myself off soup cans when I was two, so my parents knew something was up. I was first labeled gifted in kindergarten (IQ in 150s, qualified for Mensa) and was placed in a special class with other GT children through 8th grade. Took the SAT for the first time in fifth grade. Read books like crazy. Was bullied relentlessly for being smart, of course, and grew shy. I suffered from existential crises throughout grade school, which made me both mad and sad, and hard for other kids to read. I was definitely a handful for my parents, who were pretty supportive up to this point.

I was admitted to a special subschool within my high school for GT kids, but ended up going to a Catholic high school, so didn't benefit from that and simply took all honors/AP classes. I was one of only two GT kids in my high school class. I flew through all my classes easily and was quite lazy, doing only what I needed to do to get an A. Classes that didn't interest me got me a B+ and I often got downgraded because I was doing work above my grade (for example, using calculus in pre-calculus). I ended up with very high SATs, ACTs, APs, came 2nd in the state in math, National Merit Finalist, top ten in my class etc. Got into a top twenty school I couldn't afford so went to state school for college, where I entered with enough hours to qualify as a sophomore and so partied my ass off for four years instead of graduating early. I never went to class, and still graduated above a 4.0 (weighted classes). I felt college was the place I really blossomed and became more extroverted and open to the world and new experiences.

I had planned to go directly to grad school, but got in a fight with my parents and moved out. I spent the next four years following the Grateful Dead around, going to Mardi Gras, and working in the restaurant business, drinking and doing drugs almost every night. I finally got my shit together, backpacked through Europe for three months, and went to grad school. 

My first MA (history) was a breeze and I graduated with honors and a 4.0. I ran into some issues in writing my thesis and decided to start over in film, so I went to a different school to get an MA in cinema studies in preparation for my PhD. I had figured out that being a professor was my only option, as going to school was the only thing I was ever good at. I became disillusioned with my program as they had changed requirements for the PhD and decided not to go on.

Here's where things get sticky:  my film program was the first time in my life I had ever been truly intellectually challenged, and that was incredibly disheartening. I began to question my intelligence and if I was truly gifted. Once school ended, I started questioning my life and my choices - and then 9/11 happened (I was in NYC at the time). I developed panic disorder and my life got put on hold. I still worked in restaurants and tried to at the very least work at the best ones possible and learn as much about food and wine as I could, but, you know, that's just not enough for a child who had always been told she was the smartest, the best, destined for a stellar career as a doctor, lawyer, professor, someone who would ""change the world."" I had always been a lapsed perfectionist - if I couldn't do something perfectly, I did nothing at all. So that's what I did - and what I'm still doing.

Fast forward to the present. Although I managed to marry a wonderful man who puts up with all my bullshit, I am currently doing nothing to further my life or career and am just trying to manage insomnia (speaking of, here kicks in the Ambien!), anxiety and clinical depression on a day-to-day basis. So I'm one of the gifted kids who never made it, and I'm not sure I ever will. I try and grasp joy in life when I can, but it's few and far between for me. I've made a lot of bad choices and many of them were just dumb ""fuck the man"" shit when if I'd been thinking really clearly, I should have just gone to law school as my father always wanted (and damn, it kills to admit he was right). It's too late for that now.

I work as a server and sommelier at a restaurant where my coworkers and customers of course have no clue about my being gifted and it's something I never discuss with anyone except my husband with regards to talking about our upbringings. It's like a weapon I want to use to lash out at people who treat me as stupid (which is most of our clientele), but I never can, because it just isn't done. So I keep it a secret, just like all the other gifted kids I went to school with. Once in a while someone figures it out, and it's nice to be seen, but for the most part, being a gifted adult can be a lonely and isolating experience. It's hard to explain without sounding like a bitch what it's like to be the only person in the room who knows what's really going on in the world and it's hard not having many people to talk to who care about bigger things like justice and all the other things in the world that make me so bitter and angry.

And then I read that last graph back to myself and yell at myself ""stop feeling sorry for yourself and feel grateful."" So it's a vicious circle. #Ambien I definitely need therapy.

Arms are more than guns. Arms include anything that can be used as a weapon.  We use the 2nd Amendment to protect our rights to buy guns, since there are many out there today who feel that guns, specifically, are evil and should not be allowed in the hands of the public.

The truth of the matter is that murder happens whether or not guns are available.  It's true that guns are the most effective ranged weapon, and can kill from a moderate distance (up to 100 feet in most people's hands, several hundred yards in the hands of someone trained in their use).

Still, without guns you'd have killing by knife, car, blunt instrument, IED, poison, or other ad-hoc weapons.  When there was unrest last year in England, every sporting goods store in the country had a surge in the sale of aluminum bats.  People decided they needed to ""bear arms"" and their legal choices were limited, so they decided that a club was the most practical.

I'm more of a casual Fire fan and mostly support them because they're my local team, I want to support the MLS as I hope that it will turn into a world-call league one day, and it gives me something to watch and follow when the European leagues aren't playing.  Here's some stuff you should or would probably like to know:


Although we've been a fairly under-performing team for most of the years of existence, we did win the MLS cup in our first year, 1998. Other than that we have won the U.S. Open cup 3 times as well.  The stadium, I think, is rather nice but is in a very, very shitty location. Unless you live right in the surrounding neighborhood, it's difficult to get to and one of the reasons why I think that we do not sell out almost any games. 


We've had quite a few notable players during our history, both domestic and foreign, that included Lubos Kubic, Cuauhtemoc Blanco, Jorge Campos, Freddie Ljunberg, Hristo Stoichkov, and (the now Philadelphia Union coach) Piotr Nowak. Bob Bradley, the former US National coach was also our original coach and he was with us for, I believe 4 seasons.


As for the team right now, our captain is Logan Pause and we have a good mix of domestic and foreign players. Our standout players seem to be Dominic Oduro, Patrick Nyarko, Logan Pause, Marco Pappa, Pavel Pardo, and Sebastian Grazzini. Although I do like Cory Gibbs and Dan Gargan, our defense is the weak link in our team. This season, we have given up a lot of early goals and it's always incumbent on the team to then go on the attack all of the time. 


As for rivalries, the only two teams I can think of that we really seem to have anything against is Dallas and Columbus. I don't know why there seems to be this dislike for Dallas, but Columbus is more or less a regional rivalry.


Like I said, I'm a more casual fan but I do enjoy the team and the fans are a lot of fun to be around. Get out to a game sometime and I think you'll find that it's a fun club to follow.  Hope this helps.",0,1435712423,Tbickle,1338555254,t1_c4uxhhu,0,chicagofire,True,,,False,t3_uexyx,0,t3_uexyx,

I had not told my family for almost 3 years that I was with this guy. I do suspect that my mom had idea but she didn't want to bring it up. But I know my husband was feeling scared all the time if we would marry or I would leave him. At this time my family wasn't the biggest concern for me but I was myself not sure if I wanted to marry him because I didn't know if I could be with someone in long term, whom I couldn't communicate in my mother tongue or relate to things that one would having the same culture.

Once I made my mind then I knew to tell the family would be disaster (but that had to be done). We gave very short notice to my family that we are getting married. My siblings and dad were kind of ok with my decision but my mom was hard to convince but she knew she didn't have control over this. I think even at our wedding day she was hoping I would change my mind. My family has been very important for me and if they wouldn't have agreed I would not have married my husband. But I also knew I could convince them.

I think once the family (specially Indian) accepts the marriage then they accept the new member of the family. Because for Indians marriage is something sacred and now the biggest concern is not be divorced :-). Of course different families are different but this is the idea. 

My parents love their grandson. They want to teach him our heritage and traditions and we are totally OK because it gives him different perspective on life and same way my husband's family shows him something different. We live in US and have traveled to Europe and Asia so we give him our experiences. I think all these different perspectives will form an interesting personality. Only issue my husband has from my family is some of the cultural things that put very much emotional constrain on one and doing things thoughtlessly. We still get into some arguments time to time and so things are not great but we can about these stuff. My parents don't agree with the way we do things but this doesn't change the love for their grandson.

Once you have children things change for better; they may not be accepting of you but its their grand(son/daughter) and they would love them no matter what. 

I think most important thing is that both of you should know that if you want to be together. Even at the beginning if the families don't accept this but they come around soon. I have seen this happens many times as well.

c4uxuwd,1,1,t5_2qoox,1338558392,,"Hit your goal weight so you went to Europe, eh? Niiiiice. Gotta remember to reward myself with something like that when I hit my goal weight. 

1) Mediterranean - yeah, I know that I'm pretty much out of the circle right there, but what I mean is that I depend largely on fruits and vegetables, little meat, more fish, and some grains and legumes, relying heavily on things like olives and olive oil. Most of my nutrition comes from plant-based sources. I also realize grains/legumes technically take me out of the paleo camp, but I can't get enough calories on a paleo framework alone due to some stomach and heart issues (I have recurrent gastroparesis--idiopathic, likely viral--plus I have no gallbladder; I also have a heart condition that makes me sensitive to fat's effect on blood flow), so I have to include some grains and legumes to make up for my inability to eat too much meat/fat.

(Sidenote: My caloric distribution is about 45% carb, 35% fat, 20% protein. Trying to move that closer to 40/30/30.)

2) As for fat, I mostly mean I can't do fatty cuts of meat, which seems to be the staple for some. Regular ground beef, for example, would leave me in pain and nauseous for a day. (No gallbladder + impaired digestions. These are me-issues, so they're not applicable to everyone, I know.) 

3) Yaaay, no HFCS!!

4) Risks: Well, again, a lot of this depends on how you go about doing a keto diet. For example: keto diets where most calories and fat come from plant sources actually lead to a longer lifespan than keto diets that rely heavily on meats. Diets high in animal fat also affect the elasticity of arteries via a number of factors, like reducing the amount of nitric oxide produced by your body, for example. Then there's the issue of gallbladder stones (not caused by ketogenic diets, but a dependency in fat can exasperate the problem in the likely event that you DO have stones). And, of course, higher meat consumption is associated with higher rates of certain cancers, particularly digestive-system cancers. (Ironically, it is suspected that because cancers depend on glycosis, ketogenic diets may be a treatment option for some cancers.) There are more issues, but I can't think of them off the top of my head. 

Now, notice that I didn't really differentiate between high-quality fats vs. low-quality fats or animal vs plant fats/proteins. I did that on purpose, to show where there are areas of question and education.

Continuing my previous thought, these risks can all be managed. For example, after losing weight you reduce your cancer risk and your overall inflammation, which means your nitric oxide production should be better. Moving to a more plant-based diet (even if it is ketogenic, so lots of nuts, olives, and avocados) will keep this up quite nicely, and reduce your cancer risk. Cooking your meat in certain ways will help reduce the overall carcinogenic impact on your system. Also, by ensuring you eat high quality meats (nitrate-free, grass-fed, lower fat) you can ensure that you cut a lot of these risks further.  

In other words, you can lose weight by eating a bunch of salads with packaged, cold-cut turkey, but it's healthier in the long run (and I mean years, not just months) to eat chunks of turkey without the nitrates. Furthermore, you can lose weight by eating a bunch of bun-less burgers, but there's a difference between the stuff you get at McDonalds and a slab of grass-fed, Omega-3-rich meat. There's also a huge difference between having a bunch of broccoli and spinach as the side vs. having bacon. Finally, relying on plant-based fats like olive oil, avocado, and coconut oil* might be a better solution than relying on lard, for example. 

*Side note: the effects on coconut oil on HDL is somewhat understood. However, there is a major debate now going on as to whether that HDL is actually any good. It's like the whole LDL thing, where not ever LDL is created equal (VLDL's, for example, are a big problem). A similar debate is going on with the use of some statins. 

Of course, there are good advantages to keto, like a lower use of your insulin pathways. There is still some debate as to whether a ketogenic diet will actually make you more insulin sensitive in its own right (or whether it's actually due to the weight loss), but overall, a properly maintained and educated ketogenic diet is arguably a good thing, from a purely biological standpoint.

Essentially the 13 original colonies were the 13 original British colonies.  Americans at the time, regardless of state, considered themselves to be British citizens and *then* members of whatever state they lived in.  This sense of British unity helped link the colonies together, especially when the colonists felt that they were being treated as second class citizens.  This is one reason we know for a fact Paul Revere never yelled, ""The British Are Coming!"", it wouldn't have made sense considering Revere, and everyone he would be yelling at, considered themselves subjects of the crown.  Revere most likely yelled, ""The Regulars are coming"" or ""The redcoats are coming"".

So in 1775 when Massachusetts sparks the War for Independence the other states are split over whether or not to actually support a war against their own government.  While many American schools promote the idea that the United States was a unified nation against Britain, this was simply not the case.  It took a nightmare of debating, coercing and convincing to get the states to agree but somehow they unanimously signed the Declaration of Independence thus beginning the process of a unified nation comprised of sovereign states (although the groundwork was already laid as the citizens already considered themselves British subjects in different states).

The reasons for becoming part of the USA were political, economical and military.  Massachusetts wouldn't be able to defend itself against the British or the French (the superpowers of the day), and if the colonies didn't fight together they could be picked apart and controlled piecemeal.  If they banded together, however, they stood a chance against the big European superpowers so long as those powers' main military thrusts were not at the colonists (i.e. they continued to fight amongst themselves ... otherwise the colonies would be torn apart).

Secession is an odd topic in American history.  There are many states that took shape and then puttered out and never actually reached true statehood - [see the state of Franklin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Franklin) - or countries that became states - [see Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas).

The issue of secession has never been taken as seriously as the Civil War but there have certainly been interesting issues involving possible secession.

True liberals should see Solyndra as a casualty in the green energy race with China, a race for the economy of the next generation. Solyndra was an innovative American company that was undercut by Chinese subsidies on their green energy, and ""free market"" Republicans threw the next generation of American economy under the bus in a blatantly treasonous sell-out to China or in an shockingly stupid-as-shit inability to understand that China will eat us alive for this.

Conservatives see Solyndra as a pig with make-up on, a wasteful, useless pillar of the Trojan Horse that is the climate change conspiracy designed by the Socialist International as an excuse to expand government power, the true mission of the Democratic Party, and a treasonous mission during this time of economic hardship, or at the very least an astoundingly dumb-as-dirt inability to understand that deficits caused and continue to prolong the depressed economy.

Liberals see Bain as a predator murdering healthy companies that merely happen to be the weakest of the pack. Bain is a tool for moving jobs overseas in what may be best for foreign workers and rich investors domestically and abroad, but is really bad for domestic workers - you know, the Democratic base, the only ones who are really feeling the screws of the depression. Bain has put thousands of citizens on unemployment at a time when people have too little hope of a job and too much debt to feed their families as it is - unlike those dozens of rich investors who can afford to take a hit to their portfolios for the good of suffering people during this horrible economic period.

Conservatives see Bain as a champion of efficiency, streamlining industries so as to return corporate profits to the black and get reinvestment rolling again, the true engine of economic growth. Bleeding heart liberals are too idiotic to see that all they're doing is hurting the economy by prolonging the inefficiency and readjustment of resources and labor. It's not fair that a few lazy louts who don't want to look for another job can hold the country hostage. Better a quick, sharp rise in unemployment and a return to growth and prosperity than this socialism for outdated jobs. It's not like we can just invest in American companies, increase productivity through training and infrastructure, and return the economy to profitability that way.

However, if you were to look at, say, the top 20 economies, or the top 20 countries rated on the [human development index - adjusted for inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) (oh, sorry, let's make that the top 25 so that the USA makes it in due to the abhorrent wealth disparity) then we see a very different picture, and one much more pertinent to the current political/policy situation.

No one is suggesting that the USA become a third world dictatorship that prints currency for shits and giggles, and so your 'big picture' is a big load of bollocks. 

Instead, it's much more pertinent to compare the the USA to European countries to see whether 'more economic freedom' than the USA currently has is a good thing, or whether more equitable wealth distribution and 'better and stronger regulations' might have some kind of positive effect not only on wealth disparity and standards of living, but also on avoiding things like global financial collapses.

Thing is that free markets don't stay particularly free if left to their own devices. Power accumulates at the top - the rich get richer and the poor get the picture.

Free markets are a great way of generating wealth, but they're a terrible way to distribute it. The lower and middle classes get screwed over. Hence social democracy wherein free markets generate wealth and governments help to distribute that wealth back to those who helped generate it and keep society happier, more just, and humane.

If you were to be killed and reincarnated, born to a random mother tomorrow, would you choose to have your accident of birth be in the USA or Norway/Australia/Holland? If you're rational, you won't choose the former, because despite the USA being very rich, it's not very equitable nor fair. It's not the best system, and that's why it's slipped down the ranks that the video talks about - not because of **less** economic freedom, but specifically because the USA has **more** libertarian economic policies than all those countries that have overtaken it in terms of standards of living.

Don't get me wrong, the principles on which the USA was founded were the most noble of any nation ever conceived. The first place in the world to base its very existence on the precepts of the enlightenment, to create equal opportunity and a level playing field. But it ain't that no more.

c4uy8t6,-1,-1,t5_2qnmr,False,,"&gt; Simplement et avec beaucoup d'évidence, je te dirai que c'est la meilleure façon de réveiller les instincts xénophobes et racistes qui sommeillent en chacun de nous. 

Quand on se fait submerger pendant des siècles par des immigrants carrément hostiles dans le but de nous minoriser et assimiler, ce n’est pas étonnant qu’on soit un tantinet xénophoboïdaux. En ce sens, les anglais doivent porter l’entière responsabilité de cette situation.

&gt; Ma voisine du haut est originaire de Yougoslavie (elle s'est sauvée durant la guerre et s'est réfugiée à Mtl avec ses enfants), mes voisins du bas sont d'origines colombiennes avec une petite fille qui est adorable, mon voisin d'à côté est d'origine haïtienne. Il m'a aidé à monter un meuble lourd à l'étage. Montréal, le Québec et le Canada sont des endroits multi-culturels et c'est clairement ce qui en fait la richesse. 

Faux. Le Québec est français.

Le multiculturalisme est encore une invention des anglais destinée à diviser pour régner, et, accessoirement, à nous assimiler en faisant accroire que les français sont des immigrants comme les autres et qui devraient devenirs anglais plutôt que les fondateurs du Canada (en tant que pays à l’européenne).

Rien dans la culture française ne porte vers le multiculturalisme officiel, nous sommes assimilationistes.

C’est bien joli que les immigrants conservent leur culture, mais ça, c’est leur problème à eux. En tant que nous sommes concerners, les immigrants ont le devoir et l’obligation de s’intégrer à NOTRE société.

&gt; C'est cette immigration qui va nous aider culturellement et économiquement. Particulièrement pendant cette époque de mondialisation que nous vivons.

La mondialisation vit ses derniers souffles. Déjà le balancier est stoppé et est sur le point du retour; ne voyez vous pas ces récentes élections de gouvernements socialistes (France) ou isolationnistes (Hongrie, Grèce) directement issus du ras-le-bol populaire suite à la crise financière concoctée par les mondialistes?

Oui, on s’enrichira par l’arrivée des immigrants, mais à la seule et unique condition que ça ne serve pas à nous assimiler dans le grand volapük mondial qui gravite autour de la mondialisation.

&gt; Il y a quelques mois, je suis allé chez des amis à Oka - c'est pas loin Oka, on s'entend ? J'ai passé une soirée exécrable à expliquer à des gens qui ne sortent jamais de leur patelin, qui ne vont jamais à Laval, encore moins à Mtl, que les musulmans n'étaient pas tous des terroristes. Ce qu'ils m'ont répondu : ""chu pas raciste, mais moé les mangeu d'sable, j'veux pas les awère dans ma cours"".

Pas besoin d’aller si loin, Villeray est amplement suffisant! Et que dire du Waste-Island? Là, on retrouve un raciste particulièrement virulent, parce que caché sous la légendaire hypocrisie des anglais qui y habitent…

&gt; Depuis les accommodements raisonnables, il y a eu une sorte de montée du racisme ordinaire. 

Et c’est normal, parce que con. La moitié de la population est du mauvais côté de la courbe de Gauss!!!

C’est inutile de le décrier, il sera toujours là. Comme un marin chevronné qui fait face aux éléments, rien ne sert de les affronter bille-en-tête, il faut les contourner, les circonvenir.

Et le «racisme ordinaire» n’est pas si mauvais que ça en passant le message que certaines coutumes, la plupart issues de religions  arriérées (mais que dis-je? Toutes les religions sont arriérées) ne sont pas les bienvenues ici, et qu’il convient de s’en débarrasser pour obtenir un minimum de respectabilité.

En ce sens, oui, il faut éviter les accommodements au maximum; nous sommes assimilationnistes, vous savez?

&gt; Il y a toujours eu un décalage entre les mentalités de villes et de petits villages et l'idée d'instaurer une carte d'identité nationale aurait comme premier effet de créer des citoyens de secondes zones. Des citoyens Canadiens, qui ont passé toutes les étapes du processus d'immigration très sélectif et qui arrivent dans leur pays d'accueil pour se faire dire qu'ils ne sont pas assez ""québécois"" - une nation qui n'existe pas légalement... Des nouveaux québécois qui se font dire ""vous êtes pas pure laine"" (de loin l'expression du racisme ordinaire la plus navrante qu'on entend presque quotidiennement dans la belle province).

«La belle province», c’est une chaîne de fast-food relativement insipide.

Les immigrants arrivent en premier au Canada; c’est le Canada qui décide, peu importe les brimborions de pouvoir que nous avons dans ce domaine. Tant que nous ne seront pas souverains, ce sera comme ça.

En attendant, la seule avenue est de fermement mettre le poing sur la table  et de hisser nos couleurs: au Québec, nous sommes français; c’est à prendre et à laisser. Les altermoiements qu’on voit trop souvent ne sont guère de nature à faire passer clairement ce message; c’est pour ça que je suis si intraitable en postant ici.

&gt; Soyons clair : je ne veux pas de ça chez-nous. 

Vous ne voulez pas quoi? La ferme assertion de notre nature française?

&gt; Je suis fier d'être bi-culturel, bilingue et même bisexuel tant qu'on y est ! Je suis fier de dire que le Québec est un endroit où l'ouverture d'esprit et le dialogue sont à l'honneur, que l'acceptation de l'Autre fait partie de nos valeurs communes, comme l'égalité entre les hommes et les femmes. Créer un programme qui soulignerait une différence basée sur une culture, une langue ou un groupe ethnique, c'est la porte ouverte à des dérives dont on ne mesure pas la portée.

La super tolérance à tout acabit, c’est la porte ouverte à notre disparition.

Je veux bien être bon jean, mais je ne suis pas jambon! Oui, nous sommes tolérants, je le sais bien; ça nous a dirigé vers l’extinction. Si les français avaient le dixième de l’intolérance qu’ont les anglais, ils auraient été dehors du Canada dès 1770!

&gt; En 95, j'ai voté oui. Quand Boisclair est arrivé à la tête du PQ, j'étais content, puis déçu. 

Parce que t’es bi? :) :) :) :) :)

&gt; Quand Marois est arrivée, j'étais super content, et là, je ne mesure pas ma déception face à un parti qui ne propose absolument rien d'intéressant et de nouveau.

Que veux tu! Depuis 30 ans, les grands bourgeois font tout pour discréditer au maximum la démocratie, dans l’espoir que, làs, le peuple se mette à voter pour le premier venu qui dira «regardez ce bordel démocratique, ça ne marche pas; votez pour moi, j’abolirai ça et ça ira tellement mieux». C’est pour ça que Mario Ducon a été à la tête de l’opposition, et pourquoi Harper est premier sinistre du Canada.

C’est comme ça qu’Adolf Hitler a été élu en Allemagne!

C’est pour ça que les politiciens sont inintéressants, de peur de faire peur au monde. Regarde Amir Khadir, un politicien intéressant, mais qui donne la chienne à pas mal de monde!

C’est exactement le principe du Big-Mac™ et du Whopper® qui ne goûtent absolument rien, malgré laitue, tomates, cornichons et tout: si ils goûteraient quelque-chose de bien défini, ça risquerait de déplaîre à plus de gens, ce qui ferait diminuer leur part de marché.

&gt; Je doute que je vote oui encore une fois. La planète est en changement. Nous vivons une période historique à cause des nouvelles technologies. Je rêve d'un monde sans frontière (je ne le verrai pas de mon vivant) où nous mettons l'humain au centre de nos préoccupations.

L’Humain est, plus que jamais, au centre des préoccupations. Les humains qui tirent les ficelles (Murdoch, Desmarais,  les frères Koch, etc…), bien entendu.

Phoque l’humain, occupons nous plutôt de l’Humanité à la place.

&gt; Donc, oui, il faut que les politiciens aient peur de nous. Il faut sortir dans la rue taper sur des casseroles, de manière pacifique. Il faut faire front commun et se tenir debout TOUS ensemble pour montrer le ras le bol que nous ressentons face à un parti au pouvoir qui est devenu beaucoup trop arrogant.

T’en fait pas, il suffira que la police fasse des exemples en matraquant une dizaine de marches aux casserolles pour bien redonner la chienne au petit peuple qui se tiendra coi… Pourquoi penses-tu que Assad tire sur les femmes et les enfants d’abord? Pour donner la chienne au peuple.

Ici, c’est pareil. Après que 1000 personnes auront des amendes de $1500 pour avoir marché avec une casserolle, et bien les gens rentreront sagement dans leur chaumière regarder Cocupation Double, Star Cacadémie et Un Gars Un Fif…

&gt; Mais pitié, allez chercher quelqu'un qui peut rassembler ses troupes, les unir et arriver avec un VRAI projet qui reflètera le climat actuel plutôt que de ressasser toujours les mêmes câlisses d'affaires qui nous mènent nulle part et qui paralyse la province.

After all, if Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc all make progress and use nuclear or natural solutions to power their economies, they might just, as a region, build yet another prosperous economic region that provides competition for others.

Try to see the big picture. Iran is capable of leading an economic change in the region, and has the resources to do that. That makes them a significant player in the region, and a potential catalyst for some sort of economic union of countries in the middle east.

c4uz226,0,0,t5_2qi63,False,,"To those shocked and aghast at this , it’s worth noting a few things.

Firstly, this is called collective licensing, and it’s a [common component of copyright law and policy across the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rights_organisation).  This is in no way unique to Canada—the US-equivalent [collective societies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_collective) include ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and SoundExchange, and they operate under the licensing parameters of US copyright law.

Secondly, this is not new.  Those in hysterics may not have known that their favourite dance clubs, concert halls, and other public venues were in fact paying music royalties all this time, but that makes it no less true.  Many seem to have missed the part in the article that says this: “While many of these events pay fees already, those fees compensate those who own publishing rights to songs. The tariff announced today is new and on top of what already exists, and will go toward compensating those who actually perform the music.”  Collective licensing is a well-established aspect of copyright law and policy, as described under “History” in the Wikipedia article I’ve noted above:

&gt; The first performing rights society was established in France in 1851. In the United Kingdom, the Copyright Act 1842 was the first to protect musical compositions with the Performing Right Society, founded in 1914 encompassing live performances. The rights for recorded or broadcast performance are administered by the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society, founded in 1924. Italy introduced a performing rights society in 1882 and Germany in 1915. In the United States, The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) was founded in 1914; Society of European Stage Authors &amp; Composers (SESAC) in 1930 and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) in 1939. Sociedad Puertorriqueña de Autores y Compositores de Musica (SPACEM) was founded in San Juan Puertorrico in 1953. SPACEM name was changed to ACEMLA, or Asociacion de Compositoes y Editores de Musica and remains today PRO No. 76 in the Cisacs roster of performing rights society.

Finally, this is entirely consistent with copyright law and theory.  A copyright owner has the exclusive right to the public performance of their work, which includes the public performance of music.  Collective societies exist because it would be prohibitively expensive for every single owner of a song to negotiate with every single bar, club, event hall, concert hall, etc. for a performance fee.  Collectivisation vastly simplifies the process, allowing those venues to pay a simple tariff for the right to play virtually whatever they want.  

As for those who think it’s unfair, I’d ask why it’s fair for the venue owners to profit—and sometimes profit very handsomely—from the business that largely exists because of the music they play there.  People don’t go to clubs and concert halls to stand in a big room and listen to the murmur of other people’s conversations.  They go for the music, so why should 100% of that benefit go to the venue owner and 0% to the person who made the music?",0,1429045798,Absenteeist,1338564396,t1_c4uz226,0,toronto,True,,,False,t3_uf2e0,0,t3_uf2e0,

&gt; My heritage is entirely British but I don't go around telling people I'm Jute, or Saxon, or Pict.

That's because you can't figure out if the vast majority of your heritage is any one of those. Anyway, those are defunct cultural and ethnic identities, whereas ""British"" is not.

My current model (in use 3 years with no mechanical problems) is Sanyo, cost about $150, weighs about 20kg. Dial timers on each side with up to 15 minutes of washing time and up to 5 minutes of spin time before turning off. No hookup required. You can put it in the shower, for example, to fill it and drain it. I put it on the porch, hose water into it, let it drain (gravity flow) into the flowerbed or, if the water is needed, into a plastic tub I carry to the garden. 

The wash side has small ridges on a bottom plate that spins clockwise/counter-clockwise to move the water back and forth. (Better, more expensive versions accomplish the same with water jets.) No big center agitator and much much easier on clothes. For really ground in dirt (knees on garden trousers), I pre-soak, hit the hard spots with detergent and soft brush and then wash.

I like the selectivity the machine allows. I determine the water level by eye, however much is needed for the amount of clothes being washed. I might add just a tad of non-detergent liquid sanitizer to the water to wash a load of clothes that just need freshening. I move the washed clothes to the spinner (no rinse required), and re-use the same wash water, adding detergent and heavily soiled work clothes (which will get a rinse with clean water).

Two minutes on the spin side leaves clothes damp. They dry quickly in direct sun or shade with a breeze (which is easier on colors and fabrics than direct sun).

I cannot speak to power requirements, but it is a heck of a lot less than much more powerful western (American and European) machines. I will be relocating soon to an off-grid place and that tremendous time saver is going with me.

c4uz9lw,3,3,t5_2qjto,False,,"&gt;Ja, det var også det jeg mente med at ""underbygge"" og derfor jeg ikke skrev bevise :)

Glimrende! Så er vi enige :D. Jeg begyndte egentlige selv at overveje hvordan jeg ville sætte et undersøgelsesdesign op for at kunne ""bevise"" tesen. Der er, som oftest inden for samfundsvidenskab, utrolig mange variable som skal tages højde for og som er næsten umulige at kontrollere. Dertil er det vel som udgangspunkt umuligt at skaffe data, eller blot nogenlunde valide proxyer, for disse variable. Men det er da et spændende forskningsprojekt. Uden tvivl.

&gt;Forskellen er vel at en privat virksomhed blot vil gå konkurs(med mindre vi snakker om store banker self) hvis den laver tilstrækkeligt med fejlsatsninger, som man må sige at satsningen på diesel fremfor elektrificering har vist sig at være. Men sagen er jo bare, at vi som samfund ikke kan acceptere at en virksomhed, som står for driften af en vital del af vores infrastruktur, går konkurs(lidt ligesom med bankerne). Med konkurser så får man luftforandring, imens med redningspakker, eller hva nu vi skal kalde det, så bliver der måske ikke den samme grundlæggende forandring af kultur og personer i virksomheden, som måske var skyld i problemerne i første omgang.

Der kom jo en del luftforandring i DSB med bl.a. en håndfuld direktører som blev fyret så det sker altså også der. Med det sagt så er der klart nogle udfordringer med den måde man styrer DSB på - governance som det kaldes. DSB er jo en selvstændig offentlig virksomhed (SOV), som nærmest er at betragte som et aktieselvskab 100% ejet af staten. Det betyder, at staten kan spørge til ting og stille krav til DSB som var de enhver anden aktionær med en majoritet (og bestyrelsen) bag sig. Dertil kommer så, at staten er kunde hos DSB, som udbyder togdrift igennem en forhandlet ""trafikkontrakt"". Den er langt mere end gentlemens agreement end en bindende privatretlig kontrakt (som f.eks. Arriva har). Det betød da også, at VK-regeringen i deres sidste finanslovsforhandling snuppede 300 mio. kr. fra DSBs årlige trafikkontraktsbetaling uden om de normale aftaler. Til sidst er staten også regulator for DSB og bestemmer (sammen med en del EU-direktiver) en masse om hvordan togdriften skal finde sted. 

Ovenstående er blot statens rolle(r) i forhold til DSB. Man har forsøgt med alt muligt i form af armslængdeprincippet, men det betyder dog stadig, at man fra DSBs side har været nødt til at aggere med en stor politisk risiko konstant. Tag bare eksemplet med DSB Mobil, som ifølge DSBs egne jurister var fuldt lovligt og i tråd med vedtægterne for DSB, men da man mødte forsidehistorierne fra tabloiderne og den efterfølgende politiske modstand, var man nødt til at lægge sig ned. 

På samme måde har der også været en række forkerte incitamenter i forhold til hele DSBFirst-skandalen. Langt hen af vejen så hverken jeg eller mine kolleger, at der var (store) problemer. Altså ting som var på kant med loven. Man kunne klart diskutere hvordan en række interne kontroller skulle have reageret tidligere på driftssituationen i DSBFirst. Men når jurister og revisorer, både internt og eksternt, siger god for den måde driften fungerer på, jamen så er det nok nemt at blive enige i det. Siden blev vi så klogere :(. Politisk var det dog nødvendigt at DSBFirst blev en succés og på samme vis med IC4. Jeg tror netop, at det er pga. de politiske krav, at DSB desværre nogen gange ender med at gøre som de gør.

The technical definition of Covert policy says much here: ""Affecting policy in a manner unattributed to the sponsor."" Essentially the point is that you're making an assumption that U.S. activities are not as evil, suppressive, vindictive or ruthless as our competitors, based on the standards used to judge others.

Unfortunately this assumption is based on a skewed understanding of what the U.S. will or will not do, based on a flawed sample of our policies.  Over the last century the U.S. has essentially been using proxies to achieve many desirable outcomes, thus allowing the citizenry to be ignorant of actions that have enabled our superiority, while policy makers justify the standard of living to its population by way of deceit.

The U.S. has sponsored countless coup d'etat's, genocides, and ruthless dictators, and yet our name was never on it. The U.S. has played dirty, nasty and corrupt in ways that would galvanize a moral citizenry to take action. To offset this the U.S. has followed a path of proxy-driven policies never taking responsibility for its most heinous actions.

**Again:** 
*""Affecting policy in a manner unattributed to the sponsor."" That means WE caused something, but when we took our history tests, the correct answer was someone else.*

In order to appreciate the full spectrum of U.S. activities would take quite a bit of work. I could suggest ""Secret and Sanctioned"" by a Naval War College professor as a starter. I mention this because his credibility is unquestionable as he teaches intelligence, and the examples he cites smash to pieces our rosy understanding of the things we're willing to do. This isn't meant to be a smoking gun. It is merely a good, *credible,* starting point. The truly egregious actions would never be discussed by someone who favors U.S. power. Knott, the author, only helps debunk the ""we would NEVER do THAT"" mentality. He does not illustrate just how far we go.

Finally, it is the certainty in which you base your opinion that is so disappointing; that such confidence is coupled with so much ignorance. It is not as though it is a fault. I'm not blaming you or anyone. It merely is a function of how things work and is to be expected.

Of course, based on unit volume differences alone, that doesn't account for the difference, because there's also the testing cycle to consider, which is the second factor.  The US uses the EPA cycle, which is known for being stringent in order to deliver the most accurate estimate.  By comparison, in Europe, the testing cycle is not as tough, which produces higher scores.  The key is to treat them as benchmarks, and look at the relative differences in mileage score between cars within the same testing cycle.

c4uznuq,2,2,t5_2snuc,False,,"&gt;Leviticus is the legal code of the ancient Hebrews. It became outdated a long time ago.

You're right. The Bible is not a good moral system, and should be discarded.

&gt;This section is also actually a maximum rather than a minimum. As in, you may buy slaves from adjacent lands only. It is a small step forward in a time when slavery was an enormous part of life, and very common. This passage limits it to a certain degree, paving the way for more steps forward in the future.

It limits it only by treating the members of our tribe as human beings worthy of respect, and people outside of our tribe as property to be bought and sold. This is the type of ""moral"" view that causes wars, and which we need to move beyond.

&gt;Consider also social moral relativism, where what is ethical can change within a decade. Slavery would not be possible to eliminate overnight, even by making a holy law.

Does that usually stop God from prohibiting things? Like sex out side of marriage?&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In addition, taking all the controversial passages from the bible and placing them in chronological order shows that the ethics of them transform over time becoming closer and closer to our own moral standards in 2012. Slavery is actually reduced in this way. Leviticus is a historical document.

Yes, so is the whole book, and is no other moral value.

&gt;The Ancient concept of slavery was extremely different from the popular definition of slavery which tends to apply the conditions of the African slave trade to all ideas of people as property. Slaves were not treated poorly, and were not considered to be sub-human.

What a crock. It says right in the passage to treat them as property. Other passages teach about circumcising them and drilling holes through their ears, how roughly to beat them (without knocking out teeth or eyes) and when you can, and cannot be punished for killing them.

&gt;Taking Leviticus out of context from it's nature as a history is not the correct way to read it. There is almost no concept in BCE times of slavery not being a part of life. It is in China, South America, Mesopotamia and Europe for most of history, and the passage you described is an example of an attempt to reduce it, rather than condone it.

&gt;**First,** consumers need* clear information on actual, real-life broadband speeds*. Not just the speed at 3 am, but the speed at peak times. The upload as well as the download speed. The minimum speed, if applicable. And the speed you’ll get when you’re also watching IPTV as part of your triple-play bundle, or downloading a video on demand via a premium “managed” service. Plus, you should know what those advertised speeds typically allow you to do online

&gt;**Second,** consumers also need clear *information on the limits of what they are paying for*. Clear, quantified data ceilings are much better than vague “fair use” policies that leave too much discretion to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). They allow low-volume users to look for deals that suit them. And they incentivise ISPs to price data volumes in ways that reflect costs, and so support investment in modernising networks as traditional voice revenues decline.

&gt;**Third,** consumers also need to *know if they are getting Champagne or lesser sparkling wine*. If it is not full Internet, it shouldn’t be marketed as such; perhaps it shouldn’t be marketed as “Internet” at all, at least not without any upfront qualification. Regulators should have that kind of control over how ISPs market the service.

I like Kroes, she's one of the less bad commissioners in the union, and luckily she's responsible for most of the Internet questions in the EU.

Second, and probably because she understands the first point, her proposals are usually in line with her weakness. 

Consumer information is of course something good, and something the EU has taken to heart because it's easy to implement and force through. However, it does not create or ensure any kind of Net Neutrality that she or any of her supporters actually do talk about.

As Lurdlespor mentioned on the forums, we aren't actually experiencing any server issues on our end, but that does not mean it's not something we're constantly looking into.

&gt;Considdering the amount of playing sharing the same issue, myself included, it's something that is being monitored on a daily basis. Sadly, there is not much more information that I have for you other than we are taking it seriously.

&gt;From a personal point of view, I can imagine it must suck to lose your Hardcore characters as I know the feeling myself. With regards to your diagnosic information, it would appear that all your drivers are up to date except for your network card. I would recommend that you update them for now and also make sure that you are not running a lot of programs in the back ground. Also, keep an eye on your graphics card to make sure it's not over heating as Diablo III is pretty graphic intensive.

&gt;I would also like to sincerely apologise for the wait time and delay answering your ticket. The release of Diablo III has impacted our queues very badly and sadly our response times are not as epic as we would like them to be but we are working on improving them as fast as possible. I thank you for your paitence and deeply apologise for the inconvenience caused.

&gt;Should you have any further issues or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us again. 

&gt;Kind regards,

A lot less than you think. It is a fallacy that the government are free to choose how to implement the cuts and tax increases. They have asked for permission to use more the money earned to from the planned sale of state infrastructure (which they have been forced to do by the Troika don't forget) for job creation rather than interest payments. Currently they have been given permission to use 33% for job creation and the rest must go on interest. Originally they were told 100% of the money had to go on debt repayments - and were legally obliged to spend the money this way as the Troika had said they must.

&gt;so when we need to cut let's pretend 0.05 billion, we decide... 

As the above example illustrates. This is in fact not the case. When the governments views match Europes then 'we decide', when they don't 'they decide' i.e. *they* decide, the pretend *we* decide.

We face austerity either way. We severely limit our options by relieving ourselves of a lot of our sovereignty.  From now on, it's Frankfurts way, whether we like it or not -  and whether it's good for us or not. Who can predict what is going to be good for us in 10 years time and if that's what Frankfurt will want for us - let alone right now. That's what we've signed up for.

c4v02mt,2,2,t5_2qh39,False,,"No one has mentioned this so I will add a quick explanation of the result of the reformation.


An early and important Christian belief was that Christ established one Church on earth.  This one Church was spread quite far geologically, but there was ""one faith, one body, one baptism"".  When a local division threatened to divide the people of God into two groups, the bishops came together in ecumenical councils to decide which competing theology was orthodox and which was heterodox (heretical).  This system worked pretty well, (unless you were a hapless modalist, monatist, gnostic or arian etc) with only one large scale geographical division (the schism between east and west sides of the Church in 1054)  


The Western part of the Church (what we today call Roman Catholic) could say that within Western Europe, they had one unified Church.  Diversity was managed within the various orders of monks and nuns, but everyone was clear that their ultimate loyalty was to Rome and theology was agreed collectively through councils or by the pope.


Then this one little monk(Martin Luther), distressed about how he might ever get to heaven under the medieval theology of works challenged to debate a guy (Tetzel) who was selling indulgences (selling salvation essentially).

 
Martin Luther tried to argue theology from the Bible, while the people defending Tetzel (people sent by the pope) argued that the pope's authority trumped the reason of well meaning thinkers like Luther.


In defiance of that claim, the people of Germany and the rest of Northern Europe realized that they preferred a theology which stated that the individual has the ability to reason for themselves on matters of faith and scripture.  While Luther never intended to split the Church (Lutherans still believe in One, Holy, catholic and Apostolic Church  -- small 'c' catholic simply means universal) the upshot of this new protestant theology was that an individual congregation or small group could interpret independently of others.  This lead to many movements and ultimately to the denominations we have today.  


But these human factors seem to account for the creation of most new denominations.


1)  The human need to be exactly right. (orthodoxy movements within protestant denominations)


2)  Inter-generational  differences (the splits that are happening as part of the controversies around homosexuality. )


3)  The migration of people to new places (often people bring their faith with them to a new place creating many variations of the same denomination (for example the variety of Lutheran Synods that used to exist before the mergers)

4) the lure of secret knowledge  (Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, and other groups whose beginnings include a special prophet)  ",0,1435712334,XalemD,1338569146,t1_c4v02mt,0,religion,True,,,False,t3_uff8n,0,t3_uff8n,

Dunno if you heard of this global financial catastrophe that started in 2008. It started when the money lenders decided it was time to contract credit, after expanding credit created the housing bubble. 

To be sure, that's not really a broken model (as in oops), that's plain theft.

Basic math is still a capability of many people, even if it is not one of yours. Central banks stand to lose nothing here, because they produce nothing. The debt they issue is generated out of thin air.

&gt; The people of Greece lived far, far beyond their means for many years. They are now insulting, burning the flags of, and generally acting like the victim of the people who are keeping them alive and is paying for their earlier decadence.

Okay, I should not need to explain this to you, but this is why the medical industry makes such a big deal about informed consent. How were the people of Greece able to live beyond their means? Only by the expansion of credit. Who was then responsible for determining the fiscal position of Greece? The Greek central bank and the euro central bank.

No, you would like to empty the treasury because central banks issued loans they knew could not be repaid.

&gt; 
&gt; Actually this might be a good opp for me to exorcise a little bit of macro tourism that's been bugging me... 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, it's really important to remember that Iceland, the sovereign, never defaulted in 08. They're back selling dollar bonds now and everything. (You sometimes see the argument for Grexit citing Iceland as a great precedent. Nope.)
&gt; 
&gt; Iceland did decide that some its banks' liabilities were just too much to take on to the sovereign balance sheet, which is fair enough. But you also have to remember that Iceland also kept up talks on eg. Icesave.
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing... they got capital controls right, which made the devaluation of the currency a lot easier to manage. (Joseph)

**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/_/c4uyo15?context=1) (thible):**

&gt; Lisa, thanks very much for your recent series shedding some light on JPMorgan's synthetic credit problems.  I think the last estimate we've seen have put the loss at $5B - do you think that number's going to get bigger?  I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether the JPM people simply made an expensive bad bet, or whether their positions got too complex to manage, either at a trading or management level.

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/_/c4uze3l?context=1) (FTAlphaville):**

&gt; Hi thible,
&gt; 
&gt; It's important to note that the $5bn is from some academics and market participants (who were interviewed by journos) putting their fingers in the air and guessing. Also these are mark-to-market losses, not realised ones. The bank research that I've seen on this, unbelievably, quotes the press! So little is known. I don't place a high value on the $5bn.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe it gets bigger, and maybe they decided to take a bath with the number, and it'll get smaller. That said, some of the positions that they *might* have would have performed badly since they announced the $2bn.
&gt; 
&gt; With a balance sheet the size of JPM's they can afford to sit on this position and manage it over time. The worst thing they could do is make a move that reveals their position cause everyone will slam into it. We'll have to wait and see what they have to say about it in the next quarterly results, I think. Unless an insider fesses up, which seems unlikely. Possible, but unlikely.

It's not even the first time either. Greece has a history of borrowing money and never paying it back. Their citizens ask for the impossible and then go out of their way to evade taxes. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

* There reportedly are more than 15,000 companies that the ministry suspects have not paid VAT or have received large returns using forged or bogus invoices"" (Feb. 22, 2008)

* Four out of 10 businesses inspected by the Finance Ministry's Special Inspections Service were found to have violated one or more provisions of the tax code

* International comparisons show that Greece's corruption and evasion problems are among the worst in the developed world

* Even before the financial crisis, Greece ran huge deficits. They kept afloat by cooking their books and getting loans from the EU bank. They only got INTO the EU because they made up their finance reports. 

* They demand a retirement age of 52, than aggressively avoid paying taxes. Last time I checked, it was around 30-40% of filers who cheated on their taxes. 

They refuse to accept austerity, but insist on staying in the EU. They basically don't want to be held accountable for any of their actions.

The Greek people protest against Austerity, claiming it is a ""punishment"". No. It is reality. You can cite any number of sob stories, but the fact is Greece does not have the income to serve it's debts. That's the bottom line. If you want to survive, you are going to have to cut your cushy lifestyle, or give more money to the government.

c4v096a,2,2,t5_2qh1i,1338570173,,"Right I am not sure if this story counts but i feel like telling it, so here you go.

This is story of how I, back when I was 16, spend about 10 hours in the rural French countryside without pants, it involves stupidity, a near-death experience, a helicopter and of cause a whole lot of nudity. It is however a rather long story, so please bare with me (is it bare with me or bear with me? ……. Ahh fuck it in this case it is most certainly bare with me).

When I was younger I spend a whole lot of time in area of Provence, France very close to Gorges du Verdon. Gorges du Verdon is great canyon in the south of France, sometimes described as Europe’s Grand Canyon. My father and me had walked a lot trips around the canyon and even rafted through part of it, but this time we wanted to do something different. We settled on a trip where you actually walk through the river most of the way, crossing between banks of stones that had formed along the wall of the canyon as the river snaked it way through. Even though I had never walked this trip, my father had done it several times without any problems, so we were not worried.  We started making the first crossings and everything went fine. I was wearing a pair of bathing shorts and a swim vest (like a life jacket but without the neck collar) and we tied a rope between us in case one of us should fall.

The river itself is actually dammed further up from where we were walking, and the waterflow tend to be strictly controlled. Usually this means that during the weekend and most of the tourist season they limit the amount water in the river, tourists can go rafting and fishing and such. We did our trip during a weekend so the waterlevel was low. Everything was going great and yes this should of cause have tipped us off that something was about to go wrong, but it didn’t. We did all the crossings, about 18 I think, and started walking back. The trip was actually a round trip, but the last few hours were rather boring so we decided just to turn back and do the crossings again. When we had about 5 crossings left before we reached the path that would take us out of the canyon and back to our car, we noticed that the waterlevel had risen and the current had gotten stronger, but we decided to go on, there was little else we could do at this point. Clearly the people at the dam were not sticking to the normal plan this weekend, perhaps because it wasn’t touristseason. We should clearly have checked this before we went on this trip, but if you don’t do stupid things you will never have great stories to tell the grandkids.

 We did another couple of crossings, but then current got too strong and we could no long walk across the river but had to swim instead. This didn’t go very well, the current was simply too strong and we got carried down the river, however, one of us would always remain on the bank so he could pull the other one in, when they taken by the current. We did this quite a few times with worse and worse results, I did our last attempt and that did not go very well. As I reached the middle of the river I got taken by the current, which was now stronger than I had ever experienced, and pulled down river, until the rope was fully stretched out. At this point I could see father was trying to dig his heels in on the bank trying to pull me back in, but instead he simply got pulled further and further towards the river. If we had not had the rope between us, I would simply have been torn down the river and crushed against the rocks somewhere. Realizing that if my father lost his footing we could very well both end up dead, so I tried to grab hold of large slightly submerged rock nearby, succeeded in grabbing hold of it with both hands, but as I started pull myself up on  it my bathingshorts started to slide off, they got stuck a little around my angles but as I tried to pull my legs up unto the rock as well they wriggled free and the current took them far down river. I rested a bit on the rock and then swam close enough to the bank so that my father could pull me in.

So there we were, stuck on a stony bank surrounded by the river on three sides and the canyon wall on the fourth and I wasn’t wearing any pants. We could actually see the path that could take us out the canyon but we couldn’t reach it without crossing the river and that wasn’t happening unless the waterlevel fell, it didn’t, in fact it kept rising and the bank slowly got smaller. I decided that now would be a good time to call for help, however since we had been swimming in water we hadn’t brought any electronic devices or cellphones with us. In fact we had left our backpacks with phone, clothe, food, car keys next to the path, so we had nothing except the clothes we were wearing, which in my case entailed only a pair of shoes and a svimvest and nothing else. By some weird twist of fate, the bank we had ended up on was directly below one of the scenic viewpoints that had been placed along the road at the top of the canyon, and it was a popular one as there continued to be tourists there for the rest of the day. I decided to write “help” with some white stones that I found on the bank and the tourists stared at my naked arse. After about 4 hours the French rescue service showed up in a helicopter. They somehow managed to pilot the helicopter into the canyon, a pretty impressive feat, considering the canyon is very deep and not very wide. They couldn’t land, but lowered down one of the rescue crew using a crane on the helicopter. First they pulled my farther up and then me. To this day I still don’t how the French rescue guy, managed the even more impressive feat of getting me into the crane harness without getting my junk, which was jingling around caught in one of the straps or wires, but I will forever remain grateful to the French rescue service for that fact.

The helicopter landed on a small pad next to road at the top of the canyon. As I got out of the helicopter I decided to wrap my swimvest around my midlife so my groin wasn’t showing, however in order to achieve this I had to hold it in place with both hands. The road next to the heli-pad had been closed by the police as there was a limited amount of space and it wasn’t possible to land a helicopter there with cars driving by all the time. They did however let one car by, the car with the Italian tourists that had called the rescue service in the first place. They waved and got out a camera to take a picture, I decided to wave back, not realizing what the consequences would be. My swimvest dropped to the ground leaving me completely bare and the Italians got a very special vacation picture…….. the only naked photo ever taken of me where I can’t excuse myself with being drunk.

This is actually not the end, but it feels like a good place to stop.

The story goes on for 5-6 hours more before I finally get home and get into a pair of pants, but that part of the story is not quite as exciting, even though it does involve even more stupidity, an artillery barrage, a scare hotel employee, a cellphone with a very bad signal and a crazy French taxi driver.

TL;DR: River took my pants, I took a ride on a helicopter and an Italian tourist took a photo.

Those graphs are of the EU as a whole or of the PIIGS countries, i.e. not the UK. PIIGS countries are in austerity because they have a sovereign debt crisis - i.e. their deficits were so high pre 2008 that once the crash happened they were unable to borrow on the bond markets. 

E.g. look at Greece 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Greece#2010.E2.80.93present_government_debt_crisis

When Greece entered the Euro it was able to borrow cheaply and its public spending and deficit both rose. When 2008 hit and everyone's deficit's rose, it ended up in a sovereign debt crisis.

Now the UK is freezing spending - i.e. not increasing it with inflation - that is a much less harsh process. The reason it is doing it is because it is close to a sovereign debt crisis. In fact when 2008 happened it had the highest deficit in the EU. It pretty much had to do something about spending. The current government are capping the increase below inflation. Which is not that radical.

Look what the Krugster said

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/opinion/krugman-the-austerity-agenda.html

&gt; So why is Britain doing exactly what it shouldn’t? Unlike the governments of, say, Spain or California, the British government can borrow freely, at historically low interest rates. So why is that government sharply reducing investment and eliminating hundreds of thousands of public-sector jobs, rather than waiting until the economy is stronger?

This is completely dishonest. The reason the UK can borrow at historically low rates is because it has a program to reduce its structural deficit. If it did what he suggests - i.e. spend, spend, spend - that would not be true.

It's called **""Instant History: Understanding the Wars of Yugoslav Succession""** by Gale Stokes, John Lampe, Dennison Rusinow, Julie Mostov

It's in Slavic Review, Vol. 55, No. 1 (Spring, 1996), pp. 136-160, I hope you can access it because it will give you a great overview not just of the topic of modern national divides in the Balkans, but also of the easy
journalistic tropes of study of this, tropes which I think both you and the guy you were relying to originally need to watch out for. 

Firstly, you need to be very wary of seeing nationality as something primordial and innate:

*""recent scholarship has veered decisively away from the primordialist view that ethnicity and nationality are fixed categories. Most students of nationalism now understand national identities as boundary-maintaining, but malleable, imagined communities sustained by invented traditions. These national identities are typically seen as one of a family of nested identities, the salience of which is a function of circumstances""*

Next, don't just assume that communities were religiously homgenous, and that people simply took on the religion of their brethren:

*""Tone Bringa's study of a mixed Muslim-Catholic village in central Bosnia began as a standard ethnographic project based on research she carried out in 1987 and 1988' At the beginning of 1993 her village was still precariously intact both physically and as a bi-communal community. But when she returned for her last visit in May of that year, all of its Muslim majority had been killed or expelled, and their homes destroyed by Croats who included some of their fellow-villagers.""*

Next, don't assume that national or ethnic identity has always had enormous significance:

""*As late as 1990, Bringa says, her villagers and other rural Bosnians were still identifying themselves and each other as Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim in the religious sense rather than Croat, Serb and Muslim in the national sense. They displayed a lively awareness of their similarities as well as their differences, even joking about them in the course of various forms of intercommunal socializing.*""

In many cases, they simply held a religious identity orginally, and the national identity came later, as a result of external forces:

*""By early 1993, however, nationalists from outside the village were increasingly successful in insisting that separate national identities were incompatible and mutually threatening. In April 1993, to the apparent surprise of both the Muslims and the Catholics, some Croatian villagers reacted to the exploitation of the pre-existing, but until now relatively benign, awareness of difference and joined outsiders in destroying the Muslim community""*

After explaining that another historian, Danforth, has brought forth more evidence of the ""constructed and fissionable"" nature of ethnic identity, they conclude on this topic by reminding us that:

*""both Bringa and Danforth are a reminder of the ambiguous and multifaceted nature of identity, and of the disastrous consequences of insisting (or ""imagining"") that ethno-national identities must be homogeneous""*

Another article I'd love to source for you, but I don't have time to summarize now, is ""Dejan Jovic, ‘The Disintegration of Yugoslavia: A Critical Review of Explanatory Approaches’, European Journal of Social Theory, 4:1 (2001), pp. 99-118"". It's awesome, and like the one above, gives a really good idea of how lots of different historians are approaching the ethnic conflicts and rivalries which have emerged in the last 20 years, and what approaches to avoid. The best book on the topic of culture and nationality in Yugoslavia in the 20th century, IMO, is Andrew Wachtel, ""Making a nation, breaking a nation: literature and cultural politics in Yugoslavia"", do read this if you're interested and have the time.",0,1429046504,bobisterbezreal,1338571743,t1_c4v0nix,0,AskHistorians,True,,,False,t1_c4uzngk,0,t3_ufefe,

The FA refused to participate in the first few world cups because FIFA was formed in France instead of England and had a contentious relationship from the get go.  They didn't like that FIFA refused to bow to them as the ultimate authority in football.  They assumed that without British teams (England, Wales, Scotland, N. Ireland) the World Cup would falter.  

When they finally relented and agreed to participate in 1950, they soon found out that football has passed them by and they would not dominate just by showing up.  They struggled mightily for the next 16 years until England '66.   

After that you have the debacle of Mexico '70 and a long line of futility begins.  

In the 90's you have the advent of the Premier League, and while at first it's probably the 4th league in Europe behind Italy, Spain and Germany, it soon begins to get better and as it's business end begins to bear fruition, it begins to soon challenge for the top spot among European leagues.  

And here in lies another huge problem for the English squad.  The Premier League has become so successful that it has become dependent on the import of foreign talent.   While most reams still run youth Academies, because of the pressures of winning and staying in the premier League, teams are more likely to buy a developed player than actually wait for a youth player to emerge.  This means that young English players (the bulk of the youth system players) have to wait longer to get valuable experience and game minutes.   

It used to be the norm to see 18 and 19 year old English players on the pitch for the top clubs, but now they don't seem to get minutes till in their 20's.   This basically slows down their maturation process and sometimes leaves huge gaps in spots for the national team.

&gt; I didn't have a clue either. I did International Relations at the London School of Economics. No econ. No finance. Just a little bit of economic history (which seriously, everyone should study). The thing is, IR (at LSE anyway) encourages you to wander around other disciplines. So I got an understanding of international law, history, poli sci, etc. and the analytical rigour that goes into each of them.

&gt; Bearing in mind there is probably a huge shortage of real capital for investment and the opacity of banks' annual reports, where do you think the source of funds to recapitalise the banks is going to come from?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/_/c4v12sx?context=1) (FTAlphaville):**

&gt; Well, for the state-owned UK banks, depending which day you ask the government, it seems to be either Qatar or China...
&gt; 
&gt; Being serious - maybe there isn't a shortage of capital. Maybe capital just can't find investment opportunities... and in banks, it sees broken business models where return on equity and leverage are going to be depressed for a long time to come. Hard for a bank to issue equity in that environment so I think we're going to see a long trudge of banks tweaking the denominator of their regulatory capital ratios. Obviously that means things like how their risk models work.

I think that you are being more specific than you think you are; my impression is that you are trying to say 'the majority of European-Americans are descended from the lower classes of Europe'. But to some of us, what you are saying is 'the majority of European-Americans are descended from the subsistence agricultural labourer class of feudal Europe'.

In its common usage, 'peasants' can refer to a number of quite different classes; it can refer to agricultural serfs, yeomen (that is to say a landowner who still has to work his own land) and town citizens. The conditions, treatment, and size of each of these classes could vary enormously depending on what area you were in, and also varied over time. In the case of England, it has been argued (though I am not an expert and so I am only stating the arugment, not necessarily agreeing with it) of 1381, that the end of serfdom began with the Peasant's revolt, and it certainly had disappeared by 1574 when Elizabeth I completely abolished it.

So when you imagine 'peasants', what are you imagining?

As for aristocratic culture is descendant of peasant culture, that's really up for debate; the term aristocrat is somewhat modern, the preferred term is usually 'elites' (which is far too general in my opinion but it gets the point across). The emergence of 'elites' in cultures is someting that occured during prehistory, in the millenia since then many cultures have emerged, evolved, merged, and some have disappeared completely. There were 'aristocrats' in Babylon in 3000 BC, there were 'aristocrats' in Athens in 400 BC, if you are arguing that medieval 'aristocratic' culture emerged from the peasant lifestyle then I have to disagree because you're placing the origin of social differentiation far too late in Europe's history.

Most countries, especially my own of the UK/England, don't actually have a single national dish, they have combinations of dishes and foods that make up a cultural cuisine. Associating an entire country, usually a collection of cultures, with a single dish is to reduce it to a stereotype. You cannot take a stereotyped national dish and use it to analyse the cultural evolution of a group of people, and arguably food is a very bad example anyway; eating habits and diet have changed enormously even in 500 years, the further back you go the less that modern 'national' dishes mean anything.",0,1429046895,Daeres,1338575060,t1_c4v1fa9,0,AskHistorians,True,Moderator | Ancient Greece | Ancient Near East ,middleeast,False,t1_c4v0lxp,0,t3_uf4cz,

As others have elaborated here, it generally refers historically to areas deriving from European Civilization writ large. As with most historical terms, this definition is anything but exact, so there unfortunately isn't any concrete answer we can give you. 

Broadly speaking, The West in a historical article or book probably refers to one of the following, depending on time period:

1) The Greek World or the Roman Empire;

2) European Feudal &amp; Christian States;

3) Imperial &amp; Colonizing Powers;

4) First World Countries (As opposed to the Soviet Second World, and the NAM Third World).


To bring up one historical example of The West, Peter the Great is often seen as a 'Westernizer' of Russia. I'm actually not sure if the use of that term is anachronistic, but certainly the concept of Europeanizing Russia existed at the time (and has reemerged every so often ever since). The West thus usually stands in contrast to something that definitely isn't The West - in this case Russia, in a more modern case Iran or China. 

In a foreign relations/current affairs context, The West usually means some members or combination of the following countries or groups, generally consisting of the developed capitalist democracies (and somewhat oddly, the term is also effectively synonymous with The North, especially in economic and development contexts): 

1) US - France - Britain (the 3 Western countries in the P5 on the UNSC);

2) G7/G8 Countries;

3) NATO Countries;

4) The European Union;

5) OECD Countries;

6) The Five Eyes.


Notably, outside of North America &amp; Europe, other countries usually included in the West are Australia and New Zealand. Israel, South Korea, and Japan are also often included due to their political and economic structures, despite cultural differences from the rest of the West. I have even seen some references that include Singapore and Taiwan. Russia and Turkey are included in some few cases, depending on the situation or metric being used. Despite its history of European settlement and geographic location, Latin America is not generally seen as a part of the West. 

If you are interested in the idea of civilization as a defining concept in history and politics, Samuel Huntington's Foreign Affairs article *The Clash of Civilizations* (and later book) is a much-cited (and controversial) attempt to paint civilizations as the key driver of events in our modern world.

Spaniards moved 66.2 billion euros, or $82 billion, to stronger economies in northern Europe as credit ratings of 8 Spanish regions were cut due to negative economic environments. 

Spanish banks have been hit hard by losses from a 2008 property crash and funding costs have since skyrocketed. 

The 4th largest bank, Bankia, received a government bailout in May after it was not able to handle losses from real estate investments.

The European Commission has given rescue funds to recapitalize Spanish banks, as well as provide more time for Spain to reduce its budget deficit.

Spain’s Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria will meet with US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and IMF Chief Christine Lagarde to outline how Spain will handle its banking crisis.

First of all, I am a European-American, not in the sense that I'm white and live in America, rather, that I was born in Europe and emigrated to the U.S. By our culture, I mean European culture in general, along with most of American culture that is descendant from Europe. Sorry for being ambiguous as to what I was talking about, hopefully this clarifies.

And by peasant, I mean settled rural lower class. As up until the industrial revolution, that's what the majority of any countries population was. More simply, I'm arguing any culture in Europe, with a few exceptions, is descendent from an agrarian society. I won't use the word peasant then, interpret my previous posts about peasant lifestyle or culture as meaning agrarian society.

I know there has been an elite since humanity had civilizations. When I said that aristocratic culture is descendent from the culture of the lower classes, I mean that the lower class influences the upper class culturally more than the other way around. There isn't a continuous line from the earliest elites of a society to our contemporary elites. Families die off or lose fortune, and a wealthy peasant may move up the social ladder throughout enough generations to completely replace the old elites. If I recall correctly, most of the nobles of the old regime in france before the revolution weren't from families that were noble in medieval times.

National dish isn't important, that's just something that came out of nationalism. However, the cultural cuisine is important. I agree with you on the idea that national dishes are just a self-imposed (or by others) stereotype, I meant cultural cuisine.

I agree that the industrial revolution is more relevant to our lifestyle, though I chose when our societies were agrarian, as the cultural revolution varied much more in different regions. Especially if you're from the UK, which has been much more impacted by it than countries in Europe whose economy is still mostly based in agriculture.

I think JPM was trying to recoup some of the losses their CIO division incurred (2-7 billion dollars).

I think the entire situation is fishy.

FB should have gone public 10 years ago, if they did that they'd have time to earn people's trust, respect, and awareness.

Fairness is not simply a NA invention. The world is not fair, but educators should do what they can to make sure they aren't party to making it more unfair.

&gt;In a way that's a noble goal, but it also misses reality. Tests should be fair in as such that they only deal with material that the student can know, but beyond that?

You are right, they should only deal with material that the student can know, and that is it. That is the definition of testing academic achievement.

&gt;Personally I think ""free form"" tests with evaluation by the teacher is the better way to go. Why? Because you can much easier to probe if the student understood the material and can apply it, or if they just learned the basic process and are following it.

What do you mean 'free form' tests? How can you effectively make such a test reliable, valid, and fair? The ideal tests are a mixture of knowledge and understanding. Making a test that way is extremely difficult under the best of circumstances.

It is an interest based fiat money scheme that has enriched the lives of millions, (in my opinion) at the secret cost of impoverishing and limiting the economic growth of nearly every third world country with something of value to the developed world.   

Wall St. may not be your friend necessarily, but we are not the demon that we have been made out to be.  The IMF, World Bank, and the Central Banks of the world run the game.   Wall St., being closest to them, and definitely having some connections to those up top, obviously will get handouts, but we are not the source of the malevolence that you seek to put an end to.   

Libya.  Iraq.  Afghanistan.  Vietnam.   None of these countries had a debt-based currency until we invaded.  Think about what countries are demonized daily on the news and compare it to the list of countries who still do not have a debt-based currency: North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran.  

In other words stealing from the American people is one thing in order to propagate a scheme where you have already stolen from the entire world, that's just what we asked for anyways, a boom-bust cycle that will give us tremendous wealth over time.  Turns out it's not true, we weren't better off with a fiat currency.  Not only that but in order to propagate this scheme further and further into countries that necessarily are opposed to debt-based anything, you have to go to war.  It's all a sham. 

Look no further than the EU.  Every intellectual knew that it was a currency destined to fail.  Given a long enough time scale, one country would get into a war the others did not agree with, or one country would run up a bar tab and hope the others would pay it off.  It was destined to explode.  This is nothing like a real estate price bubble where we know it will burst but we think if we keep feeding it then there's no way it will happen while we're still alive.  Everyone knew the EU was a bad idea run by a bunch of ex-Soviets.  Who is Rumpel?  Barosso?  It's all a huge disaster right now.

Capitalism, god forbid, not socialism.  Is still the most efficient way of distributing resources in a global economy that we know of. The future of capitalism is dim if you look around you.  I pay nearly half of what I make to governments.  

I hope that people awaken to the horror that is Socialism before it spreads any further.  I don't think Capitalism is the best, but it's the best we have.  Socialism is an absolute head over heels race to the bottom for many reasons.  

The undue privilege yielded to banks by the US .gov is simply hilarious.  It's called moral hazard.

&gt;All the big football event trafficking claims are hoaxes
 &gt;Nope. I live in Berlin in a somewhat bad neighborhood. 2006, when the World Cup was in Germany, the streets where flooded with Eastern European prostitutes. Prostitution in Germany is legal, but nobody denies that sex traffic is real and a problem.

&gt;[–]kratistos 10 points 19 days ago

&gt;Let me try to explain: Europe has a sex slavery problem. Many young women come from Belarus, the baltic States or the Ukraine to Germany and other rich countries with the promise to work as cleaning ladies, manufacturers, etcetera with the help of human traffickers. Instead of this, they get systematically raped and are forced into prostitution. This problem is very real and not a feminist invention.

&gt;Ukraine is a corrupt country where the organized crime is the real power, censorship is normal and the democracy is kind of fake. There are a lot of human rights violations. It's pretty shitty. 

&gt;Those feminists want to bring attention to those problems - and it's the right thing to do. Soccer fans are mostly male and often drunk (speaking as a soccer fan), many of them will go to brothels. I'm all for prostitution, but if you have no choice but to fuck strangers for 10€s without a condom to keep yourself and your family alive, it kind of sucks. I hope you agree. Those feminists protest the lack of future for Eastern European women and they're very right.

&gt;Stating that the prostitution problem in Ukraine is due to ""Women who flaunt themselves and sell their bodies"" is really, really ignorant. It's due to the mob, unemployment, lack of education and the huge market of sex tourists. As I said before, I'm all for sex tourism (why not?) but people should stick to ""fair trade"" whores, who do this voluntarily and are regularly tested. A lot of Germans will bring AIDS with them from the Ukraine. 

Now, I don't know too much about sex slavery in the US, however, the concern that many women have is that legalizing it will increase the amount of women that are coerced into it. I don't see, personally, why more women would be coerced if it's legal then they would be if it were *illegal,* and I think that it should be legal, however considering that sexual slavery is an actual problem, (and not some crazy feminist conspiracy) I can see where these fears would arise, and why people may have such fears.",0,1429047676,catipillar,1338581540,t1_c4v2zhi,0,MensRights,True,,,False,t1_c4v2kqr,0,t3_ufkaq,

The SPLC, I did not know about. But a firm with 212 employees with an endowment of over $220 Million, that's an average pay of $1 Million a year. And they have not won much money for their clients, looks like. Just for themselves. So, a white guy exploiting minorities to make money? That sounds like a modern method of slavery to me. Slavery wasn't stopped because a majority of plantation owners wanted to give up their slaves, it stopped because of a handful of men. If you had been born white during that era, chances are, you would be a slave owner, if you were lucky. Or just kicking around black folk if you were not so lucky.

Irish are caucasians. And 100 years ago? Were you alive then? Did you actually suffer through the Potato famine? They say the Irish are the niggers of Europe. I work in an Irish office, and I agree. Not that that is a bad thing. I get to drink alcohol at work, swear loudly and tell crass jokes at meetings. I wouldn't trade working here for the world. But, when they get out of the building, which is in a black neighborhood, they are just as racist.

America hasn't grown past shit. Just found more ways to make money. And the number of cases, and documented white supremacist groups illustrated in the SPLC tells me this. There must be a handful of white supremacist groups in Europe. Here, in America, hundreds. So, thank you for that.

Okay.

A preference for lighter skinned, women especially, has been shown over time, all around the world, with or without European contact. Even for black men and women, lighter shades are perceived as more attractive.

[And Asians](http://www.pri.org/stories/world/asia/skin-whitening-big-business-asia.html)

I do not necessarily believe this is false. I believe that the 'seriousness' of how 'large' the problem is, is a feminist invention. Just like the grossly over-inflated 'rape' or 'violence against women' myths. There are sex slaves in the world (particularly in non-Western nations such as Ukraines) but these nations tend to have a plethora of other even more serious (male) problems which feminists never bother to address. If prostitution is legalized in a nation, then what incentive (other than price, perhaps) could someone have for choosing a dirty 'sex slave' over a clean 'prostitute'? Especially if you consider the legality of the two? Even if price is a concern, maybe it's because the price of prostitution is far too high?

&gt;Those feminists protest the lack of future for Eastern European women and they're very right.

Well, feminists in the U.S. protest the lack of 'future' of supposed child 'sex-slaves' which were proven to be false. You can't really blame us for being skeptical of feminists nor their 'statistical data' and what constitutes as a 'serious problem'. Also, you pretend like the future of 'Ukrainian men' isn't at stake? The existance of 'sex-slavery' in Ukraines suddenly means that ALL 'women in Ukraines' have a 'lack of future' is ridiculous. Men in these countries are generally poor and work jobs in horrible conditions. As you stated earlier:

&gt;Ukraine is a corrupt country where the organized crime is the real power, censorship is normal and the democracy is kind of fake. There are a lot of human rights violations. It's pretty shitty.

However, I never see feminists bring up male-issues in these nations. 

&gt;Stating that the prostitution problem in Ukraine is due to ""Women who flaunt themselves and sell their bodies"" is really, really ignorant.

I didn't. You brought up Ukraines, not me. I brought up a recent incident in America where feminists were blowing their caskets over a fallacy (as usual).

Not really. Most people have 'fears' because when think they of prostitution, they think of 'sex slavery'.

As US, you HAVE to know about Blockade. Unfortunately there is little to make this process short, but you should certainly have a look over the card manifests available online.

* The skill in the game is just as much in getting rid of your opponents events as using your own effectively. As a US player, a hand full of red cards can be great because you can deal with them when they're least effective, and potentially remove them from the game permanently. Take for instance Warsaw Pact, a USSR card which either adds 5 USSR influence in Eastern Europe or removes ALL US influence in a number of Eastern European countries. As the US, you actually want this in your hand because you can make sure it is used early on when there is no US influence to remove, because if it's still hanging round later when the US gets a chance to move into Europe (with cards like Chernobyl, Tear Down this Wall, Solidarity, etc) this can basically destroy those plans with a stroke.

The counterpoint to this is that with your own events you generally only want to play them for the event if you actually *really* need them for what they do. Otherwise, they're going to happen sooner or later when your opponent gets them in their hand; by waiting you get the event anyway + the ops value of the card. It also helps clog up your opponents hand with what is probably junk.

A good example of this is Romanian Abdication, a USSR card that gives the USSR enough influence in Romania to control it. You don't actually really need Romania all that much, and while it's 1 op you might as well put that 1 op somewhere useful rather than wasting your turn (which is the most valuable resource of all) on a fairly unimportant non-battleground country.

* The value of controlling Europe is huge, but the price of doing so is equally huge. Don't overinvest in Europe; the best situation is generally a 2/3 break in the battlegrounds to grant domination (assuming your opponent doesn't have more countries overall). Initial influence placements mean that the U.S. usually will control Italy and W. Germany, and the U.S.S.R. has E. Germany and Poland. It really comes down to France and who has control of Spain/Portugal, Greece, and Turkey - the 2 stability states. These latter ones are important because if you have fewer battlegrounds you can stop a domination by having more of these.

* Coups are *really* good, and the DEFCON usually hangs around 2 for that reason. Additionally, both players have an incentive to keep it at 2, and certainly lower than 4, to protect their own battlegrounds. As the USSR player they can take the coup when DEFCON increases from 2 to 3. One good way for the US to mess with the USSR is to use their last turn to break control of a USSR country, forcing the USSR to decide between taking the coup or restablishing control (since you cannot split your points and do both).

* Early on, the real fight is for Asia and to a degree the Middle East. As noted Europe quickly enters a stalemate. Asia can go either way; assuming the usual coup of Iran for the first USSR move, they'll usually get India and Pakistan to go with North Korea. South Korea can go either way depending on the breaks of the Korean War, and Japan is guaranteed to be American. The real battle is for Thailand, and when DEFCON drops to three the U.S. player really must rush straight for it via Malaysia. Going any earlier means you're at risk of being couped out and potentially giving access to South East Asia to the USSR who do not otherwise have access (i.e. totally disastrous).

* The Middle East is biased towards the USSR - note how the scoring for Presence and Domination are not far apart at all, because as the U.S. you're trying to maintain a presence and at best prevent domination. The U.S.' natural basis is Israel, but it is vulnerable to the Arab-Israeli War. The Mid-War Muslim Revolution card is especially nasty.

* Africa, South America, and Central America come out in the Mid War and tend to actually be more decisive - especially Africa, which has lots of low stability battlegrounds and thus can easily change allegiance with not much effort. Note that Africa control, which is entirely plausible, can score you 10vp - Europe is very unlikely to ever score you more than 5vp or so. While you should not be investing in these heavily in the Early War, getting a position ready for the Mid-War can be worth your time. For the USSR, who do not start with a position in these areas, Decolonization and Destalinization are utterly invaluable and if you're the US you should aim to deny your opponent these cards by holding on to them or spacing them.

Those are the ones that come to mind. One important thing to keen in mind: this game is deep, and it ages like wine. If you enjoy it but are slightly confused the first time, that's a good sign. The more you play it the more you appreciate the strategical complexities around things like card interactions, which cards of your opponents you actually want to have in your hand and which of your own you actually want your opponent to have, and the like.

I don't really know anything about Bradley and Jonhson but Donovan, Dempsey and Howard are all average premier league players, Dempsey is arguably the best but even he is just a slightly above average player who had a good season so don't get ahead of yourselves.


&gt; England’s national team is a joke and has been for most of my life.

Are you kidding? No we aren't the best team in the world but so what? We are easily a top 10 team and have been for most of our history. We English like to be self deprecating about our team but in reality we aren't THAT bad.


&gt;Their FA is clueless, and the top English league isn’t even English anymore.

We have the strongest and richest league so we can afford to bring in the best players from other countries, I don't see anything wrong with this. Most top teams from big leagues have a lot of foreign born players it's not just England. Although i'd have to agree about the FA being clueless, so is FIFA and most football governing bodies.


&gt;The English media is a joke and spends more time covering the shopping endeavors of WAGS or showing photos of some dumb blondes’ tits than providing any real soccer insight.

Because the American media is great right? *cough* Fox News *cough*. The media in every country is shit.

You tied with us for points, were only ahead because you scored 2 more goals and only drew with us because our keeper made a stupid mistake, congrats.

I'm still fully for the open borders and the possibility to live and work wherever within the Union but trying to bundle all these different cultures together would be just insanely impossible.

Besides, what's important is the cooperation between us Europeans and a single voice to the outside world. Not someone from wherever telling Iberians, Italians and Irish that they should all do the same, as that clearly would not work, these countries have different problems and different ways to tackle them. ;)

Basically, though further integration isn't a bad thing, centralized government isn't required outside of areas such as foreign relations or security. There needs to be a balance, Greece and Portugal should have the same public debt standards as Germany and Denmark but nobody is willing to give up their full sovereignty (for example, Portuguese drug laws or maximum sentences are fine the way they are, we don't want them changed by anyone, specially if they come from the outside!).

&gt;look at Greece and Germany. So much friction. Not just the politics, but people's attitudes and opinions.

Greece unfortunately looks like a very special case. One where government incompetence plunged the country into massive debt and now they're victimizing themselves. Not that they're fully to blame, stricter regulation to Greek public finance would have discover these issues prematurely but unfortunately now there's that and the Greeks don't seem to be too pleased about the Union's response..

I honestly don't think Germany is to blame, they're in fact doing a lot to keep us together, though I'm also fully aware Greece is having a hard time and we can't just demand them paying up everything, though it must be clear that careless spending of other people's money just isn't something allowed.

I was born almost 19 years ago, Portugal has been in the EU for 26 years, it's not a long time ago, sure, but still, I consider myself a Portuguese and an European at the same time.

My cousin didn't go to college at all, and she manages an office at a new start up hardware/software company and makes $50k/yr. She called me up a couple weeks ago and offered me an interview with her boss for a tech support job there. I got it, and it pays almost $16/hr. I start Monday. Granted, I have to learn a bunch of stuff and know next to nothing about my job, so it's contingent on me learning it; but if I do, I'll be doing better in a few months than I would've been doing a year from now by taking a years more worth of classes.

Nothing I learned in college got me this job. I could've graduated with a degree and still found a worse job opportunity than this, even with my future degree in consideration.

It's not what you know, it's who you know. Please note, I said that I know nothing about the job I'm going into. They hired me because they liked my personality and thought I could learn the stuff because I know a little about computer hardware (I can build one...wow...). If I don't learn it, I get shit-canned, but if I do, I'm signed on with a start-up company (it's a start up *here*; it's successful in Europe) as the only guy doing tech support. If they grow, I'm immediately the guy on top, supervising new hires. That's an amazing opportunity.

Again, it's who you know, not necessarily what you know. I stressed so hard because I thought I just needed to learn more, but all the learning and paper documents in the world can't guarantee you a job in this world today. My only qualifications are that I could put a computer together for you, I'm pretty smart/capable, and my cousin recommended me. That's all it is. No degree, no special training, nothing.

In short, life is about fucking luck. Once you get lucky, then I guess you can work your ass off at it and prove yourself. But, some people don't get lucky. I know I didn't; I'm 25 and I'm just now getting a decent wage.

&gt;While the phrase age of consent typically does not appear in legal statutes,[1] when used in relation to sexual activity, the age of consent is the minimum age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts.

It should not be confused with the age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, the marriageable age, the voting age, the drinking age, driving age, or other purposes.

I have a training with ISE, not GUE, but the course is similar as ISE head is an ex-GUE and sticks to GUE standards for most if not all of it.

However, even though I stick to it for many things, I cannot claim being a DIR diver myself. And _I_ for one do not think that DIR is an absolute best answer. Read http://www.inspired-training.com/DIR%20-%20Whats%20its%20not.htm to put things in perspective there (an extreme article, that I do not endorse, but still points at an other way to look at DIR...).

My point about DIR is that it is very interesting, and needs to be lived from the inside of a DIR class to undersand. But I do not ""believe"" in DIR. For instance, I think dive computers have their legitimate place in my kit, I wear a helmet in some cave dives, I sometime dive solo, etc.

All those divergences not only make me a stroke, but also mean that my kit, originally DIR-like, needs some refactoring, because it simply does not work anymore in that new context.

Diving solo is obvious and should make one think about manifolded tanks vs separate ones, gas procedures, and obviously the impossibility of team work and all the repercusions that has.

But even a simple example like adding a helmet in cave has a lot of repercusions. Consider: the helmet makes switching to the backup mask a lot more complex, could make the long hose deployment more difficult if not dangerous. Also, a helmet is also a tempting place to store torches, like many cave divers in EU do. But that in turns causes an endless string of incompatibilities with the DIR system, etc.

My principal grievance to the DIR system is that it is not flexible enough to accomodate some dive environments outside of FL caves. Ask a UK sump diver about the no-helmet DIR requirement. He will probably laugh because the sumps he dives in are just plain dangerous without a helmet.

Also, the very idea of team diving, long hose and donating gas this way is all fine and dandy in FL caves and open water, but believe me there are caves where attempting to do this would probably mean killing 2 divers instead of just one. Hence many EU divers diving ""solo in groups"".

And the list of examples is very long. I really apologize if I somehow encouraged you to consider that DIR is the best system in all circumstances. That was not my intent, neither my belief.

&gt; Looking out the last 5 years gold has had a great run...

LOL, hey, how about Gold price in the last 100 years? How does it fare then? Oh let's see. In 1912 Gold was $20 an ounce. Now its $1650 an ounce. How does that compare to the NYSE between 1912 and 2012? 

And it isn't Glenn Beck that is making gold jump up in price. [It is fundamental demand from BIG BUYERS like sovereign nations.](http://www.infiniteunknown.net/2010/11/24/china-russia-iran-are-dumping-the-dollar-buy-gold-and-silver/) And central banks.

&gt; It looked great until half way through 2011. Ever since the end of last summer gold has been trading in a downward range. http://finviz.com/futures_charts.ashx?t=GC&amp;p=w1

Every policy they come up with, the party backs it up (unless Merkel &amp; the Gang start nodding in disapprovement, which is why Ministers in Greece pressured the former Greek PM to leave last here). Coallition governments even get such blind support from more than one party. All this in order to secure a majority support of the government. This is true for any political system.

Ok, but that's a different problem altogether. This isn't about a PM and his cabinet being technocratic; you're criticizing the democratically-elected officials. Which is legitimate and everything, but not grounds to call a system undemocratic, especially if those officials in question lose power in the elections.

&gt; I'm talking about a subtle difference of principle. In Portugal when you vote you know the whole package you're getting. In Greece or italy you don't. That for me is the difference between a transparent election and an aristocratic one, which is to say the former is more democratic than the latter.

You know Italy (I don't know about Greece) has a history with technocratic governments, right? It's not seen as a terrible thing for experts to temporarily take over if the country's in the shitter (which, with Berlusconi, it was). I don't know much about how much support Papademos got, but Monti's fairly popular.

The point of this kind of government is to get the country out of a crisis, and them immediately turn over power to people elected in new elections.

Hmm... Interesting. So living in the place of a particular 'issue' means you are automatically right over someone who is NOT living in the place? 

&gt;Well, to be honest, I think it's pretty common knowledge that the movement started to benefit women. Any attempt to turn it toward a ""gender equality"" thing would be pretty recent,

Uh... no. Feminists have ALWAYS been 'fighting' for 'gender equality'. It's the same reason there are ENTIRE organizations funded by taxpayers to protect their interests. 

&gt;so sure, it looks like they're striving for ""equality,"" but since they think women aren't equal yet, then obviously they focus on women

That's called believing in a paradox and a fallacy. Basing an entire ideology off of fallacies like this is toxic to society.

&gt;No need to get all crazy and CAP locky on me, here, dude...I'm just trying to have a chat. 

Well, I'm sorry for offending. I tend to think using the cap locks is a great method for emphasizing words.

&gt;&gt;For starters, many women are pretty upset about the fact that insurance won't cover birth control, but it will cover Viagra.

Birth control and Viagra are very different things, not male/female variants. Some people have 'moral' issues with birth control. Although, I do agree that insurance should certainly cover birth control but comparing it to Viagra, a drug used to cure an actual medical condition, is idiotic. Also, free birth control is hardly an issue when you put men's problems into perspective.

&gt;This issue should concern men as well, since not having a baby benefits men, also.

Too bad men have absolutely no control over whether a woman takes birth control or not. If we have no say over whether our partner actually takes it or not (and thus, produces the effect we desire), it's not something we need to 'concern' ourselves with.

&gt;Many women are upset about the way females are depicted in society

This is a non-issue. If you want to see the way men are 'depicted in society', look no further than your average commercial depicting 'dumbass' dads.

&gt;for example, there's a huge deal of pressure to be skinny and ""sexy,"" otherwise you're dismissed by men and women alike.

Yes, clearly, there is no 'huge deal of pressure' on men to be muscular and lean. Or courageous/willing to put their life at risk for women. Once again, non-issue.

&gt;Also, many women feel that there is a lack of initiativetoward investigatingrape claims.

Because male-rape is taken sooo seriously. If anything, there is far too much initiative toward investigating rape. These continuous and never-ending false rape accusations are prime example of that.

&gt;Eastern Europe is not the third world.

Most of Eastern Europe are 'second world countries', you're right. What I meant was that it's not a problem in the first world, where feminist/MRA organizations primarily exist. Maybe we should fix the problems in our own nations before trying to tell others what to do?

&gt;I have, actually, out of curiosity. Yep...I still think that feminists shouldn't exist in opposition to MRAs, and MRA's shouldn't exist in opposition to feminists. 

You do know that the 'patriarchy' theory and feminist 'herstory' contorts history to believe that nearly all men were sitting around 'oppressing' women all day, right? That it was men who were controlling the show and 'oppressing women', when they were the primary breadwinners, exclusively doing any and all physical-labor and dying in every single war. If you honestly think this bullshit social-science theory is not anti-male, then you either have really bad reading comprehension skills or know absolutely nothing about world history.

&gt;Yes, where prostitution is legal, sexual slavery is still a massive problem. You see, sex work is considered ""independent contracting."" Prostitutes ""rent"" space in brothels, and if a woman is being forced to rent the space, the brothel is generally indifferent to this fact, because why should they care? 

Legalization would definitely not increase the number of this happen.

&gt;Well, some women feel that if prostitution were legal, this would prompt people to prime children for the trade so that they can open a brothel when the children come of age and sell superior prostitutes. Other women fear that if prostitution were legal, certain degenerates may have babies to sell to Madames so that the Madames can prime the children, and other women fear that kidnapping and forced prostitution would occur so that brothel owners can keep their places staffed and productive.

Thinking that legalization of prostitution will actually increase these things happening is mind-boggling nonsense. None of these points are anywhere near valid for not legalization prostitution. If you don't think so yourself, then why are you arguing this nonsense in the first place?

&gt;I understand that you fail to see their perspective, which I think is unreasonable, but then again, you also refuse to accept that sexual slavery is a problem in Eastern Europe for some reason. 

Way to put words in my mouth. I don't think sex slavery is a huge 'problem' in the first world, just like rape committed against females. It's just, mostly, another way for feminists to implant fear into the hearts of women and attain more votes for feminist legislature. This has been proven during the debunked '1 in 4 women are raped' campaign that still continues in most women's studies programs. Sex slavery (along with any real problems women face) mostly exist in second/third world nations.

&gt;Sure there would. If I wanted to fuck some whore, I'm not going to go to a brothel and interview each one to ask her if she's doing this by choice, not am I going to investigate her story to find out if it's true.

&gt;Sure there would. If I wanted to fuck some whore, I'm not going to go to a brothel and interview each one to ask her if she's doing this by choice, not am I going to investigate her story to find out if it's true.

Well, I may be mistaken here, but I thought that brothels had to have extensive files on their prostitutes (just like employers do of their employee's) and that this would hinder hiring sex slaves since doing so could lead to serious legal consequences.

A few things to note:

1. The UAE LoL scene as a whole is is making/has made the shift to EU West. For those few of you who're still in EU East in NA (if you're in UAE OR Middle East), I urge every single one of you to make the collective switch to EU West to make it the middle east's permanent home. The reasons are:

a. Low server latency
b. English-speaking casual + ranked community
c. Less number of retards in EU West
d. All the top elite EU LoL teams use EU West as their server base

The direct correlation between the mass amount of retards + non-english guys in EU East does NOT make it a viable option for our home base, even if we get &lt;20 ms lower ping there.

2. I don't know how to say this without making it sound like a blatant plug but please do register or at least frequent Gaming420.com to watch out for the latest news. I've established this community site (about 3 years ago) for the entire Asia/Middle East with huge upcoming plans to cover these entire regions with a custom codebase real soon. The gaming scene has grown by leaps and bounds since then and even other rival gaming news sites have benefited from our presence alone.The site's non-profit and I pay quite a lot in hosting fees etc just to help combine and put the Asia/Middle East presence out there. 

The name signifies 'gaming addiction' in a weird sort of sense. Here is a link to teh direct calendar with all upcoming events in the middle east (whatever we can find) listed there. - http://www.gaming420.com/calendar.php

3. Since tournament experience is still a new thing for all us community players/streamers/casters combined, we'll make it better and better with every new event. It's time to make a name for all our fellow pro players here in the Middle East.

4. Tournament VODs are already available at http://www.twitch.tv/gaming420tv/videos . This event's cast was a good gauge to weed out the good casters from the okay ones, I feel. If I have more time to dedicate to learning more about ranked games, I'll continue casting future events. If not, I'm pretty sure there will be other casters who will do an equally good job.

Depending on the version this is either a general decline from Adam (who was the best human ever) or a decline from Moses (since in each generation people are less holy and have forgotten more of the Torah that Moses received on Sinai). In the Jewish context this is used as a major theological justification for why rules can't be changed, even if a rule was made by Rabbis and we know why they made the rule and we know it doesn't apply now.

One sees similar ideas also in Islam.

I suspect that to some extent this sort of thing ends up in religions because of general nostalgia. If each generation thinks that things were so much better when they were kids, there's a general trend. There's also that it massively encourages people to look back at their ancestors and what they did, so religions which that have this sort of thing may be more successful memetically.

A lot of environmentalists are convinced that the environment is worse off now than it ever has been and that we're all sicker and have dirtier cities, etc. even though cities today are far less dirty and have much less soot and the like than things did 150 years ago. Similarly, in much of the US an Europe, rivers and other waterways are much cleaner than they ever were before.

**The Role of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)**

By Ambassador Miriam Sapiro, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative

Thank you for you for taking the time to participate in We the People, and for sharing your opinion about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and the importance of privacy on the Internet.

The Administration has recognized previously the importance of protecting an open and innovative Internet in the context of our response to other petitions regarding the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA). Since ACTA is quite different than SOPA and PIPA, we've decided to provide an ACTA-specific response.

ACTA is an international trade agreement that establishes high standards for intellectual property enforcement. The Agreement provides for: (1) enhanced international cooperation; (2) the promotion of sound enforcement practices; and (3) a legal framework for better enforcement.

As you may know, the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods poses considerable challenges for legitimate trade and economic development. Protecting intellectual property rights helps to further public policies that are designed to protect the public. ACTA will help authorities, for example, protect against the threat posed by potentially unsafe counterfeit goods that can pose a significant risk to public health, such as toothpaste with dangerous amounts of diethylene glycol (a chemical used in brake fluid), auto parts of unknown quality or suspect semiconductors used in life-saving defibrillators.

ACTA specifically recognizes the importance of free expression, due process, and privacy. It is the first -- and only -- international intellectual property rights agreement to provide explicitly that enforcement of intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet ""shall be implemented in a manner that … preserves fundamental principles such as freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy."" No provision in ACTA requires parties to disclose information ""contrary to … laws protecting privacy rights."" This includes the protections already in place in U.S. law.

In addition to the United States, approximately thirty countries have signed the Agreement, including Australia, Canada, Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, Singapore, and a majority of European Union member states, as well as the EU itself.

We believe that ACTA will help protect the intellectual property that is essential to American jobs in innovative and creative industries. At the same time, ACTA recognizes the importance of online privacy, freedom of expression and due process, and calls on signatories to protect these values in the course of complying with the Agreement.

Thank you again for taking the time to write and share your views.",0,1435712139,EatingSteak,1338596159,t1_c4v5z2c,0,Libertarian,True,,,False,t3_uggj5,0,t3_uggj5,

The pre-industrial consumption of cow's milk was exceedingly rare and limited to pastoral family units that had both the excess to tax cows for milk rather than slaughter prior to winter months and a lack of goats, more stable producers of milk. Goat milk was more common but still rare. [Your own source attests to this](https://www.shef.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.57538!/file/Albarella-1997-medieval-innovations-england.pdf). But if you want more sources on the impracticality of cow milk consumption for the majority of Euorpean history see: 

Simoons, ""The Determinants of Dairying and Milk Use in the Old World""; Bryant et a., *The Cultural Feast: An Introduction to Food and Society*

Wiley, *Re-Imagining Milk: Cultural and Biological Perspectives*

The mutation and further selection of genes in European population does not speak to the frequency of the consumption of cow's milk. I've looked through your links and most discuss either the use of milk (as different from the consumption of raw cows milk) or the consumption of non-cow milk. Industrialization and pasteurization together provided the only means for distributing cow's milk to the majority of the western populations. Was it consumed prior? Absolutely. Was it common, and would you, the OP, or I consume it without pasteurization? Only if we owned a rather successful dairying operation and even then, we'd probably consume goats milk in the colder months.

""Socialist oligarchy"" is a contradiction of terms to anyone whose understanding of socialism isn't entirely derived from 80's action films, and ""for all intents and purposes"" means only ""in my own judgment"".  Float that around in /r/socialism and /r/anarchy and see how well it fares.

Further, nationalized industry != socialism.  Chile's wealth is also derived from a single nationalized industry -- surely you wouldn't describe Chile as socialist?  Saudi Arabia?  Mexico?

That Venezuela is socialist simply because Chavez has said so is akin to conceding that North Korea is actually a ""people's democratic republic"".

Have you taken a basic statistics course?
&gt;What does matter is they were not reaching 60 on average.

No, it doesn't. If anything the mode would be the best indicator, because it was skewed because of the high amount of infant death...MOST people lived until their late 50's and 60's, a large portion of children died in their first few months or years. 

&gt;Now, when do you count the deaths of children, the average age of death was 40 in 1900. You cheated by using the US as a data source since throughout it's history it has had a much, much lower mortality rate than any other country in Europe, Asia or Africa due to the low population density, better diet and more advanced technology.

Wrong. In 1850 America was a volatile place and many people were dying,  life expectancy was higher in Britain or France. 

&gt;Meaning that the majority of people did not live long enough to develop cancers. 

If you used statistics it does not matter. If only 10% of people born reached maturity and lived to 60, then the rates of cancer should be the exact same...so that's why infant deaths should be eliminated.

You are also, again, detracting from your main point that people didn't live long a hundred years ago. They lived almost the same (If an average is 60 (in 1850) then quite a few people died in their 70's, not too different from today), but simply lost many children.

**The Role of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)**

By Ambassador Miriam Sapiro, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative

Thank you for you for taking the time to participate in We the People, and for sharing your opinion about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and the importance of privacy on the Internet.

The Administration has recognized previously the importance of protecting an open and innovative Internet in the context of our response to other petitions regarding the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA). Since ACTA is quite different than SOPA and PIPA, we've decided to provide an ACTA-specific response.

ACTA is an international trade agreement that establishes high standards for intellectual property enforcement. The Agreement provides for: (1) enhanced international cooperation; (2) the promotion of sound enforcement practices; and (3) a legal framework for better enforcement.

As you may know, the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods poses considerable challenges for legitimate trade and economic development. Protecting intellectual property rights helps to further public policies that are designed to protect the public. ACTA will help authorities, for example, protect against the threat posed by potentially unsafe counterfeit goods that can pose a significant risk to public health, such as toothpaste with dangerous amounts of diethylene glycol (a chemical used in brake fluid), auto parts of unknown quality or suspect semiconductors used in life-saving defibrillators.

ACTA specifically recognizes the importance of free expression, due process, and privacy. It is the first -- and only -- international intellectual property rights agreement to provide explicitly that enforcement of intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet ""shall be implemented in a manner that … preserves fundamental principles such as freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy."" No provision in ACTA requires parties to disclose information ""contrary to … laws protecting privacy rights."" This includes the protections already in place in U.S. law.

In addition to the United States, approximately thirty countries have signed the Agreement, including Australia, Canada, Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, Singapore, and a majority of European Union member states, as well as the EU itself.

We believe that ACTA will help protect the intellectual property that is essential to American jobs in innovative and creative industries. At the same time, ACTA recognizes the importance of online privacy, freedom of expression and due process, and calls on signatories to protect these values in the course of complying with the Agreement.

Why are people upvoting this rubbish from HappyScrappy?

He makes a huge distinction between Spain and Ireland, but the reality is that the problems were caused by a property bubble in both cases. What he writes about corporate tax is probably taken from a German tabloid. Poor quality commenting on Reddit.

Ireland had the earliest and the longest running property bubble of the the modern era. Spain had one too, but they have hidden and deferred the problem for longer than Irish banks/government could.

Irish banks lent huge amounts to property developers at the end of a long property bubble. They competed to outlend each other. They also gave out mortgages to home buyers at huge multiples relative to their income. This too was a symptom of inflated house prices. To make things worse, many mortgages were pegged at a rate equal to the central bank rate plus a fixed percentage, which was popular but ultimately unsustainable for the banks who had to pay deposit interest or commercial rates unrelated to that rate.

All the Irish banks became effectively insolvent at the same time, and the Irish government bet everything on a guarantee, hoping to weather out the storm. At the same time, the government had a huge budget problem as they had high expenditure which was funded directly and indirectly by the property boom (property transaction taxes and taxes on related goods and services).

2. Yes I almost always do. This has absolutely nothing to do with my religious beliefs (I am a Jewish Atheist, who identifies ethnically and somewhat culturally). Being pro-Israel is a political stance for me, and nothing more. I am very critical of Benyamin Netanyahu, and his government, and when I see fit, I am also critical of Israel. Nonetheless, I support Israel and Zionism. That being said, I do support the eventual implementation of a two-state solution, with a distinctive peace treaty.

3. No opinion.

4. As a religion, no opinion. As a people, I am very sad. That being said, if I do end up falling in love with someone outside the faith/people, I will marry her. Love follows no boundaries.

5. As a whole, yes. I do believe that sometimes people of the west are ruining Israel and the Jewish people's cause. For example, when people like Rick Santorum take these horribly extreme stances for Israel, while being a complete fool (in my opinion) elsewhere, it undermines the credibility of such a movement.

6. Not me personally, I live in a fairly Jewish area in Canada. I do have friends in Europe though, who are discriminated against daily. ""Dumb Jew,"" or ""cancerous Jew"" remarks are everywhere. I was in Quebec City (fairly French) and I saw at least 5 swastikas in the old city alone.

edit: Actually, story for story. Is only fair. Mind you I'm not a historian though, only an idealist, so anyone more well-versed feel free to add.

So every once and a while there's someone who is an anachronistic oddity. They're so far beyond their own time that no one appreciates their genius for decades or centuries. [Hero of Alexandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria) could have jumpstarted the industrial revolution by some 1500 years, [Nicola Tesla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Tesla) knew electromagnetism like the back of his hand but couldn't out-charm a business man (Edison) and died in poverty, the good king Charlie up there wanted peace when everyone else wanted blood on their teeth. 

One of these men was a 16th/early 17th century king in historical Bohemia, the region surrounding Prague in the modern day Czech Republic. His name was Rudolf II, [and this is him in his fancy man hat.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Joseph_Heintz_d._%C3%84._002.jpg)

So King Rudy Twody, this guy. He was a protestant leader of a Catholic country populated by protestants in the middle of a sea of Catholics trying to assert their power in the face of a Europe that had just left the renaissance and was about to enter the age of enlightenment. The protestant empires were rapidly growing in power, Orthodoxy dominated the East, Islam was coming up from Northern Africa, and tensions between the Catholic empires and the protestant ones were atrociously high.

He wasn't just a protestant, he was tolerant. He was an ultra-liberal before the dawn of liberalism, completely okay man's right to choose his faith and not rabidly anti-anyone, including Jews who were not the most popular group back then. He was sexually ambiguous, reported to have multiple gay affairs with close friends, and otherwise just a friendly chap.

He also hated statesmanship. King Rudy Twody was not a leader, he was a scholar. He maintained a massive collection of everything under the sun so large that it had its own dedicated estate, freely allowed academics to view any of it (mind you that Museums didn't take off until a century after his death. He studied the proto-science of alchemy in his spare time, was a patron of occultists and philosophers ([Carolus Clusius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Clusius), whose work launched the Dutch obsession with tulips, and [Johannes Kepler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler), who was one of the greatest astronomers of the era and huge figure in the blossoming scientific revolution, were both paid members of his court and free to study as they wish for the purest pursuit of scientific truths), and was so deeply involved in alchemists' experiments that even today he's known more as a wizard than a statesman. 

Oh, and art. King Rudy Twody has more art on him than any other individual in Europe. He served as a huge patron of artists in a time where the Catholic church (traditionally the big spender in the arts) was unable and unwilling to continue its involvement, and again his collection was completely open to anyone with an academic interest. 

So what Rudolf II was set to do, if allowed down his path, was essentially create a kingdom of alchemists, artists, freethinkers, and philosophers, a Bohemia where anyone could go to be [Bohemian.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism) Even today that's unheard of outside of sporadic grants that barely allow artists and scientists to survive, but Rudolf II's Bohemia would be a Mecca for ideas and the people who spawn them. 

And then he died. Not immediately of course. He sucked at being a leader as I said before and got into some trouble with some Turks in trying to unite greater Europe under a Christian banner along with the other Catholic empires (though *he* was a protestant, he served two Catholic nations in the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia). He ceded power to his brother, [Matthias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), who lacked Rudolf II's visions for Prague but had a fairly similar stance on religion in that he was a protestant who wanted to pacify inter-Christian conflict in Europe. 

However, Matthias was a stupid dick. He weakened Rudolf II by forcing him to give up his claim to then-Hungarian territories, in-effect weakening himself too, and was soon preyed upon by the Catholics via a third brother, [Maximilian III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_III_of_Austria), who represented the crown of an even bigger dick named [Ferdinand II, Asshole and All Around Bad Guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor). Rudolf II tried to suppress angry nobles in Bohemia (rebelling because Matthias was setting nations free like it was happy hour in an AA meeting and they wanted to transcend monarch rule too), something he couldn't do because Matthias was a stupid dick who had robbed him of everything. 

Rudolf II died quietly, Matthias was old as shit and couldn't stave off Catholic pressures on the crown, and the Bohemian dream of a free kingdom died with Matthias in 1619, the same year Ferdinand II (from the same family as Charles I) took power and promptly lost it because protestant Bohemians didn't like Catholic rule and kicked him out on his ass to bring back protestant power by installing [Frederick V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_V,_Elector_Palatine) as their new leader. This pissed off the Catholics who then sent in a bunch of mercenaries to retake Prague, known as the [Battle of White Mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_White_Mountain), quickly doing so and sealing the fate of whatever legacy Rudolf II may have left. Europe became Catholic, freethought became suppressed, and the scientific revolution was pushed back hundreds of years if it came at all leaving us today in a world without any period of enlightenment to speak of.

But that's not true. One of the mercenaries in that battle, on his return from destroying liberalism in its infancy and crushing modern science before it ever took off, had a dream in which an angel visited him and told him to dedicate his life to science and philosophy. That mercenary's name was [Rene Descartes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Descartes), and it's due in large part to him that the rationalists dominated the coming century and Enlightenment replaced dogma and superstition. In a way, Rudolf II's dream was fulfilled. ",0,1429050051,happybadger,1338607887,t1_c4v811n,0,AskHistorians,True,,,False,t1_c4v6tpq,0,t3_ugifj,

**The Role of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)**

*By Ambassador Miriam Sapiro, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative*

Thank you for you for taking the time to participate in We the People, and for sharing your opinion about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and the importance of privacy on the Internet.

The Administration has recognized previously the importance of protecting an open and innovative Internet in the context of [our response to other petitions regarding the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA).](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internet) Since ACTA is quite different than SOPA and PIPA, we've decided to provide an ACTA-specific response.

ACTA is an international trade agreement that establishes high standards for intellectual property enforcement. The Agreement provides for: (1) enhanced international cooperation; (2) the promotion of sound enforcement practices; and (3) a legal framework for better enforcement.

As you may know, the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods poses considerable challenges for legitimate trade and economic development. Protecting intellectual property rights helps to further public policies that are designed to protect the public. ACTA will help authorities, for example, protect against the threat posed by potentially unsafe counterfeit goods that can pose a significant risk to public health, such as toothpaste with dangerous amounts of diethylene glycol (a chemical used in brake fluid), auto parts of unknown quality or suspect semiconductors used in life-saving defibrillators.

ACTA specifically recognizes the importance of free expression, due process, and privacy.

**The Role of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)**

*By Ambassador Miriam Sapiro, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative*

Thank you for you for taking the time to participate in We the People, and for sharing your opinion about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and the importance of privacy on the Internet.

The Administration has recognized previously the importance of protecting an open and innovative Internet in the context of [our response to other petitions regarding the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA).](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internet) Since ACTA is quite different than SOPA and PIPA, we've decided to provide an ACTA-specific response.

ACTA is an international trade agreement that establishes high standards for intellectual property enforcement. The Agreement provides for: (1) enhanced international cooperation; (2) the promotion of sound enforcement practices; and (3) a legal framework for better enforcement.

As you may know, the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods poses considerable challenges for legitimate trade and economic development. Protecting intellectual property rights helps to further public policies that are designed to protect the public. ACTA will help authorities, for example, protect against the threat posed by potentially unsafe counterfeit goods that can pose a significant risk to public health, such as toothpaste with dangerous amounts of diethylene glycol (a chemical used in brake fluid), auto parts of unknown quality or suspect semiconductors used in life-saving defibrillators.

ACTA specifically recognizes the importance of free expression, due process, and privacy. It is the first -- and only -- international intellectual property rights agreement to provide explicitly that enforcement of intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet ""shall be implemented in a manner that … preserves fundamental principles such as freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy."" No provision in ACTA requires parties to disclose information ""contrary to … laws protecting privacy rights."" This includes the protections already in place in U.S. law.

In addition to the United States, approximately thirty countries have signed the Agreement, including Australia, Canada, Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, Singapore, and a majority of European Union member states, as well as the EU itself.

We believe that ACTA will help protect the intellectual property that is essential to American jobs in innovative and creative industries.

I usually don't like it when people say that it's not recommended to learn more than one language at a time, because there are certain studies that claim the opposite, but goodness gracious four at a time is too much even for me!

My advice is this:

* German and French will both take you much less time to learn than either Korean or Japanese. As i'm sure you know, both of those languages are much different than (what i'm assuming is) your native English.
* With that in mind, i recommend that you either ***A***, cut down to only German and French right now, at least until you've developed yourself to an upper-intermediate/advanced level, or
* ***B*** choose either Korean or Japanese, but not both, and neither with the other European languages.

The reason i'm saying this is that either of those two Eastern Asiatic languages should require your full attention to really get a grip on, so i'd recommend focusing on only one of them at a time.

All that being said, and whatever you choose to do, it is necessary that you make your language learning a priority. There are hundreds--even thousands!--of (free!) language learning resources on the web. Besides those, look up publications and videos in the target language. Listen to music in the target language. Immerse yourself in it. In the sidebar, there are subreddits for each of your languages of interest. Go there; learn! Seek out people to be your correspondents/pen pals! Set up some Skype chats with natives that you meet here. :)

Listen, about what i said earlier--about biting off more than you can chew? I understand that you're eager to learn new languages. They interest you! They're exciting! That being said, you need to temper your excitement and channel it into useful and focused energy.

I really do understand wanting to learn four languages at a time; i myself am currently learning three! I've been learning French for five years now, and Portuguese since last year. I just started learning Spanish this week, though i don't intend to stick with it past the basics, as i only am interested in having a working knowledge of it. After i'm done with Spanish, i've got a ton of languages that i'm interested in learning, alongside strengthening my French and Portuguese: Hebrew, Dutch, Italian, Russian, and maybe even Korean! I've got to make sure, though, that i don't try to do all of them at the same time, or i'll be dooming myself to constantly be going over the basics in each of them, without ever progressing.

**Whyte Ave**

* Transcend has the best coffee I have ever had, beating out the coffee I had in Cuba and Europe.

* Remedy Cafe has great chai lattés. I didn't know what those are until I had one there. Tastes like a gingerbread milkshake, but better. It's hard to explain.

* The Sugarbowl has the largest beer selection I have ever seen. If you like to try new beers, go here. If you're indecisive, avoid. 

* Dadeos has awesome sweet potato fries. Their po'boys are good, but if you just need a snack, stop in for a plate of fries. You won't regret it.

* As Daniz64 mentioned, there are a ton of cool and interesting shops. After just 15 minutes, you'll see why West Edmonton Mall is overrated. 

* Check out the Junque Cellar and the Antique Mall if you're into collectibles. You might not find anything, but they're like free museums!

* If you want to see some local bands perform, check out Wunderbar. 

**Downtown**

* Now, for downtown, I'd recommend Bistro Praha if you feel like a good Wiener Schnitzel. 

* If you're looking for a romantic, French restaurant, the Creperie is excellent.

* I have heard many good things about Zinc, Tres Carnales, and Corso 32. I haven't been able to go to these yet, though.

* Check out the local Art Gallery of Alberta if you're interested in that. I love it, and there's a new exhibition opening in 3 weeks.

* I'm not too into clubbing, but I did find Vinyl to be the most enjoyable one I went to.

* I have also heard 124 street off Jasper Ave is becoming more and more of a shopping and entertainment district. I haven't had the chance to explore here yet.

If you can, also check out Fort Edmonton Park. It's a great live history museum. 

You'll also be in Edmonton during the entire Festival Season. Check out the festival calendar [here](http://www.edmonton.com/for-visitors/festival-calendar.aspx). I'd highly recommend going to The Fringe on Whyte. Even if you don't go to the plays, there are many street performers and I find they usually outnumber and outclass the ones at the actual Street Performer's festival.

Also check out /r/EdmontonSocialClub for Reddit meet ups. Even if you'd rather not go to a meet up, you can always go to the same place they went to a week later.

1) Increase starting pay but also increase starting requirements. In European countries most teachers are required to hold a masters before they can apply. In the UK and Australia, teachers are required to be certified in multiple subject areas. Do away with tenure.

2) Require teachers to participate in educational research or on-going professional development to maintain their license.

3) Improve and better implement administrative observations so that they actual measure teachers growth in specific teaching areas.

4) Allow for peer evaluations and demonstration lessons, allowing teachers not just within a school, but within a district to collaborate. 

5) Bonus pay for teachers who pass National Certification

6) School districts should create authentic assessments (possibly similar to IB/PYP program) to monitor student growth. Student growth should be based on the individual child and not some pre-determined variable. As a special education teacher I know that many students have limits and at some point they WILL reach them meaning very little progress will be made beyond that point.

This means that papers are ~twice as ""successful"" for the 300th institution as the 2nd best in the world. This could easily be due to cultural differences of institutions on the quality vs quanity scale (or some other scale related to the desire to publish even less impactful results).

&gt; One of the most notable findings from work on human mate choice is that there are universal standards on what constitutes attractiveness. Extensive research has shown that, in general terms, people of all ages, sexes, sexual orientations and cultures agree on what constitutes an attractive face (overviews in Little, &amp; Perrett, 2002; Langlois et al 2000; Grammer, Fink, Møller &amp; Thornhill, 2003; Cunningham, Roberts, Barbee, Druen, &amp; Wu,1995); someone of, say, Asian ethnicity will judge the relative attractiveness of two faces of European derivation in much the same way as a European judge would, and vice versa. Likewise, there is fairly strong agreement on what constitutes an attractive voice (eg Collins, 2000; Hughes, Harrison, &amp; Gallup, 2002; Zuckerman, &amp; Driver, 1989; Zuckerman, Hodgins, &amp; Miyake,1990) and an attractive body scent (Thornhill, &amp; Gangestad, 1999a; Rikowski, &amp; Grammer, 1999; Gangestad, &amp; Thornhill, 1998; Gangestad, &amp; Thornhill, 1999), although cross-cultural studies are yet to appear.

&gt; Clearly, many aspects of physical attractiveness must be learnt or culturally acquired (for a review, see Zebrowitz, &amp; Rhodes, 2000, cited in Rhodes et al 2001). For example, culture has an important influence on perceptions of ideal size, and members of different societies differ significantly in the body mass index (relating to the amount of body fat) which they choose as most attractive (Anderson, Crawford, Nadean, &amp; Lindberg, 1992). At the level of individual variation, Cornwall et al (2004) summarize findings showing that female preference for heavily masculinized faces is influenced by the status of their relationship (Little, &amp; Perrett, 2002), the age of their parents (Perrett et al 2002) and their self-rated attractiveness (Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, &amp; Perrett, 2002). Married couples also resemble each other in such a way that they are able to be identified as partners (Hinsz, 1989, cited in Little, &amp; Perrett, 2002).

http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~simon/dissertations/saxton.pdf

&gt; A long-held view in the social sciences is that standards of beauty are arbitrary cultural conventions (Berry 2000, Etcoff 1999). Even Darwin favored this view after observing large cultural differences in beautiﬁcation practices (Darwin 1998/1874). However, two observations suggest that some preferences may be part of our biological, rather than our cultural, heritage. First, people in different cultures generally agree on which faces are attractive (Cunningham et al. 1995; Langlois et al. 2000; Perrett et al. 1994, 1998; Rhodes et al. 2001b, 2002; but see Jones &amp; Hill 1993 for weaker agreement).

Since it wasn't the point I was trying to make, I'm not an expert in what Churchill did. It was just an example. And if what I just quoted is true, he wasn't committing genocide. He had to make a choice between feeding Europeans and Indians. It's not that he thought ""well, what shall I do today? I know! I'm going to let the Indians starve to dead!"". As what you said was true, then he was thinking ""For the love of god, what shall I do?! Feed the Europeans and let the Indians die, or feed the Indians and let the Europeans die?"".

And what's defense? What if France decided to start a local genocide and kill every Christian in the country? When we march into war to defend the Christians in France, we are not defending ourself. We are attacking France.

Or even more complicated: the Football War. According to El Salvador, they attacked Honduras to defend the El Salvadorian people that fled to Honduras. So according to El Salvador, they had gone to war to not defend them self, but to defend their people. So what would happen now?

And like I said, it was ""according to El Salvador"". In reality, it doesn't really make sense. So El Salvador attacked Honduras, to defend the people that had fled El Salvador? To sum it up: According the El Salvador, they where defending there people. But according to Honduras, they where defending their ground.

And let's go back to WWII. When the Allies entered Germany, Germany was the side who tried to defend himself against the attacker. There was a turning point in the war.

And go forward to the NATO mission in Libia. Are they truly attack or are they just supporting the people? Who are the attacking force and who is the defending force? The Libian people where trying to overthrow their government, so they where attack. But that doesn't mean that they where wrong and their leaders should be executed. And the NATO deciced the interfere in favor of the people. They are not really attacking, nor are they defending. They are supporting a side.

And I could go on and on about wars that ain't that different. The invasion of Anjouan, where rebels where stopped by the government forces, supported by the African Union and France.The Djiboutian–Eritrean border conflict, where 2 sides claimed they where defending their ground. What about the Sudanese conflicts? The south want their own country and the North agrees to a certain level. But there are clashes being fought about where the borders comes, since most of the oilfields are in the South. What about the Syrian uprising? Yemen uprising? Mexican drug war? Or Gulf war? Alien forces where defending an country by attacking the country that attacked their Allie. What about the war in Congo?

**TLDR:**
War is complicated. There is no universal way to say who are the good and who are the bad. Nor there is a way to say who is attack and who is defending. Every war is different, and that's why I disagree pacifism and people that make statements as ""Than they should be willing to lay down their life to ensure the country they lead."".",0,1429051403,Shizly,1338628118,t1_c4vaq9r,0,worldnews,True,,,False,t1_c4uwocj,0,t3_uemv1,

England is the only country that has brought its violent right-wing hooligan subculture to international football. Until very recently, every tournament feared the arrival of England supporters.

Sugar itself was actually artificially cheap up until 2005 due sugar subsidies in Europe that caused a bunch of cheap sugar to be dumped on the global market at artificially low prices.  HFCS production in its current state makes it cheaper than refined sugar on the global market.  The USDA actually keeps track of this data [here](http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/sugar/data.htm).

Sugar tariffs also exist primarily to protect domestic sugar producers.  I'm not saying this is the best idea, but that's why we have tariffs, not to protect the HFCS industry.  Long story short most of the US has a climate that does not facilitate the growing of sugar cane, but does facilitate the growing of sugar beets.  Sugar beets generally have lower yields of sugar per acre than sugar cane and as such it's more expensive to produce sugar from beets than it is from cane.  So sugar beet growers in Europe and the US benefit from some form of protectionism to keep themselves in business(subsidies or tariffs).

So: generally, our society is a *little bit* unprepared when it comes to different races. One has to keep in mind we are extremely homogeneus when it comes to nations - almost 94% of People in Poland are of Polish heritage and it's always been like that (maybe during the wars it somehow changed). Therefore, in small cities or in the country, one can't miss people's weird behaviour when someone of different skin colour appears - they won't be chasing a black man to get a photo but they certainly WILL look at him in a different manner, simply because he'd be something unusual for them, which they saw only in the movies. This certainly may be unpleasant for the foreigners.

HOWEVER, we have to keep in mind that talking about the Euros, we're talking about Wrocław, Poznań, Warszawa and Gdańsk. Those are all big cities, with famous universities and a lot of foreigners even without sporting events. People there are really accustomed to different races and languages - strolling through Warsaw, you'll hear tens of languages, there's no need to be worried :) The ""normal"" Poles won't have anything against you and will treat you just like any other person. You have to keep in mind, however, that along with the regular citizens, there'll be hundreds of hools going to the game. In all probability, they'll be somewhere in the fanzones rather than at the stadium as they prefer to spend their money on getting heavily drunk than actually watching the game. It's not that Poland is somehow special about it - you can see it in any other European country. Also, some of the unprepared folks I mentioned in the first paragraph will most likely go to some games as well so they may look at different skin colours as if they were on an exhibition. It's nothing to be worried about, though - many of them don't need a foreigner to behave like a savage ;)

Summing up, there may be some incidents during the Euros, especially after the matches where both of the teams have aggresive hooligans willing to kill each other (Poland-Russia etc.). However, they most likely will involve only the rednecks willing to have their face beaten and will be shortly ended as there'll be plenty of police everywhere in the city. One thing to remember is not to wander to some lonely streets during the night and I'm sure you'll be well :) All the main attractions (Old Towns, Markets, Krakowskie Przedmieście and so on) will be heavily patrolled so there's absolutely no need for worrying :)

Doesn't mean the aren't going to acquire both in the near future, and that was the point. They are researching how to build the weapons. The development comes next.


Except that's not correct.  They could continue weapons development, indeed they have the equipment and know how to do so.  Instead they have suspended the direct development aspects.  Now that might be because they don't want to end up in the shit over weapons development, or it might be because of what has been said about their internal position on nuclear weapons, but in either case that is what has happened.

&gt;I swear.. Bury your head in the sand if you want, ignore reality, and continue to think we all live in a utopian dream and the US is evil but Iran and the other Middle Eastern States are just victims who would never ever dare to threaten anyone ever.

I don't live in that utopia, but I also don't subscribe to the evil Iran wants to nuke Israel/the US/Europe line, because it isn't credible.  The Iran is desperately seeking a nuclear weapon line also isn't terribly credible given the evidence (although it would be a reasonable position for Iran to take).  The issue is however being used to directly harm Iran because harming Iran happens to be in the interests of pretty much everyone who isn't Iran (and keeping Iran weak is even pretty handy for Irans tentative supporters in China and Russia..).

&gt;Israel is far from perfect, but it also happens to be the only ally in that area that doesn't want to destroy the west. 

Right, all the states in the middle east are simply out there chomping at the bit to kill the 'west', Israel is the only state holding them all back...  That seems so much more credible.

&gt; If you want to side yourself with Ahmadinejad and his professed commitment to the destruction of Israel, and then want to further that side by allowing them to have nuclear weapons so they can actually commit the act... well, I hope you're willing to admit this publicly so we can take proper action once WW3 begins.

And you label me as a naive dumb shit? Whilst all the time sitting there being a hyperbolic cunt?  Read the above again and tell me how that makes any sense in context of what I said. You could also tell me how Iran developing a nuclear weapon, of 5 would cause WW3, because that's frankly insane too.

I chose the annexation of Corsica because it was a fundamental step to allowing Napoleon to become the Emperor, and Napoleon did play a large role in forming modern Europe. One of the key effects he had in the long run was that his invasions left Germany with a greater sense of nationalism. Napoleon wasn't the sole cause of this, and the unification of Germany would likely have occurred without him at some point. But the way our history has played out, Napoleon was a cause.

Now, you can look at it going the other way. There were conditions set up that allowed France to annex Corsica, and those conditions had their own, and those their own, and so on. Eventually you get up to the Big Bang, and that's what's really had the most effect on history.
