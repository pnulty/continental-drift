Unfortunately, the time-sensitivity of people makes passenger rail less efficient than freight.

Wow, you are seriously out of touch with reality if you believe that the US is attempting to ""take over the world"", and especially if they are attempting to do so through exterminating large groups of people. You know what the US wants more than anything these days? The status quo, and that does not involve the US taking over the world.

Yup, Jews haven't always been popular in the US like much of the rest of the world. Big difference here is that the US has never tried to systematically exterminate them but you know that is but a minor detail.

&gt; Hating gays. Check.

A prejudice that is by no means unique to America and one it is currently grappling with. I don't see how this makes them the same as the Nazis because once again they have never tried to exterminate them. 

&gt; Hating black people. Check.

Another prejudice that the US grapples with to this day. But the US also fought a war over Slavery and then went through the Civil Rights movement. The US isn't perfect, as I have said, but they have made massive improvements over the years.

As I said, the US wants business usual. That doesn't include taking over the world any more than they already have. 

&gt; Genocide and ethnic cleansing. Check.

US treatment of the Native Americans was deplorable but it was never the policy of the US to exterminate them. They did fight war after war with them and at times the US was much too heavy handed in their treatment, but it was never *genocide*.

&gt; Slavery. Check. (Oh wait, Germany never even had that, I think we can stop.)

And a war was fought to end that practice. Oh and btw, Germany used slave labor extensively during WW2 so it is incorrect to say it ""never even had that"". Nor would they have stopped the practice if they had won the war.

&gt;Like the US has changed internally throughout history, Nazi Germany would have changed, too. A state of power and abundance usually leads to more liberal developements, which would have eventaully happened in the Third Reich, too.

,False,t5_2qhrg,"From a procedural perspective, allowing a small interest group to take the legislature (and, briefly, the executive) hostage to meet their demands is anti-democratic.  Certainly far less democratic than a bill passed by a majority vote of duly elected representatives.  Disagreements with regards to legislative procedure should be resolved by the judiciary, or the legislature itself.  That's how it's done in functioning, stable democracies.  This is literally the first time I have heard a stable democracy have its legislature completely stopped by protesters.

From an international law perspective, Taiwan reneging on its trade agreements is bad for its credibility and harms its ability to negotiate agreements in the future.  It is likely also illegal and Taiwan may face some consequences from, for example, the WTO.

Finally, at bottom, entering into a trade agreement with China does not pose any danger to Taiwan's sovereignty.  There are only two ways Taiwan loses its sovereignty: through Chinese military action, or voluntarily.  The former cannot happen as long as the US maintains its promise to defend Taiwan.  In addition, there has never been a situation where increasing economic ties causes an increase in belligerence.  Countries with strong economic ties usually *don't* attack each other.

The only possibility of Taiwan voluntarily joining China is if either a) China becomes a liberal democracy like Taiwan and there is still enough sentiment of a unified China or b) enough Chinese citizens become Taiwanese citizens to overcome the massive support for the status quo.  The trade agreement doesn't affect either of these.

I think, overall, the movement is motivated by an unreasonable fear of China and the recent Crimean annexation (I mean, why now, instead of when the treaty was first negotiated?).  Comparisons to Crimea are inapposite, though, both because the US was in no position to stop Russian troops (which already were stationed in Crimea) and the Crimean populace has largely been in favor of leaving Ukraine and joining Russia, regardless of the dubious vote they held.

,1396313539,t5_2tteh,"&gt; Well, that's kinda cherry picking too. The S2000 was at the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to engine performance. You wont find many vehicles that are that powerful with that small of an engine in most price ranges, let alone in the $30K price range. It may not be the best way to make power, but it's one that appeals to a good number of people.

This is my point exactly.  The S2000 has very little low-end torque, but a lot of high-end power.  This is bad for fuel efficiency, because it doesn't allow for long overdrive gearing to be used.  The S2000 cruises at like 4,000rpm at 60mph, which is rediculous but necessary given the engine's characteristics.

&gt; But it's the same story between the C6 Z06 and the 458, same basic differences, different era.

Not exactly the same.  The 360 and C5 Z06 were neck-and-neck from a performance standpoint.  The 458 out-performs the C6 Z06, and has more power.

For the C6 Z06, the F430 makes a better comparison.  Both have the exact same drag coefficient.  Both have very similar weights.  Both make very similar power.  Both have very similar performance.  But the Z06 has substantially better fuel economy.

360 Modena is to the C5 Z06, as the F430 is to the C6 Z06.  It would be better to take the 458 out of the equation since it has better performance, which can help explain its worse fuel economy.  The F430 doesn't really have better performance than the C6 Z06, so its worse fuel economy can't be explained away as easily.

&gt; But it's also turbocharged. Turbocharging offers a huge advantage in this area, and that's exactly why you wont find many NA engines that compare directly with the Z06. The Europeans decided that it really doesn't pay to toil around with NA engines. Look at the MP4-12C, it outperforms the ZR1, makes quite a bit less torque, yet it gets slightly better mileage.

I would think the ~2,000lbs of additional weight would decrease any added gain that turbocharging has, especially if the engine has an additional 4 cylinders.  Seriously, a literal ton of additional weight is a big deal.  The ZR1 is also supercharged, which is worse for fuel economy an N/A or turbocharging.

I don't expect the C7 Z06 to have better fuel economy than the C6 Z06.  The base C7 has better fuel economy than the base C6, but I don't think that will be the case for the new Z06, because it's supercharged.

&gt; Non-turbo F1 engines idle at around 7,000 rpm.

Yes, that's my point.  They hardly have any power or torque at 1,000rpm.  It's an extreme example, but it works.

&gt; Cherry picking. How many others outperform the 458 and get the same or better fuel mileage?

The 2008 Viper ACR out-performs it, at least at the track, and also gets better fuel economy.

&gt; In the city, where most people spend most of their time driving, it is 3 mpg.

Where I live most people are on the highway.

&gt; But that doesn't prove anything, it's the same for the 458, it out-performs the Z06 and even the ZR1, it should be allowed to have worse fuel mileage.

I agree, it should be able to.  Again, I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  All I'm saying is that it's very impressive for the Z06 to match the S2000's fuel economy, while simultaneously having over double the power.  That is very impressive, even if you don't think it is.

The Z06 should be allowed to have worse fuel efficiency than the S2000, but it doesn't.  Getting more performance for less fuel efficiency is to be expected, and that's normal - it's not a bad thing.  However, getting equal fuel efficiency for more performance is even better than that.  There is literally nothing wrong with getting more performance for equal fuel efficiency.  *This is a good thing.*

&gt; Gearing.

Which is only allowed by low-end torque.  You can't be at 1,500rpm in a ~3,000lb car with only 80ft-lbs of torque.

Animals with longer gestations and ages of maturation are harder to effectively harvest, as they take more effort to maintain prior to sexual maturity and whilst in gestation. The cost of maintaining stock with long gestation periods becomes a money pit eventually. 

I used to breed European cattle in Australia -- specifically Charolais cattle, where the age of maturation is around 1.5-2 years old, depending on the individual heifer. It might not seem like much, but that extra half to a year can cost thousands of dollars in the long run. 

Total expenses for a herd of 10 cows/heifers was about $10000 a year, add the gestation and maturation of their progeny, they quickly became a money pit. We sold them off for early maturing beef cattle and flipped a profit with the first few animals sent to slaughter.

I don't think you are looking at the same things I am looking at then.

&gt; mean you picked 1 modern example, and compared it to 1 ancient example.

No.  I was looking at an average of many modern hunter gatherer examples (the Hiwi, Tsimane, !Kung, Ache , Agta, &amp; Hadza),  and comparing it to the best case scenario of an ancient example.  Your point is invalid.

&gt;The books you gave did not support what you posted at all. 

From what I can tell, you haven't read the books at all.

&gt;The life expectancy...you did read the part about their life expectancy going up because of the hunter gatherers access to modern medicine, right? 

Life expectancy does go up for hunter-gatherers that have access to modern medicine (I am not claiming that not having modern medicine is better than having it).  However, the life expectancy numbers in the 70's is from tribes without access to modern medicine.  What I am saying is that life expectancy in isolated hunter gatherer tribes was better than the 'civilized' world until the 19th century (when medicine finally caught on).

&gt;So what you are focusing on is the day to day personal interactions within a tribe before there was a written language?

Not specifically.  I am looking at a holistic approach.

&gt;Humanity moved into an agricultural society because it had a better chance of continuing their survival than from their previous lifestyle. That is the way evolution (societal) and adaptation works.

You are correct that agriculture was more efficient for survival.  I am not arguing that.  I am arguing that this efficiency came at the cost of  quality of life, morality, and equality.  

Being happy, healthy, or old is not necessary to breed and have your children survive.  Indeed, today we see that the most prosperous, intelligent, and happy societies have the lowest birth rates.

Both of your links do not support your theory.  Your first link is simply a hypothesis based upon monkey's behavior.  Your second says that violence started 10-15k years ago, long after hunter gathering was the norm.  !0k years ago is actually pretty close to the agricultural revolution, so I think this actually supports my idea.

&gt;On average, warfare caused 14 per cent of the total deaths in ancient and more recent hunter-gatherers populations.""

I've had some amateurish questions I've wanted to ask somebody well rehearsed in quantum mechanics to answer, if you don't mind giving them a go. 

1. How can we untangle ourselves from the maths? Since we're electrons, quarks and photons all over, does observation become a feat against nature, much like using modern steel for radioactivity measuring devices? 

2.  Given the above, shouldn't celebrities advocating Atheism over religion have higher degrees of responsibility in their assertions, that there is no such thing as divinity, (when as you and I know) they are merely practicing belief? Isn't there a danger of another zealot like hegemony appearing, similar to what medieval Europe had to deal with? What if no research is put into whether or we can use quantum mechanics to finally reveal whether consciousness is truly a thing, or simply a concept of the mind, simply because the peers of the day all practice belief systems first and foremost? If indeed it is a matter of funding... I mean who is going to fund somebody like Dean Radin or Thomas Campbell for more than the lowest research funding tiers?

There might be some interesting results to things, eg: if this next question isn't answerable yet, then perhaps they could answer it with adequate funding.

I'm just curious, would this mod pass inspection? I see mods like this all the time and wonder how people pass it through inspection. Seems like it's a huge deal if they're making automobile manufacturers spend tons of money just to redesign and manufacture US spec bumpers.

Personally I like like the orange and blue contrast more in the pic. But if people want to mod it to be clear I don't see what the big fuss is about. You don't see European cars constantly wrecking because their cars didn't come equipped with orange sidemarkers.

I'm glad at least most manufacturers are working towards integrating the reflector in better places. I'm really liking how it's tucked away inside the headlight housing for the Mk7 Golf.

And it's arguable that the US could have ""*won*"" a nuclear exchange during the Cuban Missile Crisis. At that time, the US had about 4000 nuclear weapons, with hundreds of ICBMs, and thousands of bombers that could hit the USSR. While the USSR had less than 200 nukes and very few ICBMs. They had no real bomber force that could strike the US mainland, so the only way they could have hit the US was through the missiles placed in Cuba.

The US would have lost a few cities and Western Europe would have been completely devastated from Soviet nukes, but the US would have been able to turn the USSR into a radioactive wasteland.

,1396322264,t5_2ssp3,"Hello there! Japan's respectful treatment of Russian prisoners of war might be characterized as a ""civilized façade,"" since they failed to apply the same standard to the Chinese during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. To be sure, in September 1894 War Minister Ōyama Iwao reminded the Army that Japanese soldiers ""must never forget that however cruel and vindictive the foe may allow himself, he must nevertheless be treated in accordance with the acknowledged rules of civilization..."" Ōyama also emphasized that civilians were to be protected. A few days later, he articulated: ""Our Army fights for the right and in accordance with the principles of civilization. Our enemies are the military forces of the country with which we are at war, not the individuals of the country. Against the force of our foe we must fight with all resolution, but as soon as any of his soldiers surrender, are taken prisoners, or receive wounds, they cease to be enemies, and it becomes our duty to treat them with all kindness."" Japan, it other words, would uphold its obligations as a signatory of the 1864 Geneva Convention. [1]

Yet Ōyama's orders did not stop the massacre of Chinese prisoners of war and civilians at Port Arthur starting on November 21. The wanton violence shocked foreign reporters--the *New York World* claimed wildly that Japanese troops had slaughtered as many 60,000 Chinese in a span of four days--and quickly created a public relations crisis for Japan. On December 16, in an effort to control the damage, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement: ""The Japanese Government desires no concealment of the events at Port Arthur. On the contrary, it is investigating rigidly for the purpose of fixing the exact responsibility and is taking measures essential to the reputation of the empire."" According to their own description of events, Japanese troops, ""exasperated by the wholesale attempts [by Chinese soldiers] to escape disguised as citizens,"" had regrettably ""inflicted vengeance without discrimination."" The Foreign Ministry then criticized ""exaggerations"" by foreign media, insisting that ""the victims, almost without exception, were soldiers wearing the stolen clothes of citizens."" In all likelihood, however, many Japanese had already begun to view the Chinese as racial inferiors.  The government also failed to initiate a formal inquiry in order to avoid implicating senior officers. [2] The Port Arthur Massacre disturbingly paralleled what would happen in Nanjing several decades later.

Japanese forces would ultimately take few prisoners in the course of the conflict. There was a clear double standard; after sinking the British-flagged troop transport *Kowshing* on July 25, 1894, sailors of the Imperial Japanese Navy rescued European crewmen who had abandoned the ship--but not the drowning Chinese. Having learned from their experiences in the First Sino-Japanese War, during the Russo-Japanese War and First World War the government would improve its image among Western powers through the sterling treatment of prisoners of war. But by the time of the Second World War, when Japan's ambitions had shifted and when their propaganda emphasized the superiority of the ""Yamato race,"" not even Westerners deserved sympathy. [3]

Putin will not give up Crimea, this is abundantly clear, and it has been said that he will make the spending on Sochi a pale shadow in comparison if needed. For the long term this has been very costly for Russia in terms of their economy and the operations are likely costing in the billions. Russia may look strong but the increased tensions and land it must hold is a weight that it will have to swim with. 

The US will have damaged relations with Russia for some time, although this will lessen with time as was the case after the 2008 conflict. The US has said that it will not fight for Ukraine and the circumstances where it would change its mind are pretty far outliers. Maybe some European nations will reach out for more US military involvement for their own sake, I doubt any real game changing moves though. The US does actually benefit from the crisis as it weakens Russia's hand and makes Europe eager for US involvement again. Always best for them to keep wanting more and not less of you. 

The EU has been challenged and it remains to be seen what lasting changes this crisis will have on it. The individual nations of Europe have varying degrees of reactions. Finland and Sweden are reexamining their security planning. While others like Spain could not care less. Germany is of course the heavy weight but public polling in Germany is not supportive of doing much of anything. If anything this has, in my opinion, worked to greatly worsen the crisis as it must have factored greatly in Russia's war gaming and calculations. A stable and long lasting peace in Europe requires an involved and serious Germany. 

Those nations that share a border with, or are very close by to Russia will make the most changes due to the crisis. Increased security postures, possibly more defense spending, closer ties with allies, cutting off of Russian media inside their nation, etc. The Baltic states and Poland have reacted the strongest and may even work to assist Ukraine in their defenses, although not enough to really matter. 

Ukraine cannot retake the territory lost without losing everything east of the Dnieper. It does not have the economic power to create a credible deterrent against future Russian aggression any time soon. It should look to asymmetric military deterrents and to become less dependent on Russian gas and cross border trade. One of the benefits on the Russian side is that Nato and the EU will be extremely reluctant to include a new member with serious ongoing problems. This was probably a strong motivating factor in favor of taking Crimea in the first place.

It cuts down deployment times to hours instead of days, avoiding the  Russians from taking on forces piecemeal which is their best method of offense.

&gt; this issue is being partially solved by the introduction of the a400m

Stated this earlier, but its not in service today.

&gt; Most russian tanks are still unupgraded from the soviet era. No match for a modern Leopard II. 

I'm not sure you understand just how severely the EU armies have cut tanks. There are currently about 1,100 Leopard 2's in service within the EU, their are about 800 T-90's(which matches the L2) in service with Russia, again, EU barely has the edge.

&gt; The EU would immediately have airsuperiority as well, making any kind of large scale attack into Europe impossible. 

Again, as demonstrated, the EU has more aircraft but not enough to establish ""air superiority"" as we know it today, combined with Russia very large fielding of AA units, its doubtful they every could.

&gt; . The only thing Russia could do is defend what they have for some time, but when their sam sites are taken out (probably by cruise missile) even that would be though.

EU would not attack Russia, they simply don't have the forces in position to do such a thing, Russia does have forces in position to attack the EU.

You would not use cruise missiles for fear of Russia using theirs against the EU, of which they have an huge advantage in numbers.


&gt;  This is not even taking into account the large number of f-35's already ordered. Airsuperiority would also make any strategic bombers of Russia totally useless. Strategic bombers are only useful these days if you have complete air superiority, like the US in Afghanistan or Iraq.

Again with the mythical unit, the EU does NOT have the F-35 and Russia is also bring the PAK-FA online at the same time, so their is no advantage to be had here, merely status quo, plus, most EU nations aren't using the F-35.

&gt; Strategic bombers are only useful these days if you have complete air superiority, like the US in Afghanistan or Iraq.

That's not how strategic bombers are designed to work, especially the TU-160, do you know anything about military equipment at all? the TU-160 would fly north into the Arctic then curves around and strikes from the Norwegian sea with stand-off cruise missiles.

&gt; *Lt. Gen. Igor Khvorov claimed that Tu-160s managed to penetrate the US sector of the Arctic undetected on 25 April 2006, leading to a USAF investigation according to a Russian source*

.

&gt; This is all even assuming the EU doesn't use its enormous industrial capacity (by far the largest in the world) towards wartime production. Most armies in the EU almost always train together, there is a huge focus on cooperation and coordination, I do not think that would be a big problem.

This isn't WW2 cobbling together tin cans, modern machines are extremely complex, it would take a year to put factory's together to start pumping out units. If the war has gone on that long, Russia would have started using Nukes.


&gt; Most armies in the EU almost always train togheter, there is a huge focus on cooperation and coordination, I do not think that would be a big problem.

Only in the NATO framework, their are no EU military exercises. They are still using different unit designs under different commands with different languages, all massive hindrances which the Russians don't have.

&gt;The ___Emerald Tablet___, also known as the ___Smaragdine Table___, or ___Tabula Smaragdina___, is a compact and cryptic piece of [Hermetica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica) reputed to contain the secret of the [prima materia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_materia) and its [transmutation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysopoeia). It was highly regarded by European [alchemists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy) as the foundation of their art and its [Hermetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism) tradition. Although [Hermes Trismegistus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus) is the author named in the text, the first known appearance of the Emerald Tablet is in a book written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. The text was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century. Numerous translations, interpretations and commentaries followed.

---

&gt;

&gt;The term __café racer__ (/ˈkæff reɪsər/ *kaff racer* or less commonly /ˈkæffi reɪsər/ *kaffi racer*) developed among British [motorcycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle) enthusiasts of the early 1960s, specifically the [Rocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocker_(subculture\)) (or ton-up boy) subculture, [*[better source needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS)*]       The term describes a style of motorcycle for quick rides from one ""transport café""   or coffee bar to another.  Cafe Racers were also common in Italy, France and other European countries. 

&gt;In 1973, [Popular Mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mechanics) said the term *café racer* was originally coined as an insult toward riders pretending to be [road racers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_sport) but instead only parked outside cafés.

&gt;The __European Robin__ (*Erithacus rubecula*), most commonly known in [Anglophone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world) [Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) simply as the __Robin__, is a small [insectivorous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivorous) [passerine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine) [bird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) that was formerly classed as a member of the [thrush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird\)) family (Turdidae), but is now considered to be a [chat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_(bird\)). Around 12.5–14.0 cm (5.0–5.5 in) in length, the male and female are similar in colouration, with an orange breast and face lined with grey, brown upperparts and a whitish belly. It is found across Europe, east to Western Siberia and south to North Africa; it is sedentary in most of its range except the far north.

Many gypsy communities are indeed large groups of people who defiantly disregard local law and maintain a 'culture' quite literally revolving around thieving and scamming. With the EU open border policy they are quite adept at moving from country to country as necessary and generally only commit the types of crimes and scams that will have you be jailed for a day or two at worst. If the heat gets too much in one city they just take their savings and move on to the next.

Their children are taught from a young age that stealing is the way to make a living and the cycle continues. 

It's more so a psuedo-religion that *some gypsies*  adopt and for obvious reasons they are the most visible gypsies. I think when most people say a negative thing about GYPSIES they are generally referring to these specific communities. 

I understand people getting upset about the racism, but at the same time the apologist position is part of the reason these thieving communities are able to operate so effectively imo.

,False,t5_2qm21,"&gt;It's very telling that you cannot possibly conceive of a world where it was NATO (the stronger side) forcing Russia (the weaker side) into a disadvantageous position. You should try to look at things from more than one angle.

Because I don't think there's any chance of that.   NATO is a strictly defensive alliance, and in fact many of it's most important members (Germany, for example) have been trying quite hard to have good relations with Russia for many years now, at least until this incident.

&gt;If they can get a working ballistic missile defense shield up in Eastern Europe, as they've been trying to do for years

The missile shield was never aimed at Russia.   It wouldn't make any sense to put a missile shield there if you were trying to stop Russia from launching missles at the US; take a look at a globe, any Russian missles aimed at the US would go right over the north pole.   Plus half a dozen anti-missile rockets wouldn't do squat against thousands of Russian ICBM's.  On the other hand, Poland and Turkey are directly on the flight path between Iran and the US, right at the point where the missile would be treatable (before it goes suborbital), and half a dozen anti-missile rockets might have a shot at taking down one or two Iranian missiles.  And just the fact that it's possible might help deter Iran from even trying to go on a research program.

And, you know, Obama gave up the missile shield in Poland fairly early in his presidency, as part of an attempt to reach out diplomatically to Russia.

Honestly, I think the big reason Russia protested so hard wasn't the American missile shield, which was never a threat to them, they just wanted to limit American military bases in Poland.

The tiles were manufactured by Dziewulski i Lange. The Star of David was apparently the company's trademark. See [here](http://i.imgur.com/YVBWd1C.jpg), [here](http://i.imgur.com/IRgaYoF.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/2uHWT3v.jpg). ~~(Presumably it was a Jewish company.)~~ [see edit]

&gt;The OPOCZNO Ceramic Plant goes back to 1883 when Jan Dziewulski with his brothers Józef and Władysław Lange established the first factory in Staromiejska Street in Opoczno. Firstly, they manufactured red bricks and other ceramic products and later they started producing stoneware floor tiles.

___


Edit: Evidently the tiles have nothing to do with Jews. From my (rough) translation of the last sentence in [this article](http://www.opoczno-top.pl/artykul,Towarzystwo_Akcyjne_Dziewulski_i_Lange,1781.html):

**[Lewis &amp; Clark: The Expedition](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140620/lewis-clark)** - In with only a few hours remaining is Lewis and Clark.  I just got this today and sat down with my wife to give it a try.  After one play I can say that the first turns of the first play are hilariously slow. We both had a hard time starting off, but once we got in to the swing of things we started moving along the board pretty quickly.  I like the couple of different ways that you can interact with the cards your opponents have out on the board, and the ability to wipe the entire row of available cards seems like it could be devastating if you knew what your opponents were waiting to purchase.  I was a little apprehensive when I saw some posts on BGG about the poor quality of the 2nd edition, but everything I received was in good shape. The art in this game is fantastic and I'm really looking to get it out again just to look at it on the table.

**[Trans Europa](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16267/trans-europa)** - This is essentially the same game as TransAmerica except in Europe.  It's a great quick little game, and probably the most basic ""train game"" that you can get.  Each turn you lay tracks, first person to connect all their cities ends the round and doesn't lose points.  First person to zero points ends the game.

**[Timeline: Diversity](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131325/timeline-diversity)** - I'm pretty sure there are a bunch of these games in the ""Timeline"" series.  This was a great filler game that would be excellent for kids.  Everyone has a hand of cards with a moment in time on it ""The Advent of Hip Hop Music"" or ""First Glass Bottle"".  On the back of the card is the year that this occurred.  Each player takes a turn playing a card where they think each event happened in relation to the other cards already on the board.  This starts easy but quickly gets difficult as the timeline fills with other cards.  First player to empty their hand wins.

**[Star Trek: Expeditions](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/79131/star-trek-expeditions)** - This wasn't really for me.  A cooperative game with components and a theme that don't really get me excited.  It does have a neat storytelling element in that certain events will trigger others as you complete missions, but I wasn't in to the game enough to follow along.

**[Jamaica](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28023/jamaica)** - This is a neat racing game with absolutely gorgeous components.  Unfortunately we played this with 6 players which was way too many.  At that point too much of the game is out of your control and you can spend some turns moving so far backwards you should have just skipped a few turns.  I'd play this again with 4 or less any time though.

**[Amerigo](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137408/amerigo)** - I like a lot of Stefan Feld games, but too many things went wrong in this game for me to really enjoy it.  First the cube tower was boring in our play through.  It very rarely held any cubes, meaning every time you added some,  you pretty much knew exactly what was going to come out. Second, I didn't focus enough on moving my ships around, meaning I got cut off from a lot of the islands. If this happens you will lose almost guaranteed, and that's what happened to me.  There was nothing I could do after it happened.  One other minor complaint is the score track.  This is a Feld game, meaning you are going to score points like crazy. So why is the score track a 50 point loop? It's really difficult to visualize where you are compared to other players when the player 50 points ahead of you is right next to you.  I'll definitely try this again if I get a chance, but right now this is my least favorite Feld.

**[Vegas Showdown](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15364/vegas-showdown)** - I received this in a math trade and have been pretty happy with how this has been received.  Each round you bid on available rooms that you get to add to your casino. My favorite part of the game right now is the spatial element of building your casino and your hotel and trying to maximize the points you can get in doing so.  I'm a little disappointed by the lack of competition in the actual auction portion of the game. There are almost too many options available.  After my second play I feel like the real competition might come from better recognizing what other players are trying to get and denying them those tiles as opposed to just taking the cheapest option because it's there.

Funny, I am actually from Baltimore too...Golden West is awesome I frequent it. As well as other hipster establishments I suppose.

It's just an all-encompassing alternative to what people perceive as ""mainstream"" culture. Ie wearing cargo pants and liking your Jeep. Although aquaponics? Sounds pretty ""hipster""... ;)

One thing about America that has always stood out compared to areas like Europe or other older-world countries is the vast amount of subculture/counterculture there is here. There have always been ""hipsters"". It used to mean people that were into nightlife and black culture back in the 40s. It keeps changing over time and has different labels. But thanks to mass media, especially the internet, it is all getting blurry and combined and easy to identify with a glance. It also is just coinciding with overall fashion trends which amplifies everything. And on top of it, the American drive to be individualistic and unique really plays into the whole thing as well. I think this whole ""hipsterization"" is the concentration of various subcultures rolled into one identity.

,1396562848,t5_2ssp3,"Edit: Don't believe any of this, but France was a leader of military fashion, so that much is true.

There is some debate as to WHY certain nations did this. There are two thoughts concerning this: one of emulation of fashion and the other being emulation of competence. 

Of the former camp, is Desiree Beauharnais who wrote *La Victoire à Travers la Mode: Comment la Mode Française a Gagné des Batailles.* In this magnum opus, Beauharnais writes:

&gt;As a result of Napoleon's victories in the Napoleonic Wars, France became a leader of military fashion. Before the Napoleonic Wars, military fashion was very basic and bland. The French and Austrian army wore white coats into battle due to cheapness while the Prussians wore dark blue versions of the same style. Military style didn't differ until the French Revolution when the Revolutionaries used blue coats that were cut very differently than the white Royal army.

&gt;From this, fashion conquered Europe. Rather than fighting in restricting and embarrassing uniforms, the French were happy to fight in dashing and often sexually attractive uniforms. This is no better seen than in Marshal Joachim Murat, also known as the Dandy King. Spending millions of French francs on personal uniforms, he was best known for having outlandish and extravagant uniforms; famously having a large white plume reminiscent of Alexander the Great.

&gt;After the Revolution, many countries were eager to replicate French elan by copying the French cut of uniform. It is best seen in the uniform of Simon Bolivar, revolutionary that set South America aflame. Eager to unify and fight the Spanish authorities. This replication of French cut continues into the 19th century until the upset of Vauban when the Prussians defeated the higher quality French forces. After this, Prussia was the country to copy.

However, there is dispute by a much older source. Written in the 1890s, Sir. John Walton wrote *Copying the Civilized: How the Savage Tries to be Civilized

&gt;Since the success of the Ogre, the world has tried to emulate him. The South Americans tried to copy him in hope of creating a unifying South America. However they remain divided due to their inability to join the civilized world in government. 

&gt;However the Turk and the Jap have taken a look at the French monster and thought that they could replicate his skill if they too looked like him. This narrow minded and simplistic view of the world simply shows that they are not fully aware as to how to win a war.

&gt;Unlike the straight forward and clear headed Britishman, the Chinaman and the like do not have a long history of military infighting as the civilized European nor have the light of Christianity to show them the light of gentlemanly actions in war. So they look at those whom were successful and try to emulate them rather than gain the necessary skills.

The latter monograph is highly racist but tires to make a point that is present within European thought, that the non-Europeans are trying to win like a the Europeans. However it's very close minded and racist so it must be taken a grain of salt.

Hm. As I suspected from the content of your previous posts, it's pretty obvious you are not at all familiar with what the actual research you are dismissing consists of. It's practically impossible to find any academic analysis of racial or gender inequality without it being linked to economics. The idea that academics never take the ""corporate class"" to task is objectively false.

&gt;I don't know you, how would I know that?

Then why did you assume that I think that poor and rich white people have the same ""prestige""?

&gt;Yeah, and if they want to keep their jobs, they can't rock the boat too much.

Their job is to study society. As long as there are humans, there is society, and there will be jobs for sociologists. It's actually in the interest of elites to have accurate data, whether it undermines their own social position or not (no one ever remained in power for long by ignoring reality). They just aren't going out of their way to support this type of education on a mass level.

&gt;The US was founded by Europeans. Only 14% of the US is black, like 15% is Latino, and less than that for Asians I believe. Give it time and there'll be higher diversity representation.

So you are going to sit there and claim that the vast amounts of economic and political inequality that statistically exists along lines of race and gender, is a simple matter of demographics? You don't think that centuries of explicit and implicit legal exclusion and cultural traditions of racial and gendered hierarchy have anything to do with that? You are going to claim that the little diversity that does exist was simply a natural progression, and had nothing to do with the mass movements and struggles that were widely and violently resisted by both rich *and* poor white men? Wow.

&gt;Also, don't forget that white Europeans didn't do all the bad shit and blaming white people nowadays for shit done by their ancestors is kind of ridiculous. That still overlooks the ruling class who make all the decisions. The average person didn't do shit.

You are right that the common person should not have to take responsibility for the actions of the ruling classes, but you are treating the ruling classes as if they are completely isolated and protected from any sort of public pressure. If history has shown us anything, it is that despite how much rulers want to appear as invincible and eternal and above any resistance, more often than not their positions of power rest on precarious circumstances that can easily be turned against them. Often times rulers know that it is in their best interest to compromise with the demands of their subjects to keep them loyal to the social order that benefits the ruler.

Fact is, there are some DDoS attacks on EU infrastructure. That's what we know. What we also know is that there are Cox ISP issues which are preventing some players from connecting and causing frequent drops in the US. (I linked the blue post on the official forums).

If US was affected by EU DDoS issues, even if it were collateral - then Blizzard would say. They wouldn't start second guessing and making up stories about Cox ISP issues. They have nothing to gain by hiding or lying to the players.

I think people here need to stop overlooking the facts, and start looking at what is really happening. 

US Servers are fine. Yes there were some day 1 issues which have been resolved, but the majority of players are playing fine on the US servers... only a handful of people are being affected by disconnections. - This has been rooted down to ISP issues as per the blue post.

Now in the EU, for the last 2 days, EVERYONE has been suffering from disconnections and lag. We can login most of the time, but every now and then, the ping will jump to over 1k, and some people will even get thrown out of the game.

So as you can see, there is a big difference as to what is happening between US and EU. EU infrastructure based out of Frankfurt has always had capacity issues anyway (I don't know where Diablo servers are hosted, I'm assuming either Germany or Amsterdam) hence why a few companies are migrating to a more stable network solution.

I digress. TL;DR - Everyone is EU is affected by issues, only a handful of people in the US. Blizzard have already said that it looks like a simple ISP issue in the US.

,1396349499,t5_2qhpm,"Thanks for the sane and reasonable response. I admit that I was prepared for far more hostility than that :P

I completely agree that it can be difficult for consumers who are interested in animal welfare to distinguish between unethical and ethical (or more ethical, from your perspective, I suppose) farms, especially in your part of the world where I think regulations are far less rigid. In the interest of simplicity I'll write as if you're the omnivore who is interested in more humane produce. 

The first thing that you absolutely have to understand is that if you want to be certain that the animal you are buying was treated well, you will have to pay more. The more certain you are, the more expensive it gets. I personally don't think this is a bad thing; a £1.50 McDonald's is too little money to spend on anything's life. Quite aside from that, less meat in your diet is pretty much guaranteed to be healthier for most people. As well as being more humane, the meat you buy will be better quality; it'll taste better and it'll be less fatty. Also you are more likely to know what part of the animal you're buying - a high quality beef burger is not going to contain horse or some cow's butthole, while a Tesco Value bag of mincemeat might. 

The best option for ethical sourcing is a local farmers' market. In the UK and mainland Europe most cities, towns and some villages have them. I assume it's similar in Canada and the US. Not all of the farmers here will be organic but most of them will be at least free range - a farmers' market isn't at all viable for anyone on a much larger scale than a smallholding, and anything other than free range is impractical on that kind of scale. Even without asking, you can be pretty confident that most of the meat here is well-treated - when you know each individual animal personally it's hard to intentionally make them suffer. Because the farmer (or their son or whatever) is actually standing behind the stall you are also free to quiz them on the way they read their livestock. Since one of the primary targets of anyone selling at a market is ethical consumers pretty much all of them will be happy to talk to you about it. If you read up on regulations for organic/free range farmers in the UK then you'll know what kind of questions to ask. 

The second option is the local butcher. Again, I don't really know if these are still a thing in the US and Canada but I imagine they are. Since they're small businesses they probably source from smaller, local farms which you can more easily find out about. They also can't really afford to stock lower-quality meat due to size so as mentioned above the animals it came from are likely to have been treated better by default. You can also directly ask the butcher where his meat comes from and how it is treated - a lot of them slaughter the animals themselves so they can tell you about that, and a lot of them also have fairly close ties with the farmers so they probably know how the farms are run. Finally you can also look for regulatory certificates which I'll explain in a sec. 

Your last and probably cheapest option is the meat aisle at your supermarket. Pretty much all you have to go on here is regulation. In the UK DEFRA hands out regulation contracts to independent companies. For example, the BAA, the Organic Food Federation, the Soil Association. There are quite a few. The Organic and Free Range terms are protected by law so each regulatory body has an absolute minimum for standards they have to look for before providing a certificate. However each body has variations in their own rules for things like housing, breeding, feeding etc. All of their regulations are publicly available on the internet so you can find the body that you feel aligns most closely with your morals. Anyway food that is called organic will bear the icon of at least one of the regulators which indicates that the farm it is from undergoes regular inspections to ensure that it complies with the standards set by that regulator. 

That's how it works in the UK. A quick Google search tells me that Canada has a similar-ish system involving the IOAS and CAEQ which I imagine are similar to our regulators. I haven't done much research though so you'll want to look into that yourself. 

Anyway I hope that helps. Sorry if it's a bit incoherent in places. It's like 4:45am over here. ",True,cgh2mk7,Kainotomiu,omnivore,,t1_cgh0zrd,False,1,t3_21uar1,0,,1433157673,t1_cgh2mk7,1,4,1396324060,4,vegan

This is done through our very expensive carrier fleet and our very large air transport fleet. . .which also costs money.

Honda makes the [CB1100](http://powersports.honda.com/2013/cb1100.aspx) which has a 1142cc DOHC inline-4 engine in a naked retro standard setup.

Triumph of course makes a whole lineup of retros: [Bonneville](http://www.triumphmotorcycles.com/bikes/bike-categories/classics#Bonneville-2014), [Thruxton](http://www.triumphmotorcycles.com/bikes/bike-categories/classics#Thruxton-2014), [Scrambler](http://www.triumphmotorcycles.com/bikes/bike-categories/classics#Scrambler-2014). All feature the same 865cc DOHC parallel twin engine in different states of tune. All again are heavier than the Guzzi, but that's no matter once you're moving as they all have more power as well.

Its almost certainly going to be 5 east/ 5 west, and how they pick the last one could go 2 ways.

They could do 5/5 + TI3 champion, which invites Alliance, or do 5/5 + an International team, counting C9 as that team.  I think that's a bit less likely considering C9 is no longer sponsored by a Chinese Organization.  Also, it doesn't really matter, as either way would still be 6 invites for the west.

So let's assume its 5/5 not counting Alliance as a part of the west.

1. Alliance as returning champion

Western Invites:

2. Fnatic

**Project Borobudur**

Indonesia had long been under the yoke of imperial powers; the Netherlands colonized it for 300 years. The Dutch were a foreign, European power from basically another planet, so their rule was not well-received in Indonesia. From an Indonesian's point of view, all you see is Europeans working you half to death for a meager wage.

This, naturally, led to a whole lot of discontentment for many Indonesians towards Europeans and the world in general. Thus, in the early 20th century, pan-Indonesian independence activists started gaining power, with figures such as Mohammad Hatta and Soekarno. 

Now, every Indonesian (and many disappointed Dutchmen) knows that these ""founding fathers"" of Indonesia were ultimately successful in their goal of Indonesian independence. However, that's not what we're here to talk about; we are here to talk about the **secret** history of Indonesia. 

And what about that Indonesian espionage? Look at the Indonesian flag. Red and white. Now look at Poland's flag. White and red. Look at Monaco's flag. Red and white, with a little difference in dimensions. Yes, my friends; Indonesia has secretly infiltrated the highest offices of these nations in a process known only to top Indonesian officials... until now. 

Back to the independence activists. With World War II brewing, the world was too busy to notice the advancements in vexillology that Indonesia has done. The project, known as Project Borobudur, was on the scale of the Manhattan Project. Its purpose was to gain a foothold in Europe through flag infiltration and make all Europeans dependent on Poland- a cover for Indonesia, of course- and striking at the right time. Prominent scholars studied dozens of valuable flags throughout the world. There were many Indonesian Indiana Joneses searching for flags in the war-torn battlefields of Europe and the guarded fortresses of American banks. Only recently has the Indonesian government released these documents bringing to light these unknown scholars and explorers.  

Finally, it was time to strike. In late 1944, the Nazi war machine started to waver. The Red Army was pushing towards the heart of Germany, and the Western Allies made landings in France. Poland and Monaco were about to be liberated by the Allies. Secret Indonesian agents (physically modified into doppelgangers Polish and Monagesque leaders thanks to Project Borobudur) infiltrated Poland and Monaco's resistance movements and neutralized the actual leaders of the resistance movements. 

There were, however, some things that did not go as planned. The Warsaw Uprising was not fighting the Nazis, it was fighting the Indonesians. However, Project Borobudur was ultimately successfully executed. Indonesians greeted the Soviets in Warsaw and the Americans in Monaco. The flag of Indonesia rose over the cities. 

Now, they wait. Sometimes, the waiting is the hardest. Agents still need training, and Soekarno was actually taken out of power because of Project Borobudur. He wanted to declassify the operation and the identities of thousands of agents in Poland (classified as ""Coor-Va"" agents, because of their secret training base at Coor, Virginia). So, Soeharto had to neutralize Soekarno and make him forget about Project Borobudur.

Monaco is just a reserve vacation spot, only a place for agents to rest and recover for further operations. Poland, however... An army of Indonesian plumbers, blind to all but *Merah Putih* (The Red and White) surge over the whole of Europe, making a living in the UK and France... and the Netherlands. This is why Poland or Monaco has never badmouthed Indonesia; how dare you desecrate the motherland!

I must warn all Europeans of this, as your plumbing is highly vulnerable. This is also why parties like the BNP or the Front National are advocating against immigration; worldly and cosmopolitan cuisine would destroy Western Europe if Borobudur rises.

Stay safe, and buy compost toilets. 

**TL;DR**: Your plumber loves kebab.

In the event that you are working in a school in France, keep in mind you are going to have plenty of school breaks. And it will be so super easy to spend a long weekend in Turkey or spend Easter in Italy. It will be so much more affordable to do when you can jump on a train or plane and be in another country in a few hours.

Would you be allowed to tutor or babysit or whathaveyou in addition to working or do any other additional work?

Also, just because you don't want to live in Europe, doesn't mean that you wouldn't find someone who wouldn't mind living in the US. Also, you don't have a guarantee that you would find some one you'd want to marry in the next two years, either. It's okay for your plans to change and maybe spending five years in Europe isn't that bad of an idea.

You will have decades to work. Missing out on two years of potential savings is really not that big deal in the scheme of things. You don't know what the housing market is going to look like once you have a downpayment, you don't know if it wouldn't make more sense in terms of location to rent for a while.

Not to mention, think of the experience and knowledge that you can bring into your own future classrooms! There is definitely something to be said for living in another country and culture for a significant period of time. Seeing and experiencing new things is almost never a bad thing.

,False,t5_2y5ib,"&gt;You're assuming
China's bubble is on a scale large enough to derail the entire economy. I have yet to see an analysis of China's ""bubble"" that indicated it is anywhere near that scale. I am yet to see an analysis of China's bubble that amounts to little more than anecdotes about lots of construction and numbers which make you wonder how anybody could be worried about China's bubble when Western numbers are so much worse.
China would be unable to handle a bubble popping. Track record shows that their economic management is at least as good as the west. They have more policy tools to do so. Arguably more incentive to solve economic problems. And they have the lessons of the west (and Japan) to draw upon. They have a track record of learning from and applying those lessons intelligently.

If you haven't seen an analysis of China's bubble and how it's tied to the economy, you're not looking hard enough. Quite simply, there are about 300 million peasants left. Some, but not all, will move into the cities. Right now, China is building huge stretches of city for them to live in, basically from the ground up. The problem is that eventually you run out of peasants. You also have the problem that a ton of Chinese use real estate as an investment. [Nearly 15% of Chinese citizens own two or more housing units.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/10/28/in-china-theres-not-one-city-sans-terrifying-stretches-of-empty-houses/) So when the peasants stop moving in, and peoples homes are worth less, and peoples investments are also in danger...  So lets say you run out of peasants, and you just built 20 new cities. That hoses everybody who invested in those cities, and everyone who owns a house, which is 90% of all Chinese. 

Sure China can deal with it, but it's still going to slow growth. 8% growth is just not sustainable long term. Living standards rise, labor costs more.. The housing bubble will simply be the point at where it is obvious that China is moving towards 3-5% growth, rather than 8-11%. 

&gt;A closer look at economic growth in the west since the 2001 recession might make you think differently. The west is going through its own ""lost decade"" at the moment.

The West is fully developed though. Living standards might take a bit of a dip when there's low growth, but the West is still rich enough to provide that high standard of living. China isn't there yet, and won't be for a while. GDP per capita is between a fifth and a third of the U.S.'s. So when living standards dip in the U.S., you might have to sacrifice that new car, or that vacation. When living standards dip in China, where you still have millions of poor, both in the country and newly relocated to the coasts, the sacrifices tend to be a bit more severe. Growth will continue because of those poor people of course, but in the meantime growth will be stalled and there will be at least some social unrest. 

&gt;China's arable land is of very high quality. The soils are extremely rich, the water supplies substantial and the climate is very good. 

Yes it is, and it's also some of the most efficiently farmed in the world. But there's still the law of diminishing returns. You can only get so much food out of so much land, and China's inability to feed itself some years is an indication that it's close to max capacity. Standards of living are increasing demand, just as the Gobi is swallowing farmland and pollution is starting to hurt the rice growing river valley's. 

&gt;But it was a superpower. Control of Eurasia allowed that demonstrating my point that if China can do the same it can be a superpower too.

It was also clearly weaker overall than the U.S., which was the primary naval power. The Soviet Union directly controlled huge areas of Central Asia, and it still didn't control the energy supply. I don't see how China, which does not have direct political control, and which has three powerful rivals in the region, is supposed to do so. You seem to believe that China, despite the distance and despite limited influence, and despite instability in Cent Asia, and despite the fact that Russia and India both have interests and power in central asia, it will be able to completely dominate enough to replace tankers. I suppose it's possible, but it's also relying on everyone else acting like idiots. China also has yet to really embrace such a strategy, probably because they know the vulnerability of a pipeline to assymetric attack. They're building carriers and bases to the ME for a reason. 

&gt;That's simply incorrect. Taking a European centric point of view, superpower status has waxed and waned between land based continental nations and naval nations continuously.

Not really, Spain's strength was based on trade with the Americas. Dutch strength was based on trade with the East. Britain's strength was based trade with everybody. The last true land hegemony of Europe was probably France in the 15th century, but they predate Spain so my point still stands. There were ""great powers"" who were land based, but they never attained anything like a hegemony. 

&gt;That statement is incorrect. Rail is faster than ships. Sea is cheaper, especially for heavy bulk goods but for value added the speed advantage often makes more expensive but faster transport more economic.

So it's more efficient, if not faster. That results in the same effect. It's just always easier to trade over water than overland. That's one of the reasons river systems are so important. Let's say that there is a ton of oil somewhere, that's pretty easy to extract. The only problem is that it's in the middle of nowhere, and you need to build a railroad to get to it. Now lets say that there's oil in another location. This is harder to extract, but it's close to the sea, you can build a minimum of infastructure, and you can ship it anywhere in the world. The second always gets built up first. 

The Heartland theory also does this weird thing where it ignores resources everywhere else. For example, Venezuela has the largest remaining reserves of crude in the world, for a single country. And it's not exactly in Eurasia. ",True,cgh3jlm,darthpizza,,,t1_cgh1jni,False,0,t3_21sawd,0,,1433158105,t1_cgh3jlm,0,7,1396326384,7,CredibleDefense

,False,t5_2qkaf,"Latency increases due to routing over diverse paths which typically are longer paths.  There are fewer physical paths around the globe than you would imagine... for example, much of Europe to India happens via the Suez canal.  This is improving over time with terrestrial alternatives, but those are tricky in risky due to politics in emerging markets.  

Latency is a function of the speed of light through the medium, in this case fiber optic glass.  The longer the distance, the higher the latency.  You also can have congestion induced latency where there are too many packets to fit across the circuit, and the router buffers them.  That buffering means added delay.  

When it can't buffer any longer, it starts to drop packets, leading to packetloss.  For most traffic, these drops are somewhat inconsequential so long as it's a few percent of the total traffic... but it can be a huge impairment to voice and video.  As you could imagine, if your e-mail server had to retry and send part of an e-mail that was lost, and it took an additional 1/5th of a second to resend, you'd never notice.  Your computer can reorder the packets in the proper order before it assembles it for viewing.  But with video, it's relatively realtime, so if it's late, it's often useless... so it won't even be resent if it's reported missing.  Enough of these means you'll have bad quality.

Now some cable systems offer protected services, where the service provider will actually send the traffic down two paths simultaneously.  If the active path fails, it will switch over to the backup path typically within 1/200th of a second.  But protection is expensive, and many service providers prefer to buy single paths, but across multiple systems, so they can re-route around failures on their own.  In the system of protection, if you purchased a 10 gbps service, since it's replicating traffic, you'd get 10 gbps across the primary and backup... but you won't have 20 gbps of throughput.  If you offer your own resiliency with multiple active paths, you could actively use both of those paths, and effectively use 20 gbps.  Of course if one goes down, shoving 20 gbps down a 10 gbps path will result in much pain.  And that's where economics comes into play.  How far do you push it?  Each service provider (and enterprise for that matter) makes these decisions for themselves.... assessing the risks and rewards.",True,cgh42nt,KantLockeMeIn,ex-Cisco Geek,,t3_21w8zy,False,0,t3_21w8zy,0,,1433158355,t1_cgh42nt,0,25,1396327812,25,networking

,1396328438,t5_2qyt6,"I think the theory of a purposeful universe is ignored not because it isn't useful or well-stated, but by the sheer force of institutional habit. There is the opposite of encouragement to look for evidence of purposeful creation. If you try it as a scientist-in-training, as I did, then you're beaten down with bad grades, and chastised by your mentors. If you continue, your career won't. Nobody is doing scientific grants for searching for evidence of God. That is considered to be the providence of religion, not science. 

It's dualism, in the metaphysical sense, and it goes back to the age of religious dominance in Europe. When science had to define itself as not treading on the toes of religion, it created ""off-limits"" areas that are now hindering the ability of scientists to research in fields that have shown great promise for 40 or 50 years. 

Why has there been precisely one peer-reviewed study involving LSD in 40 years? Have you ever injested the stuff? It screams that there is something larger than the individual, accidental self going on. Yet science has chosen, as a field, to delegitimize psychoactive substances. This is to the grave detriment of scientific inquiry, which is my point in writing here in the first place. These scientists, overwhelmed by the evidence of a universe that is precisely, exactly what must exist for life to exist, are retreating to a position of ""it all has no meaning and is accidental"" *because to do otherwise is to be treated as unserious and unscientific by their peers and institutions.* Faced with a universe that appears to be exactly what it must be, they can either throw away 500 years of ideology or they can double down on the belief that there is nothing but coincidental accidents.

I am pointing to the elephant in the room, which is consciousness, and the role it plays in the universe. I don't believe the scientists are capable, within their crippling reductive worldviews, of progressing toward understanding in this area. They are refusing, have been refusing for 50 years, to use the tools of antiquity, which are psychoactive substances. The ancient Greek scientists, lionized by those of today, certainly we're imbibing the psychoactive plants of their time. We can trace ritualistic plant ceremonies back 25,000 years. Consciousness in humans appears to go hand-in-hand with ceremonial substance use, and every ancient culture has some sort of ritual using ""drugs.""

It isn't useful to make theories about the universe while systematically denying portions of the universe. Yet this is the way of the scientific worldview, and for all the useful inventions of the scientific revolution, there seems to be a fundamental disconnect between scientific civilization and life. It does us no good to build a religion that leads to mass suicide. Without our connection to the shared spirit, a connection that for many modern humans is invisible without the initial boost of a strong, paradigm destroying experience like a psychoactive plant ceremony, we will progress down the road to a technologically advance race of mental midgets, choked to death on our own hubris and pollution. 

It's not that I dislike science. I just differentiate between the methods and the faith. The faith of science is standing in the way of human development in understanding the world, in precisely the way that the catholic church stood in the way of human progress in the time of Copernicus. You accuse me of being the one refusing new developments out of desire for a pretty, geocentric picture that feels good, and I see it precisely opposite. Scientific dogma is firmly entrenched in the idea that life is accidental, random, and meaningless. I have direct experiential evidence, gathered over a decade, from myself and hundreds of people, that this is wrong, and I have a means for anyone to test it. 

Who is refusing to engage the evidence?

The baby boomers aren't intrinsically bad people, they just happen to be responsible undoubtably for the state of the world today. They were handed the responsibility from their parents and this is the result. That is undeniable. Obviously people change their views over time, and people vote differently, but inaction is just as effective and dangerous as action and the people who have stood by to let the world become like this are also at fault for not fighting hard enough.

If you stand by and let the government do reprehensible things it's also partly your fault. We've seen extreme instances of that in Germany, but it's more or less identical to the greedy boomer policies.

Americans were and are largely unaware of the cultural and historical prejudices about Romani held by Europeans, and though American Romani are cautious about the stigma associated with their heritage,[2] they do not face discrimination or bigotry as they do in Europe.

,1396414180,t5_2ssp3,"Great question. Certainly some of the more gruesome options might be expected. However, it depends very much on the type of pirate that you encountered. Algerian pirates were feared among Europeans because they were known to enslave sailors. 

However, some merchant sailors faced entirely different kinds of treatment. A few pirates seem to have used their captives for entertainment. For instance, the narrative of Dutch merchant Lujke Boeckholt (originally published 1741) famously contains an extended account of captured sailors being made to organize themselves into elaborate dance routines. Scholars have long debated the veracity of Boeckholt's account of being forced to act as ""dansen dwazen"" or ""dancing fools"" for the pirates' entertainment, as well as passages such as this one: (translation is from scholar Lisa Ekkelkamp's published version of his narrative, 1991)

&gt; From there, by their advices, we began to move about the aft of the ship as they shouted commands for us to perform. ""Twirl a bit"" cried one, brandishing his cutlass ""and have the other one gallop as a pony."" At that, Heike [an officer on the voyage] did behave as a horse, bouncing with a gallop to the clap of their hands.

After several more exhortations, the pirates (through the medium of a single Dutch-speaker among them) organized their captives into a synchronized 29-step routine accompanied by an unnamed female piratess, who played a crude (and no doubt poorly tuned) analogue to a harpsichord. While this story is far from representative of most captives' encounters with pirates, there are other examples of pirates making use of their captives for their own entertainment. A 1704 London newspaper contains a sensational, and thus perhaps exaggerated or fictionalized, account of a pirate capture off the coast of St. Vincent in which the captives (four men and two young boys) were made to perform the entirety of Hamlet shortly after being captured. (See *London Gazette*, May 19, 1704) 

Finally, and perhaps most bizarrely, conversion narratives during the First Great Awakening in Britain included some accounts of former pirates describing their sins. One convert, named Pete Cooke, described his amusement in his past life at forcing the captives to play, at pain of death, a game of his devising that he called ""Fowle, Fowle, Swine"" (qualitatively similar to the children's game ""Duck, Duck, Goose"" of today).

Seasonings And Spices Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends And Forecast, 2013 - 2019

Increasing income levels resulting in increasing expenditure on food products, changing food habits of Asian consumers and changing demographics are the major growth drivers for the global seasonings and spices market. The seasonings and spices market is considered to be one of the most recession-proof markets since during uncertain economic conditions, consumers prefer in-house preparation and consumption rather than opting for the expensive choice of eating out or having ready-meals. However, when the economy is in good shape the situation is reverse. Online marketing campaigns offer expansion opportunity for seasonings and spices market. Seasonings and spices companies have started new online advertising campaigns that encourage consumers to create new recipes at home. Companies are adopting different methods for their campaign such as creating their own ‘Apps’ for product recipes, social media posts and contests, including ‘likes,’ ‘comments,’ ‘photo tags’ and ‘pins’ in social networking sites such as Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter and YouTube. Such campaigns help the companies in improved connectivity with consumers and thus help in establishing their brand identity in the seasonings and spices market.

,False,t5_2qn08,"Minor quibble (I have history degrees, I can't help myself): who are ""they""?  European rulers?  European noblemen?

""beards were a status symbol""  I don't think so.  I am not aware of any superior class of bearded men who somehow effectively barred lesser men from having beards (something akin to the attempts in the middle ages by the nobility to prevent lesser humans from imitating their rich dress by controlling the amount of fur others could wear).

Beards from mid-1800's through, say, the 1910's were one of the major/popular facial hair styles/choices.  They were not the only one, however.  As far as I know any man who could grow a beard regardless of his class or wealth was allowed to do so; all he had to do was want to do it.

The particular pendulum swing of facial hair fashion which concerns these monarchs goes something like this:  

For the entire 18th-century, with the exception of mustaches in some countries (Prussia and various German states, etc.) men were overwhelmingly clean-shaven.  [Think of Peter the Great of Russia's forced westernization of his countrymen and the mass beard-shearings.]
The counter-balance generally was that these men had long hair, but pulled back into single braids.

By the 1790's sideburns began creeping in (most portraits of famous officers of the U.S. from the American Revolutionary War date from the 1790's and most of them have sideburns, sideburns they didn't have at the time of the war; track portraits of George Washington who had portraits painted from the 1750's forward.)  As the sideburns lengthened, the hair on the head shortened; the queues were almost universally gone by the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815.

Not far behind came the mustaches.  Then, they connected.  By the mid-1800's full-beards were abroad (think American Civil War).

For a really interesting facial hair progression, from an extremely weak beard to an incredibly full one, follow the progress of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), future father of George V, from the 1860's through 1910.  By the time George V succeeded his father in 1910, beards were on the way out with people his age, but he kept on with the beard of his father until his death.

The pendulum was already swinging backward, with otherwise clean-shaven men with enormous mustaches, to men who were completely cleanshaven, a trend which generally continued through the 1960's.

I don't think any one European country could take on Russia, but to be fair I think the EU could take on Russia without the US. Britain, France, and Germany have excellent professional militaries with top-notch equipment and experience all over the globe. That's without mentioning countries like Poland that aren't slacking either. 

The strength of the EU and NATO is that it's an alliance. Western Europe and the US have allies, unlike Russia who can maybe count on a few former Republics in Central Asia and possibly Belarus (which is doubtful) whereas the EU and NATO would probably be supported by quite a few other countries. 

The thing about Russia's military now and why I say they are outdated is that sure, some of their equipment is top-notch. Their latest gear is quite good, but not all of their units have it and not all of their units would deploy with their best stuff, and they don't have the best logistics. 

America and our allies are coming off of 13 years of war across the globe, our military is as sharp as ever and so is our logistical capability. We just spent the last 13 years working on joint operations with our allies, all of whom now have plenty of experience. Not to mention that the Russian Navy is somewhat of a joke compared to the USN not to mention that the EU has more aircraft carriers than Russia.

Seagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_T._Seagle)) and produced by [Cartoon Network Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network_Studios).

&gt;The franchise is about a boy who acquires a watch-like alien device, called the *Omnitrix*, that allows him to turn into alien creatures.

&gt;The Ben 10 franchise received wide critical acclaim and won three [Emmy Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards); it also has grossed over $2 billion in retail sales in [Europe, the Middle East, and Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe,_the_Middle_East,_and_Africa) (EMEA) and has sold 100 million toys worldwide.

Israel only continues its existence on the back of Holocost-guilt from Europe and the US while bullying the people they forcibly removed from their homeland.

,False,t5_2qh6p,"I appreciate the respectful way you said this first of all. 

Second of all, I agree that the *treatment* of the natives was absolutely disgraceful. That being said, I would've undo any of it. I personally wish we could've lived side by side with the natives, but the natives were savagely killing us just like we were doing to them. It was war. 

For more, genocide is looking at a group of people and saying ""those are our targets. We want to eliminate them. This isn't just war. This is extermination.""

I don't think that is even close to what happened with the natives. We were extremely superior to them technologically. And as a result, we won. The wars dragged out for a very long time, but we didn't start them (and by we, I mean Americans). 

We were born into land with natural enemies. The Europeans made colonies here, and after a few generations Americans existed. By then, the white man and the Native already had a very dark past. We wanted more land, and we were entitled to it. Let me expand on that. I think every country, town, country, etc, is entitled to expanding an empire. However, the area which they choose to expand into has the obvious right to sovereignty. If the invaders succeed, they had the right to the land all along. If they don't succeed, then they don't have the land. Whichever culture can benefit more from said land doesn't *deserve* it, but they're equally entitled to claiming it, if that makes sense. 

Plus, the Natives did not believe in land ownership. They get pissed now saying we took there land. That isn't true though. We didn't take their land. They said they didn't own it. They just lived on it. Living side by side wasn't working. They were scalping us, raiding our settlements, etc, and we were doing similar things. 

It's also important to recognize how hard it would've been to truly commit a genocide back then. There we no planes to fly over all of their settlements to nuke them. We didn't make chambers to gas them alive, or burn them in groups. No, there weren't any intentions on killing them off, just removing them from the territory. 

The Trail of Tears was the horrible. But not genocide. It was a violent, destructive, unnecessary (in my opinion) removal of people from the land they lived on. 

As for the reservations, there's nothing stopping them from getting off the reservations and joining the rest of us. That was one of the biggest problems in the first place. They didn't want to live side by side, and neither did we. 

Should they have to make that choice? Should they have to decide whether or not to assimilate to a culture of people whose ancestors defeated their own? That's entirely up to them, a shitty decision, but up to them nonetheless. Their reservations are disgusting, agreed, but that isn't ""our"" fault (by our, I mean our American ancestors. Not sure if you're an American or if your ancestors were, but I'm trailing off now..). They drink, they pollute, they destroy their own crops, they treat their land horribly, and then they request government pay. I've got no sympathy for the modern day ""natives"" who live on reservations. They aren't entitled to shit. Nobody is, with the exception of our basic rights, and air. I'm just as much a native as they are. So yeah, reservations are horrible, and while it's our fault that they EXIST, it isn't our fault that they're in their current condition.

&gt;

&gt;__Yang Kyoungjong__ (c. 1920 – April 7, 1992) was a [Korean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_people) soldier who fought during [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) in the [Imperial Japanese Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army), the [Soviet Red Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army), and later the German [Wehrmacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht).    

&gt;In 1938, at the age of 18, Yang was in [Manchuria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria) when he was [conscripted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription) into the [Kwantung Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwantung_Army) of the Imperial Japanese Army to fight against the [Soviet Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union). At the time [Korea was ruled by Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule). During the [Battles of Khalkhin Gol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol), he was captured by the Soviet [Red Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army) and sent to a [labour camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag). Because of the manpower shortages faced by the Soviets in its fight against [Nazi Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), in 1942 he was pressed into fighting in the Red Army along with thousands of other prisoners, and was sent to the European [eastern front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_of_World_War_II).  

&gt;In 1943, he was captured by Wehrmacht soldiers in [Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine) during the [Third Battle of Kharkov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Kharkov), and was then pressed into fighting for Germany. Yang was sent to [Occupied France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_France) to fight in a battalion of Soviet [prisoners of war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war) known as the ""[Eastern Battalion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostlegionen)"", serving in a battalion located on the [Cotentin peninsula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotentin_peninsula) in [Normandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy), located close to [Utah Beach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach). After the [D-Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Day) landings in northern France by the [Allied forces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II), Yang was captured by [paratroopers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper) of the [United States Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army) in June 1944. The Americans initially believed him to be Japanese in German uniform, and he was placed in a prisoner-of-war camp in the [United Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). At the time, Lieutenant Robert Brewer of the [506th Parachute Infantry Regiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/506th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States\)), [101st Airborne Division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division), reported that his regiment captured four Asians in German uniform after the Utah Beach landings, and that initially no one was able to communicate with them. Yang later emigrated from [Russia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) to the [United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), where he lived until he died in [Illinois](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois) in 1992.

&gt;

&gt;On 24 July 2010, a crowd __disaster at the 2010 [Love Parade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Parade)__ [electronic dance music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music) festival in [Duisburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duisburg), North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, caused the death of 21 people from [suffocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffocation).  At least 510 more were injured. 

&gt;The Love Parade was a popular and free-access festival and [parade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade) that originated in 1989 in Berlin. The parade featured stages, but had [floats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_(parade\)) with music, [DJs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJs) and dancers moving through the audience. The Love Parade in Duisburg was the first edition of the festival that was organised in a closed-off area.  Between 200,000 and 1.4 million people were reported to be attending the event and 3,200 police were on hand. 

&gt;With the slogan ""[The Art of Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Amatoria)"", the event was one of the program elements of [RUHR.2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUHR.2010), an effort to highlight cultural events in the [Ruhr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr) area, one of 2010's [European Capitals of Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture).

,False,t5_2vizz,"&gt; I'll admit that improvement of yield is, on its own, always positive. I was pointing out that there is a need to balance improvements in performance against possible detriments to the biosphere as a whole. What if humanity desires the biosphere to be maintained in some sort of equilibrium, that we might enjoy it in various ways?

I don't see how increasing yields makes that less likely. 

&gt; Patenting of life-forms is simply insane, and leads down a rabbit-hole of problems.

I mostly agree, although patenting cultivars is not a new thing, the Plant Patent Act was passed in 1930. I'd agree with limited protections for a short period to recoup the R&amp;D costs. Again, not an argument against GMO but the legislation that surrounds any kind of breeding of crops or livestock.

&gt; Why does everyone on Reddit assume that population control involves death camps? I can give you a bit of a pass on all the Hitler references since you're from the EU, but it is incredibly tiresome.

I don't think what I said is a Hitler reference. It's just that it's a bit arrogant to say ""there's too many people for the Earth"" when you're already alive, living a life of luxury in a developed nation, especially since there's no factual basis beyond saying there's too many of us. What's actually true is that there's too many of us who are poor. Developed nations reach population plateaus because people there are more educated, wealthy, egalitarian, and have access to contraception. Hell, my own government has to actually encourage childbirth to keep the population stable.

&gt; arguing for one alternative because others are just as bad just forces me to consider alternative criteria.

I don't agree that ""just as bad"" is applicable here. The insistence that there is a greater risk of unintended consequences when new cultivars are created by manipulating individual genes instead of cross-breeding is the opposite of reality. Agriculture destroys ecosystems anyway, and if destruction of ecosystems is of concern to you, then calling for organic farming is the last thing you should be doing. 

&gt; There is no harm in listing additional ingredients, if anything, it should help to show that transgenic foods are safe.

Which ingredients? In most food crops, there is no difference in chemical composition of GM and non-GM food. The demand is to label GM anyway, because ooga booga Frankenfoods. The reason I object to this is because it's a reaction to pseudoscientific fearmongering instead of meaningful information about the product. You might as well demand that every food product be labeled by compliance to religious dietary restrictions. 

&gt; As an aside, are you by any chance one of those people who thinks that in the future we're all going to be living in Ringworlds and becoming immortal with computers?

Not so much ""thinks"" as ""hopes"". On the whole, ecology makes no sense to me absent humanity. We know for a fact that all life on Earth will be killed when the sun goes red giant. Life developing intelligence is its way of getting off this rock in the long term. Biodiversity is a good thing, but not at the cost of human progress.

I'm not some libertarian transhumanist, though. I think the free market is not suited for ecological stewardship, and government regulation should be increased drastically. But based on a consensus of experts, not the paranoia of laypeople. For instance, the obvious large-scale solution to climate change is emission-free nuclear power, but radiophobia means that Europe, for instance, is shutting nuclear plants down and burning untold amounts of fossil fuels while we're all waiting for magical, one-size-fits-all renewable solutions. The lessons of Chernobyl and Fukushima are not ""nuclear power is unsafe"", but rather ""don't let commies maintain nuclear plants"" and ""don't build them on the coast of a country who named the phenomenon of tsunamis"", respectively.",True,cgh69mj,saltlets,Fecal Baronet,,t1_cgguv22,False,0,t3_21qswa,0,,1433159390,t1_cgh69mj,0,1,1396335426,1,TumblrInAction
,False,t5_2qrz8,"Chicken Farmer here, there seem to be two big topics in our industry that really stand out. Animal cruelty and Antibiotics. 

Here in Canada, our operations work on a quota system and are mainly family based. Consumers want [safe food](http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=9a16e2cd-9ab0-44d5-8ba6-634fad14fec7) and so we are implement new bio security measures and farm safety programs all the time. But all these restrictions has widened the gap between farmer and consumer. We in the chicken biz run on a social license wherein as long as the public agrees with the way our industry is run, we have the ability to keep the nugget train on schedule. So we have a responsibility to our consumers to assure them that their meat is produced in an environment that they agree with. 

Now animal cruelty. I've seen articles pop up on this subreddit in regards to making it illegal to video tape farming operations. I think this is the complete wrong way to deal with this situation. This does not make consumers trust farmers and it will not be long before that social license is revoked. I've volunteered for fairs and AG events working in a booth promoting our industry, and it is really hard to get the more urban visitor engaged in discussion re. food safety and our industry. We have boards and marketing councils trying to bridge the gap btw ourselves and consumers, tell me how that's going. Personally, I'm not sure if this is the answer, but just stream it all. I don't have anything to hide, and if somebody wants to check up the way I run my operation they could jump on and take a look (though I'm not sure how many people would take to the site of a culled chicken, but I couldn't think of a better way to bring the reality of the farm to the consumer). Maybe one day. 

Aaand antibiotics. Currently, there are some antibiotics that are not suited humans that are utilized in chicken production. These could breed antibiotic resistant bacteria and is something that we as an industry must get together and figure out. I attended an symposium this year on that very topic, and the measures that we are moving toward to eventually phase out this practice. It saves me in feed costs and I have a reduced mortality rate on my flock where antibiotics are added to the ration. And were I switch antibiotics off, chances are I would not be able to compete with other producers with the added cost of production. Though recently with the help of supplements and other factors, antibiotic free chicken is becoming more viable but is associated with higher risk. 

So some of the things you mentioned? 

Climate? Yeah, cold up here in Canada. Probably not the most geographically optimal place to raise chicken. We have a 'free run' operation. No cages in Canada for broiler (meat) operations, don't know enough to vouch for the states, but I think the same. People ask why not free range? Hard enough to get me to go out in -30. Punching more holes in my barn would raise energy costs and interfere with my ventilation program, also bio security and outside disease carrying birds... Warmer winters do appeal to me though...

Aquifer depletion? This scares the bajeesus out of me, should out of everyone. I suppose it's just not a problem for us right now. But I assume water recapturing or better recycling methods should be looked into. 

Aging farmers? More quota for me. No, not as simple as that. This would mean a consolidation of the business as there would be fewer people running it. And the way we embrace technology, there don't really NEED to be that many of us. We have maybe 3 employees to run a flock of 100 000. Doesn't help with the 'factory farm image'. 

High barriers to entry. That's a pretty big on in this industry. We're into succession planning between my folks and I. The cost of Quota has never been higher, and it will be a long process before the name on the ticket reads mine. I couldn't imagine trying to get in without a lot of help. I see no other barriers than monetary ones though. 

In the end, people need to eat. And if they want to import product on the cheap and not think about where it comes from (like sweatshops), they can go right ahead. But one thing I've noticed is that people don't mess around when it comes to food safety. Recalls happen and heads roll when people are afraid to eat (Listeria recently in our industry. Or that cucumber debacle a year or two ago in EU or whatever). It's up to us to make the consumer trust that we have it under control in a way that they define.

According to more than one expert suspension tuner I know the WP/Showa/KYB stuff is all about the same inside. There is a few little differences and that tends to make it so shops unfamiliar with WP (cause they never would see it much before) didn't know how to set it up. I've even ridden a KTM 250F with full Ohlins suspension (3,000$... eeek) and yea... I wouldn't spend the 3k for it...

Also do not underestimate the old standard of KTM's being factory setup out of the box for EUROPEAN style riding. The Japanese OEM's would have their USA bikes setup for USA style tracks and riders. Prior to 2013... the KTM's were setup for EU riders and EU tracks. That alone is a huge diff.

My KTM has had the suspension reworked by WP Factory Services and it does it's job just fine, and I've ridden every brand bike 2012-2014 model pretty much. Only bike who's suspension felt better out of the box is the Yamaha SSS forks, which are universally praised as the best forks out of the box you can find (they are nice).


I can't speak to pre-2013 KTM's but I know my 2013 has many nice details that you don't find on the Japanese bikes. It's a tight machine and the build quality is right there. My 250sx retailed for LESS than the YZ250 and beat it across the board in every category (except forks, see above).

**Lauchlin 'Lock' O'Hannegan** played by Me - Tough Firefighter with an axe, a shotgun, and a mission to find his son and divorced wife in the apocalypse.

**John Ness** played by O - Paranoid research specialist and germaphobe; entirely unhinged by the filthy going ons.

**Emily Hart** played by S - Apocalypse predictor, spent formative years preparing a survival plan and learning how to use a crossbow. Really quite excited about the impending end of the world and just enjoying herself until it all goes down the toilet.

**Riley** played by A - Hard-bitten detective just trying to live day to day.

**Hank Trudy** played by C - Only appeared for one session; drunken, coke-addict ladies-man with a tendency for fast cars and hard drugs. Has been on a non-stop bender since the shit went down.

**The Setting:** The Zombie Apocalypse has only recently begun, starting as a coral-like growth or infection which parasitically controlled the host (this was before The Last of Us, but it wasn't too dissimilar). The hosts moved slower in colder climates so the populace started moving away from the equator and towards the north of Europe and America. 

**The Story:** This was some time ago, so it isn't all exactly clear as it once was but I'll do my best. The group met through chance circumstance and had been together for a few weeks (told through backstory). Lock (Me) was searching for his estranged family through the swarms of survivors heading north. Having secured a car and some fuel, we began our journey for the first session. The highway was snowed in but passable with careful driving; unfortunately the road block of crashed and wrecked cars was not. We decided to do our best to clear the road so we could continue. A strange tusk-like protrusion was sticking out of a snow drift, so naturally being curious people we gave it a poke. This was our first encounter with a Host. An infected deer reared up from the snow and attacked Lock and Riley. Lock managed to get his axe stuck in it's antlers while Riley shot it several times in the face. Emily got a bolt in its side before John decided to ram it with the car. For those of you that play, you know that players declare actions and then initiative, so technically this all happened very quickly. John slammed the car into Lock and the Host-deer, wounding Lock, damaging the car, and outright murderating the Host-deer. We exchanged some choice words about not running over your friends and carried on.

We eventually made it to a homestead which provided some food and shelter for a few days (as well as some extortionate fuel prices). Following a mass of people the next day, we arrived at a military check-point. Something was off, so Lock and Riley did some snooping. A few of the soldiers were wearing ill-fitting uniforms with names which did not match their nationalities or accents. Summarizing that this was no government operation, we attempted to sneak away through the forest, only to be intercepted by armed men. They shook us down for our guns and valuables (including some doses of Cure that John had hidden on his person). Lock made an impassioned plea to leave the group with their food and melee weapons, which the ""soldiers"" agreed to.

Now on foot the going was much slower, but the group nevertheless reached a house to hunker down in for the night. Entering the premises warily, Lock was set upon by a Host-dog and knocked to the ground. The Host-dog tore at his body as the others tried to beat the creature to death with bats and clubs. Finally Riley was able to put a bullet in it and save Lock from an untimely death. Moments later the group heard the sound of screeching tires and 80s Rock and Roll. Enter: Hank Trudy. 

Hank drove a red convertible Corvette with his Host-girlfriend tied up in the passenger seat. The boot of his car was full of coke, booze, heroin, speed, mescalin, and much much more. We convince him to tie his ""girlfriend"" onto the hood of the car so we could all cram in the tiny two seater (with Lock and Riley desperately clinging to the back). The excess weight causes the car to quickly run out of fuel, so the group investigated a nearby service station. After a little accident involving Emily's crossbow, an exploding Host-human, and some engine oil, we are all thoroughly soaked with gore and oil, but the car is fueled. 

Moving on, the GM asks us all a poignant question.

GM - ""Hank, are you still smoking?""

Hank - ""Like a chimney""

GM - *rolls some dice*

GM - ""Lock, you're on fire from Hank flicking his cigarette butt while driving""

So now we have a car careening at 60mph, Lock is on fire, people are panicking as you'd expect. The GM asks another question.

GM - ""Hank, you've been drinking and snorting this whole time, yes?""

Hank - ""Oh shit yeah I have!""

GM - *rolls dice*

GM - ""You crash at 60mph into a parked car""

So let me lay this out for you. We have a convertible. Host-girlfriend is on the hood, Hank is driving, John is in the passenger seat, Emily is squished between them, Lock is sitting on the rear of the car with his legs behind the drivers seat, and Riley is in the same position but on the passenger side. 

Lock is thrown headfirst out of the convertible at 60mph into the parked car and dies on impact. John, angry at Emily for making him filthy with gore and oil, draws his revolver and shoots her in the side of the head, killing her instantly. Riley, who had also been thrown from the car but somehow didn't die horribly, draws his handgun and shoots John in the back of the head point blank, killing him instantly. Hank, not wanting to feel left out, draws his handgun and shoots Riley in the face at point blank range, killing him instantly.

Hank pauses for a moment to survey the carnage before dumping our bodies on the side of the road, removing the now squished host-girlfriend from the bonnet, and drives off into the sunset with a bottle of vodka in one hand and a line of coke on the dash board.

Thus ended our first and only AFMBE campaign.

Chief differences; a corrupt industrialist in China will receive death by firing squad or life imprisonment once caught out because China cannot afford to squander the temporary competitive advantage it holds-it must catch up in all areas, wages rise over time and that advantage vanishes, it has to improve and implement actual change behind the scenes; meanwhile in the old, languishing west, a corrupt industrialist in Europe will receive a fine, and a corrupt industrialist in the US will just lobby congress and get a raise.

&gt;The __double-headed eagle__ is a common symbol in [heraldry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry) and [vexillology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology). It is most commonly associated with the [Byzantine Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire), the [Holy Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire), the [Russian Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire) and their successor states. In Byzantine heraldry, the heads represent the Emperor having authority over both secular and religious matters, Byzantine emperors were regarded as Christ's viceregent on Earth. It also signified the dominance of the [Byzantine Emperors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Emperors) over both East and West. In the Holy Roman Empire's heraldry, it represented the [church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Church) and the [state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity\)). Several Eastern European nations adopted it from the Byzantines and continue to use it as their national symbol to this day.

,False,t5_2qh6c,"1) This is a super broad question.

Pope is like a head bishop, elected by the others, for life. The ""Great Schism""  between them and Orthodoxy was a long long time ago. Reformation around 1600. Luther was opposed to indulgences and would've preferred reform to being excommunicated and starting his own thing.

Big bang theory. Supported education and science and literacy in Europe for centuries.

Vatican City. Used to have armies (medieval). 

Mass was in Latin for a long time but languages of the people are okay now.

Prayers to Saints as one would ask a friend for prayer. Don't actually ""worship"" Mary even though it sometimes sounds to Protestant ears like they do. They got lots of Saints for all sorts of things ""Patron saint of X"". Sainthood requires a few miracles and maybe some other things. Saints recognized by Pope. 

First US Cathedral was in Baltimore. Maryland has (proportionally) a lot of Catholics.

Opposed to contraceptives. 

Priests may only be male. I think priests must be unmarried/celebate, and I'm sure it's true for monks, bishops, etc.

Pope isn't actually considered infallible.

There's a place called purgatory that is somehow involved in our afterlife. For righteous unsaved and doing penance, maybe? 

""Catholic guilt"", which I assume comes from salvation-by-faith-and-works. And penance.

Praying in the rosary. Hail Mary's and Our Father's. 

Transubstantiation. Non-catholics can't get communion. No meat on Fridays (actually all year, though most only do it during Lent). Paedobaptism. There's a sacrament about anointing the sick,  I think it's called.

Unfortunately, they've had many problems with pedophilia and covering it up.

They cross themselves at times during mass, e.g. When invoking the trinity or preparing to hear the gospel. It's not exactly the same way Orthodox cross themselves.

2) The new Pope seems pretty swell (ascetism,  humility, social justice).

3) See parts of 1? Plus basic Christian stuff: Apostle's Creed, e.g. Oh,  also, they're required to confess to a priest every so often.

4) It's a shame they are discriminated against. I assume they can do anything but be priests, so they're a lot better than some Protestant denoms in this regard. (Where better is ""more equality-embracing""). 

5) Not a fan at all,  but mostly from a social justice ""single unquestionable leader can be really unhealthy"" sort of way rather than a necessarily. Biblical objection (and really I have this objection more with Protestants who claim a ""Moses leadership"" model. Catholics are only guilty of sort of looking like that, I don't know if enough about them... Although there were the pedophilia cover-ups, and those are certainly not good.

I do prefer the Orthodox bishops-are-equal approach.

However, I do see the value in having a figurehead to influence those in power. E.g. The ""Obama meets with Pope"" headlines from the other day. And I seem to remember his predecessor encouraging Bush to pardon death row convicts.

6) Feeding the poor, tending the sick, etc. They can do a good bit of that. I guess this goes under #2 as well.

7) This would be super-presumptuous of me. I'd prefer they lose the anti-contraceptive stance as I think that can cause a lot of pain and hurt unintentionally, and I don't see belief on it as a core tenet of the faith.

8) I don't actually have a church. I'm looking... 

9) Catholics are Christians too, yes.

The idea that no nation will be a Superpower (single power) in the World in the future. This is already happening, the European Union, with 500 million people is already a larger economy then the US (even with the economic crisis). With free movement inside the EU, a single currency, it should be counted like the US is as one economy instead of just measuring the states.  

I expect China to also overtake the US economy (the aging crisis is still a few decades away with that generation in there late 40's/ 50's), also the recent lifting of the one child policy to a two child policy will mean a likely brief flatlining.

&gt;

&gt;The __theory of [Portuguese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal) discovery of [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia)__ claims that early [Portuguese navigators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_discoveries) were the [first Europeans to sight Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_exploration_of_Australia) between 1521 and 1524, well before the arrival of [Dutch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic) navigator [Willem Janszoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Janszoon) in 1606 on board the *[Duyfken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duyfken)* who is generally considered to be the discoverer. This is based on the following elements:  

&gt;


&gt;* The [Dieppe maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieppe_maps), a group of 16th-century [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) world maps, which depict a large landmass between [Indonesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia) and [Antarctica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica). Labelled as [Java la Grande](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_la_Grande), this land mass carries [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language), [Portuguese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language), and Gallicized Portuguese placenames, and has been interpreted by some as corresponding to Australia's northwestern and eastern coasts.

&gt;* The presence of [Portuguese colonies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire) in [Southeast Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia) from the early 16th century, particularly [Portuguese Timor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Timor) – approximately 650 kilometres from the Australian coast – c. 1513–1516.  

&gt;* Various antiquities found on Australian coastlines, claimed to be relics of early Portuguese voyages to Australia.

&gt;Precedence of discovery has also been claimed for [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China),  [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France),  [Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain),  [India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India),  and even [Phoenicia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia).

Also, Erwin's father was killed for telling his son about the outside world, so why wouldn't Hange be as well for telling everyone information of what happened before the walls?] (/spoiler) Why would she even share that knowledge, surely she knows that everything to do with the outside world/past is stricly prohibited.

It is specifically stated that the titans first appeared 107 years ago and that in the last 100 years there hasn't been any accidents. The series doesn't specify if this means that humans settled inside the walls 100 years ago, or if it happened earlier and it's just been 100 years since the last breach. Speculation aside, titans appearing exactly 107 years ago is stated and even lampshaded by ""everyone knows this."" Take the spin-off novels with a grain of salt, they're just expanded universe entries. The walls weren't built by humans, they were already there when humankind found them.

Aside from the obvious German Yeager and Kirstein, are there really Slavic or Finnish names? I don't recall any. If you must place the walls on the real world map, then they can't be in Europe, as humans traveled to the new continent and found the walls there.

It parodies the beer hypothesis (linked below) and several of the other less empirically supported theories explaining the origin of agriculture. I was surprised how easy it was to explain other things (like the spread of Indo-European languages or the Late Neolithic crisis) after I got started, showing just how dangerous it is to weave theories based on what's ""plausible"" rather than what can be deduced from hard evidence – a common vice of amateur and professional archaeologists alike.**

-----

Up until recently there were a number of competing hypotheses on how farming originated: that people were forced to adopt it in a period of drought or harsh climate because it produced more food for less work (Childe’s [Oasis theory](http://archaeology.about.com/od/oterms/g/oasis.htm) and updated versions); that it was needed to feed the large of number of people congregating for symbolic rituals at sites like [Gobekli Tepe](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text); or that people simply [liked beer and wanted more of it](http://m.livescience.com/10221-beer-lubricated-rise-civilization-study-suggests.html). A new theory that’s rapidly gaining ground though is a synthesis of the above based on detailed archaeobotanical studies of *Cannabis cordozar*, a now extinct relative of *Cannabis sativa* (marijuana).

In very abbreviated form, it goes like this. *C. cordozar* was a natural “super weed” with a THC content upwards of 40%, and there’s evidence that Neolithic people made it even more potent after they started using ceramic vessels to extract and burn the oil (yes, pottery was literally invented for pot!). In the Palaeolithic (before 10,000 BP) it grew widely across Siberia and the Eurasian steppe, which may explain why pottery was invented so early there, and also why it had such a low population density – because unlike in the Near East, they didn’t have any domesticable plant or animal species to counteract its negative effect on productivity (more on that later). There is some evidence it was imported to the Near East at that time (there are some supposed ground stone ""bongs"" at Ohalu II in Israel, dated to 19,000 BP), but certainly not in great quantities. However, with the changing climate at the end of the Ice Age, the plant moved southwards and became established in the steppic areas adjacent to the Fertile Crescent, where it was an immediate hit. At sites like Tell Abu Hureyra and Tell Aswad, *C. cordozar* seeds suddenly start showing up in huge quantities around 10,000 years ago, usually around hearth fires. It’s hard not to imagine the people who lived there first discovering this wonder-plant out in the bush, bringing it back to camp and throwing it on the fire, and sitting there staring for hours and hours. At the same time the amount of other artefact types – wild plant seeds, animal bones, lithic tools – drops off sharply. A sign of things to come!

We now think that smoking *C. cordozar* became the central feature of early Neolithic (PPNA) lifestyles in the Near East. It must have been a social activity, transforming previously solitary and taciturn hunters and gatherers into gregarious storytellers. People began to gather in unprecedented at numbers at places like Gobekli Tepe to smoke and erect [large monuments featuring reliefs of wild animals](http://image.b4in.net/resources/2013/09/18/1379537020-gobekli+tepe+2.PNG) – no doubt [inspired by psychodelic experiences](https://sphotos-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/p480x480/1069979_10151735826033130_1995468143_n.jpg). But just as the potency of *C. cordozar* created a high that modern strains of *C. sativa* are only just managing to replicate, it also caused extreme lethargy. At Tell Abu Hureyra and Tell Aswad the evidence for everyday activity (food preparation, tool manufacture, etc.) drops off sharply with the introduction of the plant – at Gobekli Tepe it's absent entirely. This caused a crisis in the foraging economy. They now spent most of their days intoxicated, and what time they did spend lucid was used up on a strange, ritual obsession with depictions of wild animals. In other words, they’d become too lazy to go out hunting animals and gathering wild plants. Instead they turned to fast food – cereal grains that, while low in nutritional value (Neolithic people lived dramatically shorter, less healthy lives than their Palaeolithic ancestors) could be cultivated close to home and produce large amounts of readily available, easily prepared food. Eventually they also added domesticated animals to their diet, even though they took slightly more effort to keep, perhaps because they could be killed and eaten immediately when people had a sudden urge to eat, as opposed to grains which you have to at least add boiling water to.

After this farming spread quickly from the Near East to Europe. Previous generations of archaeologists thought that this was because farmers migrated, but it now seems unlikely that they had the energy. Rather, it looks like the *C. cordozar* was spread first, bringing farming and all its drawbacks (poor diet, cramped, unpleasant settlements, the smell) in its wake. Farming did fuel endogenous population growth, however, because it produced food to spare – and what else were people going to do while they were sitting around all the time?

But if *C. cordozar* was such a central part of prehistoric lifestyles, why is it extinct now? Much like [silphium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium) in the Roman period, it was a victim of its own success. The irony was that C. cordozar, which prompted the adoption of cultivated crops, was not very easy to cultivate itself. It was a temperamental plant that was only marginally able to survive in the climate of the Near East, never mind Europe. Neolithic people struggled to maintain the level of close attention needed to cultivate it successfully, yet demand kept on rising as a result of population growth. After they exhausted their own supply the system was prolonged for a time by horse-riding pastoralist groups who brought *C. cordozar* from the steppe, travelling astounding distances to distribute it and, by virtue of the social status this accrued, spreading their language (Proto-Indo-European) across much of Europe and Asia. It couldn't last forever, however, and the activities of Proto-Indo-European-speaking dealers only served to make the plant extinct in its native steppic environment too. The social collapse that followed was calamitous: archaeologists have long recognised (but been unable to explain) a ""Late Neolithic crisis"" in which long established settlement patterns, cultural traditions and artefact forms were suddenly disrupted, and there is [new evidence for a massive population decline](http://dienekes.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/neolithic-boom-followed-by-later.html). Neolithic societies had become dependent on *C. cordozar* and the shock of going ""cold turkey"" was simply too much for many to take. They reverted to a harsher, less symbolically rich and more turbulent existence for at least thousands of years – arguably to the present day. 

It may not have been forgotten, however. Although difficult to prove, one intriguing idea is that the prevalence of ""heavenly tree"" imagery and its association with paradise in Eurasian societies (e.g. the tree of knowledge in the biblical story of Eden, the Assyrian [tree of life](http://www.electricyouniverse.com/eye/thumbs/lrg-1016-palaceofnimrud-britishmuseum-treeoflife-babylonians-assyrians.jpg) and the ubiquitous shamanic [world tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_tree)) is a cultural memory of *C. cordozar*.

Note: I should stress that this all only applies to farming in the Near East and (later) Europe. Farming was invented multiple times around the world, probably for different reasons – although there has been some new research linking the domestication of rice in East Asia to a marked increase in finds of Wutang poppy seeds (a potent opioid).",True,cgh8408,brigantus,Moderator | Epipalaeolithic Levant | Neolithic Eastern Europe,,t3_21wshb,False,0,t3_21wshb,0,moderator,1433160324,t1_cgh8408,0,13,1396346946,13,AskHistorians
,False,t5_2yj5y,"I found this article that I copied and pasted below:

The traditional tomato pin cushion is a popular and reliable pin cushion. It is used for storing needles and pins safely and in an organised way.  It has a small strawberry attached to it which has emery powder inside. This powder is abrasive and allows the strawberry to be used to sharpen pins or needles and to clean off any rust.

All you need to do is push your pin or needle into the strawberry, whilst holding it firmly between your thumb and forefinger. Carefully push the pin in and out until it has been sharpened or any rust removed.

Not a modern invention
Tomato pin cushions are no modern invention  The first reference to them dates back to the European Middle Ages between the first and the fifteenth centuries.

Over time, the tomato came to symbolise prosperity and a means of warding off evil spirits.  During the Victorian era (1837 - 1901) when a family moved into a new home, it became customary to leave a fresh tomato on the mantle piece to attract wealth, good health and good luck.

  
As tomatoes are seasonal and not always available, a substitute was developed.  This was a red fabric tomato, filled with sawdust.  This was left on the mantle piece and with time, this fabric tomato was used as a means of storing pins.  This was soon further embellished with leaves and vines and is the product of the tomato pin cushion we use today.

te subestimezi!

&gt;Pe acest subreddit (pe internet, in general) daca nu esti de acord cu toata lumea (i.e daca nu esti ateu) esti luat la misto

Ai inversat putin cauza si efectul. Cauza e ceea ce ai pus in paranteza, iar partea cu toata lumea e doar o observatie complementara si secundara. 

&gt;oamenii isi bat joc de tine, te injura si mai stiu eu ce.

I'm going to need some sources for that.

&gt;Religia a fost inteleasa foarte foarte rau. 

Asta e scuza inca de la inceputuri, in fond si crestinismul doar a reinventat mozaismul. 

&gt;Pentru ca religia nu inseamna ce vedem acum la televizor, preotii abuzivi si calugaritele curve etc.

O, nu, acum nici nu e asa rau, e doar ipocrizie. In cazul de fata, religia crestin ortodoxa e mult mai groaznica daca studiezi istorie. Nu e nevoie sa mergi mult in trecut... secolul 19 e deja plin de detalii impresionante.

&gt;Suntem oameni, condusi de putere si de bani.

OK, recomand sa nu mai fie oameni in religie, sau cel putin organizatii religioase. Esti de acord, da?

&gt; Daca au vazut preotii ca pot sa scoata bani din religie (care, pentru ei, e doar o afacere) s-au gandit sa ne ia de prosti.  Iar noi, de prosti ce suntem, ii ajutam, le dam bani si ii imbogatim.

Si ce o sa faci tu in privinta asta?

&gt;Dar religia e cu totul si cu totul altceva. 

Nu, religia este mentinuta de Biserica. Ca element cultural, preotii sunt ""agricultorii"" care intretin culturile de religie; fara ei, religia se dizolva, se imprastie, se dilueaza si dispare in timp. Cine crezi ca a scris si editat Biblia - sursa de informare de baza pentru toata credinta ta ? 

&gt;Da, e adevarat, religia e umilita pentru ca majoritatea preotilor sunt lacomi, isi doresc putere si bani.

Si pentru ideile regresive si inumane. 

&gt;In fiecare zi aud doar exemple rele despre religie, biserica si Dumnezeu.

Foarte bine. Traim intr-o perioada in care riscul este mic daca spui asa ceva. Oricum, ar trebui sa citesti asta: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias

&gt;Religia e de fapt o cale prin care ne putem uni, putem deveni prieteni, ""frati si surori"".

Fals. Deja suntem ""frati si surori"", suntem aceeasi specie, toti inruditi (grad indepartat, dar real). Ce vrei tu poate e frumos, dar esti confuz daca nu vezi ca prin religie se doreste o orinduire de ""frati si surori"" **sub** ceva autoritate mai mare. 

&gt;Credeti ca lui Dumnezeu ii pasa de bisericile uriase, din aur masiv, de catedralele scumpe si bogate, de banii dati catre preotii lacomi? Nu.

Sursa?

&gt;Pur si simplu ar trebui sa fim impreuna, sa ne intelegem, sa convietuim.

""CU JESUS, altfel, afara!"" - ai uitat partea asta.

&gt;Dupa cum am spus, religia este neinteleasa din cauza exemplelor negative ce ni se dau in fiecare zi, si pe buna dreptate! 

Din nou, o declaratie nefondata.

&gt;Dar daca studiezi atent, prietenia si dragostea sunt cele care conteaza, si nu preotii, bisericile si banii.

Grozav, atunci de ce esti religios? Prietenia si dragostea n-au nicio legatura cu religia; chiar nu e necesara.

It seems to me that they are again in a similar position where they have smaller size but more elite around which they can rebuild a larger army.  
As for experience, I think this is a problem that both sides face. The german army has been in some deployments giving some of their forces experience. The russian army has also been deployed against terrorists/rebels/whatever you chose to call them, in many places. The thing is, both of the scenarios that both army seem to be fighting in are what are called ""Low-Intensity Conflict"".

Do you know how much power Dick Law has in this situation? Can you confirm that he has the permission to make a higher bid?

How is this *clear* ? Having a friend in a Schalke board room isn't going to make them accept a lower offer if they know they can get more from Bayern in the summer. I can easily say that it is clear that they have received info that Bayern will bid 40 million in the summer. I have no foundation for that point outside of 'Bayern are German and were linked in the tabloids', much like 'Dein is English and Law is American, so clearly Dein has more ""contacts"" in European football'.

You're comparing a job Dein could do with better financial strength, a better squad to play negotiations off of and the trophies to show off/entice the player. It's not as simple as saying 'Dein did better. Law is not good.'

,False,t5_2qhos,"&gt;Is there a phonological phenomenon of interest going on with the last paragraph stuff, or are you clarifying affixation further?

Not really anything more than the lowering of /i/ and /u/ following glides (/w/ and /y/) in Ainu.

&gt;Anyway. So abstracting away from the morphology somewhat, do you agree with the assimilation/disharmony generalization?

I think Vovin (1993) shows pretty convincingly that there are a large number of counter-examples even to that rule.

1. **iCe**: (unattested)
1. **eCi**: *rewe* (/rew+i/ |bend+SG|) 'to bend (something)'
1. **uCo**: (unattested)
1. **oCu**: (unattested)

While patterns (1) and (3) are unattested, there is a widespread phonological process in Ainu where syllable final /e/ and /i/, and /o/ and /u/ merge. This does not seem to care about any sort of harmony rules, and we even see it in the early transcriptions of the ethnonym *Aynu* itself, which is often spelled &lt;Aino&gt; in early European sources. The lack of attestations in (4), especially with the attestations in (2), seems to me to just be an accidental ""gap"" in the recorded words we have of Ainu.

&gt;It's not clear that there's an affix *per se* except maybe historically but I'm not qualified to arbitrate that given my knowledge of the language, so I'd prefer to defer.

There's something there historically (and most people add nouns into this as well as verbs), but it's not exactly clear what it is. In his yet-to-be-published dissertation, José Andrés Alonso de la Fuente proposed that it is some sort of noun class system for nouns. For verbs, it's clear that there's at least the verbal number system going on, and likely something else as well, like a similar sort of classifier system.

&gt;Might I ask what way you work / worked with it?

I've done some corpus work on it.

I'd think you'd be very lucky to get into the US, given your inexperience sponsorship is going to be hard so essentially it boils down to their diversity lottery, which is rather hit or miss.  Especially as it sounds you are still studying / not qualified and your timelines are tight.

Be aware large companies have recruitment + hr departments to manage employment, even as an intern, so there be generic processes / forms (see career sections on websites).  Intern positions here are often hard to get, its usually a case of knowing somebody or being at one of the universities they are doing their recruitment drives / advertising at.  But again, you never know.

I think its best to speak to your university / college and see what contacts they have.  Although they may not properly prepare you there will be loads of people with experience and contacts you can leverage.

I would certainly speak to head of the music departmental and any of the major staff their and describe what you want to achieve.  Also do the same with the business department and yours as well.

Best chance for internship is going to be a contact through the university, otherwise writing to or finding programs at companies is good. Smaller companies then writing to them direct.

No question certain native groups were incredibly brutal and violent, but overall the settlers and later the us government was much more exacting and malicious in their destruction of native people and culture.

One problem labeling the Native American conflict as a genocide is that it went on for almost 200 years. We tend to think 'genocides' as shorter bursts of ethnic violence, I argue that they can be stretched out for much longer.

Early settlers have natives blankets laced with smallpox to kill them off. While yes the many natives didn't rexcongnize land ownership the way Europeans did, the latter tricked them into exclusively giving away land rights th natives had for generations.

We gave them the shittiest land in the world. Seriously, almost every native reserve is located where the US didnt see much use for.

Over 200 years various settling groups  lied to, raped and massacred millions of natives, then 'gave' them the land we didn't want. No one person or group is responsible for this. This was a long and complicated situation that argue should be considered a genocide.

It's happened to native groups all around the world. And it wasn't 'fair war' like many conflicts that had gone down in Europe before then. It was petty greedy, brutal and allowed to happen because Europeans saw these people as less than human. They just didn't care if all of them were wiped off the face of the earth.

Also did you know that many native groups have high instances of alcoholism because many don't have the enzyme that Europeans do for breaking down alcohol? Their bodies literally can't break it down, making them highly susceptible to alcoholism and subsequently death.

I think what you're teacher was trying to illustrate was that the US gov and early settlers betrayed the trust of native groups, brutally massacred them and largely didn't think twice about it. She may be a left winger but just because she argues a point doesn't make that point invalid.

And let's be honest here, why are we even arguing the semantics of systematic ethnic cleansing? Do we really need to clearly define what makes a certain incident more aggregious than another? I don't think so. 'Genocide' gets thrown out a lot these days, often to make a point, which I think is pretty ridiculous, but that shouldn't detract from actual genocides.

,False,t5_2ssp3,"It happened. Fighting and living in Stalin's USSR was not exactly the dreamlife and it is easy to see why some of the Red soldiers would envy the German soldier's life of being well fed, well equipped, well trained and generally well commanded. 

The purges had eliminated a lot of very competent officers from the Red Army that had been replaced by fanatical members of the party that were often not competent and greatly enjoyed the huge all out charges with the communist flag flying high. Keep in mind also that being made prisoner by the enemy could often result in getting sent to gulag when getting back to USSR as the general consensus was that you were supposed to fight to the death for USSR, getting captured therefore meant you had failed your duty. 

You would be exempted from gulag only if you could prove that you were wounded at the time of your capture and that you therefore did not have the physical ability to fight to death.

Another dimension was that red army prisoners were treated basically the same way as the jews, so executed, tortured and worked to death without much food. 

It was therefore easy to see why some of them would be tempted to join special German troops such as the Dirlewanger SS Brigade which recruited basically the lowest of the low (common law criminals, rapists, pedophiles, sociopaths, deserters etc...) to send them to fight the partisans and put terror in the local population.

Desertions in this kind of unit was of course high and mutiny were generally avoided by making sure these guys were drunk most of the time and had a lot of occasions to indulge their sickest perversions on the local populations. 

The Brandenburgers (special forces commandos, specialized in infiltrations and coup de main behind the enemy lines) also recruited some eastern european soldiers but the profile was then very different. They were not looking for thugs and sociopaths like Dirlewanger but for very motivated and professional soldiers that spoke well allied languages for behind the enemy lines commando operations. The Brandenburgers also did not accept fanatical nazis as the soldiers composing this unit would have to be able to fight well alongside soldiers from anywhere, including subhuman races according to the Germans, and be able to pass themselves as enemy soldiers which was not very compatible with political fanatism.

So basically it was not common but it definitly happened.

Only decades before, in the late 1800′s, Europe had been filled with, “human zoos,” in cities like Paris, Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, and Warsaw. New York too saw these popular exhibits continue into the 20th century. There was an average of 200,000 to 300,000 visitors who attended each exhibition in each city.

&gt; Brüno is a gay Austrian fashion guru. He has his own fashion based television show, Funkyzeit, the most popular German-language show of its kind outside of Germany. After he disgraces himself in front of his Funkyzeit fan base, he is ruined in German speaking Europe. He decides that in his quest for worldwide fame, he will move to Los Angeles and reinvent himself. Accompanying him to the US is Lutz, his former assistant's assistant. Lutz is the only person left in his circle that still believes in Brüno's greatness. Brüno goes through one reinvention of himself after another, ultimately straying to areas far removed from his own self. Perhaps when Brüno finds an activity that he truly does love, he will also find that über-fame he so desperately desires.

---

**Critical reception:**

&gt; While Borat was criticised in Kazakhstan, Austrians were generally positive about Brüno. Others regarded the humour as ""pretty average"" and ""inoffensive to Austria."" Within the Austrian press, reactions have been generally mild and positive, although the film has also been labelled as ""repetitive"". Christian Fuchs, from the Austrian radio station FM4, writes that ""hidden beneath the hard-as-nails satirist Cohen, lies a humanist who enlightens."" However, the film has also met some opposition in Austria, due to its portrayal of homosexuality, and basing the portrayal of Austria on motifs such as Josef Fritzl and Hitler, even going as far as calling Mel Gibson ""der Führer"" as he pointed at the actor\/director's photo in the film. (*Wikipedia*)

**Awards:** 1 wins and 4 nominations

It was great for learning the game; But playing any other map makes you realize how much they improved the game in subsequent versions. I wasn't fond of the longer routes in US. It makes it way easier to get blocked out.

Europe is probably the most balanced overall, especially with the mini expansion (doubles the tickets). It also has a mechanic(train stations), which basically allow you to ""piggyback"" on ONE route of another player's; For the purpose of completing a ticket/route. There's also the additions of tunnels and ferries(ask me if you want me to explain them). Overall, I find europe is much more balanced, and more interesting. There's many different routes, so completing tickets(of which there's over 100), is more interesting.

If you play 2 player TTR fairly often, I'd also advise the Nordic countries. It's amazing with 2 players, but has a 3 player max. It also has some of the most(seemingly) complex rules of the TTR franchise.

On the negative side the Europeanisation and development of democracy in Russia will probably take longer now that Putin has skillfully implemented the old trick of a 'sweet and short little conflict' to create a wave of blind nationalism in order to bolster support for the regime, and in the future he can point to Western sanctions as being the reason for why Russia is faring badly.",True,cghajqv,Seefor,Copenhagen,,t3_21wwne,False,0,t3_21wwne,0,DENK,1433161473,t1_cghajqv,0,18,1396358787,18,europe

I have been using a build with Frost Arrow (Admittedly I have 900k sheet dps and about +40% elemental arrow damage) However I find it great fun especially in narrow corridors where it just wrecks everything!

**My skills are:**

* Smoke Screen (Healing Vapors) 
* Vault (Tumble)
* Companion (Wolf) 
* Vengenance (Seethe) .. love that win button!
* Entangling Shot (Justice is Served - 6 hatred gain!) / Ele Arrow (Frost)

**Passives:**

* Cull the Weak
* Archery / Single out (Bosses)
* Night Stalker
* Ambush (Solo) / Steady Aim (Group)

I find it all synergises very well, Cull the weak adds damage to every shot because every shot snares, constant crits, piercing, means you always have plenty of discipline for heals/vaults.

Then popping Veng for that win of constant ele arrow spam, and instant refill of both resources! Give it a go, see how you find it, itll work very well even without great gear because nothing can reach you. If you're stuck for toughness, swap the pet for the boar or archery for perfectionist, both are very powerful defensively as they scale your life and resists by a fixed percentage, perfectionist even lowers the disciple costs!

I come from a small European island with a high rate of unemployment, and I always knew that since my parents had only the money to invest in my education, I would have had to leave, find the good job that did not exist at home and earn everything I wanted. I felt like there was not enough time or little possibility to avoid a life of struggle. One mistake and you're out. Be fast, be precise, be perfect. No time to lose, there are too many people and too few jobs, and you don't have that ""family network"" to rely on.

These books seemed to be about people who had time to waste, in a world that allowed you to waste time and opportunities.

How many Baby Boomers had the opportunity of getting lost for a while, in drugs and trips of various nature, to then be able to go back, get a great paying job and having the world at their feet?

They had time and space to ""rebel"", dropping off college, traveling and doing a bunch of other stuff.

In turn, I was told to graduate fast, amass ""experience"", learn all the languages, never waste time or I would lose the race for ""A JOB"" that would allow me the luxuries of a house, a family, maybe a pet.

Of course I could not understand Kerouac.

In time, I learned to appreciate the change it brought, and also...the poetry of getting lost. I did make some mistakes, and I got back on my feet. I discovered that sometimes ""wasting time"" serves you good in understanding what you want and finding motivation. Probably, also WHO you are, which I think was Kerouac's point. γνῶθι σεαυτόν, ""know thyself"", is the biggest favour you can do to yourself and your journey to wisdom, happiness and a more fulfilling life.

I still find his characters insufferable, but I understand them better, and I appreciate their experiences.

I did not ""want"" to get lost, but I am better because of it, despite of it. 

In the end, I made peace with old Jack, and instead of telling him to ""Get a job you moron!"", I'd like to share a nice bonfire, a guitar and a joint with him, asking him to tell me what he's been up to these days.

Well, there is still competition for mating partners and resources, but it is mostly human created, rather than from the natural world (in most places, and at this point in history).

Another thing that is causing the species to evolve is the increased variety of groups of mating partners available now, who wouldn't have been available to most people 2-300 years ago. Keeping in mind that evolution happens ofer many hundreds and thousands of generations, that's a blink of the eye in comparison)

Think about interbreeding between native American and African bloodlines, for example. Or Asian and northern European. Only a few hundred years ago that wouldn't have been able to happen on a large scale, but now that almost anyone can travel anywhere on the planet, it is becoming the new normal. 

That will introduce new mixes of traits into succeeding generations. Who knows, maybe some of those will be more resistant to certain congenital illnesses? (and conversely, some will be more susceptible, and won't pass on their genes)

Other pressures on mating are societal. Those change very quickly relative to evolutionary time scales, though. But they might have some effects?

,False,t5_2qhfj,"Short Answer: because they want it to be (in this day and age, devaluing or valuing your currency (if you are a developed nation) is ""relatively"" simple.

Long Answer: If you take a look at the UK and compare it to the other major developed nations and their currencies, it (mostly) makes sense. For example: The UK is as of 2012 #6 in the world in GDP behind only the US (USD), China (CNY), Japan (JPY), Germany (EUR), and France (EUR). Now let's look at some other stats. In terms of national debt as a percentage of GDP, the UK has a debt to GDP ratio of 83%, compared to  the US' 88%, Germany's 57%, France's 84%, and Japan's whopping 134%. China has a net surplus at the moment so their's would be negative. The UK fares better than everyone in that group except for Germany and China. Here is the kicker, China fixes it's currency, and if was able to float, it would be significantly higher valued, so we can't really compare them. Germany is part of the EU and uses the EUR. If Germany was still using marks then it would be expected that their currency would be more valuable than the EUR is today, as there are lots of countries in the EU which are weighing down Germany and France. (If France was still using francs then it would most likely also be worth more than the EUR, but probably not as much as the mark). In conclusion, and this is only a small part of the currency equation, the UK has a large GDP (especially for it's size), and a good debt to gdp rate (compared to other very developed nations).",True,cghb5zk,AB1125,,,t3_21wxq1,False,0,t3_21wxq1,0,,1433161763,t1_cghb5zk,0,-7,1396360693,-7,finance

Julia Wong over at The Nation recently published an article questioning the validity of the movement criticizing Park.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that Wong sides with Park, but she is definitely sympathetic in some sense.  Here is the crux of her criticism:

&gt;We have been told that, even if Colbert’s joke hurt the feelings of some Asian Americans, it was all in furtherance of a greater good—the education of people within his audience who did not realize that the name “Redskins” is an offensive slur until it was compared to anti-Asian slurs. This narrative strikes me as particularly specious. It rests on weighing the education of a group of people who have been hypothesized into existence as more important than the experience of a group of people who are actually speaking out to express their discomfort. If any journalist wants to present evidence of a single person who was moved to change their opinion of Dan Snyder by Colbert’s routine, then perhaps we can assign it a social value. I’ve yet to see any such evidence, and while I would never deny that Colbert’s performances are entertaining, there’s a difference between entertainment and enlightenment.

&gt;We have been told that Colbert’s joke was aimed at the abhorrent racism of the name of the Washington football team, and that bringing up the question of racism aimed at Asian Americans is a distraction that will hurt the cause of Native Americans. This is a charge that would be easier to swallow were it not that so many of the writers putting forward this argument have never written about changing the name of the team themselves. Park and many of her fellow #CancelColbert tweeters have a history of engaging in Twitter activism against the team’s name alongside Native American activists: See #NotYourMascot as one example. Meanwhile, the idea that Colbert is more valuable to the fight against racism than people of color who are engaging in anti-racist activism on their own terms comes perilously close to a white savior argument that deserves serious scrutiny.

&gt;[Source](http://www.thenation.com/blog/179084/whos-afraid-suey-park#)

I think this cuts to the heart of the matter, really.  The issue at hand, at least, is not Park as a person or what she had to say.  I don't think this response is very good, but to be honest I think this is much better than the reaction to Park.

The argument is twofold.  The first is an assessment of the validity of the argument based on whether or not it is justifiable to offend some in the defense of the ""greater cause,"" in this case the Redskins' name and Snyder's actions.  My biggest disagreement is that the argument is based on assessing a ""hypothesized"" group of people against real people who have been actually offended.  The biggest problem that I have with identity politics (for the most part) is that it equates offense with oppression.  The two seem almost inseparable in the dialogue.  Were this not the case, Wong would have to provide some connection between the two, but she does not because they are the same to her.

There is a massive problem with this.  Anyone that is a student of feminist or racial studies should already be aware of the fact that sexist and racist institutions/policies/actions/etc. in many cases have been tolerated by their victims, if not accepted and even advocated.  In 1700's-1800's Europe most women accepted and advocated the idea of a woman's ""proper place"".  Mary Wollstonecraft famously derided most women for this in her seminal work *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman*.  Does this acceptance - this lack of offense - translate into a lack of oppression?  Certainly not.  Then how can we claim the opposite is true - that offense necessarily translates into oppression?  If a victim of oppression can be unoffended - even an advocate of said oppression - is it not also the case that someone who is not a victim can be offended yet not oppressed?

Now, I'm not saying that Park or other Asians/women don't experience oppression, or that institutionalized sexism/racism does not exist.  But Wong's argument does not address the legitimacy of those offended, so it isn't necessary for me to address in formulating a rebuttal.

The second argument Wong makes is regarding the notion of who has the proper credentials in the debate.  It's perilously close to an ad hominem.  I think that Park, Wong and Colbert can at least all agree that Snyder's actions are abhorrent, and that they're on the same side of the debate with regards to the Redskins.  Questioning whether or not Park's critics have been involved in the criticism of the Redskins name is, in my opinion, irrelevant to this discussion outside of the implicit narrative that Wong is trying to paint, but which she only tangentially touches on.

Wong's assertion is that Park's critics are on the offensive because of a structural anti-asian/woman stance, and that most of these people are promulgating this stance in their actions.  I think this has some merit but only in a very general sense.  It is certainly true that these institutional perspectives exist and are internalized and expressed in this debate to an extent, but it is also true that Park is acting like an idiot and deserves to be called out for it.  Just like Wong is incapable of separating oppression from offense, she is also incapable of separating the ideas of institutionalized sexism/racism in this debacle from people just plain calling Park out for being a moron.

It depends, the general outlook is of course that things that come from Europe or America are Western. However, the roots of what is Western go back to ancient Greece, and some other civilisations also have links to Greek and Roman antiquity. The definition of Westernisation differs from one person to another.

As to the relation between the Islamic world and the West, this is a very interesting one because the general non-academic view is that of a dichotomy between the West (Europe, USA etc.) and Islam. However, Christianity which is commonly referred to as part of the Western tradition essentially shares the same roots with Islam. This has led some scholars (Olivier Roy for example) to conclude that Islam is a Western religion: it has connections to Western antiquity, recognises Christian philosophy, is open to technological advances, and is very compatible with Western politics which is why we have Islamic states, Islamic parties, alliances between Islamic scholars and Socialists throughout the 20th century,  Islamofascists like the Taliban, and of course millions of Muslims who live happy lives in Western countries. After all, the European renaissance only came about because Europeans got their hands on ancient texts which were previously in the possession of the Caliphate. Furthermore, historically the greatest clashes keep occurring not between Europe and the Middle East, but rather between the Middle East and South Asia. This suggests that the Islamic world is not antithetical to the West, but rather an extension of it.

&gt;

&gt;An __armoured personnel carrier__ (__APC__) is type of [armoured fighting vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle) designed to transport [infantry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry) to the battlefield. APCs are colloquially referred to as 'battle taxis' or 'battle buses', among other things.

&gt;APCs differs from other [AFVs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle), namely [infantry fighting vehicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_fighting_vehicles), due to the weaponry they carry. The [Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Conventional_Armed_Forces_in_Europe) defines Armoured personnel carriers as *""an armoured combat vehicle which is designed and equipped to transport a combat infantry squad and which, as a rule, is armed with an integral or organic weapon of less than 20 millimeters calibre.""*

&gt;By convention they are not intended to take part in a direct-fire battle, but to provide additional protection from [shrapnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell) and [small arms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_arms) fire. Examples include the American [M113](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M113_armored_personnel_carrier), the French [VAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9hicule_de_l%27Avant_Blind%C3%A9), the [Dutch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Netherlands)/German [GTK Boxer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_MRAV) and the Soviet [BTR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTR_(vehicle\)).

Possibly the most shocking revelation was made on February 24, 2014. Internal documents show that the security state is attempting to manipulate and control online discourse with “extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction.” The documents revealed a top-secret unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Unit, or JTRIG. Two of the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in an effort to discredit a target, and to use social sciences such as psychology to manipulate online discourse and activism in order to generate a desirable outcome. The unit posts false information on the internet and falsely attributes it to someone else, pretend to be a 'victim' of a target they want to discredit, and posts negative information on various forums. In some instances, to discredit a target, JTRIG sends out 'false flag' emails to family and friends.

Now, consider the words of former NSA employee turned whistleblower Russ Tice:


&gt; “Okay. They went after–and I know this because I had my hands literally on the paperwork for these sort of things–they went after high-ranking military officers; they went after members of Congress, both Senate and the House, especially on the intelligence committees and on the armed services committees and some of the–and judicial.

&gt; But they went after other ones, too. They went after lawyers and law firms. All kinds of–heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. One of the judges is now sitting on the Supreme Court that I had his wiretap information in my hand. Two are former FISA court judges. They went after State Department officials.

&gt; They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House–their own people. They went after antiwar groups. They went after U.S. international–U.S. companies that that do international business, you know, business around the world. They went after U.S. banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs that–like the Red Cross, people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few antiwar civil rights groups.

&gt; So, you know, don’t tell me that there’s no abuse, because I’ve had this stuff in my hand and looked at it. And in some cases, I literally was involved in the technology that was going after this stuff. And you know, when I said to [former MSNBC show host Keith] Olbermann, I said, my particular thing is high tech and you know, what’s going on is the other thing, which is the dragnet. The dragnet is what Mark Klein is talking about, the terrestrial dragnet. Well my specialty is outer space. I deal with satellites, and everything that goes in and out of space. I did my spying via space. So that’s how I found out about this... And remember we talked about that before, that I was worried that the intelligence community now has sway over what is going on.

&gt; Now here’s the big one. I haven’t given you any names. This was is summer of 2004. One of the papers that I held in my hand was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated with, with a 40-something-year-old wannabe senator from Illinois. You wouldn’t happen to know where that guy lives right now, would you? It’s a big white house in Washington, DC. That’s who they went after. And that’s the president of the United States now.” Russ Tice, NSA Whistleblower

Who didn't? Your sentence has no subject. Are you being glib, or just can't write the full sentence in good conscience?

Just so you start to understand, I'll reiterate the fact that Russia stole Crimea, along with a bunch of Ukrainian public and private property.

&gt; Holy shit, it's called a competitive advantage. Learn economics and stop thinking Russia is only doing this shit for politics.

Perhaps you should study the political situation, drop the assumption that Russia is a perfectly rational actor (modern economists are gradually coming to terms with the incorrectness of this assumption), and please try to learn to analyze situations by looking beyond your very narrow, myopic frame of reference of basic economics. You sound like some sad college business major that can only refer to things he learned in the last couple of months, and is unable to comprehend the big picture or incorporate disparate facts into a coherent scenario. 

&gt; Should Russia ask for the 200-250 billions dollars back?

Why would Ukraine owe them any money? They were paying rates upon which they agreed with Russia. I already explained to you why certain agreements should not be broken, but do I also have to explain to you that when something has been purchased, the retailer can't show up at your house and say, ""hey, sorry, I should have charged you more for that.""

&gt; What would you consider to be a reasonable price for Russian gas. Oh and Ukraine isn't a very reliable customer.

The determination of a ""reasonable price"" is very subjective, and my opinion wouldn't mean much, and neither would yours. What I do know is that Russia, in the past, and at present, has used its economic advantages for political manipulation. For example, last week, they arbitrarily closed down the Russian factories and bank accounts of Poroshenko, who is Ukraine's leading presidential contender, and very pro-EU. I also know that part of Ukraine's unreliability has been due to Russian interference in Ukraine's political and economic circumstances.

See where I am going with this? The phrase is from a poem called ""The New Colossus"" which reads:

""Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

With silent lips. ""Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

When you outlaw something, you don't make the problem go away, it just go's underground...it's called THE BLACK MARKET. I can speak from experience, 27 years ago I had four scum bags break into my home in which I, along with my wife and two young daughters were at home. Two of the individuals where escapees from a correctional facility. In the chaos that followed I managed to shoot Three of them, killing one, and one got away who was caught a couple miles away. As it turned out, the one who I killed was in prison for breaking into a home, tying the family up. Then raping the wife and the oldest daughter. After that he had butchered the entire family with a butcher knife. Maybe we should ban butcher knifes...Sounds crazy huh. The point is that had I not had that shotgun gun, I or my family would be here today. What's worse is that had I not been there, my wife and daughters would not be alive today. You think that banning guns will make all our problems go away, but it won't. Man has been committing atrocities against each other since the dawn of time, way before black powder was even invented. And for those of you who seems to think that Europe has no gun violence, again your showing your ignorance, gun violence has been going up in the last decade. In London, all though the bobbies don't carry guns. They do have police that do have guns, because gun violence is on the rise.In Norway, you had the idiot who not only built a bomb and blew up the downtown area, but murdered 80+ teenagers, not with an assault weapon, but with a shotgun, and a couple of hand guns. In Germany gun laws are very strict, remember when Hitler came into power, the fist thing he did was force everyone to Register their guns, after that he took everyones guns away, and yet In the last decade, they have had there version of the Columbine school shooting, and have had a number of work place shootings. People are so spoiled and take so much for granted that you don't know what freedom is until you have lost your freedom. And it's only then will you realize what freedom is.

So as most people will be aware of here, a leaked audio recording of various high level Turkish officials reveals they were discussing the implementation of an attack on themselves to start off a war in Syria which could possibly invoke [article 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty#Article_Four) or [article 5 of NATO.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty#Article_Five) Why nobody from some of the most 'trusted' and often cited media sources failed to mention why it was clearly talk of a false flag is telling. Notice the wording in each article.

Here is the leaked audio converted to a transcript...

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/turkey-youtube-ban-full-transcript-leaked-syria-war-conversation-between-erdogan-officials-1442161

&gt;Hakan Fidan:
""I'll send 4 men from Syria, if that's what it takes. I'll make up a cause of war by ordering a missile attack on Turkey; we can also prepare an attack on Suleiman Shah Tomb if necessary.""

This is obviously the most damning part amongst other high level corruption which proves beyond doubt that a false flag attack was a consideration.

The next part of the post is the absolutely incredible wording (or the lack of wording) from some of the most 'trusted' and widely used media sources from the US and UK.

At least USA Today made it clear that it was going to be a false flag, I guess the writer didn't get the memo.

[The Guardian - The move by the TIB came hours after an anonymous YouTube account posted a leaked audio recording allegedly of a confidential conversation between Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu, undersecretary of the foreign ministry Feridun Sinirlioglu and deputy chief of the general staff, Yasar Gürel, discussing possible military action in Syria.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/google-youtube-ban-turkey-erdogan)

[Sky News - Thursday's recording purports to be of senior Turkish government, military and spy officials discussing a military intervention in neighbouring Syria - a hugely contentious issue in Turkey. The officials allegedly debate plans to stage an armed clash in Syria or a missile attack that would serve as justification for intervention. The context of the conversation is not clear.](http://news.sky.com/story/1233171/turkey-youtube-hit-by-internet-restrictions)

Context not clear Sky News?


There's an obvious trend barring USA Today and that is all of them do not once mention the attacks would come from Turkey themselves or completely ignore it and frame the article around high level discussions or corruption.

,False,t5_2scl4,"&gt; Didn't the Norse abstain from using cavalry because they thought of it as cowardly?

Not really. Their successors, the Normans, adapted to fighting on horseback well enough, and horses were not unknown amongst the Norse; there are many grave sites from Denmark, Sweden and other places throughout the 8th-10th centuries where grave goods included spurs, stirrups and other equine accessories. In fact, it is mostly from these graves that we get our knowledge of the spread of stirrup technologies through Scandinavia. The first reason the Norse used few cavalry is fairly obvious; you can't get that many horses on a longboat. William the Conquerors flagship *Mora* carried ten knights, their horses and equipment, and only had to get them across the English channel. Most of the longships used in earlier military expeditions would have been expected to traverse much rougher seas, and it was generally thought more expedient to carry 40+ warrior-sailors. The Norse often stole horses when they were trying to get somewhere quickly, but a horse that's not trained for combat is useless on the battlefield. Most horses wouldn't go anywhere near a formation of armed man if you whipped them half to death. It was pretty much the norm in Europe in the early medieval period to use horses strategically, to get to battlefields and outmanoeuvre the enemy, rather than tactically as a battlefield weapon. Even the Normans didn't really use cavalry the way we would expect a knight to; they were mostly used for skirmishing rather than heavy impact warfare. Which brings us to the other factor, the horses available. [Have you seen Scandinavian horses](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg)? They are not exactly what you'd look for in a combat mount; they're hardy and they don't take any shit, sure, but they're not really very big; in fact they're normally a size which would see them classified as a pony, and they were probably (like most North European livestock) rather smaller in the early middle ages. The very biggest modern Icelandic horses are about the size of the smallest horses used for combat in the later medieval period, and nowhere near as heavily muscled. The Normans had access to much larger horses (Norman horses were famed throughout Europe in the 10th century) that had been bred with larger breeds from Spain and Italy going back to the late Roman period.

,1396364843,t5_2ssp3,"A lot of it was the result of foreign influence from Western Europe. The British intervention in Greece had a desire to restore the home of the philosophers who founded Western Civilization. They extrapolated the history of Ottoman-occupied Greece to the Classical Age. This was in many ways a result of the virulent neo-classicism present in late 18th to early 19th century Europe, which sought to emulate old, Republican Rome and not Imperial Rome. In this mindset, Greece was considered the land of thinkers and philosophers, and not the place where the Roman Empire survived for an additional thousand years.

Initially, Greeks actually sought to restore the Roman Empire, as exemplified by early independence organizations like the Filiki Eteria. Additionally, Constantine XI was used as a sort of martyr figure by revolutionaries, who sought to restore continuity between their efforts and Rome Indeed, some vestiges of later Rome are entirely visible in the Greek Kingdom, one need only look to the unofficial numbering of their Constantines (XII and XIII). Furthermore, the Megali Idea, although adopting many Panhellenic ideals, was in many ways a Roman idea, with its main objective being the retaking of Constantinople as its capital, not Athens. Upon the birth of the first, Greek-born prince (later king), the people supposedly demanded he be called Constantine XII, as he would be destined to retake Constantinople. Eventually, they settled on officially calling him Constantine I. Still, many actually believed him to be the reappearance of Constantine XI Palaeologus, who never died and was merely waiting to be reawakened.

EDIT: I must make a distinction between the popular narrative and the political history of Constantine I's reign. The Megali Idea was actually propagated by radical Greek nationalists and republicans who sent the king into exile.",True,cghcikf,TyroneFreeman,,,t3_21wt4m,False,0,t3_21wt4m,0,,1433162400,t1_cghcikf,0,40,1396364355,40,AskHistorians

,False,t5_2qh1i,"Sorry I'm a bit late to the party here...

Some of these are complete no-brainers, but not everyone's been on an airplane before. So just skip over the ones that seem a bit too obvious.

Transit:

- Don't overpack. For weekend trips you can usually get by with just a carry-on. If it's longer than that, check a bag

- Get an aisle seat if possible. Makes it very easy to stretch your legs if you need to and you have much easier access to the restrooms

- If your flight has connections, make sure that they're with the same airline. If they're with different airlines, they'll usually be in separate terminals meaning that you have to go through security while trying to make your connection.

- Give yourself lots of time in airports - especially for connecting flights. If your flight gets delayed, it's very easy to miss your connection and be stuck somewhere for an extra 4-12 hours. It's much better to book your flights with a few hours between so that you have enough time. If something gets delayed, you don't have to rush. If nothing is delayed, you've got extra time to kill.

- If you do get stuck with shitty connection timing (30 minutes between landing/takeoff), ask your ticket agent to move your seat closer to the front of the plane so that you can get off faster when you land. They're always willing to do this if you ask about it early.

- If you take a cab, tell them your flight is 30-45 minutes earlier than it ACTUALLY is. Airport cab drivers know that most people don't know the layout of the town they're in, so they'll drive slower or take bad routes so that they can charge you more. If you tell them you're in a serious hurry and that you flight takes off very soon, they'll rush you hoping that they can get a better tip out of you.

- If you rented a car, pre-paid the fuel, had to refuel, and now you're returning it: they will say that you can get reimbursed for the gas you bought. However, in order to do this you have to go stand in line with all the schmucks who are renting cars. These lines can be SLOW. If you had to refuel your rental car and you want your cash refund, get there early! I missed a flight out of denver because of this and ended up spending 6 extra hours at an airport bar waiting for my NEW flight.

- On most flights, there's LOTS of stuff that you can request for free - you just need to ask: playing cards, the WHOLE can of soda, extra snacks/beverages, blankets (yes, you can keep the blankets), headphones, etc

- Do NOT get a seat that is directly in front of an exit row. It might sound like a cool idea because ""nobody will be kicking the back of my seat"" but what it really means is ""I can't recline my seat."" That's right, seats in front of exit rows do not recline for safety reasons. If you don't mind not being able to recline, you can usually save a few bucks by choosing this seat.

- All airplanes have a copy of Hemisphere Magazine in the back pocket of the seat in front of you. Find the airport that you're going to arrive at in the way back of the magazine and take a look at the map. This will save you from having to read a million signs when you touch down to figure out where you're going

- If you have a connecting flight, you can ask an attendant where your connecting gate is and they'll be able to look it up for you.

- If you have priority boarding or first class, everyone will glare at you as you get on the plane first.

- Kind of obvious, but EVERYTHING in an airport costs at least 3x what it does outside the airport. Buy yourself some clif bars before going to the airport instead of buying the 10 dollar chicken caesar sandwich in the airport terminal.

- Airplanes are drying. The air they pump in is filtered but it's very dry. Keep a tube of moisturizer with you and don't drink alcohol on the plane.

Hotels:

- As some of the hotel managers have mentioned on other /r/AskReddit threads: if you pay full price for your room and *book directly with the hotel* they will treat you like royalty. You'll get free upgrades if you ask for them, they'll go out of their way to give you discounts over other people, and you'll get preferential treatment most of the time. You paid full price, those schmucks who used hotels.com are paying the hotel less AND the hotel has to give hotels.com a commission.

- Let the concierge do the work for you. If you need a taxi, restaurant reservations, directions somewhere, boarding passes printed, or just about anything else - ask them.

- Be nice! Hotel workers can make or ruin your day. If you're stressed out, angry, annoyed, and tired from your journey, don't take it out on the staff. If you're nice to them, they'll be excellent to you.

- Hotels near an airport are going to be either expensive and nice or cheap and crappy. If you don't mind traveling a bit farther to get to the hotel, you can have both a nice AND cheap hotel. Just be aware of how long it'll take to get BACK to the airport when it's time to leave.

Bags/Packing:

- All airlines will restrict you to a certain weight per bag (usually 50lbs). If you're a premium member for that airline (gold, elite, etc) they'll increase the baggage weight for you (usually to 70lbs). Keep in mind that this weight is PER BAG. If you have one bag that's 80 lbs and another that's nearly empty at 10lbs, rotate some stuff around so that they're each 45 lbs. An overweight bag fee can be 100 dollars or more.

- If you still can't get your bag under a certain weight, try removing some of the items and storing them in your carry-on. Jeans weigh a lot more than you might think. Don't take any unnecessary bottles (shampoo, mouthwash, etc) that you don't need to. If you can buy it at your destination, do it. Remember your hotel will have shampoo and soap for you for free. You can also re-bottle your own shampoo in travel-sized containers available at most drug stores.

- Most people who travel for vacation bring too much ""entertainment"" with them. They'll bring laptops, books, tablets, mp3 players, portable dvd players, and all kinds of extra junk - then they end up watching the in-flight movie the entire trip without touching their own entertainment.

- Vacuum bags are wonderful because they help keep your clothes organized and compact. Just make sure you don't pack too tightly - if you have to open your bag at security, it will be a lot harder to make everything fit.

- Travel with TWO wallets. Put a spare/emergency credit card and cash in one (along with a secondary form of ID or a photocopy of your passport), keep your primary cash and credit card in the other (along with your primary form of ID). Pack them separately. Put one in your checked bag and one in your carry-on or on your person. This way if you ever lose one (pick pocketed, lost luggage, etc), you'll always have the other.

- Keep a list of the your credit cards: last 4 digits of the card, type of card, and the 1-800 number on the back. Make a copy and give it to a travel companion or put it in each of your bags. If you DO lose your wallet or card, you can call the 800 number and cancel it right away.

- Tell your bank that you're traveling abroad. They may monitor your account for unusual activity and may block you from using the card until you call them and verify that it's not fraud.

Random Tips:

- If you're in a touristy area you will be hassled on the street by street vendors and beggars. If you think you might buy something or give them some of your money, keep a separate cache of bills in your front pocket for this purpose. The instant you pull out your wallet, they can see how much money you have and they WILL try every trick in the book to get more cash out of you. If you just pull out a single bill from your pocket, they can't tell what you do or don't have. If you don't want to give them anything, tell them you only carry plastic (credit).

- Look up local customs (if international) so that you don't act like an asshole on accident. Don't cut in line in england, don't walk in the bicycle lane in europe, and don't talk about Nazis in germany. Simple stuff

- Check local prices before you go so that you know about how much money to bring and set aside.

- Bring extra cash. However much you plan on bringing, bring an extra 20% for touristy gifts, airport food, unexpected purchases, etc. Always be prepared!

- Get an extended life phone battery. They make them for just about every phone nowadays. I got mine on amazon for 25 bucks and it more than doubles the life of my Galaxy S3 - even with heavy use.

- For international travel, pick up a SIM card which will work in that country. Make sure your phone is geographically unlocked also! You may have to contact your provider ahead of time to make sure. Otherwise, pick up a cheap burner phone and use that.",True,cghcm3o,AdequateSteve,,,t3_21uc8d,False,0,t3_21uc8d,0,,1433162446,t1_cghcm3o,0,1,1396364599,1,AskReddit

Also, Vader didn't really lose speed. He might not have been quite as agile, but he's still faster and stronger than most. In the comic *Darth Vader and the Ninth Assassin*, Vader is shown as being agile enough to do somersaults while navigating a forest, and in one of the *Coruscant Nights* books, I want to say the third one, Aurra Sing attacks him and he moves fast enough that he dodges her effortlessly - and she's very, very fast.

There's actually nothing official that says Vader can't use Force lightning, either.

,False,t5_2qh1i,"Thanks for making a strawman out of me again, this time implying I'm xenophobic. Charming debating tactic. I've never said nor implied the things you make me out to say.

Seeing as both Europe and America attract non-Western people, your point about America being exceptionally diverse because you have immigrants becomes void. This is the point I was trying to make. 



America has 317,791,000 people living there.
The European Union alone has over 502,519,900 people. As you might be aware, this is not all of Europe. A conservative estimation would make the total number of people more than twice the population of America. 

In addition, Europe is way more divided by barriers of all kind; within countries there are socio-economic barriers, groups of similar ethnic backgrounds, etc. This is similar to the United states. Both Europe also has barriers in state and language the US does not. In additon, Europe has more barriers concerning history, simply because America is relatively new. 

Bottom line: Europe has about twice as much people as the USA. Europe has more barriers between those people when compared to the USA. This means Europe is fractured. More people + more social barriers equals Europe is more culturally diverse.

Are you still seriously going to argue that America is as culturally diverse as Europe? For this to be the case, factors that  promote diversity are more than half as active in Europe, or, they would have to be twice as effective in America. This would require exceptional circumstances  in either/both America and Europe, and you have failed to provide any evidence as to what these circumstance are. 


Very classy though to split hairs on usage of the English language, as you've probably guessed I'm not a native English speaker. Very classy to accuse me of xenophobia as well.

It was so important that the founders considered the ability to bear arms to be a fundamental human right, and wrote in the supreme law of the land that this right is not to be infringed. 

Concerning why Americans feel the way they do about gun control, there isn't that much evidence to show that it works. Yes, Europe has fewer school shootings, but it also has fewer guns and gun owners because of the lack of gun culture, so it is to be expected.  In America, the rate of murders and mass shootings has been steadily declining since the 90s, when ""assault weapons"" and handguns were made legal in most states and the rate of firearm ownership has steadily increased.  Correlation doesn't prove causation, so we don't know if the murder rate went down *because* of the increase increase in firearms ownership, but the lack of correlation disproves causation: gun control went down, and so did the murder rate, so you cannot argue that the lack of gun control causes more deaths.

I knew a lose would be just a day off at the office and nothing more, so by the time the next match came around it would a win, no matter who they were.

The man built United, he made it what is it today and it wasn't for him then many of the fans would not be here today, which is why I find it so upsetting when I see him criticised like he has been by some fans and sections of the media, Moyes upset me when he said Fergie would struggle with this lot, when I know deep down it would upset Fergie in some way, he had some much faith in his players - no matter what!

I don't mean to turn this into a Moyes bashing thread, but to say the club Fergie took over is the same as the one Moyes did is beyond silly. Fergie took over a club that hasn't won the league in years, a club that was in a complete mess - one where the players would be drunk half the time. We weren't producing players through the youth system, we didn't have world class players ready to play, a strong squad and a lot spending money if needed. 

But, I digress - it doesn't matter what Moyes said when he took over, one man came in a winner, came here with a clear vision from the start and had no fear from anyone. People like SAF come once in a lifetime - it's pointless to compare him to anyone, let alone Moyes. Moyes should be given the chance to do things his own away, which he has done thus far, but he needs to remain true to the club and its traditions, which he has failed to do so far in some ways. Just ask Giggs, Scholes or Neville.

Anyway, I don't remember what my point was but I don't feel Moyes and Fergie compare at all - Fergie took down the 2 biggest clubs in Scotland and he took on Madrid in European final and beat them - Moyes has never gotten close to anything like that. Today is his biggest challenge. The players will be up for it, the fans will be on fire and they will not stopping pushing the team on for one second - it's up to Moyes to get things right and fire us past Bayern. 

What I'm saying is that Moyes should not be compared to Fergie, it isn't fair to both - Moyes said in his first PC here that he wasn't going to better Fergie - he even knows it. We need to accept him for who is and not wish him to be another Fergie, because, frankly speaking, there will never another manager like him - never!

,False,t5_2ssp3,"This is a complicated matter but since your questions is 11 hours old and you got no replies i will at least try to give some insight.

The causes of World War are now believed to be more inconclusive than spread at this time. All major powers share some blame for World War 1. The correct ""distribution of blame"" is up to debate of course. But

* The middle powers were declared the sole reason for the outbreak of WWI

* The Treaty of Versailles in retroperspective was badly designed and pretty much enabled what happened later

Some examples:

* Germany lost a good amount of territory--&gt; unhappy people in this areas obviously. Resettelment harms the economy.

* Germanys military capabilities were restricted. Telling a proud and strong country like Germany what it can have and what not will create tension and hatred for sure. On the other hand the restrictions failed in the long run as we have seen when the Wehrmacht marched all over Europe despite the allied ( particulary France ) plan to prevent a future German aggression. So this part of the treaty was pretty much a fail-fail. Not even sure if its possible to restrict one of the strongest countries ( in terms of economy, population, science ) in that way. The French desire for safety of German aggression was understandable after what the French people had to suffer during the war, fighting and destruction happened primarily on French soil, casualties against German armies were huge and had lasting impact. But the approach was the wrong one. They tried to ""cripple"" Germany in a way it was never able again to raise an army like they did during World War 1 and the France-Prussian war. 

* Reparations. Germany had to pay a huge amount of reparations. These reparations hindered the German economy and the rebuilding effort. Add the population which had to be resetteled and all the other problems you get economical collapse. Here we have to question the intentions of the Victors. Obviously you want to trade again with Germany and start a new friendly realtionship which will ensure longterm peace. But damaging the economy doesn't help. Like all the other mistakes this fueled resentment and even hatred. Also the fact that obviously outside influence enhanced German domestic problems made it very easy to blame others and fuel hate. ""France is at fault"", ""Great Britain is at fault"" ""the Jews are at fault"". 

* There are more points but iam no expert on this topic and just want to give some input.

Overlooked military situation at the end of WWI.

In contrast to World War II, German armies were not destroyed at the time of surrender. With the USA entering the war, the German defeat was unevitable the odds were to high at this point, but it should be noted the german armies were functioning and still ""outfighting"" the entente thus inflicting heavy casualties while retreating. During 1918 the entente suffered more than 2 million casualties fighting German armies. When the 
Germans decided to surrender they also at least partially factored in the strong possibility to get acceptable conditions. The Treaty of Versailles eventually disappointed. Obviously it felt unfair to the germans to suffer so many ""punishment"" for a war which was the result of many political failures on all side and thurst for power on all sides. People than obviously asked ""Why did our armies lay down their weapons if we get treated in that way"" this helped to propagate the ""Dolchstoßlegende"".

What could be the summary of this situation? ""Punishment"" was obvioulsy the wrong choice. Making a strong country like Germany the scapegoat and interfering with domestic matters in such a way enhanced the already serve problems of Germany and created enemies in the eyes of German people. This eventually was the breeding ground for facsim. It was rather easy for them from this point on:

* ""Look how the punish us despite our strong armies laying down their weapons to end the blood shed""

* ""They make us pay thats why you the people are poor""

* ""They took our land. They took what rightfully was ours""

Well hinsight is 20/20 of course. What could have be done better? After a war it seems to be the correct approach to talk and fuse together what was ripped apart during war. Establishing new friendship, bonding the economies and helping each other to rebuild what was destroyed. The aftermath of WWII showed us what could have been done after World War 1. Germany for example now is a strong economy with peaceful intentions and generally a good impact on humanity as a whole. Same goes for Japan. The aftermath of WW1 was the opposite it drove a wedge between the peoples and created resentment all over the place.

,False,t5_2ssp3,"The British (as well as the French and other allies) had a lot to do with it during the Greek revolution. As the Greeks revolted, the western nations aided them in their revolution and after the revolution was successful, they helped Greece rebuild.

Before they completely fell to the Turks, the capital was Constantinople, and then eventually Mystras as the empire collapsed. During the revolution the capital was located in Corinth, and after the revolution, they relocated the capital to Athens.

Part of this relocation to Athens (which was a farming village by that point) was part of a redefinition of Greek identity to how western europe saw Greece, rather than how the Greeks saw themselves.

So they ended up completely designing Athens after western neoclassical style of urban planning. The Acropolis itself had many buildings on it, dating obviously from the classical era, to the Roman Empire, to the 19th Century. The western nations in helping to rebuild and redefine Greece, had all buildings on the Acropolis completely levelled except for the classical ones, so what you see today is, at least according to their narrative, what it would have looked like several thousand years ago in classical Greece.

In fact, even in the reconstruction of Orthodox Churches, a lot of them were rebuilt according to western architectural styles at the time rather than according to the Byzantine styles.

This whole redefinition continued, even as the Greeks wanted to restore the Roman Empire. When the Russians fought the west and the Turkish Empire during the Crimean War, the Russians felt it was their duty to protect all Orthodox people and to aid all Orthodox people in revolutions against the Turks. The West wanted to contain Russia, and in the end, defeated Russia. Greece actually wanted to help Russia during the conflict and wanted to gain more territory from the Turks, but its western allies prevented it from participating.

Prior to World War I, Greece went to war against Turkey yet again, and advanced within just a few miles of Constantinople, had gained Smyrna and a large portion of the western coast of Turkey. Unfortunately a few military blunders led to them being pushed back to the coast when they neared Ancyra (Ankara). Eventually the western nations forced Greece to sign a treaty which required it to give back a lot of the territory it had gained, and they also forced Greece and Turkey to exchange populations, with Turkey sending the Greek Orthodox (except a few in Constantinople) to Greece, and Greece sending the Muslims to Turkey.

This was considered a national distaster for Greece. It almost completely destroyed any hope the Greeks had for regaining the territory lost when the Roman Empire fell.

Ever since then, and with the rise of the Olympics, the redefinition of Greek identity continued and many Greeks today see themselves more as ""westerners"" than people of the east.

To a degree, they still identify with their ancestors in the Roman Empire, and still identify with their Orthodox neighbors. During the recent conflicts over Yugoslavia, many Greeks actually travelled to Serbia to help Serbia fight against the Muslim populations.

What is called the ""Great Idea"" of recapturing territory lost 500 years ago is still somewhat alive. Many young Greeks don't really care and are mostly focused on their current political movements, finding gainful employment etc... In fact, many end up travelling to western countries like the UK to get employment or to be educated.

A lot of the older population of Greece still (somewhat) hold on to that idea though. And for the religious people of Greece, there are some prominent and popular prophecies by highly respected, venerated monastic elders in Greece that started 300 years ago and the most recent date to the late 1980s. Those prophecies basically predict that the territory will eventually be given back to Greece, but Greece won't be the ones to capture it, it will happen in a world conflict and Greece will have to stay neutral because of economic problems and a famine. There are many in Greece who hold to those prophecies still, but also many (especially the youth) who dismiss them.

,False,t5_2qjxn,"BEKs don't predate circa 1997 and are entirely an internet folkloric phenomenon - creepypasta in other words. They have absolutely no tradition predating that in any traceable authentic paranormal folklore or myth, at least nothing clearly linking the first emergence of the story (from a journalist whose name I forget) to an earlier source, and absolutely nothing in European myth or Western Esoteric Tradition. 

It goes without saying they have zero traceable evidence in terms of real witnesses or verifiable events. 

The black eyes may have been introduced by the very influential Whitley Strieber books from the '80s which everyone freaked out over, but fully black sclera used as a horror trope goes back to the '60s in movies and TV. When makeup technology allowed full sclera contacts in movies, there was a lot of this along with lizard eyes, cat eyes, etc. It was just an inversion of fully white sclera, which originated with boiled egg membranes (!) in the 1920s or earlier to mimic cataracts. 

It doesn't take much imagination as a horror or mystery writer - or theatrical makeup artist - to invert fully white eyes (very common in horror tropes) to black. First example I saw was in the late '70s British Paranormal TV show Sapphire and Steel in which Joanna Lumley was spirit possessed and wore fully black sclera for this scene - very unsettling and frightening for a young Caerbannog I can tell you. I'm almost certain Hammer Horror productions had done this before that period. 

Black eyes suggest nothingness, they also reflect the fully black eyes of predatory animals - and this I think is the true origin of the psychological fear manifested by this imagery. It is some kind of racial or species memory of the eyes of wild animals, black, featureless or nearly so, hiding any character or message. Human white eye sclera evolved (probably) to enable us to communicate more effectively, so the inverse is unsettling. 

BEKs are a bullshit made-up internet idea. If there was any history of them in folklore I'd be more inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt, but all signs point to a cute internet chiller tale with elements culled from theatrical makeup, Grey Alien imagery, and the 'possessed kid' trope from horror movies. 

The past life regression document you source is not in any way remarkable in terms of that field of literature, and nearly every symbol, imagery or cliche is dredged up in material of that type.

&gt;

&gt;__Molniya orbit__ ([Russian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): молния, ""Lightning"") is a type of [highly elliptical orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit) with an [inclination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination) of 63.4 [degrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle\)), an [argument of perigee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_perigee) of −90 degrees and an [orbital period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period) of one half of a [sidereal day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time). Molniya orbits are named after a series of [Soviet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union)/[Russian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) *[Molniya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_(satellite\))* [communications satellites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite) which have been using this type of orbit since the mid-1960s.

&gt;A satellite in a highly eccentric orbit spends most of its time in the neighborhood of [apogee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee) which for a Molniya orbit is over the northern hemisphere, the sub-satellite point at apogee having a latitude of 63.4 degrees North. As the apogee altitude is as high as 40,000 km, it will therefore, for a considerable period around apogee, have an excellent visibility from the Northern hemisphere, from the Russian Federation but also from northern Europe, Greenland and Canada.

&gt;To get a continuous high [elevation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence) coverage of the northern hemisphere, at least three Molniya spacecraft are needed.

**And a lot of THAT radioactive waste is now being recycled to be used in low grade reactors.**

*A key, nearly unique, characteristic of nuclear energy is that used fuel may be reprocessed to recover fissile and fertile materials in order to provide fresh fuel for existing and future nuclear power plants. Several European countries, Russia and Japan have had a policy to reprocess used nuclear fuel, although government policies in many other countries have not yet addressed the various aspects of reprocessing.
Over the last 50 years the principal reason for reprocessing used fuel has been to recover unused uranium and plutonium in the used fuel elements and thereby close the fuel cycle, gaining some 25% to 30% more energy from the original uranium in the process and thus contributing to energy security. A secondary reason is to reduce the volume of material to be disposed of as high-level waste to about one fifth.

,1396381956,t5_2ssp3,"Well, to start, the sources you refer to here are certainly important. Christopher Bayly is one of the most widely known and respected historians of India in the world. EDIT: Well, I'm an idiot, since I was thinking of Chris Bayly, and not **Susan** Bayly, the scholar who has written more specifically on caste. But, yes, SUSAN Bayly is also a well-known and highly-respected scholar of Indian history. Nicholas Dirks's book *Castes of Mind*, presumably what is cited in your quotes above, is definitely the book to read for this subject. You might also be interested in Bernard Cohn's *Colonialism and Its Forms of Knowledge*, a book which sort of lays the theoretical groundwork for Dirks; Cohn might have been his adviser, but I'm not sure. As to your specific questions...

&gt;Is this historical revisionism justified? Does this fit into the anti-realist and constructivist camps of historiography? Additionally, is this construction of a supposedly historical and ""exotic"" class stratification (often likened to a curse) an example of Western Orientalizing tendencies?

I'm not sure what you mean by ""justified."" It's based on evidence; it's not like Dirks just made it all up, and as a professional scholar taking part in academic discourse he's certainly professionally justified in making his argument. 

For your second question, yes, his argument is most definitely constructivist, but I'd take issue with the notion that it's ""anti-realist."" Things that are constructed can be and are very much ""real,"" and Dirks would not, I think, argue with the idea that caste is not a ""real"" thing right now, since people certainly behave according to the divisions that it creates. I'll explain further below. I'm not exactly sure what your last question means; is caste an ""exotic"" class stratification? What precisely does mean? Exotic to whom? If you mean ""exotic"" in the sense that the British imposed it, then I think you're misreading Dirks's argument slightly. 

Dirks would argue that it was the century and more of scholarship before his revision that was Orientalizing. He opens his book with a massive and wide-ranging critique of literally generations of European anthropologists, historians, ethnographers, philologists, and so on, many of whom we could certainly say were ""Orientalists,"" who had developed the scholarly ideas of caste going back to the nineteenth, and perhaps even the late eighteenth century. These scholars were Orientalist in the sense that they assumed that the Indian peoples they encountered were basically static, unchanging. They might have had great civilizations once, but that was the distant past, and in the colonial present they saw, they thought they could safely assume that Indians were unchanging. Thus, when they saw caste divisions, they assumed that these had always existed. Dirks's point, following the work of people like Cohn and Bayly, is not merely to critique this Orientalist assumption, but to show how precisely caste has changed. His argument is not so much that British colonialism created or imposed caste unilaterally, but rather that it created the conditions for the construction of a rigid and *apparently* timeless, unchanging, ""Orientalist"" caste system. The passages you supply above note that 

&gt;Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate that caste structures – more specifically the type and number of castes within a particular region – are not primordially given. They are a function of political processes. As Bayly (1999) points out, over the centuries, shifts in political control have resulted in shifts in the caste system because of changes in **systems of patronage and allegiance**. Dirks (2002) specifically looking at British colonial rule makes a compelling case that **the British propensity for measurement and administrative control forced standardized categories onto a hitherto fluid system that in turn had important effects on political mobilization** – essentially creating the modern caste system.

The point that gets missed here is that politics--and therefore caste--is a two-way street. Yes, British and European scholars and administrators looked at Indian people, saw caste relationships, and assumed that these relationships were fixed, rigid, and timeless; yes, their administration put into place governance that operated on those assumptions--but, Indians also had to work within these systems, and adapted to them. I don't have his book to hand, but Dirks identified moments in the late nineteenth century when colonial administrators would come up with some policy that gave preferential treatment to particular castes. As soon as they did that, the people affected would begin to assert their caste identity, going to the administrators and saying, essentially, ""We're in this caste; you've gotten us miscategorized, we're part of this caste, we always have been, and that other group of people from the other side of the village, they've never been part of this caste. So, you should give us this particular preferential treatment, and not them."" So, it's not as though the British just showed up and declared caste a thing; they showed up, tried to govern according to a radically simplified[1] and Orientalist view of how they thought Indian people lived, and Indian people responded to that governance in ways that maximized their benefits within it. Caste is, therefore, the product of colonialism and Orientalism, but not *only* of those things. It was a long process, involving actors from all parts of Indian and colonial society. 

Now, I think your main question is really, ""Do historians agree with Dirks?"" This, I cannot really elaborate on too much, since I haven't done much reading in South Asian history in the past few years. My understanding, though, is that Dirks's work has really shifted the paradigm. I'm absolutely positive that there are counter-arguments to it, in which people say ""Here's an example of a caste relationship that has existed for 1000 years, so Dirks's conclusion that caste (as it exists today) is a recent invention is wrong."" And this should be expected, because one undeniable fact about South Asia is its diversity. There MUST be caste relationships that are *really* old--but a few counter-examples does not mean that the broad thrust of Dirks's work, that modern ideas of caste as a fairly rigid system of relationships is a relatively recent product of interactions between Indians and European colonizers, is invalid. He is the standard read for that topic.

Christianity: 
True religion preached by Jesus, peace be upon him, who was a messenger of Allah and promised messiah to the tribe of Israel (the Jews). prophecied in the revelation given to Moses, peace be upon him, he was born to a virgin and performed miracles during his lifetime as signs of his prophethood. The jews rejected him as their messiah and plotted to kill him. Allah raised him to the heavens and he shall return near the end of time (which us and christians believe in common). 

Where we differ? The christians attributed divinity to Jesus, and called him the Son of Allah, changed their book and split the unity of Allah into three turning the monotheism that Jesus preached on its head. They also abandoned all their laws which Allah ordained for them. Hence you find the most heinous of obscenities in the so called christian nations.

Hinduism:
Origin can be given the benefit of doubt since Allah says that he has sent messengers to all nations and peoples. Also the vedas are said to be ""heard"" or conceived by the rishi munis. Some islamic scholars have dug into them and came out with the proofs of unity of Allah in them. But leaving all that aside, the religion has become more based on myths and fantasies written by human beings with numeroous gods and pagan rituals including worshipping stones and wooden idols that has no power of its own. Also has become more of a cultural identity than a religion and being manipulated well by the politicians for their needs.

Buddhism:
I dont know much about buddhism. Since its time is about 4 centuries BC, it is possible that he was a true messenger of Allah or someone inspired by him. But I have seen no evidence of him conveying a message of recognizing the creator of the universe. Buddhism has become more of a lifestyle or a set of practices with no foundation to stand on with regards to its worldview. If that is the case, he was just an ordinary ascetic, a fraud or people changed his message just like with the other religions.

Atheism:
More of a modern and naive set of beliefs that arose out of the empiricism of the 20th century and a bunch of pop-culture scientists. The idea that reality is only as far as what the senses can sense and that the only source of knowledge is through empirical evidence is frowned upon and discarded ages ago even by non religious philosophers. Origins can be traced to the european rebellion against the political control of the catholic church, the so-called scientific revolution and conditioning of the global minds with a strictly secular worldview of the universe. This belief meets a wall beyond a certain set of presuppositions which are needed to be put 'blind faith' in.

Germany's Russia lobby includes industrial and political influence groups of considerable power, a faction of the Social Democratic party, and anti-European Union activists of the far left and right. They successfully encourage the notion that the West, America in particular, has humiliated Russia to the point of being responsible for Vladimir Putin's actions on Ukraine—and, above all, that confronting Russia on virtually any issue is catastrophic for German business.

A little reality here, please.

According to the German Statistical Office, Russia ranks 11th as a German trading partner, behind Belgium. Data from the MSCI research organization shows that, as a percentage of overall revenue among listed European companies, the highest German exposure to Russia is 11.5% for retailer Metro. BASF is exposed to Russia for 4.1% of its revenue, as is Siemens. Volkswagen, Porsche and BMW are situated at 4.8%, 4.8% and 3.6%, respectively.

In fact, Switzerland-based soft-drink bottling firm Coca-Cola Hellenic faces about double the combined Russian exposure of those German auto makers.

That's great to know for bar bets. But it also says that Germany's efforts to avoid being tough with Russia on Ukraine are colored by a nervous, not totally frank and extremely emotional element. Arguments against stronger sanctions could be countered by stressing the factual limits of the lobby's ""we're-gonna-go-broke"" poor-mouthing.

But the wider context for the German government involves postwar national guilt, and centuries of a both romantic and ruthless vision of Russia as a nearby Amazonia. It represents enormous potential German wealth, coupled with a German notion of Russia's need for German guidance.

In the Germany of Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, all of these habits get masterfully massaged by the Russians.

Last week, I asked a high-level European security official to evaluate Germany's position on Ukraine. He said, ""I don't see the positive effect of all these phone calls by [Mrs.] Merkel to Putin. As for [Mr.] Steinmeier, there have been instances at international discussions where he seems to be pitching for the other side.''

Held up against the crisis in Ukraine, Germany's new, projected engagement in foreign-policy leadership boils down to making sure its old ""let's-talk-this-over"" and ""maybe-we-can-do-nothing"" approaches stay in place.

In February, to wide international applause (and to occasional remarks that Chancellor Merkel wasn't necessarily on board), Federal President Joachim Gauck dared Germans to take risks for freedom and justice, to turn away from comfort and excuses, and to assume possibly painful front-line responsibilities in the world.

Here's a checklist on how Germany's coalition government was holding up to that task with 40,000 Russian troops just over Ukraine's eastern frontier.

When Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, a Christian Democrat, said last week that it was important for NATO countries on Russia's borders that the Alliance ""show its presence'' there, she was immediately shot down by Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat. Mr. Gabriel said, ""The impression must not be given that we're playing with military options even in theoretical terms.''

In the process, Mr. Gabriel looked like he was disregarding a warning issued the day before by U.S. Gen. Philip Breedlove, the top commander of NATO forces in Europe, about the unexplained and troubling nature of the Russian troop buildup.

Who came to the defense of Ms. von der Leyen, after the vice chancellor clobbered her on an issue where she was in tune with a developing aspect of NATO policy? Chancellor Merkel said nothing specific.

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung's (FAZ) explanation for why was not reassuring. The newspaper reported, in fact, that the chancellor's silence involved her government's resistance to a plan under in discussion in Brussels, which would preposition ""heavy military equipment"" in the Baltic states and Poland. This is the kind of action to which U.S. President Barack Obama is referring when he says that NATO will maintain a ""regular presence"" in Alliance countries that feel threatened by Russia.

More discomfort: The FAZ described NATO members' broad view that Germany was slipping into its old passive mode, akin to its position during NATO's Libya incursion. This included its attitude towards certain ""practical measures."" Presumably, this means deeper and riskier involvement than flying the air patrols over the Baltic Sea that the Germans had previously indicated they would undertake.

All the same, it is commonplace among allies to say that Germany is an ultimately sure partner in the Ukraine crisis because of Mrs. Merkel's known mistrust and dislike of Mr. Putin. But the notion can wear thin.

After years of Germany accommodating Russia, the problem now comes down to weak expectations for fundamental change in Germany's approach. Since little in the realm of future cooperation can be expected of Mr. Putin, it would be reasonable for Berlin to consider that its current relations with Russia can not survive the Crimean aggression.

But Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Steinmeier and German public opinion give no sign of willingness to concede the point.

In terms of the existence of a Ukraine whole, free and anchored to Western institutions, that means its new leaders in Kiev must limit their reliance on Germany. It also supports their case for pressing (and perhaps shaming) the Obama administration and the rest of Europe into accepting historical responsibility for preventing new Russian adjustments to the post-Cold War map.

If Ukraine instead winds up dismembered, neutralized and parceled into Russian quasi-protectorates through an ugly international deal, the result will be a triumph for Vladimir Putin and an undisguised defeat for Barack Obama. As for Germany, it would mean life and business continuing pretty much as usual—on Germany's own deeply self-involved terms.

&gt;The __River Don Engine__ is a 1905-built [steam engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine) used for [hot rolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_rolling) steel armour plate. It is a 3-[cylinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine\)) [simple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine#Simple_expansion) engine of 40 inches (1.0 m) diameter, 48 inches (1.2 m) stroke. At its operating steam pressure of 160psi, it developed 12,000 horsepower (8.9 MW), and was able to reverse from full speed in 2 seconds. The rapid reverse was an essential feature of an engine used for rolling, as delays would result in cooling of the workpiece. This engine was one of four built to the same design, one going overseas to the Japanese Government, one to John Brown's Atlas plant, and the destination of the final one being unaccounted for. It is claimed to be one of the most powerful steam engines ever built, and the most powerful remaining in Europe.

,False,t5_2qh1i,"&gt;I don't believe that.

Well, it's a criminal act in the US (and nearly the entirety of the rest of the world).

[In the whole of North and South America, Australia, the only country *not* to criminalize marital rape is Haiti. (Legal status in Paraguay is not known.)

In Europe and Asia (including the Middle East), the only notable countries that have not criminalized marital rape are China, Mongolia, Burma, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia. (Legal status in a few countries, including Georgia, Lithuania, and Azerbaijan is not known.)

In Africa, the continent is divided into about 1/3 not criminalized (e.g. Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Nigeria), 1/3 criminalized (e.g. South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Rwanda), and 1/3 ""data unknown.""]

So, as far as nearly the entire developed world is concerned, a man who forces his wife to have sex against her will has raped her.  Just because you don't believe it doesn't make it untrue, because it is legal fact.

&gt;makes no sense or logic

Please tell me how.  What is your logic behind a man forcing his wife to have sex without her consent *not* rape?

My logic is that each person is autonomous and has the right of consent to any act done to his/her body (as well as a right to revoke that consent at any time). Marital vows *do not* include a renouncement of that right.

Following your logic, is a man who kills his wife not a murderer?  The man that kills his wife has violated her right to consent to acts done to her body.  If you believe she has relinquished this right upon marriage, then he must not have murdered her.  (If you believe that no one has the right of consent to acts done to his/her body, then is no one ever murdered?)",True,cghex5u,IAm_Jacks_Reddit,,,t1_cghbyhd,False,0,t3_21o31n,0,,1433163600,t1_cghex5u,0,1,1396369989,1,AskReddit

Of course, European persecution of the Jews is something that arguably predates European Christianity, if you want to point at Rome's pretty extreme solution to the problem of frequent rebellions in Judea and the rest of Roman Palestine. But, it could be argued that those were strategic measures rather than targeted anti-Semitism. 

Regardless, anti-Semitism has been in Europe for a long, long time, and has deep roots in religion, so we cannot responsibly address its most horrible result without also considering the religious aspect.

,1396398245,t5_2ssp3,"So, when it comes to mysteries of early Italy, one of the biggest remaining question marks is over the foundation of Rome itself. When was it founded, and by whom? Different Roman accounts have provided different ideas, such as Rome being founded by Romulus and Remus, or by Trojans led by Aeneas. Eventually, though much later than is often realised, the Romans even adopted their suggested date as a dating system- A.U.C being ‘before the founding of the city’, the city of course being Rome. But ever since archaeologist and historians in the modern era turned to this question, a lot of doubts were raised. Not only about the obviously legendary figures, but the proposed date. Frankly dating a lot of early Roman history is hard, let alone telling which events actually happened.

So what does this have to do with the Near East? Well, there is a historiographical debate over what’s called the Eastern Hypothesis. Of the two main positions the earliest was that developed by S. Grunion in the early 1950s. He proposed, quite seriously, the idea that Rome was in fact a long lost sister city to Carthage. More specifically, that Rome had been a lost Phoenician colony who had quickly lost their original cultural identity. They had assimilated into the local Italic-speaking populations, and been strongly influenced by Archaic-era Greek culture, and thus lost almost all their originally Phoenician characteristics. The evidence leading to these conclusions was the Ficana wreck, a wreck of a typical 8th century Phoenician trade ship part way up the Tiber river. The key evidence was the presence of an artifact assumed to be intended for a Phoenician temple. And yet, the only settlement of any size nearby would have been early Rome. In addition the 8th and very early 7th century pottery from Rome has marked similarities to equivalents in Phoenicia. However, this did not pass without comment, and here enters the second school of thought.

Early criticism of the Lost Colony centred around a number of points. If the colony was Phoenician originally, why were there almost no traces of Semitic influence in the earliest known Roman language? If the Romans were originally Phoenicians, why was there relationship with other Phoenicians later on so adversarial? Why is this suggested origin for Rome not preserved in any Roman history? There were, of course, counterarguments. But nonetheless Q. Quayle’s 1964 deconstruction of the ‘Grunion School’, *A critical examination of the Lost Colony theory for Roman Origins*, proved to be a game-changer in the equation. He argued an alternative approach to the Eastern Hypothesis, and one that fit with a number of other pieces of evidence rather better. His hypothesis was that Rome had, quite simply, been an Etruscan colony at first. After all, Roman history quite clearly indicates a strangely intimate connection to the Etruscan world. His hypothesis is that the turning point was, in fact, the very well known Gaulish sack of Rome in 390 BC. His equally unusual hypothesis was that the sack had actually resulted in the destruction of the Old Romans, who were Etruscan speakers and part of the Etruscan world. But where on earth did the Romans we’re familiar with come from then? Why do we have a record of the Romans surviving the siege?

Quayle’s equally bold suggestion was that Rome had, in fact, been refounded. This is why the Romans post-390 BC spoke an Indo-European language rather than Etruscan, and why their preservation of early Roman history was so poor. But who had they been refounded by? In the 390s BC, the terror of the Mediterranean remained the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Having newly consigned the Greek world into bickering (see the Persian interventions in the Peloponnesian War), the Achaemenids had gained an opportunity to move more freely. Having retained the same borders for almost a century the Achaemenid monarchs had sought new opportunities. Accordingly, Quayle hypothesised that an Achaemenid monarch had authorised an exploratory expedition to Italy in order to map and potentially colonise it. The reason that this was not something any history told us was because it had not been preserved, and in the 1960s very few Achaemenid era documents were known to us. So what do the Achaemenids have to do with Rome? His hypothesis was that this Persian expedition came across the city just after it had been depopulated severely by the Gauls. That the Roman legion in the Roman accounts led by Camilus was actually a Persian army led by one Kâhmloš. Upon saving Rome from the Gauls, the Persians had seen the opportunity to be independent actors rather than under the control of the Persian King, and therefore Quayle proposed that it was in fact they who then took control of Rome. They adopted the history and identity of the Romans they had displaced, much as the Hittites had taken over the identity of the Hattic people they displaced. Their own Persian language was displaced in favour of Italic dialects, but it was their Indo-European origins that caused Rome to become part of the Italic-speaking world rather than Etruscan. Evidence for this that has been cited includes the city’s Chaldean district, which is something /u/farquier has greater familiarity with than I, and the clear hybridisation of Indo-European and Etruscan deities visible in the surviving religious expressions of Rome.

So these are the two schools of the Eastern School; those who favour the Lost Colony hypothesis, and those who favour the Persian Refounding hypothesis. Both of these would quite clearly establish Italy’s Iron Age history as being profoundly connected to the Near East. However, the debate between the two has not been resolved to any satisfaction, and nor is the Eastern Hypothesis accepted entirely within the study of pre-Classical Rome (or pre-Roman archaeology of Italy for that matter). But it remains an intriguing and distinct pair of possibilities.

,False,t5_2qh1i,"First one needs to understand relics in Christianity.

There are many within Christianity who don't understand relics, and who simply dismiss them as extra frou frou and a creation of the Roman Catholic Church. That just simply isn't accurate, as relics have existed in Christianity since its earliest days.

Second, when it comes to things like the holy grail and this current example, sometimes it comes down to mythology.

Myths around the holy grail (unlike earlier relics) only date to about the the 12th or 13th Century, and during this period, western Christianity (IE the Catholic Church) was seeing a resurgence in relics, in holy sites and pilgrimages to them. If a site had a holy relic, that meant pilgrims and therefore money.

Many people also viewed Christ in such a way, that they felt he had to have ""the best"" things, and that it would have been common sense for him to be drinking from a beautiful cup.

______________________________

However... When it comes to other relics, it isn't quite the same. For the Holy Grail, it's myth only dates back a few hundred years. However, there are some Christian relics which can be traced back nearly to their origin.

The true cross is one example of this. These days, there are many, many different pieces of the true cross, most of them are as small as little splinters. However, there was a point in time when the true cross was still in one single piece. It was originally discovered by St. Helen, the mother of Emperor Constantine when she made pilgrimage to Jerusalem. It's reported that she went to the site which for the prior 200 years or so, had been venerated as the site of Christ's death and resurrection.

The site previously had a small church built there, but it had been demolished, and as was common at the time, people would build religious buildings on the holy sites of other religions, a pagan temple dedicated to Venus had been built on the site.

They discovered a cave tomb next to the site, when they opened it, they found three crosses, a titulus (the sign with the criminal's crime displayed) and several nails. In order to test which cross was the cross of Christ, they touched all three to a woman who was terminally ill, when the third cross touched her, she miraculously recovered, they presumed that this cross was Christ's cross.

The temple to Venus was destroyed and replaced with a larger church dedicated to the resurrection of Christ. The nails were sent back to Constantinople where they were added to Constantine's crown. The cross was placed onto the spot they presumed it had stood over 200 years before, with the church built around it and the tomb. 

From this point, apparently pieces (from small splinters/shavings to larger chunks) of the cross were broken off. These made their way around the Roman Empire into various churches and were encased in gold reliquaries.

They also apparently had recovered the crown of thorns which was placed on Christ's head, the lance that pierced his side on the cross, and the pillar (now at a Greek Church in Istanbul) which Christ was presumed to have been chained when he was flogged. All of these were also set up near the cross for popular veneration.

300 years later, the Sassanids broke up more of the cross, and took part of it when they captured Jerusalem and when they were eventually defeated by the Roman Emperor, the cross was recaptured. The cross was taken by the Emperor to Constantinople and a great procession was held, and then the cross was transfered back to Jerusalem and placed back in the church.

It stayed in the church for about 400 more years until the Greek Orthodox citizens hid the cross from the conquering Muslims. When the Roman Catholic crusaders took Jerusalem, they tortured the Greek Orthodox priests who had been hiding it. The crusaders captured the cross (which by this point, had been encased in gold) but only a small part of it (since had previously been broken up).

Saladin captured a part of it, and nothing has been seen of that part of the cross since.

By this point, the cross was largely broken up and no longer stood on the spot it had been at in the church since Constantine.

Today, there are many little splinters of the cross all over the Christian world. The largest chunks remaining are in secluded Greek monasteries as well as some in Rome and other Catholic Churches in western Europe.

______________________

That's just one other example of a prominent relic in Christianity. There are many, many other examples out there. Some relics are more contemporary myths, whereas others, like the cross, can reasonably be traced back at least 1700 years or so.

Many such relics, like the right hand of John the Baptist, or John the Baptist's head, have long been encased in gold. The same is true for common objects. But if the gold were to be removed, the normal object or body part is still there, and sometimes they contain openings or little hatches that open and allow viewing or veneration of the actual relic itself.

I myself have venerated relics. These include pieces of the bones of Christian Saints like St. John Chrysostom (d. 407), St. Nicholas (d. 343), St. Demetrios (d. 306) and St. Polycarp (d. 155).

We shouldn't be quick to dismiss all relics within Christianity, as many of these traditions and relics pre-date even Constantine and they can be relatively accurately, traced back to either their discovery or even in some cases to their attributed Saint.

But, in the case of the Holy Grail, the Holy Grail is more recent phenomenon in Christianity (12th or 13th Century) and is pretty much unique to only Roman Catholicism (and some Anglicans and Protestants).

,1396377030,t5_2qqjc,"The British gained nothing because, as the defenders, they didn't seek to gain anything; merely to defend what they had.  The British supported the natives, which severely restricted American expansionism northward.  If the goal was to end native raids, then this was accomplished by the end of 1913, through a series of American successes.  At that point, it wouldn't matter if the British were supporting the native raids; the raids had already been put down.  

The trade blockade with the French was, in part, to keep the Americans from supplying French troops against the British.  This makes sense, since the US already had beef with the British and such trade in materiel would've significantly changed the balance of power between Britain/France.  There's no question that an invasion of Canada, *if successful*, would've given the US a massive bargaining chip with the Brits, but ultimately it wasn't this ""bargaining chip"" that led to the cessation of war, primarily because the US was incapable of any significant invasion.

Ultimately, the war dragged out, got too costly and resulted in what amounts to a stalemate.  What did the US really win with the Treaty of Ghent?  Not an end to native raids, since those were already long over.  Not any more territory since the treaty restored the pre-war borders.

The US gained *respect*, to be treated as equals on the international stage.  Was that the goal of the US in the War of 1812?  Possibly a secondary or tertiary one, but given American expansionist idealism, I doubt it was the primary goal.

Edit, since I'm apparently being downvoted for my astute observations:

Pickney's Treaty (1795) gave the Americans access to the Mississipi from New Orleans.  The Louisiana Purchase (1803) increased the American frontier across to the Pacific.  Continental expansionism was fully entrenched in the psyche of Americans long before 1812. Less than a decade later and you have an Amrican mentality that expansion is a moral obligation and a reflection of romantic nationalism.

I don't dispute that breaking the British naval blockade may have precipitated the War of 1812.  However, the threat posed by potential American trade with France as possible suppliers against the British waned as the war ground on.  With the impending end of the Napoleonic Wars, American resupply of France likely wouldn't have helped them defeat the coalition of European nations they were fighting.

Right, I'm probably taking out some general annoyance on you. 

&gt; Islam at it's core is just as much a political system as christianity. In case you didn't know, The bible is full of rules how to live your life, ever heard of the ten commandments?

Sure, but ten rules compared to pretty much the entire quran, is a pretty big difference. 


&gt; However, Islam has a whole bunch of litterature written around it that also contains lots of rules and so on, and in some muslim countries, like Saudi Arabia and Iran, the clergy has a whole lot of political power. But that is nothing inherent in Islam just as it isnt in medieval christianity (where the same thing happened in even larger scale). 

If you live in Europe aside from England, you're probably used to the civil law type legal system. If you live in the U.S or England you've got common law. Well, most of the Middle East uses sharia where the quran and its surrounding sources is the source of the law. In other words, islam could easily be referred to as a legal system, rather than a religion. Since this legal system describes how to organize society, you could also call it a political system.

Something similar would be very difficult to achieve with the bible because it's mostly a collection of stories and very few hard and fast rules.

&gt; It comes down to politicians(who sometimes happens to be religious people as well) using Islam to justify their actions, unlike the other way around, which apparently a lot of people think.

Islam is very much a complete legal and political system with very clear rules. However, as you point out, people also exploit this system. Arguably, this is in fact one of the very problems with islam. It sets up a framework that can be, and is, exploited. 

Edit: One of the biggest problems, imo, is the treatment of women.

Four more matches – four measly little matches – and they could be in the final, the chance to win Europe's most prestigious competition for the fourth time within their grasp. All they've got to do first is beat Bayern Munich and sure, it'll be tough against the all-conquering side that wrapped up the Bundesliga title before the clocks went forward, but United are coming into this bang in form, a 4-1 thumping of Aston Villa on the weekend the perfect way for them to warm up for this tie.

&gt; Cantor Rabinowitz is concerned and upset because his son Jakie shows so little interest in carrying on the family's traditions and heritage. For five generations, men in the family have been Cantors in the synagogue, but Jakie is more interested in jazz and ragtime music. One day, they have such a bitter argument that Jakie leaves home for good. After a few years on his own, now calling himself Jack Robin, he gets an important opportunity through the help of well-known stage performer Mary Dale. But Jakie finds that in order to balance his career, his relationship with Mary, and his memories of his family, he will be forced to make some difficult choices.

---

**Critical reception:**

&gt; Seymour Stark's view is less sanguine. In describing Jolson's extensive experience performing in blackface in stage musicals, he asserts, ""The immigrant Jew as Broadway star...works within a blackface minstrel tradition that obscures his Jewish pedigree, but proclaims his white identity. Jolson's slight Yiddish accent was hidden by a Southern veneer."" Arguing that The Jazz Singer actually avoids honestly dealing with the tension between American assimilation and Jewish identity, he claims that its ""covert message...is that the symbol of blackface provides the Jewish immigrant with the same rights and privileges accorded to earlier generations of European immigrants initiated into the rituals of the minstrel show."" (*Wikipedia*)

**Awards:**

* **1928 Academy Award** for *Best Engineering Effects (nominated)*; *Best Writing Adapted Screenplay (nominated)*

Newt finds a flock of Phoenixes, learns about them, comes to appreciate them, and denies the client his request of a pet because of the nature of Phoenixes. Albus Dumbledore, while assisting Newt, wins the allegiance of a phoenix we come to know as Fawkes. Along the way to find the Phoenixes, he falls back out of love.

He carefully studies dragons, while teaching protective enchantments, and discovers what draws the dragon's to the sleepy town. Risking great personal injury and potentially his own life, Newt manages to discover that the Dragon is an Animagus. He duels and defeats the wizard in charge and the town, vexed no more, goes back to being Sleepy. 

Newt then rushes to stop a mob/army that is forming up to Kill all the dragons around Europe. He prevails in proving that Dragons are not predatory towards humans and are not a threat if left alone. Newt is lauded by an uneasy populace who, still wary of Dragons, are indeed glad Newt saved them from destroying the entire population.

When Germany annexed Sudetenland the international community did the same (diplomatic sanctions) and if Germany wouldnt have invaded Poland (who was guranteed by UK and France) WWII would never have happend.

Agreed. The sad thing is, this lesson seems to be well-learned in Russia. Putin isn't a racist hell-bent on exterminating some nations and enslaving others for ""lebensraum"", so as long as he doesn't become that in the future, he's safe, and the following applies to him quite well:

[As one British political leader observed at the time of Munich, in words that may come to haunt some contemporary politicians, “Hitler’s policy is perfectly clear: he simply says one thing and does another,” and he expects others to accept that as the new reality if they want peace and stability in our time.](http://www.interpretermag.com/dugin-tells-separatists-in-ukraine-what-to-do-next/)

BTW I don't think Russia much cares about its Black Sea fleet or ports. The Black Sea fleet is obsolete. It has been neglected and is quite irrelevant compared to the Northern Fleet and the Far East Fleet, for example.

* Crimea, which... has some nice beaches. Already had the naval base there so meh

Arguably they wanted to *keep* that naval base - if the Ukraine joined the EU it's certainly possible that Russia would lose that base. Russia could strong-arm an independent Ukraine to keep the base in place but when the EU is backing the Ukraine Russia no longer has that power. If it was going to come down to a fight better to do it when the opposing party doesn't have treaties with every country in the EU. Crimea is also at least somewhat valuable from an economic standpoint - the rest of Ukraine not as much.

* I guess people arn't talking about the ridiculously homophobic stuff, so there is that.

I doubt the Russian leadership really cares if the rest of the world is or isn't talking about it and unfortunately the homophobic stuff has relatively high popular support in Russia.

* Fair bit of popular support at home, but given the elections are so fair it hurts anyway, meh.

Fair elections or not, a happy populace is a hell of a lot easier to govern than an unhappy one. And although I don't think anyone's arguing that the Russian elections have been free of corruption, it doesn't seem unreasonable to think Putin wouldn't have been elected in free and open elections - many Russians do seem to like him.

&gt;Rest of Ukraine to eventual Nato/EU membership. 

It seemed pretty apparent given the riots that, if the EU allowed it, this was going to happen regardless of what Russia did.

&gt;Any goodwill in its major energy market (the E.U) and major import market (Russia fails to function without German imports fairly quickly).

Germany doesn't want to take the hit cutting off Russia - that's a two way street - Russia hurts without imports from Germany but Germany hurts without exports to Russia. Energy market below.

&gt;China the one time BFF now seems content to sit on the sidelines, China no like-interventionism.

China's not stupid - it gains very little from jumping into the fight. Can you name other instances where China lent support behind an ally where it clearly hurt China to do so?

&gt;Long term viability of Gazproms current EU focused delivery infrastructure as the E.U as a whole scrambles to seek alternative natural gas supplies. Don't underestimate this 1/4th of the entire Russian budget comes directly from the gazprom sales to E.U members. Q: What's a semi feudal petrostate without exports. A: Fucked.

Sure. And best of luck to the EU on that. Because by and large they don't have the infrastructure or resources to deal with demand. Long term I guess it would hurt, but renewable energy is a greater threat from a long-term strategy than this. Short-term the EU can't afford to boycott Russian gas. And, as evidenced by pretty much every moment of the last century, people tend to not be willing to pay more for energy just because of ideals (see: the US happily buying oil from the Middle East/Venezuela). So TBD on whether or not it's just empty talk like most ""we'll stop buying fuel from you"" talk is.

Nicht jede Entmachtung eines demokratisch Gewählten ist illegitim.

Wenn Schulze schreibt:

&gt; Anders gefragt: Wie lange würden Demonstranten bei einer ungenehmigten Kundgebung auf dem Berliner Alexanderplatz aushalten können, die den Sturz von Merkel und ihrem Kabinett (und am besten auch gleich noch von Gauck) fordern, weil Merkel nichts gegen die NSA unternimmt und maßgebend dazu beiträgt, dass Europa durch das Freihandelsabkommen mit den USA den Welt-Konzernen ausgeliefert wird?
&gt; 
&gt; Zudem fordern die Demonstranten, dass Edward Snowden, der letzte westliche Selbstaufklärer, einen Ort im Westen findet, an dem er unbehelligt leben kann. Unterstützt werden die Proteste mit Millionen oder Milliarden Rubeln und Yuan, und ab und zu tauchen der russische und chinesische Außenminister auf, verteilen Glückskekse und Pelmeni, applaudieren den Demonstranten und rufen unter der Weltzeituhr: Angela Merkel, deine Zeit ist vorbei!

dann ist das genau, worauf ich abhob: Der Gedanke, dass der russische oder der chinesische Außenminister in Berlin Demonstranten zum Sturz des Merkel-Regimes auffordern, hinkt so dermaßen, dass er den Autor regelrecht diskreditiert.  China betreibt von jeher eine Politik der Nichteinmischung – ein solches Manöver ginge gegen alles, wofür die chinesische Führung steht. Und die Russen? Mit welchem Anspruch, der geeignete wäre, emanzipatorisch orientierte Demonstranten in ihrer Sache zu bestärken, würde denn ein russischer Außenminister in Deutschland auftreten, während daheim in Russland die Sippenhaft wieder eingeführt und die Diskriminierung gegen Homosexuelle forciert wird?  Und die deutschen Demonstranten? Die gibt es ja gar nicht, weil die Überwachung den meisten sowieso egal ist.  Wenn man das durchdenkt, sieht man im Grunde sofort, wie evident hohl diese Argumentation ist.  Wenn diese fiktiven Demonstranten, die Schulze erwähnt, irgendeiner Unterstützung würdig wären, würden sie diesen Außenministern den Zugang zu ihrem Platz verwehren.

&gt; Es bleibt aber mehr als ein fader Geschmack wenn Unrecht der einen Seite entweder de-facto oder per Definition (Amerikaner können gar keine Kriegsverbrecher sein!) nicht geahndet wird, dann aber für die andere Seite die populistische Kanzel bestiegen wird, um schärfste Strafen zu verlangen.

Aha, also doch infantiles Gerechtigkeitsempfinden.  Amerikanische Kriegsverbrecher haben mit dieser Diskussion herzlich wenig zu tun.  Und vielleicht hätte ich mich deutlicher ausdrücken sollen, aber als ich von der »Gesundheit seiner Implementationen im Westen heutzutage« schrieb, meinte ich genau das. Nach 9/11 haben die Amerikaner sich verändert, und zwar nicht zum Guten hin. Cheneys Ansatz im Krieg gegen den Terror, demgemäß der Zweck beinahe jedes Mittel heiligt, ist eine Tendenz, die zurückgedreht werden müsste, weil es der Ideologie der Freiheit sonst in ihrem Kernland an den Kragen gehen würde.

,False,t5_2qh13,"Wow, are you seriously going to tell me that the US as a hyper power doesn't have more than a century policy of ensuring no threats are allowed to pop up in the west? The Monroe Doctrine is hard undeniable fact, Noam simply sums it up in a way the average joe can understand. But if you want other scientists.

""President James Monroe first stated the doctrine during his seventh annual State of the Union Address to Congress. The term ""Monroe Doctrine"" itself was coined in 1850.[3] By the end of the nineteenth century, Monroe's declaration was seen as a defining moment in the foreign policy of the United States and one of its longest-standing tenets. It would be invoked by many U.S. statesmen and several U.S. presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and many others.
The intent and impact of the Monroe Doctrine persisted with only minor variations for more than a century. **Its primary objective was to free the newly independent colonies of Latin America from European intervention and avoid situations which could make the New World a battleground for the Old World powers, so that the United States could exert its own influence undisturbed.** The doctrine asserted that the New World and the Old World were to remain distinctly separate spheres of influence, for they were composed of entirely separate and independent nations.[4] However, the policy became deeply resented by Latin American nations for its overt interventionism and perceived imperialism.""


The full document of the Monroe Doctrine is long and couched in diplomatic language, but its essence is expressed in two key passages; the first is the introductory statement:[9]
The occasion has been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.
The second key passage, a fuller statement of the Doctrine, is addressed to the ""allied powers"" of Europe (that is, the Holy Alliance); it clarifies that the United States remains neutral on existing European colonies in the Americas but is opposed to ""interpositions"" that would create new colonies among the newly independent Spanish American republics:[1]
We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider **any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.** With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.

**As the United States began to emerge as a world power, the Monroe Doctrine came to define a recognized sphere of control that few dared to challenge.[4]** Before becoming president, Theodore Roosevelt had proclaimed the rationale of the Monroe Doctrine in supporting intervention in the Spanish colony of Cuba in 1898. After he became president, and following the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903, Roosevelt added the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine in 1904. This corollary asserted the** right of the United States to intervene in Latin America in cases of “flagrant and chronic wrongdoing by a Latin American Nation”**.[21]
The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine was invoked to intervene militarily in Latin America to stop the spread of European influence.[21]
The Roosevelt Corollary was the most significant amendment to the original doctrine and was widely opposed by critics, who argued that the Monroe Doctrine was originally meant to stop European influence in the Americas.[4] This amendment was designed to preclude violation of the doctrine by European powers that would ultimately argue that the independent nations were “mismanaged or unruly”.[4] Critics, however, argued that the Corollary simply asserted U.S. domination in that area, essentially making them a ""hemispheric policeman.""[22]

After all, I do not claim to have a deep understanding of the national issues of Belgium, I'm not an expert in that any more than most Americans are experts in Ukraine. I don't live there and I have no reason to read a lot about it, well, until it shows up in the news. 

I lived in Chernivtsi, that's the West of Ukraine. West of Ukraine and Kiev is very anti-Russian. East of Ukraine is very pro-Russian. None of that changed. Ukraine wasn't 'lost'. Ukraine was inching closer to NATO &amp; EU for quite a while, Yanukovich was only a minor setback, as the next leader would probably have came from the opposition, so pro-EU basically. Once the revolution happened, the new gov't wasn't about to honour the extension of the lease on the Sevastopol base that Yanukovich granted Russia, well, because he was a corrupt pig with previous criminal history and frankly an embarrassment to Ukraine. Though from a technical standpoint, he was still a democratically elected leader of Ukraine, while the new gov't is basically the West of Ukraine holding the East hostage to its own interests. This isn't very democratic in principle. However, in short, Putin was going to lose Sevastopol anyway. 

Now Putin regained Sevastopol and all of Crimea. He has not lost the East of Ukraine either. And the IMF bailout of Ukraine will be *very*, *very* painful. Think Greece, but possibly worse. Remember how much Greece hated the EU and IMF even as they were helping it stand back up? Well Ukraine gets all the stick of the IMF without the carrots granted by the EU that Greece got prior to the crisis. Ukraine is typical of post-USSR states, it has a wide range of gov't subsidies for a number of crucial things. Which will be gone. The people will blame IMF or the new gov't. We will see how it plays out. In the short-term, the Yanukovich deal with Russia was very attractive. In the long-term, however, it would do nothing to cut the endemic corruption.

Georgia already has pretty balmy relations with Russia, the new gov't in there following Saakashvili, headed by Bidzina Ivanshvili is sensible pro-Russian -- by 'sensibly', I mean that they are for increasing relations with Russia without losing sight of their eventual goal of NATO and EU partnership. Georgia suffered rather heavy casualties and damage from the Russian invasion, lost two territories and it didn't even have the humbling experience of a very painfully pro-austerity IMF loan. If Georgia is any indicator, Ukraine isn't set in stone in how it will perceive Russia.

Put as objectively as I can manage; Facebook has shown on multiple occasions to have zero respect for the requests of European governments regarding personal information rights, they refuse to let users delete their profiles off their servers, they frequently change their privacy controls and deliberately make them hard to access and understand. 

They go to any length possible to gather and sell as much information as possible pertaining to every individual they digitally come in contact with, with seemingly no self imposed lines or ethics to guide them. They exercise the practice of buying up any opposition that arises, to either completely shut them down or absorb them into the Facebook landscape. 

As I've said, they have no respect or regard for their users. 

But I hope you are right. And I think that's what they NEED to do to get VR and more specifically OR off the ground. My concern is once that happens, then what. I'm curious if this is something Palmer and Co. have given thought towards, whether they are in this for the long run and think they can maintain objective seperation from Facebook and it's probing interest in dominating the VR platform, or whether they plan on jumping ship once the VR boat is afloat, and working on something entirely different.
