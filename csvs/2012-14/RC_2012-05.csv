* Most cities still required rail companies to pay for the maintenance of their own system despite having to now share it with cars, giving cars free roads while increasing the need for maintenance on the part of tram companies as ware increases from car usage.
* The popularity and convenience of 5 cent ridership had placed many tram companies in poor financial positions as inflation eat into their profits even prior to the Depression.
* From the start of the Great Depression till the end of the war, virtually no updating or maintenance was done on any system, leaving them all outdated, expensive, antiquated and in bad need up major repairs.
* The post war prosperity allowed for millions of new car buyers in a matter of years leading to plummeting ridership.
* With millions more cars on the road, leaving two lanes reserved for street cars was deemed an expensive use of limited road space. Once cars shared the road with trams they began to get stuck in the same traffic jams as the cars, leading to exceedingly slow service. It made them no faster than buses would be and made cars faster than either of them because drivers didn't have to adhere to timetables or wait to transfer between lines.
* Changes in diesel technology from the 20s to the 40s meant that buses were much more economical to a degree they weren't prior to the Great Depression.
* Increased oil production, originally for the war, lead to very low fuel costs after the war and throughout most of the 50s and 60s. In the same time the price of electricity that trams relied on stayed level or increased.
* Culturally, street cars were seen as the past, part of the Depression and the war, while cars and highways being the future.
* City planners of the time thought the way to a good city was an ordered city with single use neighborhoods rather than the clutter of ""traditional"" multi-use neighborhoods. This lead to almost all new construction of the post-war boom to be built as single use land requiring long trips between homes, commercial centers and industry, something the tram network wasn't built to accommodate and something it would be slower at doing than cars on a highway would be.
* Unlike Europe, the US did not have the same shortages of land that Europe had, allowing for the new housing of the post war boom to be built at much lower density making the building of new tram lines uneconomical.

AssholeDeluxe,t5_2qh7l,c4ijaxo,15,0,t3_szz9s,0,False,"Copypasta from a comment I made a few days ago:

The private prison industry, though sick, only holds around 8-9% of the prison population in the U.S. [Sauce](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/06/30/how-the-recession-hurts-private-prisons.html)

Corporations certainly benefit (think who supplies food, toiletries, etc. for all these prisons), but blaming the corporations is oversimplification.
 
Prison, depending on who you believe, is intended for a few different purposes. First, the incarceration rate of minorities is inexcusable. The incarceration rate of the U.S. for whites alone is 3 times higher than most Western European nations [Source 1](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/raceinc.html) and [Source 2](http://www.prisonstudies.org/publications/list/40-world-prison-population-list-8th-edition.html), but black men are incarcerated at a rate 7 times that of white men [Source](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p10.pdf).

Michel Foucault believes the reason for this is establishing a delinquency model. We have no interest in rehabilitation, but we make minorities delinquents in order to control. We incarcerate them to incapacitate them. Our government redefined crime through the War on Drugs to control a potentially dangerous minority population. We put them in prison to keep them in government control, we parole and put them on probation to keep an eye on their activities, we take away felons votes to keep them from influencing decisions in government, we slash prison education funding, and we make them likely to return by keeping a public record of their criminal activities so they can't get a decent job [Source](http://www.storesonlinepro.com/files/3483016/uploaded/3088944-TheImpactofIncarcerationonWageMobilityandInequality.pdf). The War on Drugs exists to manipulate minorities. The crack vs. cocaine sentencing laws (the former a drug for poor blacks and the latter for rich whites) were 100-1 in length of mandatory minimum sentence until just a few months ago. They are now 18-1. [Source](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-01/justice/justice_crack-cocaine-sentencing_1_powder-cocaine-fair-sentencing-act-crack-penalties?_s=PM:JUSTICE)

I could go on about the effects of mandatory minimums and the three strike laws and their racist effects, plus prison labor, plus the horrible recidivism rate, *ad nauseum*, but corporations are a side-beneficiary of the prison system. Control is the primary motivation.

Also, as a note, if one reads [Discipline and Punish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish), Foucault doesn't talk about minorities but of the prison system as a normalizing force in general. However, I think it's a pretty clear connection to the normalization and control of minorities.

The States are legally capable of making their own EPAs. So Alaska is in charge of Alaska, Virginia is in control of Virginia, and California is in charge of California.

I know a lot of people dismiss that, but the fact is it's also quite similar to how the European Union operates. The countries involved(analogous to US states) are responsible for their own testing and determine their own rate of use for their own resources.

If you just eliminated the EPA and made no attempt to fill that gap, yes, that would probably be a bad thing in many cases. But that's not *generally* what people advocate for.

There's the very real alternative possibility that more government action could have made us better off over the past few years of recession, with relatively little cost even far out into the future.

[deleted],t5_2cneq,c4ik6zn,1,0,t3_sycgb,0,True,"&gt;There was no need to step one toe on mainland Japan to ensure their absolute defeat.

I asked you what you would do, and your response was ""no need to invade"".

Alright, fine, but that wasn't what I asked.

*What would you do?*

Because the options are

(1)Stop fighting and not extend the same terms to Japan that you did to Germany.

(2)Stop fighting.  Just pack up and go home.

(3)Continue bombing campaign and blockade.

(4)Continue just blockade.

(5)Force an invasion without the bombing/blockade campaign.

(6)Frce an invasion with the bombing/blackade campaign.

The first two are going to be politically unlikely, to say the least.  It's a big ""fuck you"" to all the servicemen who served in the war so far, it's a ""fuck you"" to our allies, and it's a ""fuck you"" to the Chinese...and China is the reason we got into a war with Japan!

Combined Bombing/blockade campaign minimizes American loss of life while maximizes pressure applied.  It erodes their industrial capability and, by the way, helps ensure that the Japanese people have a lingering famine that will kill millions.

Just blockading gives you the lingering famine that will kill millions, but without the destruction of industrial capabilities, except for the mass death of workers, of course.

So, now we're at invasion.  

If we decide to end the bombing campaign and the blockade for ""humanitarian"" reasons, then we are drastically improving the ability of the Japanese to kill a lot of Allied servicemen.  Good luck telling the American people that.

Prepare for an invasion combined with the bombing/blockade is what we went with.  And, by the way, *it worked*.

So, what would you do?

&gt;If it were me, I might not have left the Chrysanthemum Throne in place.

Then you were denying the **one** condition the Japanese wanted, which we proved flexible on.   This means invasion or the obliteration of the Japanese people through blockade/bombing.

&gt;Would not have felt the need to demonstrate weapons for Stalin using the Japanese people. 

Making a weapons demonstration to Stalin had excactly dick to do with the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  It had to do with the Joint Chiefs and Truman unwilling to order an invasion of Japan without doing everything politically possible to head it off.  The idea that it was done for a ""demonstration"" came a decade later in Eisenhowers recollections, and that came from a conversation he had had with Stimson that Stimson remembers much differently.  In fact in July of 45 Eisenhower said in a letter to a friend that ""he had not the slightest idea of what was going to happen in the Pacific"", as he didn't have access to Pacific ULTRA and MAGIC intel. 

As it is, the Atomic Bombings were widely regard as the same thing as the area firebombings...just using one bomber instead of several hundred.

&gt;My grandfather was an engineer building airfields off the coast of Japan then. He described the construction of twentyfive bases that could each field a wing of twentyfive B-29s. The Japanese had lost practically everything that flew. So absolute air supremacy is achieved in sky-darkening numbers over an island nation, completely dependent on a far-flung empire that had already been captured. 

So?

That is absolutely immaterial to the tactics and strategy at hand.  Indeed, by '45 the Japanese had switched most of their ADA production to higher altitude guns, and part of the reason the firebombing campaign was so effective was because it required dropping the flight ceiling from over 20,000 ft down to 2,000ft.  The Japanese couldn't hit the B-29s because all their ammo was primed to detonate about 20,000 ft above them! 

Remember, the goal here is to end the war in accordance with the Potsdam declaration.  So just because the Japanese can no longer challenge the air doesn't mean it's time to stop bombing industrial targets to pieces.  Especially if you're still planning on making the largest amphibious invasion in history in the Fall.

&gt;Quibble over the meaning of atrocity if you like.  Float your theory of collective innocence for the perpetrators, too, if you want.

Ha!

You're just pissed that I called BS on you throwing ""atrocity"" around like it's meaningful in the context we're talking about.

All of the belligerents were in a state of total war.  So, the ones who commit the ""least amount"" of atrocities were the ones who were taking care to avoid unnesscary suffering in order to meet war aims.  Guess what?  There were only two organizations in the entire war that met that criteria.  One was 8th Air Force in Europe(the B-17s) and the other was 20th Air Force under LeMay(the B-29s).  Everyone else was about an order of magnitude more cavalier in the deaths of innocents, or commiting war crimes such as not taking prisoners.

Your whole argument seems to be ""The USAAF would not halt bombing industrial targets if they couldn't make sure they wouldn't kill civilians, therefore it's a war crime.""  This is baloney.  I can totally tell you're some kid who thinks that bombing in the 1940s was exactly like it was in the 1990s or today, where 99% of the ordnance dropped are guided munitions.

food comes down to nutrient density versus anti-nutrients and the like contained within each item. the profile of each item should be such that there exists the greatest amount of nutrient density and the least amount of anti-nutrients, so to speak. in broccoli there are goitrogens, in apple seeds cyanide, in alfalfa aflatoxin, in industrialized meats potential carcinogens, etc. etc. of course, if you steam broccolli, for instance, you can diminish the amount of goitrogens in it, same with spinach - as i understand it - i don't eat much of either, in fact. additionally, grass fed meat does not have the same issues that meat from cafo's has. further grass fed meat is more nutrient dense. so differences in food processing before you buy it and after effect nutrient density and anti-nutrient quantities, so to speak, again. 

the diet you described is primarily grain based and thus high carb, high starch and consequently high glycemic. vegetables can be high starch too i.e. corn. afflatoxin in peanut butter in tandem with industrialized meat, if i recall, was detailed in the china study as a potent carcinogen. at any rate, something to be more than a little bit mindful of. 

real simple list of essential nutrient dense foods:
fermented cod liver oil - see green pastures 
high vitamin butter from grass fed cows
grass fed beef/wild alaskan salmon 
organic kale, collard greens, chard, romaine, parsley everyday with every meal
yogurt that has no added thickeners of any kind i.e. seven stars everyday 32oz per person
vitamin d from the sun between 10am - 3pm as much exposure of skin as possible for like 30 minutes. in addition to that and esp. if lacking that alaskan salmon weekly along with a vitamin d supp and/or cod liver oil as mentioned above.
variety of other vegetables i.e. mushrooms, onions, cucumbers daily
additional supplementation of other fermented foods for their probiotic content + other advantages
water filtered of fluoride and chlorine at least

of course, your own biological inheritance, so to speak, will effect things so adjust accordingly
i.e. asians can probably eat higher carb diets, certain northern europeans can tolerate dairy more so, etc.

page 2...

&gt; By contrast, Figure 2 – which shows comparable data for 1990 – offers no  comparably easy interpretation: Britain both imported and exported mainly manufactured goods. One might have hoped that a look within the manufacturing sector would reveal a clearer pattern, but this brings us to the issue of intra-industry trade: trade in manufactured goods, especially between countries at similar levels of development, consists to a large extent of two-way exchanges within even narrowly defined product categories.

as you can see, the entire foundation of his paper is the analysis of why countries would import and export the same goods.  but his explanation falls short on several vital counts.  first, he does not take into the account the MASSIVE bias towards cheap importation created by British direct and proxy imperialism - the words ""empire"" and ""imperial"" do not even appear in this paper.  second, he does not taken into account individual market-selection behavior in choosing goods, and instead chooses to analyze only abstract trends, in order to support his argument with cherry-picked evidence which is incompatible with the basic facts about human nature.  more on this as i go...

&gt; It shouldn’t have been that hard to make sense of similar-similar trade.  Indeed, for some economists it wasn’t. In his seminal paper on the rise of intra-industry trade in Europe, Balassa (1966) stated it quite clearly: each country produced only part of the range of potential products within each industry, importing those goods it did not produce, because “specialization in narrower ranges of machinery and intermediate products will permit the exploitation of economies of scale through the lengthening of production runs.”  Yet this straightforward-seeming explanation of similar-similar trade was not at all part of the standard corpus of international trade theory circa 1975.  It was not so much that these ideas were rejected as that they seemed incom-
prehensible. Why?

&gt; The answer was that unexhausted economies of scale at the firm level necessarily imply imperfect competition, and there were no readily usable models of imperfect competition to hand. Even more to the point, there were no general equilibrium models of imperfect competition readily to hand – and trade theory, perhaps more than any other applied field of economics, is built around general equilibrium analysis.

the entire history of economics has been a study of systems with imperfect competition - economics is concerned primarily with the study of how human behavior exploits *demand* for a given economic *solution* because of the various profit motives and altruistic motives possessed by humans.  any system in equilibrium, by its nature, possesses forces in opposition to each other - an economic system in disequilibrium, in particular, inevitably tends towards equilibrium, unless an artificial force suppresses that equilibrium (for example, government patent laws forbidding the adoption of a new technology, except for the holder of the patent).  Krugman here tries to brush aside much of the history of human economics in order to support his theory.

&gt;  But the algebra said otherwise, and the intuition followed. 
Increasing returns provide an incentive to concentrate production of any one product in a single location; given this incentive to concentrate, transport costs are minimized by choosing a location close to the largest market, and this location then exports to other markets.

ignores the process of competitive distribution on the onset of a new technology - why?  simple - his theory is trying to provide an artificial explanation for the creation of a highly super-equilibrium monopoly, such as a multinational corporation, and he does not wish to explore political causes for that phenomenon.  this is typical of Krugman - trying to sweep away blame for government policies by associating them with ""free markets"" and ""trade liberalization"".

&gt; In this model we consider the location decision of a single producer serving two markets. We assume that the producer has fixed sales of S, S* units of a good in the two markets, with S&gt;S*. And it must pay a transport cost of τ for each unit shipped from one location to the other. The producer has the option of having either one or two plants; by opening a second plant, the producer can eliminate transport costs but must pay an extra fixed cost F.  Clearly, if the producer opens only one plant, it will be in the larger market.   But will it concentrate production? Only if F &gt; τS*.

&gt; It goes without saying that this little exposition ignores market structure, pricing, the elasticity of demand, and more. But we know that we can put those things back in by doing a full Dixit-Stiglitz, and the cheat version conveys the essential intuition: if economies of scale, as captured by F/S*, are large enough compared to transport costs, production will be geographically concentrated, and that concentration will, other things equal, be in the  larger market.

&gt; From there it’s an obvious, short step (which for some reason took me a decade to take) to a model of geographical concentration of factors of production. Think now of a world in which there are many firms making the same kind of choice I just described, and also in which some but not all resources are mobile. Let S be the size of the overall market, μ be the share of that market attributable to “footloose” production, and suppose that there are two symmetric locations. Then we can think of a possible equilibrium in which all the footloose factors concentrate in one place. In that case the other location – the smaller market – would demand S(1 – μ)/2 units of our representative good. 
And this concentration of production would be self-sustaining if   F &gt; τS (1 – μ)/2, or F/S &gt; τ(1 – μ)/2. So that’s our criterion for the creation of a self-sustaining concentration of production in space.

an analysis of geographic modes of production with a *two-point* analysis in Euclidean space?  just a few pages back he was criticizing economists for using unrealistic examples, and this is what he comes back with.  

in reality, a ""self-sustaining concentration of production in space"" does not continue unabated, because real-life economies of scale have major limits because transportation costs, especially in high-technology environments, tend to rapidly exceed the costs of local production.  local farmers with some degree of machinery tend to produce higher quality products at near-comparable price to multinational farmers, once a few factors are removed from the equation - namely, government subsidies on oil and agriculture (not 'tax break subsidies', but artificial subsidies due to warfare fought to gain oil reserves) government bias in legal disputes, and (sometimes government-assisted) union-busting.  this model of price-determination is highly unrealistic - he seems to be shaping his theory around predetermined conclusions.  what's more, there is no distinction between ""mobile"" and ""non-mobile"" goods - he is trying to cut shades of gray into black and white.  goods have relative ""mobility"" due to factors like value relative to ease of transportation...

the conclusion he draws from this is as follows:

 &gt; 1. A self-sustaining concentration of production in space can occur if economies of scale (F/S) are large, transport costs low, and enough production is mobile.

this is like claiming a balloon will inflate non-stop if someone blows into it.  in reality, their lungs cannot continually exhale.  economies of scale have  strict limits due to the locality  of production and the tendency of technologies and modes of production to be distributed to new firms due to the presence of *profit motive*.

&gt; 2 . Which location gets the concentration of production is arbitrary, and can be presumed to be a function of initial conditions or historical accident.

the concentration of production is a product of relative cost, and is a calculated decision by individuals, not a random ""accident"".  this ignorance is extreme.

&gt; As in the case of the new trade theory, a willingness to focus on tractable special cases was of the essence. In Fujita, Krugman, and Venables (1999) we described our method as “Dixit-Stiglitz, icebergs, evolution, and the computer”: we used Dixit-Stiglitz-type models to handle increasing returns and imperfect competition, “iceberg” transport costs that are proportional to fob prices, simple adaptive dynamics to arrive at equilibria, and numerical simulation to deal with models that tended to be just past the edge of paper-and-pencil analysis. 

of course, he immediately follows this hugely ignorant passage with insane ranting about his own work, including an association with a theory enjoying immense popularity - the theory of evolution.  it's hard to tell if he's not just trying to get people to like him.

finally, he ends his paper like this:

&gt;Whether the influence of increasing returns on trade and geography is rising or falling, one thing is clear: much was learned from the intellectual revolution that brought increasing returns into the heart of how we think about the world economy. It wasn’t just that economists could make sense of previously puzzling data, we found ourselves able to see things that had previously been in an intellectual blind spot. Many people contributed to this process of enlightenment; I’m proud to have been a part of the journey.

amazing how he attributes the entire centralization of production to a ""**historical accident**"", and then claims to have been a part of the ""journey"" of ""see[ing] things that had previously been in an intellectual blind spot"".

[Edit:]  The summer between high school and college, a friend and I backpacked around Europe. Three months, and I hardly spoke to anybody but him.  I have some photos and a few memories, but that's about it.  I'm over 50 now, and last month I took my pack and went to Marrakesh.  Knowing Morocco is not the richest country, I took two old computers with me (in a carry-on sized back pack and a day bag).  I gave one to the front desk guy at my hotel, and another to a really nice guy who ran a cyber cafe.  Both were thrilled to get the gifts, and I immediately had a friend at the hotel.  I'm now working on more computers that I can ship to Abdel at the cyber cafe.  One guy made my trip much better, and I now have the opportunity to make someone else's life better.

There is also a lot of Christian mythology in fantasy. That's where you get the heavy focus on prophecy, the showdown between the forces of good, and the minions of ""Ultimate Evil."" Also why ""Ultimate good"" is a no-show, since he works ""through the hearts of the righteous."" 

For example, early Christians foretold that at the end of times, [Gog and Magog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog) will be released upon the world, and the nations of man will fall before them like wheat before the sickle.

&gt; I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished.[Rev 20:1-3]

And in that time, the last Roman Emperor shall reunite all of the faithfull against the agents of Satan and the anti-Christ, and he shall do battle with them. And upon the hill of Golgotha, where the son of god himself was crucified, he shall be smoten down by the agents of evil.

But fear not! For his death shall signal the second coming of Christ. In that time the Heavenly Jerusalem shall descend to earth, and all of the faithful shall receive salvation, and be elevated to paradise. The rest shall be damned, to burn in the fiery hell of their making for all eternity.

...Like...seriously. How much of that sounds like it could basically be straight out of a fantasy novel. That entire Revelations quote is basically straight out of WoT's backstory. It's *because* fantasy is so steeped in the European, and thus necessarily the Christian, mindset that we get these stories rehashed over and over again. I doubt many authors even realize what they're drawing on.


Anyways, what I was talking about with familiarity had more to do with the reader's familiarity than the characters. Even in books like Tad William's *Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn*, where the elves are not at all familiar with the characters, when we finally meet them they were so generic that that feeling of mystery is heavily diluted. They're so overused that there's just no mystery anymore, no wonder. It's just like ""oh, sup Legolas. Haven't seen you in a while. How are things?""

That was something that RA Salvatore did really well when he wrote about the Drow (though, being based in WotC's Forgotten Realm's universe it's hard to say how much of the credit he should get). The Drow society was very much unlike the elves you regularly see in fantasy. Their world is harsh, cruel, and alien. That made it fascinating, in a way that you don't get with yet-another race of forest elves with bows and long blonde hair, or dwarves with scottish accents and excellent metalworking skills.",,1335839433,1428830566,Fantasy,1,0,t1_c4ikvkf,t1_c4iivnu,True,False,,,

I agree.  And while I do not agree entirely with heritage’s, I know of none better.  Plenty of people use the index, many of them not on the right.  Do you have a better one?

&gt;It takes one set of policies (Heritage's favored tax policies) and measures them along with other measures which Heritage opposes, but it's implicitly a demonstration of how happy, awesome countries follow Heritage's advice and so everyone should.

Whether they do that or not is, again, irrelevant to the question of whether or not it is a good index.  Indeed, the fact that they include policies that they do not advocate as freedom should be a mark in their favor, not against them, when trying to decide if they are engaged in a genuine scholarly effort or not.

&gt;Are you at all familiar with the 'anti-government' rhetoric coming from the most highly-regarded pulpits of the right? 

I do not judge the entire left by the likes of Al Sharpton or Maxine Waters.  You should extend the same courtesy to the right.

&gt;That's a false dichotomy, and the index doesn't measure ""statism"", not really. 

It measures state involvement in the economy.  While not exactly statism, it is a good proxy.

&gt;It's analogous to taking a situation in which there's regulatory capture, and saying that clearly the problem is the existence of regulation.

Regulation ALWAYS generates regulatory capture to a greater or lesser degree.  The more restrictive the regulation, the more incentive to do so. Pretending that this is not the case is no more a solution than anarchism is.

&gt;I have no idea how that's being calculated, so I don't know what the real numbers are for the rest of the countries, but the values for the United States are wrong
The numbers are from the OEDC, hardly a right wing extremist organization.  Similar results are reproduced [here]( http://imgur.com/WSQSq) by different methods.  This is exactly what we would expect.  The US relies among a highly progressive income tax for the bulk of its revenue, supplementing with various less progressive taxes.  Europe relies on far less progressive VATs for most of their revenue supplementing them with smaller more progressive taxes.  

&gt;I'd hazard a guess that the Tax Foundation, which tends to conflate 'tax' with 'federal income tax', made a similar mistake there.

Again, no.  A common trick, but not what is happening here. And it is an OECD study not tax foundation.

Of the meager examples listed in that article, at least 4 were intersex, (which means they were probably not trying to trick anyone, since many people don't know they are intersex until they get their chromosomes tested) two of the athletes were women living and competing as their birth sex at the time of the competitions and had a sex change to male later, and one athlete mentioned in the article, Renée Richards, appears to have been a transsexual who transitioned to female before competing.

There is only one person in that entire article who appeared to be purposely deceiving people in order to compete.

&gt;Prior to the advent of sexual verification tests, German athlete Dora Ratjen competed in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin and placed fourth in the women's high jump. She later competed and set a world record for the women's high jump at the 1938 European Championships before tests by the German police concluded that she was actually a man who then took the name Heinrich Ratjen.

And again, doesn't say if this person was on hormones and was serious about transitioning, or if they were a crossdresser.  Do you even read the articles you link as your sources?

&gt;Not to mention that people retain their strength even after assuming a different gender identity

Muscles don't magically disappear when you start on hormones, it takes time and some transwomen want to speed it up for obvious reasons.  But they will lose it over time unless they were to work out twice as hard, and building new muscle mass would be just as hard as for a genetic woman.  So, you are correct in saying a MTF would have an advantage over a genetic women if she had *just* started HRT.  After a couple years that advantage would be gone.

I don't have an opinion either way on transsexuals joining the military, so I won't comment on that.",,1335843042,1428831022,AskReddit,1,0,t1_c4ilp5h,t1_c4il7cu,True,False,,,

bithead,t5_2qh53,c4immmn,62,0,t3_t0p4z,0,True,"My dad had a cousin who was a soldier in the German 6th army.  He participated in most of the 6th's major campaigns, and did show me a pic of him in paris after  what must have been a difficult experience, because he looked ready to shoot whoever took the pic.  At one point he was shot in the head and sent back, just before the battle of Stalingrad.  At the end of the war, after Berlin fell, his unit kept fighting in the hope Patton would come through and re-arm them to fight the Soviets.  Even if he didn't, it was believed among them that the USA treated their POWs far better than the Soviets, and in the end they did willingly surrender to what they though to be US soldiers, but were actually Soviets dressed as US soldiers. 

He was taken to a Soviet labor camp.   Worked hard and barely fed, german soldiers died in droves.  At one point, a soviet soldier took pity on him and gave him half a potato.  The other guards beat that soldier severely.   He (my dad's cousin) was beaten as well, and was no longer able to work much, having been too badly beaten.  Finally, too sick to work at all and too stubborn to die, he and a group of remaining POWs were shipped back to Berlin in a boxcar.  According to him, they were packed into that boxcar so tight those who died on the trip back - which was most of the occupants according to him - could not fall to the floor.  He spent months in a hospital, and when he was well enough to leave, he went back to the family farm near Bromberg, only to find what he described as mass rape and genocide committed by the Soviet army.  He finally determined that his wife had somehow escaped to Canada, and he followed.  When I met him, they were living in Edmonton.

I can't verify anything of what he said, and my dad translated much of it as his (the cousin's) english wasn't very good, and I tend to take his story with a grain of salt.  After all, he was still convinced the Poles started the war.  However, I have no reason to believe he made up his story.  It was fascinating to hear an account from the other side, so to speak.

As an aside, my dad had another good friend who was a fighter pilot in the European theater (USAF) who was shot down and spent over a year in a German POW camp.  He was impressed with how well educated and alert even low ranking guards were, and absolutely hated the TV show ""Hogan's Heros"".

[deleted],t5_2qhqb,c4in1js,1,0,t3_szilf,0,False,"&gt;Where are all these technologies that are cheaper than linux?

Operating systems run applications that do important stuff, applications that may have been running for many years and are 
perfectly efficient at what they do having been designed, developed and tested and implemented over many years that are understood by the people that use them. Things that work perfectly fine, that do  all kinds of important stuff and non-important stuff. That run on a variety of platforms for a good reason, because they are the best platforms to run them on. 

Thats the reality, to try to force linux and open source software in to replace-it-all is a nonsense. An operating system is one component of a million of other highly integrated systems. Operating systems aren't terribly expensive compared to everything else that sits around and integrates with them. 

The reason companies like to go with as homogenous a solution as is possible is simply the practicality, you are dealing with one vendor  and a single vertical architecture. 

Sure linux is free, but if you want a professional suppport service it costs, so you dont deploy zoobuntoo you deploy red hat.

Sysadmins need 24 hour round the clock support by experts who know the experts on the database team or the the experts on the email server team, where you arent having to deal with different companies when critical systems stop working. 

&gt;China, India and Brazil are developing world countries and have invested in linux because of its low costs. Ever read about the frustration of microsoft trying to get Chinese companies to pay for their relatively expensive software?

This is Britain and Europe we are talking about and the real world with real IT systems that do a plethora of life impacting functions, that run on software stacks that have been proven over many years that are known and understood by the users. 

It's simply ridiculous to suggest everyone has to replace everything with open source because its free. 

&gt;One of the advantages of linux is its ability to run well on old and cheap hardware. As security support for old microsoft software dies, linux looks like an ever more attractive option.

Not in my datacentre, we discount hardware properly and get rid of it when its out of date because it becomes a maintenance headache  and increasingly costly to maintain as spares become harder to source as manufacturers end of life them. What kind of world do you live in? I dont know what kind of outdated crap you have running you organisations, not actually a compelling argument in the real world.

&gt;Linux does not need license management. You can use linux on a million computers without paying anyone anything in license costs.

And in organisations that have to do real things in the real world you need software support agreements that include people from  paying  thousands of suppliers and  integrating with other systems that arent open source and work in weird and wonderful ways to paying the little lollipop lady in cash from the office because she doesnt have a bank account but everybody loves her because shes the best lollipop lady in the world.

&gt;Can you really claim that windows 7 is mature and well integrated? By the time a company is running in it, windows 8 will probably be released. Linux doesn't have this problem, you can upgrade as updates are produced without having to pay at all.

You dont pay for security updates on windows either.  Just saying like.....are you on crack....:?

In any integrated IT system you dont just install updates willy nilly, you plan them, you test them, you develop rollback plans, you test the  rollback plans, and you make sure you do things in the right order so highly integrated systems dont break. In the real world...

&gt; Linux admins can manage more hardware and software and are paid only slightly more. So, they work out being more cost effective.

TCO is probably about the same.
There really isnt a cost benefit its just simply open source mantra from people who copy other peoples ideas. If open source took over, there wouldnt be any new ideas, open source isn't innovative its like a leech off the closed source world. The open source community is too busy stealing other peoples ideas and fixing bugs to actually drive innovation. Companies like Microsoft and Apple and Oracle and HP and Cisco and Intel hire the finest brightest minds to work on their products.  These are the innovators not the guys in their bedrooms trying to be like them.  

Why change the world and systems that do real stuff just because of mantra...the reasons have to be utterly compelling and so does the software, and  there is a reason that open source systems wont take over it is integration.

Sun btw would change Java from one version to the next in such a way applications developed for the previous version stop working completely with the new version. This left applications no longer just not upgradeable, apps developed on one version couldn't use the same physical computer system as an app developed for a later version. Everything had to be redeveloped from the old version to the new.   Causing no end of chaos.

Operating systems, databases, email systems, web servers, these things are all highly connected if you change one tiny element things stop working, and the problem with getting multiple systems from multiple vendors is having multiple companies to call multiple contracts to sign multiple maintenace agreements to maintain, this is why IT departments prefer to stick with a single homogenous platform, open source isnt a platform, its a bunch of different bits of software written companies,  when you need something fixed you want one number to call and you want to deal with someone who knows the intricacies of your business because you pay for his services, these people are called Technical Account Managers, they are the interface between a software vendor and a business, they understand what you do as a business and they are someone to call if the shit hits the fan, you pay for them, they arent cheap but they are invaluable and can represent your business to a software company thats dealing with a million other businesses, as an IT department, I want as few of these as possible because it simplifies everything, simplification is the key to successful computing, complexity is a bitch, if I have an application issue I want to call Microsoft or IBM I dont want to have to call mysql and redhat and oracle and a load of suppliers. 

&gt;Linux doesn't have this problem, you can upgrade as updates are produced without having to pay at all.

There is no free ride, that my dear is a nonsense and TCO between Windows and Linux is about the same, its not compelling enough to sweep by all that has gone before it for A BRAVE NEW WORLD,just say no to crack....

&gt;  Microsoft cuts support for their software after a given time period and companies that use their software are entirely reliant on this one entity to maintain support.

For a very good reason it becomes more expensive for everyone involved to have to maintain different revisions of software. Old software becomes an increasing security risk, maintaining lots of versions of software introduces unnecessary complexity. 

You tend to know what is about to happen well in advance and plan it properly, its no different with open source systems except you now have more vendors upgrading at different schedules and a lot more integration testing that you have to do. 

And if things don't work you get the inevitable teleconferences between different back covering IT vendors, and programmers going wtf, youre not supposed to do that, that not our problem its yours, no its yours. Oh how much fun I've had on those dreary telephone calls that go on for days and weeks on end with managers threatening, developers arguing and engineers on site scratching their heads, and at the end they work out who got what wrong and fix it. Dealing with one company makes things a lot simpler, application architectures developed for a homogenous platform tend to be better integrated and tested.

&gt; This means that if a company wants to keep up with security updates it has to upgrade both its microsoft software and its hardware. This is expensive and these costs would be much lower with linux.For example, IIS7 is only available for windows vista and up.

IIS runs on Windows Server primarily. 

IIS7 was a complete functional rewrite involved the http listener being moved into  kernel mode for performance.
They decided to modify the OS in order to rewrite it, this isnt something typical

&gt;And yet most prefer the open source LAMP framework.

In the linux world yes. Important stuff, like banks tend to stick with Microsoft if they are a Microsoft shop.  

&gt; Expensive licensing.

For things like algorithms and software components, drivers, specialist things that they know that other companies have developed, but they pay properly to license and use. 

You have to ask the question if I design something and I don't offer it for free, if this is my livelihood, is it actually OK for someone else to just copy and steal my ideas? I don't think so personally. Cross licensing agreements have always happened within the industry.  There have been lots of partners that got acccess to the whole Microsoft code base, back when NT4 was written they encouraged innovation by giving the NT3.51 source code away to innovators to do innovative stuff with, which is where Citrix came from. Microsoft eventually fucked them when they tried to do the same thing on later releases, but that's neither here nor there,  it has become a very successful company. It was common for Microsoft to have other vendors develop stuff that wasn't their area of expertise.",,1335849602,1428831656,unitedkingdom,1,0,t1_c4in1js,t1_c4ic5y3,True,False,,,

&gt;I agree with you whole heartedly. But you do know that, if only well- informed people could vote (such as, say, a test), it would overwhelmingly favor whites and consequently the Republican party. Taking tests to vote was outlawed during the civil rights era so more blacks could vote.

&gt;Of course I can say it on anonomously on the internet.

&gt;But could I say it as, say, a college professor? A politician? Of course not. Are you honestly saying a public figure can discuss racial differences in intelligence and not face major public outrage?

&gt;Poverty does not equal crime. How many White and Asian flash mobs do you see, or even Hispanic flash mobs. Some of the poorest communities in America are Chinatowns, and yet there is hardly any violent crime, especially compared to black areas. California has a substantial population of very poor asian immigrants, and yet the prisons have a negligible asian population.

&gt;Just to make another point, how can one argue that the justice system is biased toward blacks, since any city with a substantial black population has a black police chief , black D.As, black juries and black judges, and the head of the Justice department is black, not to mention the President...

&gt;How on earth does racism affect the black community? They have a black mayor, black police, black teachers, black school principles, etc etc.

&gt;In black schools, all they learn about are black leaders and black history, and teachers go out of their way to teach self esteeeeeem and any other hairbrained scheme that some idiot has come up with... and of course they never work.

&gt;The people who experience real racism in Philly are Asians - Google South Philly high school attacks on Asians. They don't have Asian police, teachers, mayors, or other Philly Asian rolemodels, and are constantly victims of violence and racism at the hands of blacks. Nevertheless, within a generation they are middle and uppermiddle class and doing better than the average American.

&gt;Blacks need to quit making fucking excuses for themselves.

&gt;Europeans constantly mock America for how religious we are, but they have a much bigger problem brewing in their own backyard.

&gt;I really think political correctness is one of the worst evils in society. Europe is currently being overrun by these Muslims, they spit on the people and the culture, and everyone is afraid to do anything about it because of 'racism'.

&gt;I am actually quite optimistic that Europe will eventually close its borders or start kicking people out. But I am afraid that once they realise how bad Muslim immigration is, it will be too late.

&gt;No one wants to say it, but it is because of the high percentage of black and hispanic residents of the south. It is easy to say, ""hey, look at how smart and charitable my state is!"" when your state is 90% white. One area the south does poorly in is education. For example, white students in Texas score higher than white students in Wisconsin, black Texas students higher than black Wisconsonites - but lower than their white counterparts - and same goes for hispanics.

No. The reason you think we exclusively target you is because the vast majority of atheist redditors live in the western world. Christians make up the religious majorities (if not super-majorities) in most of our countries, they're the biggest threat to our societies, and most of the theists we deal with every day (friends/family/classmates/coworkers) are Christian.

So yes, we focus on you. But not exclusively, and not because we think Christianity is somehow worse than Islam, Judaism, or any other belief in the supernatural.

For example, here's the [Friendly Atheist](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/), one of the most popular Atheist blogs on the net. Just going back through the last month or so, you can find the following headlines:

* ""At Global Atheist Convention, Islamic Protesters Have No Power""
* ""This Picture of a Muslim Woman Holding a Bra Is Not Offensive""
* ""Anti-Muslim Group Wants to Run FFRF-Like Ad in New York Times; NYT Says No""

* ""Muslim Attacks Atheist for Wearing Muhammad Costume… and Judge Lets Him Get Away With It""
* ""Sam Harris: We Should Profile Muslims at the Airport""

A: What's called libertarianism in the United States is a significant deviation from traditional libertarian thought. Traditionally, say in Europe, ""libertarian"" meant the anti-state wing of the socialist party. In the United States, ""libertarian"" means ultra-capitalist; it means permitting capitalist institutions to function essentially without constraint, or virtually with no constraint. That's a recipe for one of the worst kinds of tyranny that exists: unaccountable corporate tyranny. Take a look at individual libertarians -- say Ron Paul. He may be perfectly sincere, but as I read his programs and other programs of the Libertarian Party or the Cato Institute and so on, they essentially would give free rein to unaccountable concentrations of private power. And that's about the worst kind of tyranny you can imagine. Whatever government is -- say our government -- it's to some extent accountable to the public, and the public can compel it to be fairly accountable, at least in principle. That's why we have things like New Deal reforms and so on: It's public pressure. On the other hand, you and I can say nothing about the policies of Goldman Sachs or General Electric. In principle, our only relationship to those institutions is to consume what they produce or to serve them as an obedient work force. We can maybe own some shares, but that's meaningless given the concentration of shareholding. So they're essentially unaccountable to the public except through a regulatory apparatus that can be developed through the state in our society, which can somewhat tame the excesses and destructive capacities of these institutions.

This requires nuance to answer, but each person has their own reasons to participate. My own support for the movement is based in a recognition that a significant portion of government, both elected and unelected, has become little more than a reflection of the extraordinarily wealthy plutocrats that more or less bribe officials for favorable actions. This is expressed in tax, trade and regulatory policy.

Fully explaining the details of this corruption would take a small book. I think most people see the basics of which I speak especially if one is well educated in the topics by which I mean possessing knowledge not simply derived from a 'trusted' authority. Some only see government as the problem. Occupy generally recognizes this is incomplete and that rather a symbiotic relationship between them exists as politicians/bureaucrats, the media industry and the wealthy who buy them off feed each others power. Occupy generally seeks to expose this corruption so that the 99%(really 99.99%) of us not part of their game may wrestle power back to the people.

&gt;To protest rich people when they're the main ones paying America's taxes?

This is a logical fallacy Strawman typically sourced to specific forms of media often spread by word of mouth by those that consume said media. This is also an incredibly weak method of analysis of the equity of the tax code. I know far more than is typical about taxes, though I am not a CPA or tax attorney. Not so long ago I wrote several paragraphs on Reddit about this very topic based on a few lines from a similarly long post by another. I don't want to go into such depth now.

However, on this point let me say it is perfectly reasonable to expect a group of individuals that obtain the vast majority of wealth and income to also pay taxes at the very least in line with that proportion. It's simple mathematics, even in the instance of a flat tax for this to be the case. Though as Adam Smith himself advocated in the Wealth of Nations one would expect that proportion to be greater were the progressive tax code actually working as intended. Unfortunately, due to capital gains rates and loopholes disproportionately favoring a particular class(the rich). Rather we actually have a regressive tax code where as income approaches infinity ones rate approaches ~15% rather than the top marginal rate of 35%.

&gt;What about protesting the government's taxation of gasoline?

You are aware this is a large source of funds for the infrastructure on which that gasoline is consumed that is actually unable to meet its maintenance obligations as it stands? We have to pay for things and I fail to see how a consumption tax which supports the infrastructure it depends upon is unjustified. Even then the real price of gasoline is quite obscured by the other spending we do in externalities, petroleum security, etc.

&gt;Or they're unwillingness to cut spending...

Austerity is questionably of value and always dependent upon the type, pace and scale of application. Though I think there are a few hundred billion which would be well cut from some places, namely global militarism fed by the propaganda of fear and reductions in benefits through means testing of the boomer generations demographic time bomb.

For far too long the generations in control have been unwilling to adequately fund the debt obligations incurred by themselves and their predecessors. It's coming time to pay those bills and the elder generations, often well to do, still don't want to pay the check for their wars, tax expenditures and social benefits financed through payroll taxes. Instead their solution is to keep their benefits and cut them for the rest of us while the working generation pays the bills. It's outrageous when one understands how these systems work and the effected targets of so many proposed austerity measures.

&gt;What will happen if business have to pay more taxes or whatever 'Occupy' is all about? Are they going to hire more people? Pay them better? Pfft, no. Not a chance. They're going to either cheapen their products, fire people and put more work load on the remaining people, or they're going to just move shop over to some place that doesn't suck to be a business owner.

Raising corporate tax rates is rarely in the discussions from what I gather. The taxes which are often discussed are in regards to tax expenditures, loopholes if you will, which favor specific segments when there are bills to be paid. This is not talked about in isolation and frankly isn't even the central thesis of the movement for most. In regards to Wall Street in particular I think prosecution of criminally fraudulent behavior and an indictment of their corrupting myopic sociopathic pursuits is the target.

&gt;Start a business of your own that embraces the 'honest capitalist' market (which exist, as seen in a lot of indie video game companies).

There's a strong current of cooperative business involvement influencing various occupations and growing from their memberships. There is a momentum to establish alternatives, one of which you might be aware of was bank transfer day moving ones money from the TARP banks toward local banks and credit unions instead. However, these efforts executed in an era of corrupt captured government only achieve so much the symbiotic organism seeks to stomp out the competition. Such are the realities of Corporatism, which I see as an embryonic state of fascism which may precede the authoritarian variety that plagued Europe some 80 odd years ago.

The mean intelligence of blacks is much lower than for whites. The least intelligent ten percent of whites have IQs below 81; forty percent of blacks have IQs that low. Only one black in six is more intelligent than the average white; five whites out of six are more intelligent than the average black.

They are reflected in countless everyday situations. “Life is an IQ test.” http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/foreclosures-by-race-and-ethnicity.html

There is a huge academic literature on the gaps in cognitive test results, practically all of it converging on the fact that African American mean scores on cognitive tests fall below the white means by a tad more than one white standard deviation. There is in fact so much data on this now that we have meta-studies — studies of the studies: the one best-known to me is the meta-study by Roth et al. in 2001, which covered 39 studies involving nearly six million test-takers. That one standard deviation on cognitive testing has been so persistent across so many decades, an academic sociologist, calls it ""the fundamental constant of American sociology"" — it's like the speed of light in physics.

The APA believes that IQ scores have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement.IQ scores have predictive validity for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled.IQ scores predict future achievement equally well for blacks,latinos and whites.

As far as intelligence being a heritable trait. Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.9. A 1996 statement by the American Psychological Association gave about .45 for children and about .75 during and after adolescence.A 2004 meta-analysis of reports in Current Directions in Psychological Science gave an overall estimate of around .85 for 18-year-olds and older. The New York Times Magazine has listed about three quarters as a figure held by the majority of studies.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve

According to the Bell Curve IQ levels from highest to lowest:Ashkenazi Jews, East Asians, Whites, Indians, Latinos........Blacks

Although James Watson earned a share in a Nobel Prize for his work on the structure of DNA, he ruffled more than a few feathers last October when he said, “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours—whereas all the testing says not really.”

Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis

The book claims to represent the largest collection and review of the global Intelligence Quotient (IQ) data, surveying 620 published studies from around the world, with a total of 813,778 tested individuals. Lynn's meta-analysis lists East Asians (IQ 105), Europeans (100), Inuit (91), South East Asians (87), Native Americans (87), Pacific Islanders (85), South Asians and North Africans (84), non-bushmen Sub-Saharan Africans (67), Australian Aborigines (62), Bushmen and Pygmies (54). The average human IQ of the world is estimated to be 90.[3]

Lynn defines races as the genetic clusters or ancestral population groups identified in previous genetic cluster analysis by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues in their 1994 book The History and Geography of Human Genes.

There is no physiological or genetic differences between the races? That is patently false.

""The majority of genetic variation is found within populations"" This is one quip I hear a lot and it is also misleading. It depends very specifically on which population you are talking about. There is more genetic variation on the African continent between genetic Halogroups than the rest of the human race, i.e between Europeans and Asian, combined.

In the field of population genetics, it is believed that the distribution of neutral polymorphisms among contemporary humans reflects human demographic history. It has been theorized that humans passed through a population bottleneck before a rapid expansion coinciding with migrations out of Africa leading to an African-Eurasian divergence around 100,000 years ago (ca. 5,000 generations), followed by a European-Asian divergence about 40,000 years ago (ca. 2,000 generations). Richard G. Klein, Nicholas Wade and Spencer Wells, among others, have postulated that modern humans did not leave Africa and successfully colonize the rest of the world until as recently as 60,000 - 50,000 years B.P., pushing back the dates for subsequent population splits as well.

The rapid expansion of a previously small population has two important effects on the distribution of genetic variation. First, the so-called founder effect occurs when founder populations bring only a subset of the genetic variation from their ancestral population. Second, as founders become more geographically separated, the probability that two individuals from different founder populations will mate becomes smaller. The effect of this assortative mating is to reduce gene flow between geographical groups, and to increase the genetic distance between groups. The expansion of humans from Africa affected the distribution of genetic variation in two other ways. First, smaller (founder) populations experience greater genetic drift because of increased fluctuations in neutral polymorphisms. Second, new polymorphisms that arose in one group were less likely to be transmitted to other groups as gene flow was restricted.

Our history as a species also has left genetic signals in regional populations. For example, in addition to having higher levels of genetic diversity, populations in Africa tend to have lower amounts of linkage disequilibrium than do populations outside Africa, partly because of the larger size of human populations in Africa over the course of human history and partly because the number of modern humans who left Africa to colonize the rest of the world appears to have been relatively low.

Humans that migrated out of Africa in particular show great genetic differentiation with the populations that remained. One reason for this may be the interbreeding with indigenous Neanderthal populations that did not occur in Africa. As a result scientist are now saying that 1-4 percent of all European/Asian DNA is in fact determined from the genetic influence of Neanderthals.

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100506-science-neanderthals-humans-mated-interbred-dna-gene/

Humans have relatively low mitochondrial diversity compared to the other great apes, and reports of this are mostly responsible for the belief that humans have low genetic diversity. However, mtDNA makes up just a few millionths of the human genome,[17] and as a single locus, carries little statistical weight.

When allele frequency data are used to estimate genetic diversity within a population, a frequently reported statistic is the average number of alleles per locus (A), but because rare alleles do not contribute much to overall diversity, the most informative statistic is average heterozygosity (H). This is estimated from both the number of alleles and the frequencies at which they occur, and is generally defined as the percentage of individuals in a population that are heterozygous (have two different alleles) at a random locus. In general, genetic diversity is synonymous with mean heterozygosity.

Keeping the preceding caveats in mind, these are qualitative guidelines suggested by Sewall Wright for interpreting FST:

“The range 0 to 0.05 may be considered as indicating little genetic differentiation. The range 0.05 to 0.15 indicates moderate genetic differentiation. The range 0.15 to 0.25 indicates great genetic differentiation. Values of FST above 0.25 indicate very great genetic differentiation.”

Human FST values of 12-15% are typical not just for microsatellites, but also for classical protein polymorphisms,[102] autosomal RFLPs[103] and Alu insertions.[104] Values for mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome are substantially higher.**It would seem, then, that the level of genetic differentiation among human populations is not especially small, and in fact is entirely adequate for race designation, particularly when coupled with consistent morphological differences**

What is indesputable: The left, at least all over Europe, universally liked Israel more or less until they broke with the Soviets. I'm not just talking about politicians, but individual people. If your politics were leftist, you were highly likely to support Israel, with increasing likelihood the further to the left you were. Israel was seen as a force of good, and quite a number of communists, who were the most set in their beliefs, actually went and fought for Israel. With guns.

After Israel broke with the Soviets and became friends with the USA, this changed 180 degrees. Israel was suddenly a force of evil, and  everyone on the left very quickly began to care about the plight of the Palestineans. If your politics were leftist, you were highly likely to hate Israel, with increasingly strong feelings the further to the left you were. Quite a number of communists, who were the most set in their beliefs, started supporting the PLO with weapons and money.

And it's still the case today. There is a lot to criticize about Israeli policies, but the same is true about half a hundred other countries. Yet none of these evoke feelings like Israel and the USA do. If you are a leftist (almost anywhere on the spectrum) in Britain, Denmark, or any European country besides Germany, there is almost zero chance that you don't think Israel is ""bad"", and the further left we go, the more one-sided does the beliefs get. You should try noting the same when you read newspapers. I had a picture in my head more or less as it's painted in the Guardian the first time I visited Israel, and wow, is it ever separated from reality. 

It's an interesting phenomenon. There's no reason that unrelated memes should come in batches, but they do. It's amazing how much the information bubbles we surround ourselves with determine our beliefs. 

Disclosure: I'm slightly left of centre myself (the Danish one, that'd be fairly far left in the US), and used to believe the leftist narrative about Israel until I had to spend a good deal of time there. It's amazing how much you can read about something and yet be completely misinformed, because it all is selected to fit the bias.

And this, right here, is how I know that you haven't really read or cogitated upon what I wrote.  All you are reading is ""this guy says the Atomic bombings were justifiable, therefore he is a bloodthirsty maniac.""

What I said was that, in the context of the world war 2 it made perfect sense especially since the major allies agreed at Potsdam that it was going to be a unconditional surrender situation for Japan, same as with Germany.  

In order to end the war quickly this means an invasion of Japan.  in order for the invasion to go forward with minimal loss of allied life, it means continued industrial bombing and the blockade as a prelude.  If you are a leader of a allied country partaking in the invasion(meaning the US with some Commonwealth assets), and you are making a conscious effort to maximize the warfighting potential of Japan then you have committed criminal negligence on the part of your citizenry.

Your job as the leader of a country in the middle of total war is to end the war as quickly as possible and with a minimal of casualties on your part, and a minimal of suffering on the part of noncombants.  It is *not* to put the war on hold(unless you think it'll end the war peacefully on reasonable terms), or to throw your allies under the bus, or to put concern about enemy deaths above the deaths of your boys.

Nothing, nada, zip of what I have said in this thread is me going  ""herp derp Nuclear war is a good way to solve problems"".  

&gt; You still have time. Yes or no answer, is nuclear war ever sane?

Nuclear War is never sane...if the other guy has the means to dish out equal amounts of damage.

That you're talking in absolutes makes me seriously wonder about your upbringing.

What's with the language you're using?  Trying to make dramatic appeals with flowery language isn't impressing me.

&gt;Blah blah blah why do you say Famine is worse?

Because combined the atomic bombings immediately(as in, within the first couple of days) killed about 100k Japanese.  The Tokyo firebombing killed more.  A famine and blockade would have killed millions and millions.  In your mind millions and millions dying of starvation is a *better* option than the under 500k Japanese killed by the bombing campaign?

Is this what I'm seriously reading?  You think the numbers of the dead don't matter?  It's better to kill one two five ten million over the course of 4 months than 500k over 6 because you think it's, I don't know, cleaner somehow?  Only someone who has never seen true starvation would make so callous a statement.

&gt;How many combined sorties of 625 Superfortresses does it take to equal the TNT kilotonnage of Little Boy and Fat Man? 

So?

Guess what?  In one day those B-29s who didn't reach the amount of kilotonnage of either bomb killed more Japanese at Tokyo.  That you're trotting out kilotonnage as if that actually means anything says that you don't even really understand the *tools* used in the war, much less the tactics used to meet the overreaching strategy.  

Did you know that if you popped a 1 Megaton nuke over the middle of London, 95% of the city assets would survive and so would 80% of the population?  It's true.  It wouldn't stop it from being a colossal disaster, but it goes to show that absolute tonnage has little to do with effectiveness.

Shoot, LeMay even said tonnage dropped:

**""In Japan we dropped 502,000 tons and we won the war.**

**In Vietnam we dropped 6,162,000 tons of bombs and we lost the war.**

**The difference was that McNamara chose the targets in Vietnam and I chose the targets in Japan.”**

&gt;Because Red Japan

And again, here you are making speculation on....what?  How were the Soviets going to invade the home islands?  They didn't have the lift.  They knew it, and we knew it, which is why we told them ""tough tatty"" when they said they wanted to split japan like everywhere else.  You are creating a bogeyman that didn't exist in 1945.

Seriously, it didn't.  Looking back we have a bunch of people running around trying to cover their asses in their memoirs because Eastern Europe got written off, but by that point everyone wanted the war to be over and no one(except for Patton) was in the mood to go to war again.

Hell, from 1945-1950 the US refused to give Rhee(the dictator in South Korea we were backing) anything heavier than rifles because we were concerned *he* would provoke a Korean war.  Well-known communist sympathizer Douglas MacArthur recommended to the joint chiefs that the RoK army be trained as a constubaltory because anything better equipped Rhee would use to invade North Korea.

What about lets say, people from Africa, who by your definition are racially black due to the way the look only. So if I were to present you with someone who was African, but presented the albino gene, making their skin and hair white and their eyes blue. Would that make them of a different race to their family members who did not have or present the albino gene phenotypically?
You say that race is ONLY about appearance, yet appearance is nothing but a physical representation the genotype of the individual, i.e the phenotype. So if I had dark brown skin and I had, lets say, South American ancestry, would that make me of the same race of someone from Africa who also had dark brown skin? I would say no.
Now on your point that saying it is riducluous for an atheist to call himself a Jew... If we take apart the word ""atheist"", it simply means without belief in a religion. I stress the word belief. My argument throughout this thread is that it is indeed possible to be a Jew without any belief in any gods, deities or higher power. This is because there is indeed a racial link between those of common ancestry. If you want to take the cultural meaning of the word ""race"", you can say that it defines that classification of humans on the basis of their ethnoreligious background. If you would take the scientific meaning behind the word ""race"", you would see that it means genetically divergent populations within the same species. I am of the species Homo sapiens. So are you, I'm assuming. I am simply proposing that you and I are genetically divergent in such a way that it is classified as a racial difference, excluding any belief system. Just as I, a Caucasian, British Jew of Eastern European stock, am genetically different from an individual from Scandinavian stock, although we share the vast majority of our genetic material. 
On the matter of calling all humans Ethiopian - why on earth not? We already do, using the word ""human"" instead of Ethiopian. One can be of many racial sub-groups. I am, in my opinion, racially a Jew and racially Caucasian. And you would not find yourself mistaken if you classed yourself as partially Anglo-Saxon. There is no problem with that scientifically.

RTB’s model involves abductive reasoning, which is commonly used by scientists to evaluate hypotheses.

1) X is observed.

2) If Y were true, then X would be expected.

3) There is good reason to believe that Y is true.

With this, one can indirectly infer that there is good reason to believe in God.

I’ll copy &amp; paste some background info. from: Hugh Ross. More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation (Reasons to Believe) (p. 91). Kindle Edition.


There are 4 cornerstone inferences from Scripture that are the foundation of RTB’s model:

* Dual revelation: the Creator's attributes (truth, love, wisdom, power, etc.) ensure the harmony of his creative works (nature) with his verbally inspired Word (the Bible). 
* Creation purposes: nature fulfills the Creator's stated and implied reasons for creating. 
* Creation chronology: the Creator transcends creation; the realm of nature has a beginning and an end, a before and an after. 
* Detectability of the divine: close and careful study of nature's record can reveal evidence of the Creator's miraculous interventions.

From the biblical texts, a structure emerges for RTB's creation model that explains the features of the natural realm in logical and scientifically testable terms. This biblical material on the origins and natural history of the universe, Earth, life, and humanity includes details for: 

*The* *universe,* *which*

* began (once) in finite time; 
* has a beginning that coincides with the beginning of space and time; 
* was not made from that which is material, visible, or detectable; 
* continuously expands from the beginning; 
* is governed by constant laws of physics; 
* manifests precise fine-tuning for humanity's benefit; has enormous volume, encompassing an ""uncountable"" (to ancient peoples) number of stars;
* contains stars that differ from one another and eventually stop shining;
* will someday cease to exist. 

*Earth,* *which* 

*  emerged from the cosmos at a specific time; 
* was enshrouded by an opaque cloud layer in the beginning; 
* began with an ocean that covered its whole surface; 
* was precisely fine-tuned for humanity's benefit; 
* contains resources essential for launching and sustaining human civilization; has a Sun and Moon and other astronomical companions specially designed to benefit life and humanity;
* carries finite resources and time-limiting conditions for sustaining human civilization. 

*Life,* *which* 

* began early in Earth's history; 
* began under hostile conditions; 
* began by divine intervention; 
* began with optimal ecological relationships; 
* began with optimal design for environmental conditions; 
* appeared in abundance, in diversity, and for long eras for the specific benefit of humanity; 
* started as physical only (most life-forms); then soulish
* creatures (many species) appeared; 
* and finally, one spiritual species was introduced-an original pair of humans and all their descendents; 
* progresses from simple to complex through a series of extinction and replacement (speciation) events; 
* reflects shared common designs; in its soulish characteristics, appears designed to serve and/or please humanity. 

*Humanity,* *which* 

* arrived late in Earth's history; 
* resulted from divine intervention;
* represents the culmination of God's creation work on Earth; 
* remains the only earthly creature with a spiritual nature; 
* descended from one man and one woman who lived in a God-designed garden near the juncture of Africa, Asia, and Europe; migrated rapidly from area of origin shortly after the flood of Noah's time; 
* experienced a significant drop in the potential life span after the time of the flood; 
* genetically bottlenecked at a later date for males than for females (because male flood survivors were all biologically related to Noah, whereas females were not related to one another); 
* was gifted from the outset with attributes needed for functioning in a high-tech civilization.

The RTB biblical creation model based on this framework invites side-by-side comparison with competing models on the scientific findings already established and still accumulating. From this framework predictions are formed that are testable/falsifiable. Their specific predictions are detailed in their many books or can be looked up on their website.

ur2tuff4me,t5_2qhhq,c4ioqcw,3,0,t3_t0ufg,0,False,"Thank you for a well thought out position! I also don't know everything, as the workings of a national economy and governing system is probably far, far nuanced for any individual to have a firm grasp. That being said...

1) Inflation is bad if it gets too high yes, but right now, at 2-3% inflation, it is at a somewhat normal amount that actually stimulates the economy. The fact that there is inflation encourages people to go and spend some of their money now, which, ideally, is helpful to kickstart our economy again. I understand the concern with people who don't have too much money sitting around in the bank to invest, but in today's financial market, you can put money into index and no-load mutual funds very easily. If you are saving for college, you must be making semi-regular payments to the account - you could make those payments to an index or low fee managed fund. If you are just putting your money into a savings account and not investing it, isn't it only recently that rates have become so low that you are feeling inflation? The fed also raises interest rates in times of economic prosperity as well - during those times, banks are paying you interest over the rate of inflation. If you really do keep your money under your mattress, you (not specifically you obviously lol) need to be educated on a savings account. 

2) You are arguing from the position of two different monetary systems post facto. If half of the US was being paid in Canadian dollars, you would not be able to state the same statistics. Also, for the continuity of the national economy, having one currency prevents all the pitfalls that go with a multiple currency economy; distortions in the cross rates, currency wars, etc. Look at Zimbabwe. Yes its multi currency regime helped stem hyper-inflation, but only because they were in crisis. They are now attempting to revert back to one currency because of the problems they are currently experiencing. 
Moreover, I think it would cause a great deal of problems. Citizens would have to diversify their money because the two currencies would be competing and would have different and dynamic cross-rates. If a big business got a huge order in gold denominated currency and they report in dollar denominated currency, they would have to hedge their position and can do so easily. But what if an individual got a huge dollar denominated payment - does he convert half to gold? all to gold? none? If he converts all of it, then the next year the dollar does well, how will he feel about the two currencies? What if all I have are gold-backed currency and I want to buy something from a dollar-only merchant? I have to go exchange it? This adds complication to an already complicated financial system. Sorry, this point was kind of stream of consciousness and might be a bit disjointed.

3) I understand Senator Paul's position on State rights and decentralization of government and I actually think some of his points have merit, but I do think he takes it too far. If you really do take the federal level out of this and give most of the power to states, it seems to me that you'll end up with Europe. This is not good as all the, relatively, more poor southern states will begin to do way worse than their northern counterparts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP sort by per capita). You say that people will move and while, yes, there will be migration, that is not necessarily a good thing and can cause a lot of friction. Right now, we are a Union of states - we identify with the United States more than Illinois or Minnesota; we don't think about how we are subsidizing Mississippi; but if you decentralize, you create a much more identifiable State that people will (in my thinking) adopt as a much more important player in their lives than it once was. All this will lead to fraction and strife within the Union.

UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this means that if the Champions League winner falls outside of its domestic league's top four, it will qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League.

beard-maketh-the-man,t5_2qhqb,c4ip2ka,5,0,t3_szr1d,0,False,"Indeed there is:

The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate. I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject.

For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft. Now rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin, and then to Mars ... (Laughter) ... if we use pennies.

Now this is obviously a powerful, some might say dangerously powerful, insight. But it's also a morally important one. Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about, but this is actual economic losses. This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops, as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.

But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math. Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene. So that's a chunk of what we're looking for. But total movie revenues across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up. And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up. Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up. So this small missing chunk here is puzzling.

(Laughter)

(Applause)

Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms, it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented, but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the 90's. What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy. (Laughter) 50 billion dollars of it a year, which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone, that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. (Laughter) It's true. (Applause) I have Excel.

(Laughter)

The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft, which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people. Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people. And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft, have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. And some people think that string theory is tough.

(Laughter)

Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. Some people think this number's a little bit large, but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.

Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. And it was a big Christmas hit. Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.

(Laughter)

(Applause)

These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs, which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media. (Applause) Or about 75,000 jobs.

(Laughter)

(Applause)

Now you might find copyright math strange, but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. So that's it for now. I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

You want to believe that money needs intrinsic value the way a Creationist needs to believe that God created man in his own image, and man has always existed in his current form.  You might now like the idea that all money arose from debt and credit systems and politics, just like a creationist doesn't want to accept that man arose from primordial ooze.  Sadly, your want does not override reality.  Once again, David Graeber:

&gt; If someone makes an inadequate return you will merely mock him as a cheapskate. If you do so when he is drunk and he responds by poking your eye out, you are much more likely to demand exact compensation. And that is, again, exactly what we find. Anthropology is full of examples of societies without markets or money, but with elaborate systems of penalties for various forms of injuries or slights. And it is when someone has killed your brother, or severed your finger, that one is most likely to stickle, and say, “The law says 27 heifers of the finest quality and if they’re not of the finest quality, this means war!” It’s also the situation where there is most likely to be a need to establish proportional values: if the culprit does not have heifers, but wishes to substitute silver plates, the victim is very likely to insist that the equivalent be exact. (There is a reason the word ‘pay’ comes from a root that means ‘to pacify’.)

&gt; Again, unlike the economists’ version, this is not hypothetical. This is a description of what actually happens—and not only in the ethnographic record, but the historical one as well. The numismatist Phillip Grierson long ago pointed to the existence of such elaborate systems of equivalents in the Barbarian Law Codes of early Medieval Europe. [7]For example, Welsh and Irish codes contain extremely detailed price schedules where in the Welsh case, the exact value of every object likely to be found in someone’s house were worked out in painstaking detail, from cooking utensils to floorboards—despite the fact that there appear to have been, at the time, no markets where any such items could be bought and sold. The pricing system existed solely for the payment of damages and compensation—partly material, but particularly for insults to people’s honor, since the precise value of each man’s personal dignity could also be precisely quantified in monetary terms. One can’t help but wonder how classical economic theory would account for such a situation. Did the ancient Welsh and Irish invent money through barter at some point in the distant past, and then, having invented it, kept the money, but stopped buying and selling things to one another entirely?

When all parties are in peaceful agreement, they have no need for money, because they value social relationships over personal gain.  The only time you need money is to resolve a conflict or dispute between parties who are unable to resolve the dispute on their own, in other words, a legal system.

3-Super Cup: the winner of the league plays the winner of the cup at the end of the season. If a team wins both the league and the cup, then I think that team plays the second in the league.

1-Champions League: the top teams of each European country compete for the ultimate prize. An intricate coefficient system is set in place that dictate the number of teams that can participate from each country. Its too complicated, but what you need to know is that Germany, England, and Spain have 4 spots, Italy 3. Lesser leagues don't even have automatic spots, and have to battle it out with other teams in a playoff that usually starts before local competitions. Once the 32 teams are known after the playoffs, the team are put in 8 groups of 4 and battle it out in a hone-away system. The top 2 teams from each group qualify, the 3rd goes to Europa League (see 2.) Now we have 16 teams who continue on to a home-away knockout stage. Note that the winner of each group get home field advantage by having the second game at home (can massively tip the scale) The final venue is always pre chosen and is only one game (not home and away.)

2- Europa League: The same coefficients system used in CL dictates who gets into the EL. Generally its lesser teams in each local league (5th &amp; 6th in Spain, England, and Germany for example.) Teams here play in a mixture of groups and knockout stages. EL is considered less prestigious than CL.

My sister and my best friend know, and I know there are rumours around town about me but I could care less.

I was 20 and spilt with my BF, dropped out of school and started working in a cocktail bar. One of our regulars owned a brothel (legal in my town) and was very wealthy and sophisticated. So were the whores he'd bring in. We, the bar staff, would go drink at the brothel's bar with him and various workers and clients at 3am when we knocked off and nothing else was open. It was all in-clubby and cool and I felt accepted and slightly naughty.

After two years of making friends and having a ball my best mate and I decided to go OS together and start saving to do so. He had $30k saved as the date was looming, and I didn't. T he pimp gave me the option to quickly make up the cash before I went so I didn't miss out/disappoint my friends etc etc

So young and so dumb.

After I'd been at the brothel about a month 'their highest paying regular' phoned. Apparently they were saving me for him. So yes, I went in knowing that he used whores. You wont believe me, but the truth from him and the whores and the madam and the pimp, was that he was a 'talker'. They're rare, but they exist. He would call girls for his mates and for parties, and even himself, but he never fucked them. I did my own digging and found this to be the case. So yes, Mr Prince Charming.

So for example, Man Utd will qualify to play in the Champions League by finishing in the top two this season, so next season they will play in that tournament as well as all the English tournaments they currently play in (European competitions take place mid-week with domestic league games usually on the weekend)

There are two European competitions, The Champions League for the best placed finishers and the Europa League for the next group of higher placed finishers. The amount of teams each league can put into these tournaments depends on how strong the leagues are, so for example the strongest leagues like England and Spain can potentially have four teams each in the Champions League, whereas weaker leagues like the Scottish league, where my team Celtic play, have only one or two who can qualify for the Champions League. The ranking of the league depends largely on that country's standing in world football (a points system based on clubs euro performances over a rolling 5 year period)

There are sometimes qualifying games for these tournaments, so for example 1st and 2nd in England might go straight into the competition, the third placed team might have one qualifying tie against another team from a different league and the 4th placed team might have two qualifying ties.

This all sound ridiculously complicated, but it's not actually all that hard in practice. As for knowing what the big games are, it takes a bit of understanding of the different leagues.

Some games are generically big, so the Champions League final will always be a big game, no matter who is playing and you can find out the date of that months in advance. The UEFA website might be a good place for European competitions. 

last night's game and the recent Barca vs Real game were especially big because of how the teams were placed in the league, so keeping an eye on domestic tables is useful. These games are often only scheduled nearer the time. Then you have other games that are not in big leagues, but are big games. For example Celtic vs Rangers was on Saturday, not the best league in the world but a very famous game because of the rivalry of both teams.

tl/dr - no playoffs. european competitions depend on where you finish in the league. I also agree that listening to some podcasts, like the Guardian Football Weekly podcast is a god way to keep up with world football.

...which we're not going to get within an ass' roar of doing.  No matter how many asses we currently have roaring.

If we ratify both treaties, I don't see how it improves matters for us.  We'd continue a downward spiral, sucking money out of the economy leading to more unemployment, more social welfare spending, and continuing the recession.  On top of which, we would be expected to have a bag of €11 billion ready for when the ESM came looking for it - we have 5 days notice when they want it.  Any ESM loan we get would just add to a debt we can't pay due to the austerity policies we have to apply in order to qualify for the funding.

if we end up in a situation where we manage our own finances to our own priorities and schedules, and are still failing to show that we are on a path out of the debt, then we would have to see who would lend us the money.  The markets most certainly would, but possibly at a rate of more than we can afford.  The IMF and indeed Europe (under some mechanism) most probably would because Ireland would not fail in isolation.

Quitting the euro in a panic does nothing for us.  We would be left with debts in euro and dollars which we would be trying to pay off with an ever-devaluing punt. 

Curring the deficit to zero in 18 months is neither desirable nor possible.

There will be two weeks between the French election and the Irish referendum.  If it looks like the treaties are reopened for negotiation, then we shouldn't even have the referendum now, because we are voting on a package which will only exist if the French allow it.

arbuthnot-lane,t5_2qhvo,c4ipncs,1,0,t3_szj0k,0,False,"&gt; What are you complaining about? In early 20th century Palestinian Arabs did not have objective characteristics of a people. 

Sure they did. Local allegiance to Palestinian cities and districts. Local dialects, customs, clothing and ancestry. The region between the Jordan and the Mediterranean is in some ways a ""natural"" territory, and genetic tests have shown the Palestinian admixture to be somewhat different than their neighbours. There are no clear-cut borders of course, just slow zones of diffusion.

But that doesn't really matter. Even if there was absolutely no difference between the people living in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudia-Arabia or Yemen, local people *still* have the right to self-determination.

You seem to be referring to the fact that the most popular model in the early 20th century called for a union with the neighbouring people - a Great Syria type of country, with the territory of at least. Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan in a unified, perhaps federal structure.

There is nothing objectively natural about the Middle Eastern borders that the ""Gereat Powers"" drew up post-WWI, but only an imposed balkanization.

Your contention seems to be that if the Palestinians did not necessarily want a state separated from their neighbours, their right to self-determination disappears.  
This is a ridiculous claim. There is nothing natural or historically right about ethnocracies, they are merely expressions of völkisch ideology, and will always implode or descend into racism.

The zionist project was the exact opposite of subjugation and dispossession of the Arabs 

&gt; The manifestation of Zionism that became Israel could not exist without subjugating the native Palestinians. It was a colonial project in a populated area. Ethnic cleansing was a necessity for the construction if Israel. Do you remember what Ben-Gurion thought about the matter of the natives?


&gt; who were not in any sense natives any more than they are natives in Egypt. 

Oy vey. Are you seriously spouting Joan Peters at me? I'm a bit disappointed, really. You don't seem that stupid otherwise.

&gt; They were pressured by their Arab peers to go to war, chose to do so, lost it,

The majority of the Palestinian population in 1948 fought no one, it wasn't like the British and their Zionist allies had allowed them to have any weapons anyways.

The preceding Civil War and beginning ethnic cleansing are the most important reasons for the Arab declarations of war. The Arabs were undermanned, under armed and hardly prepared, against a well-armed, organized Zionist machine that had been planning this for decades.

Ethnically cleansing out the Palestinians were in any way a grave crime. Stealing and annexing their private property likewise. Continuing the colonial project in the West Bank and Golan is of course a daily reminder of the roots of the state of Israel - built on the backs  of a dispossessed people.

&gt; and now want to do it over again - except this time they demand all the land and money and rights and infrastructure that Israel has created for itself - the so called ""one state solution"".

There are three (perhaps four) options. 

A two-state solution based on the borders of 67 with possible land swaps. Complete sovereignty  for the Palestinian state over land, resources, air and its own borders. Free passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Removal of all Israeli control over West Bank infrastructure and territory.  
Removal of all illegal settlements, except for some territories close to the border, and only in exchange for land of equivalent size and value. Jerusalem to be negotiated, but a corpus separatum would be my suggestion.

This option is soon becoming nearly impossible due to the entrenchment of Israeli settlers and military in the West Bank.

Secondly, a one state solution with equal rights for all citizens. Requires comprehensive peace talks with neighbouring countries, but should be quite doable.  
Restoration must be paid out to the Palestinian refugees, and in coordination with the host countries incentives should be offered to avoid an immediate influx of all refugees to the new Isratine.  
Most refugees would probably stay in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria if given full civil rights.

This option will not allow for eternal Jewish supremacy in the new state, and immediate tensions could be high. Truth commissions would probably be helpful, and with clever governance the model would be quite beneficial for all parties.  
This is the only long term option for an actually democratic and viable  ""Israel"".

The third option is a continued Israeli colonisation of the West Bank. Closing in of Palestinian populated areas in enclaves and functional bantustanification. Israel controls all resources, water, travel and fertile lands.
This is the road we're currently headed down. It will lead to continued hatred, international denunciation of Israel, possibly terrorism, increased regional tension, and in combination with Israeli belligerence towards Iran, possibly a bloody, regional war.

The fourth, highly theoretical option is the completion of the ethnic cleansing.  The majority of the Palestinian population is forcefully deported to Jordan, tens of thousands killed in the process. A large number of Palestinian citizens of Israel are branded 5h columnists, stripped of citizenship and also deported.
Israel annexes the, now mostly *Arabrein*, West Bank and colonises it in its entirety.  
Furious international protests follow of course, but probably no immediate military responses. 
Terrorism *will* again become a tactic. Israelis abroad will be targeted. Jordan and Egypt might rescind their peace treaties, and relationship with neighbouring states will completely deteriorate. Israel will consider re-occupying the Sinai.
European states will be highly critical, and sanctions might well be put in place.  
U.S. will stay on Israel's side, but other than that, isolated by other countries.  
This festung Israel will become even more militaristic, and expansionist ideologues will come to the forefront. Calls for invasion of Lebanon and Syria. The chance for regional war increases dramatically.

Which option do you chose?

With that said, we're in this budget mess in part because of the major increases in social spending we've seen, so that's going to have to be part of the discussion.

&gt;  Plus they would gut government investments in transportation, research, education, etc. that would severely harm the economy.

According to the same models that assumed we'd be under 7% unemployment right now thanks to the stimulus.  I'm not too concerned with this aspect of it in the short term.

Remember, too, that the claims of disaster in austerity spending have not come to pass in Europe.  The UK, for example, has not shown major multiplied losses in GDP from their austerity budgets, and Germany is holding up quite fine.

But after a few years, after most people who are interested in it have learnt it and most interesting content has been translated (can you imagine a reddit-like website in which people from all over the world are evenly represented? I think it would be absolutly fascinating), everything would just be so much better. Sure, lots of interpreters would lose their jobs, but that's a side consequence for something much better.

Also not only it could strengthen understanding among average people from all over the world and cheapen the cost of internation relations (both political and economic), it could also help countries focus on people learning their own language instead of having them study english for years and years. If I had spent every hour that I've spent learning english just reading stuff in spanish I would be fucking Cervantes.

Also you're ignoring the fact that English takes years and a shitload of hours to learn. You probably don't notice but I live in Spain and I realise this every day. I enjoy a certain fluency, but most spaniards, after years (like at least 10 years studying at school) learning the language can barely understand a native speaker. And that would be my case too, if I hadn't spent a year as a foreign exchange student in the US; and still this doesn't work for everyone. Just look at east asians. Do you know how hard it is for them, coming from such a different culture, to achieve conversational english skills? Most chinese foreign exchange students I met during my stay in the US had insanely strong accents and quite a rough time with the language. We all can learn english, sure, but of course europeans have it much easier, which, obviously, is not fair. Conlangs, on the other hand, are much easer. Esperanto, for example, can be learnt in months, and there are much easier conlangs.

Also, since all these people HAVE to learn english in order to communicate, international relations are submitted to anglo-saxon culture. Africans and chinese people have to communicate through a western language, which, if you ask me, doesn't make much sense. English being the international language just means that globalisation is a synonym for the expansion of western culture. Which is sad: diversity is beautiful.

There are even more advantages: it's been proven that the more languages you learn, the easier it is for you to learn a new one. An experiment was conducted in which they took two schools: one of them learnt french for four years and the other one learnt esperanto for one and french for three (or something similar, I don't exactly remember). In the end, the girls from the second school had achieved better skills in fench than the girls in the first school even though the had been learning it for less times. This meaning: the existence of a international conlang wouldn't have to stop people from learning foreign languages. It would just mean that those who do it do so because they like to, and it would even help them do so. As I said, international relations among average people would be strenghened. Which is not just hippy daydreaming, it could be incredibly useful stuff. Could you imagine what it would have been like chatting with arabs during the arab spring? The amazing insight we, the people, could have had? 


Imagine traveling to a foreign country and not having to rely on tour guides and shit like that: if you want to know something, just ask a local. Imagine not having to wait for ages for japanese videogames/manga/anime to be trasnlated into english because anyone from Japan itself could translate it into the international conlang. All sorts of stuff like that. Our personal experience as individuals could be so enriched if governments from all over the world encouraged people to spend a few months learning an easy new language.

The other one can irradiate some hundreds of square kilometres when a *severe* accident occurs. Unless you start a nuclear war, nuclear power is orders of magnitude less dangerous than climate change.

So, if we want to get clean by 2050 (~40 years), here's how much we have to do: average power consumption in America is ~10 kW/person, in Europe it's 5 kW/p, world average is about 2 kW per person. So, best case we bring everyone down to 2 kW, worst case everyone wants 10 kW. How much energy would than mean for a population stagnating at about 10 billion in 2050? Between 20 and 100 TW (today it's 15 TW worldwide). So, if we want to do this in 40 years, we have to build between 1.4 and 7 GW of clean power *every fucking day*. To put that in perspective: thats between 2 and 8 nuclear reactors every day. Between 50 and 400 square kilometres of photovoltaics every day (+ storage). Between 500 and 3000 large off-shore wind power stations every day.

Even on weekdays the shallow end can be crowded with kids, as there's some sort of daycare program somewhere in the city that gets a bus or two and brings kids by the busload. By my two boys are good swimmers so we hang out and chill in the calm of the deep end.

A few things to know:

- Every few hours on busy days they blow the whistle and everyone has to get out of the pool for about 20 minutes while they add chlorine. 
- If there's even a hint of a thunderstorm nearby, they'll shut down the pool entirely. You don't just get out of the pool; you have to leave.
- Sometimes they'll close down the deep end if they're short-staffed (under-funded?).
- The staff is often short-tempered and rude, with little explanation given for why they just blew their whistle at you and told you to stop what you're doing. 
- This is right next to Rock Creek Park and a trail that runs down to the creek where vagrants hang out. You can get creepy folks observing from the fence. I'd suggest women not lay out along the wood-side fence unless they want to be oogled.
- It's a city, of course, with a broad mix of people, and the deep end is more ""adult"".

We cannot spend anymore. To get the bubble back afloat some are saying that we will need a 20-30% cut in purchasing power. You think people are going to sit back and take the hit for the public at large. They rather let it crash then take that deep of a cut. Look at what’s going on in Greece and Spain, the BRICS summit, China going around American sanctions of Iran, etc. The world is not going to fund that type of expansion. This is the problem with your suggestion of spending more. If we devalue they start to dump dollars. No one is going to bail us. The EU is breaking apart. Ireland was smart they default in their debt and are now recovering but we can’t do that. We are a debtor nation. We don’t produce anything of substance but weapons and our IP won’t hold us over because you got countries like China, Iran, India, Russia, etc. stealing source code from American countries left and right. 

Actually travel to some of these countries they have knockoffs everywhere. I don’t know this until I visited family a few years ago in India but they massive websites were you could download any software you want for FREE. You have them in Haiti, Georgia, Switzerland, Iran, some places I visited in Africa, etc. Copyrights don’t work in a third world countries. It’s crazy what Americans accept. I’ve seen people get killed in Haiti for trying to cut someone’s cable. They hotbox electricity all the time especially in the Dominica Republic. They are barter countries there is no way to can panelize them economically for it. Many of their prisons are so overfull that you have status amongst the populous if you are permitted to sit down.

I have family in the military holding stacks of money bribing these people so they don’t have to fight them. Its unsustainable we can’t pay them off forever.

Britons Weary of Surveillance in Minor Cases
By SARAH LYALL

""POOLE, England — It has become commonplace to call Britain a “surveillance society,” a place where security cameras lurk at every corner, giant databases keep track of intimate personal details and the government has extraordinary powers to intrude into citizens’ lives.

A report in 2007 by the lobbying group Privacy International placed Britain in the bottom five countries for its record on privacy and surveillance, on a par with Singapore.""

And everyone looks around, and cheers wildly, applause errupting from the rooftops. We look each other in the eye and  then turn to the crowd, raising our fists in triumph. Through our years of strict research and study, we have both come to the most brazen radical conclusion of the century, the millennium, perhaps all eternity! The cheering grows louder, people are throwing their life savings, even their children at my feet, begging for a morsel of my vast superior intellect to be imparted.  My brain swells to gigantic proportions, barely able to contain the unimaginable energies of reason, logic and quotes from the God Delusion. Christopher Hitchens' face errupts in a golden tattoo on my back, glowing with the veracity of every 12 year old who has trolled Christian videos in his name. My penis has now grown to epic proportions, lying across the floor like a intercity train. Women are now fighting each other to get close to me, the atmosphere is incredible, my conclusion is indubitable, my logic is infallible, my powers are unthinkable!

as a once personal chef, my experience is that US european disasporas hardly know how to properly cook beans.  there is no understanding of the washing/pre-cooking process and then seasoning and cooking needed to properly cook beans. that's why pressure cookers are still all the rage in places like latin america. we wouldnt be able to cook a whole bag of dried beans in less than 2 hours without them :\    
   
    
but as far as keeping low-starch diets low, rice would be needed to make beans a whole protein and that's kind of defeating the purpose.  but, btw, the same misunderstanding about QUINOA (inre: how to properly cook it) also abounds.  it's a complete protein seed, not a starch and it also may cause a lot of problems if not properly cooked.

Napoleon or Hitler as individuals had huge influence. They didn't really fundamentally change the trends, but both boosted the processes they were born in to tremendously (Napoleon and enlightenment, democracy and secularism...

I think actually visiting the *fucking moon* might be considered the biggest event of 1500-2000 by people reading about the era in the year 3000. Internet going online might also be there. Both of these have subtle but insanely powerful influences on how people view the world. Of course, those are very hard to estimate as their influence is so insidious.

Of other events I'd go with first Siege of Vienna failing in 1529. Things could have gone very differently had the Ottomans actually managed to break through in to the heart of advanced Europe.

Is continuing to act like he has to answer to no one.

1. Anyway, dropping 'hot shit like interactive brokers'...please don't make me laugh man (trying to talk shit on the internet is really cool!!) - they are just the broker that I use. While you lambaste me for not knowing anything about anything, I am pretty sure that GLD is actually backed by physical bullion. It is stored, if I'm not mistaken, in the HSBC vault in London and whenever market makers trade newly issued shares or redeem shares, *physical gold* is transferred to and from the vault. It is now something like the top 5 holders of gold in the *world*. They **do not** use futures contracts. It would also be interesting to see where you got that 4% figure. note: I have no position in GLD or any gold-related stocks. The one reason why my question was a bit stupid, as someone else pointed out politely, is that I didn't think about cap gains tax. 4am, wasn't really thinkin on that one.

2. You are correct that he is congressman paul - my fault, again, 4am, not thinking. Thank you for continuing 'to respond to my position as if I might be a logical human being'; you are quite generous. 
 A) Bernanke's career only spans the financial crisis - you're going to ask me to state a time during and directly after the financial crisis that volatility has been less than normal? I don't believe in the things greenspan did, as he kept interest rates abnormally low for a prolonged period of time even as the economy was really gaining steam (nor do I believe in his hands off approach and deregulation), but that has nothing to do with bernanke.  B) Subprime mortgages are not a normalizing factor; a lot of blame for that goes on unusually cheap, low interest rates in an economy which was already doing well. It is also a product of, as greenspan later conceeded, letting the banks try to govern themselves and an era of deregulation. People are short sighted and during times of economic boom, it seems they can't control expectations as the past is very difficult to conjure up. Normalizing factors do take a little bit to play out, but they are on the relatively short term compared to protracted engagements like the great depression which took a decade.  C) This point can definitely be argued to death - both centralization and decentralization has its own share of issues. While I do agree there is way too much bloat in the government, I don't believe that that in of itself is reason to say we should *decentralize* gov't. Yes, if you get a city that is run well by a good group of people, it would be better; but conversely, if it was a terrible group of leaders, your city has the potential to become *very* bad. This is also true from a centralized standpoint, it just takes longer for good and bad to happen - hopefully this lets us pick off the bad faster than slowing down the good. But like I raised in another comment, if you decentralized gov't to that degree, wouldn't we just look increasingly like Europe? States would institute their own policies and we would begin to get states that vary even more widely in terms of education, prosperity and power. I think this is a hugely divisive force and could create a great deal of friction within the union, especially as people begin to identify more with their state instead of their *country*. Obviously, I don't know that this would come to pass just as you don't know that everything will be great and happy, but there are huge tradeoffs to these radically different systems and I don't think our country would survive the switch.

[X-Wing](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-wing) and [Tie Fighter](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter) - Though the graphics are very dated, the gameplay is rich, complex and rewarding. You can either find a direct download somewhere or buy the physical game on eBay or Amazon marketplace.

[Rebel Assault](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rebel_Assault) and [Rebel Assault II](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rebel_Assault_II:_The_Hidden_Empire) - These are very simple games, done in the arcade style. The first is basically a rehash of A New Hope. But the second is notable for being the first Star Wars property to film live actors since the shitty Ewok movies in the 80s.

[Dark Forces](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Dark_Forces)  - Basically the first FPS in Star Wars. The game is pretty bland by contemporary standards, but each installment gets exponentially better. [Jedi Knight](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Jedi_Knight:_Dark_Forces_II) has a pretty decent story, but really shitty acting. [Jedi Outcast](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Jedi_Knight_II:_Jedi_Outcast) is so indescribably good, it has set the bar by which so many other games will be judged.

[Shadows of the Empire](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Shadows_of_the_Empire_\(video_game\)) and [Rogue Squadron](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron) - More arcade style action, this time on the N64. Not my favorite, but nostalgic classics for some.

[Rebellion](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rebellion_\(video_game\)) - Alternately called Supremacy in Europe. This game has been forgotten by most, but a few hardcore fans still swear by it. It is an endlessly complex and intricate Strategy game that allows you to control every operation of one faction of the Star Wars galaxy during the galactic civil war. From sending Luke to train Jedi to building mines on Mon Calamari to building a *fleet* of Death Stars, the possibilities are endless.

[The Knights of the Old Republic](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic) - Hands down the best Star Wars game. Ever. Available on either PC via Steam or on X-Box. This probably rates just behind Episodes VI and V as my favorite Star Wars installment. Ever.

I think it is difficult for soccer to become cherished and popular in the US for a couple of reasons (which do not necessarily represent my line of thought) besides the fact that soccer, well Football, is European and rooted deeply in local cultures and history.

* Soccer games can end as draws. A lot of my American friends have expressed their dislike for this property of the sport, there just needs to be a winner...whether at the end of regulation or in OT or sudden death (and I have to say...who doesn't like OT drama?...but wouldn't it become mundane if even the least important of games went to OT and players just played another 30 minutes of rubbish?)

* It is not as TV/consumer friendly as major American sports. Baseball, basketball and football have plenty of room for advertisement and commercial time-outs which make broadcasting financially viable for media companies. Vendors and merchandise sellers at stadiums benefit massively as well. Soccer on the other hand features a running-clock that allows for only 15 minutes of advertising/marketing between halves.

Europe generally takes the view that speech should be responsible and moderated. Essentially, you may have the right to say what you believe, but you don't necessarily have the right to inflammatory or hateful speech.

The US view is rather more liberal in this regard. You can say as much hateful and inflammatory speech as you like, and so long as it isn't 'fighting words' or has no value in the marketplace of ideas (my recollection of First Amendment Law is a little sketchy, admittedly, but I do recall a SCOTUS case where the judgment held that certain forms of speech have no value and are therefore not protectable), then your speech is likely to be protected.

The crucial distinction between the US and the Europe philosophy is in who is best at 'regulating' speech. The US takes the view that it is the public themselves through the marketplace of ideas, whereas many European nations say it is the function of the state to limit certain speech so that it cannot enter into the marketplace of ideas (see, for example, Austria and Germany's anti-Nazi laws, the UK's various laws against intolerance, and the Italian laws of having Berlisconi own everything).",,1335889237,1428833916,humor,1,0,t1_c4irthm,t1_c4iqwx8,True,False,,,

2) Regardless of the current conditions, and the will to use it just as a point of passage for the rest of Europe (in Italy, for example, a large influx of illegal immigrant try to enter the country just as an intermediate point on the way to France, Germany and the rest of continental Europe), Greece was in recent year better of than most North and Sub Saharian countries, therefore still appealing.

Is Islam taken seriously and if so, to what degree does it affect everyday life

Religion is mostly a non-issue here. There are some ""rowdy"" areas, but I don’t know much about them. 

&gt; -Which part of Sweden do you think is best to live/study in? I have heard the Norrland is nice but need some opinions.

I’ve never been there, but it’s *very* sparsely populated. I’d probably go to one of the larger cities like Göteborg or Stockholm, or if you’re a student, Lund och Uppsala.

&gt; -Is the euro accepted in Sweden? (seeing as it is an EU country, I would assume yes but would just like clarification)

Nope. :) We’re not part of the EMU (European Monetary Union).

&gt; -How hard is it to find a job as an immigrant and and how hard is it to learn the language (Jag talar inte mycket svenska)

You get by without speaking Swedish, but I can’t tell you anything about the job market.

&gt; -Is it true that Swedes are very introverted when it comes to social situations and is alcohol really that prevalent of a social lubricant?

Unfortunately, yes. 

&gt; -Once a citizen of Sweden, how easy is it to pass through other EU countries? (i.e Britain to visit family)

For Schengen countries, you just need your ID. For other EU countries (like England), you need a passport.

&gt; -Is healthcare/education really free or is there a copay that has to be paid first?

Well it’s financed by taxes, but the short answer is yes. Universities don’t charge any fees at all. Health care is *mostly* free. You need to pay ~10-15$ to see a doctor, and you need to pay part of the costs for medication up to a certain maximum (like 1500 kr / year I think). Anything more expensive, like surgery etc, is totally free. I'd recommend sticking to privately ran hospitals financed by the state - in my experience it's a good combination.

&gt; And lastly, is surströmming really as gross as some say it is? (wish i could say I was joking) Thank you and I hope someone can clear some of these questions!

zulaikha_idris,t5_2s7k2,c4it0bg,6,0,t3_t1h07,0,True,"&gt; You seem to take for granted that Islam gave women the opportunity to do these great things. Have you had the chance to read 'A Room of One's Own' by Virginia Woolf? In that book, Woolf creates a character known as 'Shakespeare's Sister' to illustrate that a woman with Shakespeare's gifts would have been denied the same opportunities to develop them because of the doors that were closed to women. If it wasn't Islam that gave the women the right to strive for greatness, then how come Western women never founded academic institutions in the Middle Ages? 

You still have not answered my question; how exactly does Muslim women doing great things translate into ""Islam gave women rights""? All you are doing is appealing towards culture, instead of referring to the primary sources of Islam. I can say the same thing for the women in every other religion; there have been hindu, christian, shinto, buddhist, jewish women who have done great things, but does it mean that it's because their religion gave them rights? Of course not. 

Here again, due to some bizarre reason, you think there were no great women who did great things before Islam, as if before Islam, all the women were stupid and suffering and ignorant and couldn't do anything. And what the hell does quoting Virginia Wolf have to do with evidence for Islam giving women rights?

And of course the western women weren't as successful, because it was during the Dark Ages of Europe, when Christian theocracy killed a lot of progress. 

&gt;And Khadija continued her to conduct her business dealings LOOOOOOOONG after Muhammed ""invented Islam in a cave"". It implies that one of the greatest role models for Muslim women had a job (which had a lot of responsibilities) and was the one who supported her husband financially during his Prophethood. Therefore modern Muslim women today should feel no shame or face deterrence for trying to get work outside of the home, as Khadija wife of the Prophet did so. 

Again you're missing the point. The point is Khadijah was a successful woman BEFORE Islam even existed. This basically shatters the belief that Islam gave women rights to work or do business and be independent, because such rights has already existed BEFORE Islam even existed.

&gt; All those men who came to Aisha for religious guidance and to ask her opinion on a variety of legal, social and financial affairs doesn't show that Islam doesn't differentiate between a man and a woman except in knowledge/piety? If Islam really did denigrate women to second-class citizen status, then how could Aisha (and the other wives of the Prophet) have had so much religious authority to the extent that 1/3 of hadiths are transmitted by her? 

Maybe it's because **they were wives of Muhammad?** Don't you think that should be taken into consideration?

Let's walk through it again one more time, but really this is the last time, because if you don't get it now, you will probably never get it. You buy a $10,000 bond with a 2.5% yield using $1,000 of your own capital and $9,000 borrowed from the Fed at .25%, and the inflation rate is 3%. At the end of the year, you get 10250 (10000\*1.025) from the government for the bond, you pay back the fed $9022.50 (9000\*1.0025), leaving you with $1227.50 (10250-9022.50), or a 22.75% nominal gain (1227.50/1000-1). But because of inflation, 1227.50 is equivalent to 1190.67 in start of year dollars (1227.50\*(1-.03)), so your *real* gain on your original 1000 is 19.067% (1190.67/1000-1).

&gt; and you're claiming that this is such a stable and preferable form of investment, that it creates ""double digit positive real yields""

I never claimed that. Reread it, check it for edits. I said ""leveraging into bonds is **perceived** as high return (double digits) with low beta"" (emphasis added). Look at Greece last year as to why this is a perception and not reality. This is, in fact, why the crisis in Europe is economically important, because if they force a haircut onto bondholders then they could effectively wipe out these giant organizations that have been leveraging into unstable government debt, or if not them, then the insurance companies that wrote the CDS protections. It's the housing bubble all over again but with government debt.

Apart from that, the fed could also raise the .25% cost of debt, which also affects the equation. This is why the Fed signaled that they will be raising rates in 2014. It's a warning to deleverage.

&gt;The Massachusetts senator accused Bush and his aides of a “sudden embrace of accelerated Iraqification and American troop withdrawal without adequate stability,” which he called “an invitation to failure.” 

Yeah, back in 2004 Democrats believed that shit.

Now in 2011 it's ""We weren't involved in Libya, and we don't need to help there"".

How about some Pelosi?

MR. RUSSERT:  What would you do in Iraq today right now?

REP. PELOSI:  What I would do and what I think our country must do in Iraq is take an assessment of where we are.  And there has to be a leveling with the American people and with the Congress of the United States as to what is really actually happening there.  It's very hard to say what you would do. We need more troops on the ground.  General...

MR. RUSSERT:  American troops if necessary?

REP. PELOSI:  ...Shinseki said this from the start, when you make an appraisal about whether you're going to war, you have to know what you need.

MR. RUSSERT:  So you would put more American troops on the ground?

REP. PELOSI:  What I'm saying to you, that we need more troops on the ground. I think it would be better if we could get them to be not American, that we could appeal to our European allies, NATO. I agree with Senator Kerry in that respect to come...

MR. RUSSERT:  But if they say no, would you put more American troops on the ground?

REP. PELOSI:  Clear and present danger facing the United States is terrorism. We have to solidify, we have to stabilize the situation in Iraq.  As secretary of state has said, ""You break it, you own it.""  We have a responsibility now in Iraq there.  And we have to get more troops on the ground.  But when General Shinseki said we need 300,000 troops, Secretary Wolfowitz said ""wildly off the mark,"" because they knew a commitment of 300,000 troops would not be acceptable to the American people.  So they went in with false assumptions about rose petals, not rocket-propelled grenades, and we're in this fix that we're in now.

MR. RUSSERT:  Well, let's assume all that is wrong.  In order to stabilize the situation, NATO has said they have no troops for Iraq, the French, the Germans and Russians saying no.

REP. PELOSI:  We have to send...

MR. RUSSERT:  Would you send more American troops in order to stabilize the situation?

REP. PELOSI:  Yes.  And let me just say this, we have--we must, though, internationalize the situation. We cannot take no for an answer.  We have to use our diplomacy to the fullest extent to get more international troops on the ground.  And we have to truly Iraqitize, internationalize and Iraqitize the situation.  Before we can proceed, we have to know what we're dealing with.  There's quicksand over there.  It's Chalabi one day on the payroll, the next day we're raiding his house.

Most troubling to me is the fact that we are still a decade from the first high-level-waste repository opening up, and even then we will need to ship the waste over vast distances to get it there from the US and Japan (The one I'm thinking of is in Scandinavia, so at least Europe will be able to access it effectively)

I guess the good news is that by the time it opens, the waste ships can just sail over the pole free and clear every summer.

Whether another source is biased or not is hardly relevant in criticising Fox.  As your own link pointed out the comments were quick to point out the bias in others too.

&gt;And you don't think it's a gross exaggeration when Redditors say that Republicans only get their news from Fox?

Statistically it appears Fox viewership is more polarised, but it is still an exaggeration.  As it is I'm sure people will be open to accept that there is an online Ron Paul following.  Fox is clearly not a fan of Ron Paul, so to say Redditors believe that Republicans only watch Fox news doesn't seem consistent.

&gt;Right. And DailyKos, Alternet, ThinkProgress, etc. don't do this? Remember the whole slaver thing? 

And yet you've cherry picked certain sites out of the list of sites that appear on r/politics.  If these sites do this, readers on Reddit are also clearly balancing that with other more balanced sites.

&gt;Or how Mitt Romney is a apparently a fascist? Or how Republicans are destroying democracy?

To be fair if there's someone that's trying to marry big business with big government and the military industrial complex it's Mitt Romney.  By the same measure you don't see Huntsman being labeled a fascist, and by no means is everyone bandying around fascist terms.

You can't really see how Republicans lend themselves to enhancing their democratic claim when they attack women's rights and universal health coverage when by the vast majority of counts show these to be populous platforms.

&gt;If you're going to criticize my grammar/sentence-structure, then please double check your own mistakes. There are several in your paragraph. You know what I meant by that.

That wasn't a problem with your grammar sentence structure.  You said people were opposed to laws introducing censorship and then claimed the same was being done to you.  It's not even close.  You are not being censored when you are downvoted, you're being marked unpopular and irrelevant.

&gt;Are you sure about that? I can't tell you how many times I've seen people downvote someone criticizing Obama because of his occasionally radical policies. Unpopular? Yes. Censorship? Yes. 

Of course it's not censorship.  It's just a meter as to how popular it is.

&gt; People don't want other people to see how Obama can be right-leaning in many of his views. And the Mods removing posts is the very definition of censorship.

The Mods have left your post standing.  People might not agree on your perception of Obama.  If you're having a problem with downvotes (you're currently on a 60% approval not taking into account the anti-abuse logarithm) try putting your point across in a more conducive manner.  It's not so much what you're saying, but how you've chosen  to say it.

&gt;Believe me. I have brought this very issue up at least 4 times, either as a comment or a submission, and it was downvoted over and over again. 

And yet your relevant link disproved your notion.

&gt; Ironically, this submission has a decent amount of upvotes despite my harsh language -- which I did not use in the previous comments/submissions.

I think it's more a case of pity because you were acting so hurt.  You complained about people downvoting you and people chimed in to tell you why that was, despite you telling them how you knew why they were downvoting you.  Ironically it turned out not to be the case.

&gt;Of course it means something! 2 people downvoted me but didn't want to say why. Right after I made that edit, the comments came flowing in.

I was one of the two.  I downvoted first and wrote the comment second. It was less than a minute old.  You were just too quick to take offense.  I downvoted you because the observation was poorly made and argued.

&gt;How so? He said exactly what I said: People will complain about sensationalism all the time from Fox News, but they will upvote the shit out of it if it has a liberal bias.

So you're complaining about a post and a hivemind where the majority of the community agreed with you???

[deleted],t5_2qh6c,c4itvwd,2,0,t3_t1iva,0,True,"The actual purpose of the church is spelled out in Jesus command found at Matt 28:19,20. Yet many faith ignore that while claiming to do the will of Jesus. Jesus knew many faiths would do this hence why he stated what he say at Matt 7:21-23 ending with calling many workers of lawlessness.

Jesus stresses the command to preach by saying that ONLY the ones doing the will of his Father will enter into the kingdom. How do we know what God's will is? When we look all the way through the bible back to the days of Noah forward God's M.O. has always been the same to send out others to warn people BEFORE God acts. He did that with Noah whom Peter calls a PREACHER of righteousness, he did that with Lot who warned others including his future son-inlaws, he did that with the minor prophets Hosea, Jeremiah, Micah etc, and his Son Jesus who said it was his will to do the work of the one that sent me. Jesus left the work to this disciples and apostles who continued it in fact Acts 5:42 says from house to house.  I'm not sure how you can claim ""Orthodoxy, unlike other faiths, is a lifestyle."" The early church who preached and lived it was a lifestyle. If you are not living according to what Jesus commanded are you really living it as a lifestyle?

&gt;""Orthodoxy, unlike other faiths, is a lifestyle."" 

Its an interesting thing that happens to many north American arms of faiths. They seem to ignore what their eastern European arm of their same faith is doing while claiming they are living the lifestyle. May I ask how can the orthodox faith be the right one when in eastern Europe they are blessing wars, aligning themselves in Russia to be the defacto government religion while oppression other faiths? Not only in eastern Europe, notice this link [ENDORSING AGENTS](http://prhome.defense.gov/RFM/MPP/CHAPLAINS%20BOARD/endorsements.aspx). Can I ask how you can be the correct faith if you guys are siding with nations and warmongers? Can I ask how you can be the correct faith if you don't know the bible enough to know God is going to destroy nations and armies as per Dan2:44 the ones you are siding with? Can I ask how you can be the correct faith if your faith is right there front and center as an endorser of ones who Satan will mislead and use as per rev 16:14 to fight against Jesus and his angels. Yes you guys are all about tradition of your church but doesn't the bible preach a message of peace while you guys side with ones who arent about peace? No offense dude but you don't know the half of what your faith is doing on the other side of the globe. What they do paints you with the same judgement Rev 18:4,5.

&gt;The Orthodox Christian Faith is that which has been handed down to us from the Apostles in an unbroken.

If this was the case you would be preaching house to house, Matt 24:14 says this must take place BEFORE the end. If Jesus or Paul, Peter, Stephen, Apollos was brought back would they be ignoring the preaching work with Gods day so close at hand? To be a true follower of Jesus would mean doing what 1 Peter 2:21 says. Jesus had ONE job which he handed off, that many today are ignoring due to ""traditions""

&gt;Her ministers do not interpret the teachings of the church based on their own knowledge but upon the teaching of the church as revealed through the church and tradition.

That is exactly what you are doing, as I pointed out about you are missing some GLARING no no's God has warned about.

&gt;That attitude is what lead to the heresy of the so called reformers and is what has splintered Christ’s Holy Church.

Most pre-reformation religions preach and teach that the bible is second fiddle to church tradition. The whole reason for the reformation was because those pre-reformation mainstream religions weren't sticking to the word of God and were way off track. In fact even today those per-reformation mainstream religions look down on post reformation faiths because they use the bible as a basis for their faiths. Since when did using the inspired word become a bad thing? When the inspired word was used to expose the wrongs of the church, those pre-reformation never forgot that, and now have made God's word a pariah.

We are 6000 yeas into bizarro world where ones who are supposed to be teaching the God ""inspired"" manual (the bible), these faiths who should be leading the way with using it, are instead ignoring it or down playing it for ""traditions"".

How can you attain salvation for yourselves and your flocks it you ignore, and down play the importance of the writings that lead to salvation???? It's as stupid as ignoring or down playing instructions from your doctor to prolong your life.

As for the link between WWI, WWII, and the Cold War? You need to break that up into the relationship between WWI and WWII as well as WWII and the Cold War. The WWI world, or rather, pre-WWI world existed in a very different dynamic than the Cold War. 

Also, it'd help for you to be more specific - region, aspect, etc. The basics you can get off Wikipedia. There are far more vestiges of the 1910 era in Asia at the time of the Cold War, for example, because the Chinese turmoil and civil war ran to 1949 and became part of the Cold War.

And to answer the questions you had earlier: The immediate spark that set off WWI was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, in Bosnia, in 1914. Austria had annexed Bosnia earlier, and as you can imagine, it wasn't the most popular act. Serbia, an up-and-coming Balkan nation that was fiercely nationalistic and anti-Austrian in policy, may have had a hand (pun intended) in the assassination, and the series of alliances in place in Europe that was built through the 19th Century kicked off a chain reaction that pitted the nations at war.

As for WWII, the Treaty of Versailles was overly punitive and effectively created a Germany (Weimar Republic) that couldn't adequately manage its own finances, and widely seen as a backstabbing act by Germans who thought that reaching out to offer an armistice would reduce the terms of their surrender. In response, after hyperinflation and the depression hit, ultranationalism became in vogue and Hitler rose to power riding that wave.",,1335900591,1428835218,AskHistorians,10,0,t1_c4iugly,t1_c4iu6ho,True,False,,,

Cities like Paris and Amsterdam simply cannot expand, while st Louis can. This further causes the car focus, because sprawling cities are not suited for rapid transit, because of low density. These things influence each other, making it worse. Because highways are the only viable option to get to a city in an affordable way.

But if you look more closely, European cities have many freeways too. The difference being that they don't extend into the city centre, because that is historically unacceptable. San Francisco is actually the same, but does it make things that much better? And look at the German Ruhr area. It's more dense in freeways than Los Angeles. But it does not have the same problems.

That's my point moron. When europeans initially got smallpox, plague, etc, they didn't die off. Instead europeans got stronger because the disease killed off the weaker people.

&gt; Disease can and does wipe people out.

There never has been a documented case of this happening. It's a biological impossibility due to mutation and adaptation.

&gt; The black death, a disease Europeans had little immunity to, killed up 60% of the population of Europe.

Bullshit. It is estimated from 10% to 33%. And europeans didn't get wiped out did they? 

&gt; That's one disease. American Indians were hit with small pocks, tuberculosis, cholera, typhus, measles, colds, and flues. They had no immunity to any of those.

And? It isn't additive, if small POX kills 30% and the flu 5%, small pox and the flu doesn't kill 35% of the people. There is a lot of overlap between people would die from small pox, flu, measles, etc. 

&gt; They had no immunity to any of those.

And neither did europeans, africans, pacific islanders, etc BEFORE they got immunity. 

So ultimately, it was the migration of europeans that wiped out the indians, not the disease.

theram4,t5_2snuc,c4iuuo5,0,0,t3_t1ui5,0,False,"Thanks for your reply, but I don't really agree. I read of a study once (I wish I could find the actual study), that showed when children were given absolute freedom to find and engage in any activity they wanted, most were somewhat confused, and their ""happiness level"" wasn't very high. In contrast, a second group of children were given a choice from among a handful of activities. This group of children were much more engaged in what they were doing, exhibited less confusion, and had more fun.

Likewise, I have read several studies that address the psychology of choice. At a typical supermarket, we might have a dozen different brands and sizes to choose from. We get overwhelmed from all the choices. In contrast, if our choices are narrowed down to only a handful, we have a much easier time making a decision. One study showed a statistically significant increase in a purchasing decision made when the choices were narrowed.

In both of these cases, sure, our absolute freedom was restricted. However, an argument could be made that our freedom was actually increased when our choices are restricted. Maybe you call it something different from freedom. The point is we have an easier time living life and having fun when our choices are restricted.

This is what Paul is talking about. We are no longer slaves to our sinful natures, slaves to these poor choices. I believe it is wrong to denigrate another person. So I suppose you could say that I no longer have the freedom to cuss out and disparage another person whom I disagree with. But I don't agree. With these choices removed, I actually feel more freedom to encourage the person, to calmly resolve our differences. Maybe in absolute terms, my freedom is decreased, but from apparent choices, it's better.

This is the whole point of Christianity. Christianity is not about being a slave to an absolute tyrannical authority. Read Romans 6. I'm sure you have, but Paul makes a good case for this. In fact, he even admits that using the analogy of ""slave"" and ""free"" is simply a human analogy so that his readers understand. His point is that sin no longer pulls at us. I no longer am a slave to alcoholism, or emotional abuse, or anything like that. I can live freely.

One more comparison, if I may, from the political world. Strict libertarianism argues that we ought to have freedom to do whatever we want. But most people argue today for a more social-democracy approach. In the US, we don't have publicly funded health care. On the one hand, strictly speaking, we have great liberty in our health care choices. But the poor in effect don't have health care choices at all, because they can't afford health care. In a social democracy as typified by many European countries, citizens are forced by an authority to pay for health care. But in the end, though their freedoms may be decreased, it really allows for more freedom, in that you can actually have the freedom to live a healthy life. You are not encumbered by the inability to pay.

LRonPaul2012,t5_2cneq,c4iuwlm,2,0,t3_t1ktm,0,False,"The funny thing is that a lot of examples of the ""gold standard"" are actually fiat.  From David Graeber's book on the history of money:

&gt; During the reign of the actual Henry II (1154-1189), just about everyone in Western Europe was still keeping their accounts using the monetary system established by Charlemagne **some 350 years earlier­ that is**, using pounds, shillings, and pence--**despite the fact that some of these coins had never existed (Charlemagne never actually struck a silver pound), none of Charlemagne's actual shillings and pence re­ mained in circulation, and those coins that did circulate tended to vary enormously in size, weight, purity, and value.** According to the Chartalists, this doesn't really matter. What matters is that there is a uniform system for measuring credits and debts, and that this system remains stable over time. The case of Charlemagne's currency is par­ ticularly dramatic because his actual empire dissolved quite quickly, but the monetary system he created continued to be used, for keeping accounts, within his former territories for more than 800 years. It was referred to, in the sixteenth century, quite explicitly as ""imaginary money,"" and derniers and livres were only completely abandoned, as units of account, around the time of the French Revolution.

In other words, Paulbots will cite this reign as an example of the gold standard being successful for over 350 years because all purchases are measured in gold and silver coin, despite the fact that *no gold was actually being traded and the coins don't actually exist.*

And the same thing is true in the US.  Even when the US was ""backed"" by gold, no one took is seriously.  As soon as people began to cash in their gold in large number, the system collapsed.  In other words, the gold standard only works as every day money in cases when it's never actually used.  Which is functionally *identical* to fiat.

Therein lies the problem with the above citation.  It doesn't properly define the meaning of fiat and gold, which gives them the ability to cherry pick so that all the failures are listed under ""fiat"" and all the successes are labeled under ""gold.""",,1335902380,1428835427,politics,2,0,t1_c4iuwlm,t1_c4isewt,True,False,,,

Great War = Rise of the new Germany after the Franco-Prussian war and age of Bismarck. Germany needed raw materials desperately for its industrial gear-up. All the colonies were spoken for by England (sun never set on thsi british empire), France, and a few others. Russia also had tons of resources it wasn't using. Sarajevo was the excuse they could use to get some with the best army in the world at the time (serbian terrorist shot arch-duke ferdinand of Austria, Austria asked Germany for help, Germany agreed, Austria gave Serbia an impossible ultimatum, then invaded anyway, Russia backed Serbia (pan-slav thing), Britain/France backed Serbia (balance of power thing), and everyone went home with the Spanish Flu).

You could simplify it to WW1 caused by decline in use of normal coal (which Germany had vs metallurgical coal and oil which they really didn't), and their need of other feedstocks such as rubber and guano. Britain had a monopoly on most of those resources. Call it the first of the oil wars.

They lost. OTOH they took Russia down with them, so swings and roundabouts.

WW2 - Germany was not broken by WW1, but the rest of the world was broken by the Great Depression. Time for a rematch. Still need raw materials, this time Europe is dramatically weaker due to economic issues. The costs of WW1 were devastating also (roaring 20's were largely caused by us selling them stuff they couldn't make themselves yet). Japan is now desperate for oil and steel as well, and starts looking for their own sources (as currently Britain, France, and US have an effective monopoly on oil at this point).

Once Germany gets momentum, it just keeps going, surprising everyone.

Jump to Cold War. Now we're afraid of Russia, considering how strong they became after beating Germany. We rebuilt Germany as a rampart to contain Russia. What follows is a very very stupid game of whack-a-mole where Russia tries to convert a state somewhere, and we try to hold it (often by supporting horribly cruel and corrupt people, because they're easier to buy and hold with ""money""). This goes back and forth for a while, because nobody wants war again after the last few decades, plus we've got nukes, and later they have nukes, and somehow we figure out that no matter what happens we all die.

[deleted],t5_2qqjc,c4ivghk,1,0,t3_t1izb,0,False,"Perhaps this isn't the case with Feta, although as I said it was found to be  almost exclusively marketed as Greek, so perhaps there is something that it gains from that, but a lot of products *do* gain significantly from their origins.  Scotch, for instance, gains from the strict production techniques, and also the peat used which imbues it with certain flavours.  Wines gain from bottling processes, as well as the soils and climate of a region.  Meats from grass and rearing, cheese from molds, etc.

There are very strict rules surrounding designations of origin which preclude their use for product names that are generic at the time of applying for them - thus spaghetti would never gain one.  The PGIs and PDOs protect producers in a local area whose products are synonymous with those areas and gain specific qualities and characteristics from those areas.  Just because something is similar to them doesn't mean it should benefit from the same name and the associations that that may bring.  Many people may colloquially refer to their mp3 player as an ipod ( know my parents have) but I don't expect you would similarly argue that Apple should allow, say Microsoft, to market their own products as such.

As I said - Feta-type cheeses *are* marketed as ""soft sheep/goat's cheese"" (and I wasn't totally wrong - some feta is made with goat's milk, albeit not exclusively) and still sells fine regardless.  Designations of origin are treated, within the EU, as a form of commercial ownership, equivalent to trademarks, and while they might not be  in the US that's just a difference in cultures.

andernathanson,t5_2twoq,c4ivghz,1,0,t3_stpx7,0,False,"&gt;Sad truth is that the only way we will make progress is if we inject our politics into a bourgeoisie party. But this is what socialists have had to do for decades. In Europe, for example, where many countries have multiparty systems (which have their problems too, for sure) the socialist parties are forced to join bourgeoisie coalitions in order to get their policies implemented.

But wouldn't you say that the coalition governments in those European countries are bad for the movement? It forces the party to the right and makes it partners with the bourgeoisie for austerity (i.e. England, Greece, etc.). What is needed in those countries is a break from class collaborationist tactics and labor to power on a socialist platform. This of course will only come with the return of the masses to the labor parties, which will happen in time as it has time and again before (i.e. the Orange Wave in the Canadian elections). 

&gt;Since coalitions don't exist in 2 party systems, we have only one realistic choice. Even if there were enough people to create a significant pro-worker movement (which I don't think there are, especially here in the south considering union membership in South Carolina is only 2% of the working population), they would have to be more numerous than the centrists in order to replace the democratic party. This is not the case and never has been the case in history. Most people are moderates (mainly because most people don't seek betterment of society and prefer the status quo - they fear both progress and regress)

Why do you ignore the actual activity of our class in analyzing the situation? Organized labor may only account for 2% of the population but workers still constitute the vast majority of every state's population. The beauty of a labor party is that it offers a channel for labor action for workers who do not have a union. Clearly for a LP to be successful we will need to carry the unorganized worker's vote. 

People are looking for something else, just look at Occupy. This movement has swept the nation because people are tired of the same old bourgeois politics. In the south this can often take the form of supporting reactionary, faux populists like Ron Paul. They are clearly rejecting the politics of the status quo, but as there is no leftist voice they are pulled in by the false promises of the racist, petty bourgeois libertarians. Give the workers a real choice and just watch as the tides change radically. 

The south is a hot bed of poverty and frustration, which is why it is so important to keep us divided based on class, gender, sexual preference, etc. But as everything is in dialectical motion the current conditions will give way to their opposite. The south will explode with populist fury, as it has in the past, and will change the course of history. If we leave this movement to be taken over by the petit-bourgeoisie and their parties then it will fall into reaction. We must build viable mass organizations capable of leading our class in the right direction. ",,1335904625,1428835692,redstatereds,1,0,t1_c4ivghz,t1_c4ibas0,True,False,,,

[deleted],t5_2snvh,c4ivjcj,8,0,t3_t110p,0,True,"I'm not American, but I am black/white mixed, so I humbly offer my perspective:

I was born in southern Africa, and raised there and in east Africa til I was 15, then moved to Europe.  My parents split up when I was 4, and my white European dad got sole custody of my 2 sisters and me.  When we lived in Africa, we had a very mixed level of social/professional/scholastic interaction, with Europeans, Africans, South Asians and people from all sorts of cultural groups.  At the time, I didn't find it to be anything special, just how it was, but have now come to realise that having such a mix around me was great.  My family was always as true to my dad's heritage (and by extension, mine) even though we were not surrounded by it - it gave us a cultural home, a sense of belonging, even though we were caught up in a cultural maelstrom.  

Through the moving, changing schools, changing countries, cultures, languages, customs, making new friends and all that, the one thing that was constant was our family: me, my sisters, and our dad.  We didn't have to conform to any standards other than what being a family was about.  Our dad never held us back and said we couldn't be friends with so-and-so because she was different.  I remember getting my hands painted with henna because an Indian friend of mine was getting hers done for a celebration.  I had friends over from school who thought we were weird for putting marmalade on cheese. It was share and share alike, all the way.

When I moved to Europe and went to uni, there was a guy in my department who was also mixed like me: African and European.  He basically chewed my ass out for identifying with my dad's culture, and accused me of denying my African heritage, and my blackness.  I can't deny anything about my heritage: it's written into my skin, literally.  However, the fact that what I consider home is my dad, and my dad's culture, is not immediately evident.  I find it irritating that someone would want to negate all of the love, support and encouragement my dad has given me by being a wonderful parent by saying that I'm some sort of 'race traitor' by identifying with him or our culture more.  

I hate expressing my heritage or culture along racial lines.  It's not something I grew up with.  My dad doesn't have blue eyes because he's a white man.  He has blue eyes because that's what my dad looks like.  I don't have brown skin because my mum is black.  I have brown skin because that's what *I* look like.   Circumstance has made me identify more with my dad's culture than my mum's, but it doesn't mean I hate who she is, or what she represents in me -  I am who I am, and I look how I look.  

If people want to give me shit for who I am, they obviously have problems of their own.  Personally, they can go to hell, and leave my toasty brown ass alone.

Our hundreds of years of striving for pure white, European homogeneity and English language dominance is what I think has led to this. We shunned out anything else really, and the existence of such small amounts of German-speaking [or close enough to german] people is testament to that. And it doesn't help that we put such a negative connotation on Spanish and Spanish speaking people as a culture. Languages are almost a niche market in the US. 9 times out of 10, you're going to be using it in a decidedly non-American context; whether that be traveling, amongst foreign family, or in the role of having a job within a ""high need"" language, like Arabic or Chinese.

DrBobert,t5_2qh34,c4ivl4n,1,0,t3_szrm8,0,False,"&gt;I want to live in a society where people can question anything and everything without fear of legal consequence.

I totally agree with that sentiment, but I've become more of realist on this issue. At least, 'a realist' is the best way I can term it.

I hold stock in the proposition that 'a person is smart, but people are not' (yes, I quoted Men In Black), or putting it another way: 'The general public are idiots.' To have an open and fair marketplace of ideas assumes that everyone is engaged in it equally, and that a debate on every issue is fair and equal.

Take, for example, gay marriage. In a true open market place of ideas (and for convenience sake I will refer to this as the US model - this is, after all, what the US is trying to accomplish), all speech relating to gay marriage has equal weight, no matter how hateful or untrue it is. My religious belief on children of same sex couples will have the same weight as your social studies about the impact of gay marriage on a child's development. My distorted facts about the cost of gay marriage on the economy should be counter balanced by your accurate research by the finest economists in the world. The people will see that you are telling the truth on the economic impact, and so should rally behind it, drowning out my erroneous speech. The US marketplace thus by and large should ignore the falsehoods. The opinion that emerges from that debate is the 'right' one. After all, the marketplace of ideas chose it to be the right one.

However, we know this is not the case. Not all arguments and viewpoints are given the same weight. For one, some people don't care enough to engage in that debate, even when it could very well affect them. But most importantly, we know that there are those with agendas (political, spiritual, or spiteful) who *do* care about these issues. And they care enough to shout louder than everyone else. Instead of the marketplace drowning out the falsehoods, the falsehoods drown out the 'truth' of a situation. To carry on with the gay marriage line, it's apparent that there are political groups who have the funds and the influence to have their messages heard more than say a gay rights group. And people who don't care enough or don't want to look elsewhere for information on gay marriage are probably more willing to say 'I'm hearing this viewpoint a lot, it must be more aligned with the truth'.

The US marketplace of ideas is drowned out by the bigger voices. And the bigger voices can do so because the First Amendment says that their speech has equal weight to their opponent's. If the opposition speech was any good, then the marketplace would rally behind it.

The European view is, I believe, built on the lessons of European history - kings, crusades, Nazis and everything in between. Europe as a continent has seen war and strife, hate and bigotry, and now in a more 'enlightened age' the collective mindset is 'free speech is great, but responsible speech is better'. To avoid repeating the days when saying 'Jews are evil vermin who should be driven out' or 'Those Muslims shouldn't get to live here' was seen as perfectly valid, the solution adopted has been to stop those ideas gaining currency in the first place.

I see the falling economies (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain) being offered **financial help from big (and mostly American) corporations** that will subsequently add logos (and that's just a symbolic take-over, they'll actually begin to own everything) to every aspect of the history of Western civilization. The **wages will drop**, the **work hours will increase** and the **common man's cultural/political drive and involvement will die down**. Human rights will automatically suffer, as will the general dumbing down of populations. 


What is sad is that the rest of the world (for better or for worse) lives by European example. Civilizations expand and have downfalls - yes - but I fear if the European example falls before the intellectual rise of the rest of the world, we're in for a very tiny percentage of the population (the financial elite) practically owning the rest of us in the future - without enough people's movements to fight that.

Its funny how you guy can keep doing wrong things misleading many yet think that God is ok with it. Where in the bible do you read God gave blanket forgiveness for continual wrong doing? Where in the bible do you read God will give blanket forgiveness at armageddon? Last I read he is sending his Son to come and judge the earth. Yet you guys keep telling homosexuals and other wrong doers that God is ok with what they are doing, you don't have to change. That is completely BS.

&gt;Where did such intolerance of differing religious views exist? Oh right, the Crusades.

Its not about intolerance, its about your blanket tacit approval of what God clearly said he hates. I dont have to go about on any crusade because that is what God will be doing at armageddon. Trust me he wouldn't be happy with you guys mislead other into continuing their wrong habits. Its funny how you claim intolerance what is intolerant about pointing where you are wrong? If you told me I was wrong and showed me proof from the bible I would truly consider that. Where in the bible do you read God is sending out others to tell wrong doers everything is ok with God? Nowhere because God has always sent people out to preach and teach HIS righteous requirements.

&gt;Even though there are 3000 Christian denominations in the world right, yours is the only right one, right?

There are actually more but for the sake of an argument lets reason on what you said ok? Lets reason on some of the things the right religion would NOT be doing.

* item 1 Matt 7:14 says the right religion would be found by few. Is your religion few?  Does your religion preach and teach what the majority beleive Yes or no? Why does Jesus make it a point to say at matt 7:13 the majority are on the wrong road and not the right road? How then would the minority differ in its teachings? Many people like yourselves think because you have a majority it is smooth sailing but its not, neither does the bible say that.

* item 2 We already covered the right religion would not be accepting what God hates. God hates the continual practice of homosexuality, along with fornicating, lying, stealing etc. Yet you guys are scared to teach that. There is nothing those people can do to you that will be worst then God's judgement.

* item 3 We already covered the right religion would not be backing nations and its wars, yet you Presbyterian are right there front and center backing the armed forces, giving them you approval. Even if you personally aren't, the head of your church IS and that means you are a party to the bloodshed they are blessing.

* item 4 We should both know that God has ALWAYS been against interfaith. Because if you where the true faith then why would you need to hang out with false religions right? Dude you faith shows up as part of [World council of churches](http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches.html), and [The National council of churches](http://www.ncccusa.org/members/index.html)  

Those are only 4 thing of the many. Please tell me how I'm wrong while your faith is out there cavorting with God's enemies unless you are one also. Dude dont hate the messenger make a change. You can call me all the names you like but God is still coming to remove those who are in the wrong.

&gt;Learn to respect differences in interpretation of scripture and beliefs.

I do unless they are clear. See the issue many church like yours have is they have a fall back line of reasoning, you call into question interpretation, you will call into question the applicability of it for our times because the writer lived in different times, You will call in to question God's own commands. God inspired the bible what was written especially in the NT is VERY applicable for us living near the end. 

For the sake of argument lets hear you interpretation of matt 7:13,14. Lets hear your interpretation of Ps 37:9-11, 1 john 5:19, rev 12:9. Im going to wait over here--&gt; but I really like to hear what you have to say on these clear verses.

&gt;I disagree with your interpretation of Biblical passages that leads you to your conclusion. I still respect your difference of opinion as a fellow Christian and we can live our lives differently to fit how we believe best serves God.

Dude Im telling you these things to make you my brother. Not to hate on you. 1 john 5:19 is quite clear Satan is ruling the world, Rev 12:9 says he is misleading many JUST as Jesus said at matt 7:13. We all have to wake up and not just accept any old slop for faith, but to make sure what we beleive and what our faith is doing is NOT in violation of God and his righteous requirements. We must make sure our faith globe wide is upholding God's requirements. I have sen to many faith blatantly ignore what the European, African, South american arm of their faith and its followers are doing. The true religion would be united globally which means not endorsing war, not accepting what God does not, not getting together in interfaith which God was NEVER happy with EVER.


&gt;Note how I did not say you are off track, wrong, going to hell, or that you must be part of Satan's army. Respect - Learn it.

No you didnt thanks, not im sorry I had to be raw with you, Im trying to wake you up to reality. Satan is using many religions to mislead, test yours out and see. Ask yourself the 4 tough questions I posed above against what the right religion would be doing.

I like to reiterate that I don't hate homosexuals I want them to receive the same gift of everlasting life I could receive, but while im trying to show them God requires change just like the guy in the article understood. If other religions are undermining God's word and telling them they don't have to change, human nature what it is, we would al rather not have to do anything.

You really are kind of misjudging the Germans there.

The thing is, German politicians want fiscal union in Europe, they want what we call ""more Europe"". Before that happens, they will resist any stimulus packages (or similar stuff). Without more accountability, there won't be more money. And, of course, neither does Hollande have the power nor the will to sever the Franco-German axis and push it through alone. So the faster fiscal union happens, the faster the economy can turn to the better, I guess.

Only if you include them in the US numbers but *not* in the other OECD countries.  There needs to be an apples to apples comparison, which is why I stuck with the [initial OECD data on tax revenues](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=21699), which show about a 10% less than average collection rate.  If you're also curious on including expenditures, the [OECD has that data on their countries (large PDF, graphs start around pg 237)](http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/seges/arquivos/OCDE2011/OECD_Tax.pdf), and while the data isn't perfect (US numbers from 2008, some other countries from 2006), it seems that both the UK and Canada have a large number of tax expenditures, yet both countries collect 7-8% more in tax revenue than the US.

While I agree we're not going to make serious moves in this number merely with a slightly higher tax rate on the top income bracket, it would seem that other countries are able to collect a lot more revenue with a combination of higher income taxes on *everyone*, higher payroll taxes, higher capital gains taxes and higher sales taxes. From the looks of it a [VAT alone](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=21699) could help collect 6% extra revenue a year.

[deleted],t5_2qhb9,c4iwujz,8,0,t3_t22z4,0,True,"I'd play Devil's advocate here and say that if FG got a clear majority last election, what would the consequences be on Ireland, as opposed to what has transpired so far? I honestly shudder to think. Although i've no solid proof we only have to look to the shit FF got us into when they essentially had a clear run at things. My thinking on this is that Labour, whether we refuse to believe it, have been somewhat of a brake on FG. Don't see this as a glowing endorsement, (Labour's conduct since their election promises showed to be hollow will be the nail in their coffin come next election) just a realistic assessment.

This is how things could have panned out.

1. No matter who is in government, things are going to be shitty or as shitty as it has been because all possible combinations of government (which we would find popularly acceptable as Irish people, lets be honest it was just FG / Lab, or FG / Ind.) would be doing pretty much the same thing since they are ideologically (economically at least) the same when it comes to how they would handle this situation, especially with them being so hamstrung by the troika agreement. As shown by the Greens and Ind. propping up FF in the last session, and how their ideology and bargaining for legislation was dwarfed by the stronger larger party, so it would be with any other combination other than Labour / FG, as Labour has relatively more bargaining power and are more political savvy to keep FG from having their cake and eating it.

2. Labour could have said that they are standing by their principles and their ""roots"" in ""equality"" and can't in all good conscience go into government with FG who will ""ruin the country"". The only option would be to go into power with independents for FG, as FF and Sinn Fein isn't acceptable, no matter how much talk of ""pulling on the green jersey"" that would go on, it's just not viable for a variety of reasons which i'm sure we all know about. The independents needed to form a government wouldn't have been gotten since to have a clear majority FG would have to woo a lot of independents who ran on a platform of essentially telling the rest of the world to go stuff it's debt in it's ear. Not likely. Even if FG achieved this miracle it would have been the least politically stable Dail in history operating at the most perilous time in history. I couldn't see any of the tax cuts and charges being legislated for. So we are back to square one where there is a re-election where Labour runs on a more leftist platform telling Frankfurt it is their way or the highway on debt or FG with some of that and some austerity. Whichever party wins goes out in the next election as they run Ireland into the ground by having a clear run to enact their ""extreme"" plan. FG would probably have won too, because Labour not going into government with FG would give them political ammo, that they didn't have Ireland's best interest at heart by calling a re-election and costing the state money, yadda yadda. 

Either way, I think if Labour had gone for any of those combinations (lets say for brevity are the most likely combinations of how events could possibly have gone down) they would have ended up on the scrap heap come the next election. 

The question here is, what would you have them do otherwise? They are in an impossible situation (by way of point one and two) and I can't see how they, a centre left party, could have come out of this smelling of roses when it was basically forced into government with a centre right party that have opposing views and nearly a clear majority to swing their ideological weight around, to Labour's detriment.

The more important questions are what will fill the political vacuum should Labour be slaughtered at the next general election? Will a new party arise? On measure, FF or Sinn Fein in government in any combination scares me more than anything FG / Labour have done to date, and that's saying something. 

When all is said and done regardless of your political leanings, hoping for Labour to be slaughtered in the next election is fucking nuts!

**The Terminator** part is bullshit. Obviously **NOT ALL HUMANS DIED** as they exist in the future; subsequently, it doesn't take much imagination to realize that the robots could coral and coerce the remaining humans into working for them. Or worse, humans (in a moment of weakness or greed) might voluntarily HELP the machines. The whole premise that they 'couldn't create themselves' is utter bullshit. It's plausible, if not likely, in that world. 

**The Matrix.**
Are we really going there? Are we really going to demean the film to this level? Hur dur! Asian population is shrinking derp derp derp.

&gt;In other words, the machines would be short millions of children and would be forced to take tens of millions of children from Africa and reassign them to be children in Europe and Japan and try to convince the population that they are their naturally born kin.


Let me get this straight... you're telling me, that these super robot computers can WRITE THE ENTIRE MOTHER FUCKING WORLD IN CODE...and I'm supposed to believe they can't just do exactly what this guy is saying they can't? Bullshit. They can do whatever the hell they want. As a counter argument, I propose that not all humans **HAVE** to look like they do in the real world, the 'robots' just do it to save time and effort. Nothing suggests or stipulates otherwise -shrug- 


**I Am Legend.** 
This explanation is ENTIRELY too complex, what with the math, however,   it's the most believable. It's true, I wondered the same thing, about the food. Not to mention how they could domesticate animals, since they're mindless...that movie was full of continuity errors. Oh well. Still good.

shoguntux,t5_2sir4,c4ix784,13,0,t3_t1vmb,0,False,"A quick and simple explanation for them is that they are the remnants of the Roman empire from when it went into ruin. and after they moved their capital to Constantinople, and which lost much of the part of Western Europe from raiders and from sanitation problems as the peak of civilization declined overall, IIRC (might be wrong on that. Been a bit since I last studied European history in depth). And also, IIRC, they didn't refer to themselves as the Byzantium initially either, but that's a name which historians later applied to them, naming them after the city Byzantium before it was renamed Constantinople, since they no longer held Rome at the time, and it was no longer as accurate of a description.

Trying to pass them off as peaceful, as I said a few other times, is rather ridiculous overall, as they continued on like the Romans before them in empire building and expanding out their territory. In that respect, they were rather aggressive, although they are more known for their navy rather than their army forces. Trying to portray them as a peaceful nation is roughly like trying to portray the Golden Horde of Mongolia underneath Ghengis Khan as being peaceful diplomats, who just so happened to leave your favorite racehorse's head in your bed to try to get you to come to an agreement. In other words, it's such a revisionist view of how they functioned as a society that it's rather ridiculous to entertain. I can't even think of how someone would come to that conclusion about them.

Of course, this is also what led to their downfall as well, since they were so aggressive all the time that they didn't feel the need to build up a lot of allies, since what would be the point, if they felt like a vassal state was a lot better. Probably one of the few allies that I can think of that they did have, were the Rus (Russians), but in a lot of respects, they were essentially just a kingdom which they had fought into becoming a vassal, but didn't absorb entirely at the time because it was towards the end of their existence, and they didn't have the resources to do so. That's where the term czar originated from for the names of their rulers, in that it was essentially a Russianization of the term Caesar, as they felt like they were the dynastic successors to their empire once they were gone.

Won't try to go too much farther into it than that though, as I know the history of Western Europe a little better than Eastern, but that's probably enough to give you an idea why it was such a ridiculous statement on its face that it made people question just how much he knew about his history.

Even today in Spain the age is 13, and I think even in one US state females can marriage at that age. If you back further in time you will see this age drop. It's just the way life was, and it's worth remembering that often life expectancy was a lot lot lower, around 30 in during the dark ages in Europe for example.

As for Aisha. The Prophet was thinking about marrying, and one of the women suggested Aisha as a wife. She was already betrothed at this point. So both points suggest that it was entirely normal. She also stayed with her family until she was considered mature enough to become a wife, at which point she moved to live with the Prophet. Traditionally, when a woman had her period, this was considered the sign of maturity. It can be difficult to relate to.  Today we live something of a pampered life, we don't have to work to survive, we have high school, university, but they had none of those 'distractions', life was simpler I suppose.  

One other thing about Aisha was her father. Her Father and the Prophet where very close indeed. He was one of the most beloved people to him, and this marriage cemented that bond. 

Aisha turned out to be exceptionally bright, and her youth and vigor meant that  the Caliphs and others could get guidance and learn from her long after the Prophet's death. 

There are so many stories about the tenderness of their relationship. Like the one where he asked here where on the cup she drank from, so that he could drink from the same place her lips had touched.

His most beloved wife though was probably Khadija. She was older than him and had been married before. So in these two examples we have different roles models.

That said Schiff focus' on investment, if I had to have one or the other put together my portfolio I would listen to Schiff. He may not be very aware of academic scholarship compared to Krugman but he is interacting with the market on a long term basis, this first hand experience provides him a different context, he see's things down to the level of actual investments rather than as and in terms of various aggregates. There are academic side Austrian economists who publish often and are active in the academic sphere, I think the context of their predictions would be more in line with where Krugman is approaching things. 

The money manager actually is a part of the market and has an intuitive sense of the market psychology that can only come by directly interacting with the market. The academic economist if you ask him the question ""what should I invest in to make money"" will just give you an icy stare, they get that all the time and usually it's a stupid question because that isn't what an academic economist focus' on.

Yes. We're well aware of the obsessive nerd effect. This is reddit after all.

&gt; Also there are so many pagan religions that its hard to make a blanket statement like that. 

There are many pagan religions that have never become extinct, if that's what you want me to concede. I am not trying to convince people that only the monotheist religions still exist in any ""true"" form or anything like that. The African Diasporic religions, every one of the 10 zillion religions throughout the Indian subcontinent, and even some bizarre ones in the Middle East still exist in their recognizably original forms, or at most they have evolved into something that shares continuity with the original. 

What I am saying is that the European pagan religions are all dead. The Norse pantheon, the Celtic pantheon, the Greek/Roman pantheon... and even some of the lesser-knowns (Etruscan, Slavic, etc). The Egyptian pantheon is dead... even if it wasn't thoroughly co-opted by the Ptolemies (is that spelled right?), Islam in the Nile delta would have wiped out any remnants centuries ago (No, Aleister Crowley doesn't count). 

These religions are dead. And if those who ""practice"" them want respect, I can give it to them as if they were dramatic re-enactors... but little else than that.

&gt; And obviously they stopped sacrificing because animals die. That's enlightened thinking.

I have no problem with animal sacrifice. If we can eat them to satisfy our need for hunger, then ritually slaughtering them to satisfy our need for superstition seems little different to me. If the worshippers of Odin had really survived and their religion had *evolved* into that, I wouldn't call it extinct. But you can't claim to revive a religion at the same time you're changing everything about it.

At best, it's a new religion ""inspired"" by the old. Any resemblance to traditional deities is purely coincidental, yadda yadda yadda.

? I was skipping Alsace Lorraine b/c it was a background note, and a consequence of the Franco-Prussian war. Other than that how was it not a balace of power issue?

&gt;&gt;You could simplify it to WW1 caused by decline in use of normal coal

&gt;Only if you blatantly ignore everything that was going on at the turn of the century.

? The sudden shift from coal to higher quality raw materials processing, and the dramatic shift to high strength carbon steel, coupled with the naval expansion post-dreadnaught, including oil burning turbines seems to track thus far?

&gt;Germany was not broken by WW1

As a country, they were not, they kept their patriotic nationalism, their character and sense of manifest destiny as a country, their economy was destroyed, but outside of raw materials and the Saar Valley, they had most of their industrial heartland such that they could rebuild, though the reparations were crippling, they were handled via the Weimar inflation...

&gt;&gt;but the rest of the world was broken by the Great Depression.

&gt;So Germany wasn't affected?

If I throw a match at a bonfire, it's not as bad as throwing it into a puddle of gasoline.

I am trying to point out how the rise of Prussian Germany under Bismarck from a group of rival European states in the 19th century, was a direct factor in the tensions that later led to WW1.

In WW2 the goals were less subtle, Lebensraum, or specifically, the Ukrainian heartland for food, and the incredible oil supplies throughout Russia, which a sufficiently industrialized economy is dependent on.

Revolutions in the aftermath, saddled with a treaty that left it defenseless, all previous conquests in the east done away with, a pariah in Europe, soon to experience hyperinflation, left at the mercy of the French and Belgians who could and did invade at a moment's notice, etc.  What is your definition of 'broken'?

No you don't. You can also choose any of a number of middle ways, as social-democracies and even forms of centrist and christian-democratic government have shown across Europe and the non-U.S. West for decades. 

There are ways to promote equality without imposing state control over the whole economy. In short: you can choose any level of trade-off, where you end up with some economic liberty and some economic equality. You dont have to choose for all of one or all of the other.

And that's just the answer to your claim that still accepts your premise about what actually makes for economic liberty. You could also ask yourself, does unbridled capitalism really equate with economic liberty? For whom? 

E.g., is the sweat shop worker in an emerging market who works 10 hours a day for wages barely enough to survive on really enjoying ""economic liberty""? For that matter, is the U.S. white-collar worker who is expected to willingly take on any unlimited amount of unpaid overwork, only take 2 weeks holidays a year and still face imminent dismissal if he should ever fail an employer's demand really enjoying ""economic liberty""? Or should there be another definition of economic liberty, which is measured by more than just the boss's freedom from regulations and taxation? 

To a large extent, after all, the industry regulations, capital restrictions and redistributive taxes that have marked most Western countries in the last 60 years have increased liberty for the common worker: the freedom to work reasonable hours for reasonable pay for example, the freedom of fear for life and limb that came with worker safety legislation, the freedom of fear of illness that came with universal health insurance, etc. The freedom that literally comes with having more free time to spend with one's family, when no longer shackled by a 10-hour day and a 6-day week.",,1335918477,1428837142,occupywallstreet,6,0,t1_c4iyjdh,t1_c4ivqt6,True,False,,,

&gt;The more relevant question is whether it would be cheaper/more productive to address that debt through fiscal austerity (higher taxes, lower spending), or through expansionary policies (taking on more ""productive"" debt to expand the GDP and tax base).

&gt; That's not a question that can be answered philosophically, I think. You can't just say ""well, I'll just get out of debt by borrowing a million dollars in good debt"". The opportunity has to be there, and the evaluation is specific and technical, not ideological/philosophical.

&gt; That said, there are some aspects of the arc of history that are too obvious to ignore, with or without technical expertise:
If you look at history in 100-year chunks, 2012 is way more different from 1912 than 1912 was from 1812, or than 1812 was from 1712, or 1712 from 1612, etc...

&gt; For that matter, 2012 is more different from 1962. Change is accelerating, almost entirely for the better, in terms of the human condition, and 2062 is likely to be as different from today as today is from 1912.

&gt; There is a movement in the US that almost seems to want to turn back the clock and seal the world in plastic, or that wants to pretend that we can somehow halt change through military power or somehting. That's not going to work, and it seems most closely allied with the ""pay down the debt"" mentality today.

&gt; USA is positioned far better than any country in the history of the world to sustain its position as intellectual, military, moral, and technological leader. But that can't be based on trying to force other countries to stop progressing. It will only come through re-investment.

&gt; We are the richest country in the world, in every sense. We can be the kids who ""pay down the debt"" in order to squander grand-dad's fortune on fancy cars and clothes, or who reinvest, and re-leverage more debt into producing the best and brightest minds in healthcare, technology, engineering, finance, entertainment, higher-education, and so on, as our grandfathers did.

&gt; There is nothing stopping us from building the greatest society the world has ever known. We already live in it. The question before us is: do we mortgage the family farm to buy clothes and cars, or do we simply chop it all up to close the books and call it a day, or do reinvest in making a better farm?

&gt; America will not be the world leader that is today without significant societal investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (""STEM""). Other countries will invest in those things. Capitalists above all should not regard that as a zero-sum-game, or us-versus-them thing: making the world better makes it better, period, end of sentence.

&gt; But USA is in the best position any nation has ever been in to either accelerate or stifle world development and prosperity. This might be a difficult moral decision if doing the right thing didn't mean an even richer and more powerful USA.

&gt; There is a whole lot wrong with the USA, but compared to historical standards of globe-spanning empires, USA might not be the best cultural, military, economic, moral, and technological leader the world could ask for, but it's almost certainly the best superpower that has ever existed in the real world.

&gt; America's strength has always been its flexibility, its willingness to be whatever the world needs it to be. America's greatness comes not from rigid adherence to fixed ideology, but from messy and blurry self-reinvention, answerable only to vague and lofty principles laid down by articulate hypocrites.

That's one area where the focus should be on right now. In the case of Spain, this means finding something to replace what used to be the construction sector with.

Many of those policies are free, others actually require investment. To make the money for the latter available, apart from having those convincing plans in the first place, is a real unified common financial policy in the EU, or at least the Eurozone. This will be at the cost of national sovereignty, which makes it politically difficult, but it will be hard enough to convince voters in Germany et al. to accept long-term monetary transfers as it is. If they just have to transfer money without there being any constraints to how this money will be spent in the recipient countries, this won't happen.   
To help countries like Spain to become more competitive without having to go through internal deflation, the ECB should increase the inflation target. The value of the euro needs to go down, wages in the more efficient economies need to go up, while the others try to hold theirs stable.

But Spain leaving the Eurozone? I don't think this is a good idea. You can't leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU. If you had savings, and Spain would be about to leave the Eurozone, would you leave those savings in Spain to be devaluated? Wouldn't you sell those assets that can be sold to move your money elsewhere? Wouldn't you withdraw all the cash you could to carry it across the border, especially since your debt would be devaluated as well? It would have to happen over night, capital controls would have to be put in place, and all the cash you'd withdraw would have to have a stamp that said ""peseta"" on it until new cash would be available to replace it with.  
Contracts would have to be rewritten, especially those with business partners across the border. Even those within Spain would have to be renegotiated, since imports that have to payed in euros or dollars often play into the price. Salaries would be difficult to simply convert as well -- especially receivers of low incomes spend a large share of their income on things where energy prices and transportation cost are a large factor, and with a devaluated currency, oil and gas imports would become relatively more expensive.

Investors unwilling to invest right now will be even less willing to buy bonds of a country that has returned to its old currency for the sole purpose of being able to devaluate. This has never been done before, and for the reasons I've mentioned above the outlook for the Spanish economy would be uncertain at best.

""In the Jewish diaspora, a Jewish quarter is the area of a city traditionally inhabited by Jews. Jewish quarters, like the Jewish ghettos in Europe, were often the outgrowths of segregated ghettos instituted by the surrounding authorities...

Jewish ghettos in Europe existed because Jews were viewed as alien due to being a cultural minority and due to their non-Christian beliefs in a Renaissance Christian environment. As a result, Jews were placed under strict regulations throughout many European cities...

The character of ghettos has varied through times. In some cases, the ghetto was a Jewish quarter with a relatively affluent population (for instance the Jewish ghetto in Venice). In other cases, ghettos were places of terrible poverty and during periods of population growth, ghettos (as that of Rome), had narrow streets and tall, crowded houses.

Anarchism, in the way you explain it existed, 30,000 years ago on the plains in Western Europe. Small tribes worked and traded furs together, they painted cave paintings. You know why it went away? Because Tribe B decided they wanted Tribe A's hunting ground(as an example) and they won with might. That's the problem with anarchism, you can respond with force, but then whoever has the most force wins and they get to set rules. That's all of human society, it builds up and then it crashes, and then it builds up and then it crashes. China the past 5-7000 years have had constant warfare and they were mostly farmers, they just had to be convinced by somebody else that they'd be better off by killing farmers from the next town over and growing more food for their people.

You don't get it, anarchism has happened, and you don't address its short comings, you spout philosophical crap trying to make an appeal to emotion, how do you overcome its failings? By computers?

After creating a better governing system two decades ago it is only fitting that his Grace continue to reign as long as he sees fit. (He's also an 8/7/8 ruler and my infamy is off the charts). Although some question his decision to emulate the heathen Venetian government and model his title after it, it can be said that our incredible efficiency is enough to silence these detractors.

Administratively Doge Basir has wisely been building up our infrastructure, we have vast road networks in every corner of the empire, an incredible modern manufactory in Halab,a university in Al-Qahira. Now the great Republic relies little on taxes, once the staple of our nation and is instead entirely self-sustaining. And, thanks to his efforts is now the most economically successful nation on Earth! Allah willing we will maintain this wondrous achievement.

Our army continues to grow, now approximately 108,000 men are prepared to defend the Republic. Along with our vassals armies our corner of the world is not an area to be trifled with. Only Austria has more troops ready to defend its frontier, but soon we hope to dwarf the heathen nations army as well. With a manpower limit of 120,000 this feat is attainable within the next year.

The Republic continues to incorporate its lesser vassals into the realm for the good of Islam. (Dulkadir, is the newest addition) As only if we are united can we hope to hold off the heathens that share our borders. Stretching from Bursa to Iran and Yemen our borders are now truly something to behold.

Nationalist revolts spring up every once in a while in a vain attempt to restore backwater kingdoms that are far better off under our glorious leadership. They are all futile though as our Republic has several large armies guarding every region of the nation. 

The foolish Knights of St. John, in a desperate attempt to restore Catholicism to Anatolia launched two crusades against us. The first time we punished them heavily and warned them, but after the second transgression it became clear that the only solution was outright annexation.

Thanks to our colony in Qonekticut (Connecticut) tobacco has finally been introduced to Alexandria.

I don't think anyone would doubt that Luther was helped by the printing press (I'm sure you can Google just as well as I can) but can we go so far as to conclude *post hoc ergo propter hoc?* No printing press = no Protestants? 

Well, I can't give you an answer but here's some thoughts:

(1) Luther wasn't just some yahoo with a printing press. He was a professor at Wittenberg, he was a German patriot, he was a powerful writer, and - most important - he was protected politically (by no less than Fredrick III). Probably the only thing that saved him from getting burned at the stake (which would have put the brakes on Protestantism big time) was that the Holy Roman Emperor wasn't going to risk civil war by invading Saxony just to put the Cleansing Fire to Luther.

(2) Luther was in the right place at the right time. By the 16th century, attacking the Church was the national pastime. Luther had a number of famous contemporaries (Hulderich Zwingli, Thomas More, Desiderius Erasmus) who were openly and *bitterly* critical of the Church. Heck, the Church itself only condemned fewer than half of Luther's 95 Theses (it was only later when Luther sassed the Pope that he got himself excommunicated).

(3) The implication that Protestantism spread because of the availability of cheap books - noble Luther criss-crossing the countryside and winning over the unwashed masses by shoveling mass-produced copies of his treatises from the back of a donkey cart  - seems to me a little too simplistic. Remember, this is the Middle Ages. Literacy was largely restricted to the clergy and the nobility. If you gave a German peasant a copy of *On the Freedom of a Christian Man*, they probably would have eaten it. The peasants mostly remained Catholic anyway, which might explain why when they got uppity, Luther took Fredrick aside and said it'd be fine by him if they slaughtered all the peasants, which Fredrick did, in great numbers. In fact, if you look at a map of Europe circa 1600 the Protestant strongholds are in places like northern Germany* where the Catholics are, well, dead. And there's no better way of getting your new religion up and running than having your buddy the Protector of Saxony wipe out the competition.

(* and of course in Switzerland, where John Calvin is having his nutty.)

Hope that helps.

In this case there is no middle ground for the temperature ranges.

Soccer is popular in America. There, I said it. It isn’t as popular as football, baseball, or basketball, but it is becoming more and more popular every year. Hell, 13.5 million Americans watched the Women’s World Cup final this past month. Not just the World Cup, but the WOMEN’S World Cup. Compare that to the WNBA where they averaged 269,000 viewers per game on TV. I know what you are thinking, “who in the fuck watches women’s basketball?” Well, obviously 269,000 people a week do. But that is one of America’s most beloved sports, played by women, and a sport that America supposedly doesn’t like, played by women, kicked its ass. Sure, the WNBA isn’t as exciting as a World Cup final, but that is beside the point. Soccer is popular in America, but not everyone is hopping on board. 

When talking to colleagues about soccer, the people that talk the most shit on soccer are conservatives. Just listen to this segment from Glenn Beck’s radio show from last summer during the men’s World Cup. My favorite is how he somehow takes the World Cup and spins it so he can talk more shit on Obama. He is a radio genius! When you think about it though, soccer has many values that conservatives could get behind. 
#1: Nationalism

This is probably the biggest value that conservatives and soccer share. No matter what the club does, the die hard supporters will always cheer for the club. You will hardly ever see people changing which team they support. Same goes for conservatives and the United States. Sure, they may question the people who are in charge of the country (or the club), or they may not like the results that are happening in Congress (or on the pitch), but conservatives will always support the United States. You know how conservatives love the flag (“these colors never run!)? Well, to a soccer fan, the crest of their favorite team is their flag. I imagine if a Sporting KC crest touched the ground, I’d have to burn it out of respect. You always stick with your club, through thick and thin, just like conservatives do with the country. While they may not be happy about the current president, they will always love the country.

#2 Corporatism

If there is one thing soccer is good at, it is making money. Everywhere you look in a soccer stadium, you see advertisements. Advertisements next to the pitch, on the players’ shirts, all over the stadium. Soccer teams do a great job of whoring themselves out to corporations, just like how conservatives have whored themselves out to the corporations of the United States. I just wish that politicians suits would be like a soccer shirt, and it would show where the politician got their money. Also, in terms of regulation and a salary cap, soccer is as deregulated as it gets. Wanna spend $110 million on one player? Go right ahead, no one is stopping you.

#3  Hard Work

Soccer is a hard game, especially when it comes to scoring. But when you do score in soccer, it is extremely exciting. I compare scoring in soccer to trying to get laid in high school: sometimes it is really hard to do, but once it happens, whether it is ugly or pretty, it is always exhilarating. Conservatives are all about sticking it to people who are lazy, which is why I don’t understand why they like baseball so much. That is probably the slowest game ever invented. You could have an outfielder just standing out there for three hours, not doing shit, and the team could win. Why the hell does that outfielder get to be on a winning team without doing anything? What a lazy ass. 

It is different in soccer. You have to work really hard, individually and as a team, to score a goal. Not only that, but your hard work pays off. One goal could be the difference between glory, and being yelled at for six hours when you don’t win one World Cup match. In basketball, if you work really hard to get a basket, it normally doesn’t matter (unless it is a last second shot and your team is down by one). In soccer, a goal in the fifth minute could be what decides the match. So in soccer, hard work pays off. That is a huge conservative value.

#4 Change, or the lack thereof

Conservatives hate change. Anything that has to do with change, they hate it. To them, the word change = socialism, and the only people who use socialism are those liberal pussies in Europe. You know who else hates change? FIFA. Even after this blatant missed call in the World Cup (for you soccer noobs, for a goal to count, the entire ball has to cross the end line, which in this video, you can see the ball crossed the line, but no goal was given), FIFA still won’t consider implementing technology into the game. Not even technology that will tell a ref when the ball has crossed the goal line. This goes right along with conservative values: keeping things just as shitty as they used to be, and not progressing with the times. 

Unfortunately for soccer fans like myself, the reasons for conservatives to hate soccer far outweigh the reasons for them to like it. The biggest reason conservatives hate soccer: the United States isn’t the best at it. As a matter of fact, the USA is far from the best. In the latest FIFA rankings, which ranks countries by the talent of their national team, the USA is ranked 30th. That is not good for a country that is supposed to be the best in everything. I imagine our ranking in football is #1, but we don’t know that for fact since the rest of the world is too scared to play football. 

It will take a while for conservatives to start enjoying the sport. Hopefully they can learn that soccer isn’t just for liberal hipsters that enjoy folk rock and listen to NPR. Soccer has something for everyone, unless of course you are Glenn Beck, but I don’t think that man likes anything, even himself.

One huge reason I even ask this question of culture and christianity is because the sda school I most recently attended for some time did two things: 
Strengthened me in areas of academia that I needed, setting me on a track to continue growing. 
And, test every aspect of my belief system, I have come out having thrown all my cards up in the air, to be reassembled, some in the same order as previous, others entirely different.  I view that as a very positive thing in general, in other ways...I'm still looking to be sure, hence (in part) my question. 
Here a few thoughts, I won't feel bad if you don't read it in entirety, my attempt at being concise didn't last past my first point.... heehee

Ordination.  Traditionally western culture has had men in public positions especially religious or political.  Matriarchal or Patriarchal, does it even matter socially, religiously, politically?

Wedding band and eating cheese was understood as culturally necessary in parts of Europe because of people's views, and lack of other food options.  In US for many years it was felt to be culturally unnecessary, to some a sin, now is fine in most circles.  Never mind wedding rings, the strongest reason I have heard for not wearing jewelry in general as an sda, was that it is “unnecessary adornment” or leads to, or is often a result of pride and love of display, and conforming to worldly ie ungodly and unnecessary custom.   -I'm still thinking, and rather unconvinced (Lord help me if its a hard heart problem), but in most circles no one has had anything to say of my wearing little dried rose buds around my neck.  :) 

Drinking wine. In Japan it is such a strong custom for men, they are outcasts if they don't. So, in order to not be automatically shunned in the (majority of cases) even from family, and have contact with them hindered or cut out, is a person (who is has not been susceptible to addiction) going to have a really good reason not to, or just drink just enough to satisfy custom? 
I could, in some circles try and bring marijuana into the discussion -but I think I have little question personally. (I don't like my mind being altered). :P  -but is that strong enough? Hmm...

Dress/modesty. Jesus culture had their customs, western culture had and has theirs.
Both cultural groups in ancient times wore robe/skirt style clothing for both genders, with colour and style being the main distinction. In the west the men seemed to change to britches/some sort of tights or leggings first, later, much later the women.   (some people feel its imodest for women, but not for men, okay, logically how?).
My friends form Czech Rep. describe how there (or in their part of Czech) it is a strong custom for men to wear speedos, and women bikini's to the pool/beach, they said that commercial pools will not allow you to swim with board shorts. I don't see speedos as a strong custom here (in Canada/America), is that a question of morality, or is there something deeper to consider? Or the well known custom of nudity on the beaches of Australian and other countries.   To most Canadian/American's this is not normally the general custom, but is there a Biblical culturally transcendent reason to be a spectacle with clothing on in a nude beach?  I'll wear a skirt swimming if,...that statement would honour God most.  I know this is describing a specific situation but the idea of how one portrays them self in any given context seems to me still applys. 

Yes, the Bible lays out in old and new testament principles for clothing, namely modesty, difference in gender, and healthfulness -which is all glorifying to God, an expression of the love of God in our hearts. 
But, am I just going to pray and go with common sense, or is there a logical reason if say I am in Czech, and have already agreed to take a bunch of church youth to the pool, and I don't feel right about backing out; what if I had not previously thought bikinis (the same thing I wear to bed in a cotton version) were something I felt fell into the category of morally modest? But, since I have no natural inhibition to bikinis what would I be praying about, whether I would be making totally unnecessary display by dressing in a one piece or  fitting  in and not get extra looks?  How do I put respect to God first, (since that is my sincere desire) but also show appropriate respect, as His representative towards other people as well?     Thankfully I don't face this often...lol     If something is totally normal, is it really “causing” lust on mine or other's person part? -or, what exactly is “to look ... and lust in (their) heart?”   
  Is the idea that showing skin just a long held taboo from the cloistered mindset of the dark ages?  Or, progressive truth of the enlightened protestant reformation -to use very loaded language.  :D 

Then there is the idea of “love God with all your heart and your neighbour as you self,” ie showing respect of/to God, and of/to the people around me. How is his love dwelling in my heart going to be expressed in  relation to eating or accepting food from people unacquainted with my normal diet. 
In a culture where to refuse food is to refuse/reject the person offering you part of who they are as a person and community, I have to have a very strong/good and an explainable reason in order to not eat what is put before me, be it meat, or something biblically unclean.  The later  quite possible to explain respectfully -though you still risk. (but then, walking with Jesus was never going to be totally accepted or understood anyway). 

I don't wont to be taken for someone who is trying to see how much of a “cultural christian” I can be and still be biblical, ie. saved. But, I seriously have questions, and just try to live life by what I can logically or for a reason of strong impression justify doing or not doing.  And....it is all about the heart, I strongly belief my actions are not going to save me or put me in better “standing” with God, and hopefully (though its not true) with mankind. :) I don't want to sound like I obsess over external lifestyle questions, I haven't hardly talked about it with anyone for two years and just do my best to pray and use common sense, and what logic -(expression of principle) is left after being ""educated"".... :) 

Sorry this is incredibly long, and I haven't even mentioned entertainment, or worship styles etc!  Or anything political. -that's why I'm looking for ways to not have to labour through every different topic specifically, but wish for something deeper....it must be there....

Kaiverus,t5_2sokd,c4j0yev,0,0,t3_t2kfm,0,True,"You just are not seeing all of the consequences. Yes, cutting government spending during a recession, with everything else being equal, will worsen the current economy. A worse economy (with laid off government employees and fewer social welfare dollars going to other citizens) means these people will have less money to buy things (and they will also save more now that they are worried about the economy), which means less income, property, and sales taxes. Less demand means less supply is needed from producers, so they cut back as well on production and employment. This is less taxes (VAT, payroll, corporate income tax) on their side, and creates a spiral until it reaches equilibrium. More unemployed also means a greater strain on the social welfare system. If the government balanced its budget at the beginning, they will soon have less income and more expenditures (unemployment assistance, food aid, etc.), which means it again has a deficit.

The problem that Greece, in particular, has is that the government, which was the major employer, had to fire lots of people, cut wages, and cut social welfare programs. The economy went into a worse mess than before, so their debt-to-GDP is still high, or higher than before. They then have to cut even more in order to get bond interest rates down, which hurts the economy even more, thus their budget. Pretty much all of the European countries that have tried balancing budgets are in or will soon go into a double-dip recession, and now the technocrats like the European Central Bank and Italian PM Monti are trying to focus Europe on growth rather than just cuts.

This is actually economic fact, and almost all economists prescribe to the idea that Keynesian economics works in this fashion. The problem is that since the 1970s monetary policy was considered the best way for government to intervene in the economy, but with interest rates at 0% we have mostly used up monetary policy's uses.",,1335929527,1428838354,explainlikeimfive,0,0,t1_c4j0yev,t3_t2kfm,True,False,,,

CountVonTroll,t5_2r5hw,c4j176e,5,0,t3_t2jke,0,True,"Public universities (which are what almost everybody goes to) cost no or only very low tuition fees in several European countries, not just in Norway. Germany, France, Switzerland and others are the same, yet others charge non-EU/EFTA citizens extra or let their universities set their own tuition fees for their various programs. So, there are several options, best try to think of which countries you'd like to study in and then research what it would cost.

There are a few potential hurdles, so it's good that you're planning ahead. I'll use Germany as an example, because that's what I know best, others will have similar but slightly different rules.  
The most obvious one is the language. There are many Master programs that are taught in English, but unfortunately only much smaller number on the Bachelor level. If the course language isn't English, you will have to pass a language test.  

The next hurdle is that US high school degrees don't automatically qualify for admission. The requirements for Germany can be found [here](http://www.anabin.de/scripts/SelectLand.asp?SuchLand=124&amp;MyURL=lstAbschluss.asp), but unfortunately it's in German. If I'm reading this correctly, this means that you will have to meet a minimum requirement [of courses](http://www.anabin.de/scripts/frmKapitel.asp?ID=2577) (ask if you have questions), plus at least a 3.0 GPA, plus a 1.300 SAT score in math and critical reading (Edit: This seems to refer to the older SAT system) or an ACT composite score of 28. You can lower those requirements by studying in the US for a year to 1.150 (SAT) resp. 23 (ACT). There's another way by picking the right AP courses and doing well in them, USA-BV07 and BV08 on that page. Ask if that's relevant for you, I don't want to translate all of that if you don't need it.

Finally, while the student visa comes with a limited work permit, you'll still have living expenses and need to show that you'll be able to cover at least the first year. For Germany, this requirement is 8.000 euros, either in form of your own funds, a loan, or a scholarship. AFAIK, you can use US student loans to study overseas, but as with everything else I write here, don't rely on this information.

After your graduation, German student visas will give you 18 months to find employment for which your degree is relevant. During this period, employers can hire you without the red tape that they'd normally have to cut through to hire a non-EU citizen.

So, in short, learn a language and do very good in school. Take the admission requirements into consideration when picking courses. Save money.

My education and knowledge of the Holocaust was gradual, I don't remember it as this sudden moment in my life when it all hit me. But I come from a secular, liberal family, and I went to a Conservative synagogue and its Hebrew school. No one tried to scare me. Then I went to college and started going to Chabad and I became a little bit more exposed to the Orthodox community. This is when I really started seeing the scare tactics you're talking about. The Rabbi there took every opportunity to say ""These people want a repeat of the Holocaust,"" ""There are still people out there who want to destroy us,"" ""Remember what happened during the Holocaust, Jews didn't expect it then, and even though we don't expect it now doesn't mean it can't happen again."" I went on the Chabad birthright trip, and they made a huge thing out of the day we went to Yad Vashem, they showed us videos of radical Islamists being Anti-Semitic, they asked us questions like ""Do you think the Holocaust could happen again?"" and lectured us on how it could. They took us to military outposts and had more officers and trip leaders tell us how threatened and unsafe the Jewish people are.

After this experience, I realized what you and others were talking about. I was a college student at the time, so I had the rational reaction--extreme annoyance. But if this was thrown at me as a child, I would not fully grasp the reality of the Holocaust. I would understand it as SIMPLY a matter of ""the world hates us and wants to kill us,"" which is a very superficial version of the facts. This petty scare tactic would actually decrease my appreciation for Jewish history, because fear wears away. Especially the degree to which they use every opportunity to mention the Holocaust...I would just go from shock and an unhealthy, antagonistic image of my world, to eventually being apathetic. I was lucky enough to have a family that was more interested in educating me than shocking me, and I took a European History (1880-1945) course in college with an absolutely fantastic professor. I understood the Holocaust and the context in which it occurred. Today, I am informed, I have a bit of fear in me, but most importantly, I understand. If the Jewish community focuses on education instead of training people to fear the rest of the world, we can actually embrace ALL of Jewish history. My Rabbi at Chabad was a great person, but he did absolutely nothing for my respect (which is very little) towards the religious Jewish community.

Of course not.  Show me where, in an written atheist doctrine, it says to kill people.  For that matter, show me a universally accepted written atheist doctrine.

&gt;I (think) said punishments were carried out by the secular government. Not the inquisitions.

You should learn your history.  Almost all, if not all governments of Europe in the Dark and Middle ages were monarchies believed to have divine right and were closely intertwined with the Roman Catholic Church.  Additionally, the inquisition **was** the punishment and torture.  They weren't inquiring anything, they just tortured your ass until you admitted you were a heretic, a witch, or an apostate, then they burned you alive.

&gt;But if taboos have no ultimate power, then the edifice of human culture implodes.

The fact that ""the highest values devaluate themselves"" is a deathly blow to the traditional culture, that's true. After all (paraphrasing interpreters of Nietzsche) this has always been the destiny of Western thought, since its Greek origin. I found the work of an Italian philosopher (Emanuele Severino) extremely illuminating on these themes. Unfortunately, you won't find translations of his books. But you can take a look at his Wikipedia entry [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuele_Severino). Another recommendation: the Romantic age poet Giacomo Leopardi. You may find more material about him in English. Read [this](http://atlas.verslo.is/integration?s=20052006/italy/italian_literature). He was a precursor of Nihilism (even Nietzsche acknowledged him). He's considered among the greatest Italian poets (after Dante of course). Needless to say he's my favorite...

&gt;Many people believe that man is the pinnacle of evolution, that man was made to rule the world, and exploit nature in any way possible.

Man isn't the pinnacle of anything: it's just the latest model on the market of primates.

&gt;You say nothing is forbidden in your worldview. That is why people hate and fear atheists. It makes you a potential felon. An atheist has marked themselves as a person who may not respect a group's taboos, which makes you an enemy.

You are generalizing too much by saying ""people hate and fear atheists"", somewhat implying that ""all people"" do that. You might be thinking only about the US. In Europe, where I'm from, atheists are a significant group in many countries. ""Hate and fear"" are such strong words. Unfortunately in these debates, it's common to just use black and white: there's actually a lot of grey out there. 

I would say that many people find atheism discomforting: they don't fear atheism itself, but rather the possibility that they may question their own beliefs. I consider those people in a ""state of minority"" (Kant). I wish I could shout: ""Sapere aude!"". What's more self-demeaning than refusing to fully use our intellect?

&gt;But the weakness of atheism is that in a godless universe, killing atheists would not be wrong.

Why is this a weakness? This doesn't contradict the supreme indifference of everything. It seems quite coherent to me.

Also, in real life, humans organized in societies, even though aware of the non-existence of absolute value, can arbitrarily agree on useful and temporary rules that forbid murder: relative values turn out to be quite practical. Who cares if they don't have a transcendental foundation? Those who don't abide by these rules will be prosecuted. Societies can do that, regardless of their belief in god. Sure it's arbitrary, but it's doable. At worst, one can use violence to impose his will. After all, wars have been a constant in human history, and ironically many (most?) of them have been inspired by religious conflicts.

&gt;Sayings like the Earth is our mother is not new age BS. It is just a poetic way of describing the fact that humans originated on Earth, and depend on this planet for survival.

Try and say that to the victims of natural disasters.

&gt;An atheist believes that a certain configuration of molecules can gain awareness. That given enough time, non-consciousness can turn into consciousness, with no evidence to show for it. But many religious traditions believe that awareness or consciousness has always existed, or is the only thing that really does exist.
A scientist may believe that the universe can create itself from nothing since gravity exists, and since quantum particles can pop into existence. And yet Hindu cosmology says that the universe is created from nothing, and later destroyed, and that the cycle repeats forever. And it said it thousands of years ago.
A scientist may talk about quantum teleportation, or quantum non-locality, or spooky action at a distance, and yet many religions have said that everything is connected for much longer. In the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus said ""I am everything.""

Of course many vague ideas have been around for ages! But it is not intellectually honest to put poetic descriptions of the Universe (as those of religions) on the same footing with quantitatively precise scientific statements. It's quite a stretch! A non-religious example: Democritus and his idea of atoms. Nobody can seriously say that Democritus was a precursor of modern chemistry! Scientific progress is painfully slow: I experience this first-hand everyday!. Science doesn't light-heartedly state that ""everything is connected"", or that ""the Universe is created from nothing"". It rather goes through decades of theoretical models and experiments, looking for factual evidence, or at least trying to build a logically consistent framework in the absence of definitive experimental inputs. The method is NOT indifferent. The scientific method has proved successful over and over. Can you say the same for religious myths? Nope.

&gt;Science first assumes that everything is fragmented.

Reductionism is usually the simpler approach to a problem, and it has worked quite well in the past.

&gt;In pantheism, atheism is simply God pretending he does not exist.

Nice way of putting it! I'm going to recycle this phrase in the future.

&gt;If there is no God, and if death is intrinsic to nature, science can do nothing to escape it. If the death of humanity is inevitable, the death of science is also inevitable. If it doesn't matter when a person dies, it doesn't matter when science dies. The universe is indifferent.

I agree on every single word here. The neat thing about Science and Nihilism is that they acknowledge their own fragility, they undermine their own survival. I find this simply amazing. On the other hand, you keep implying that this is something negative, a weakness of my worldview: I rather think that this weakness is tragic and epic at the same time. 

What's to like about the modest consolations coming from the fictions of religions? Don't you feel more alive thinking of the vertigo of Nothingness, which is so exhilarating and so depressing at the same time?

As a final note, may I ask you what's your background? I would like to give a more precise face to these walls of text.

Indeed.

&gt;Please, wake up, and realize that 2012 is not what the peasants of the dark ages lived in. When your biggest worry wasn't ""is my spiritual need and mental readiness acceptable"" but instead ""Am I going to have enough food to eat, can I survive another year, how are we going to make it.""

Sir or madam, you take me for a fool, and I resent it.  I full well realize that the peasants and serfs in feudal Europe did not live in 2012.  However, bear in mind that until fairly recently, perhaps until the turn of the 20th century, the issues of ""will we have enough to eat?  can we get through another year?"" were shared by the vast majority of people, even in industrialized nations.  Yet somehow, more, not everyone, but a higher percentage than in the middle ages, found the time to be educated.  Whether you choose to accept it or not, there is a correlation between the ""Dark Ages"" and widespread ignorance.  Why do you think the period immediately following was known as the age of enlightenment?  Also, whether you choose to accept it or not, the Dark Ages were marked by domination of the Holy Roman Church over much of Europe.  I don't think it's much of a stretch to claim that A correlates to B, and A correlates C, so B more than likely correlates to C.  In this case, A is the period known as the Dark Ages, B is widespread ignorance, and C is religious domination.

For further reading on the matter, you might read [this](http://www.askwhy.co.uk/christianity/0800DarkAge.php) paper by Dr. M.D. Magee.

&gt;Actually the original cause was the help the byzantine empire out, Seljuk Turks were pushing in from the East and they applied for aid from their Western brethren.

Yes, that is what the Crusades were **originally** about.  However, as it does with all things, religion poisoned it.

""The Crusades were a series of religious expeditionary wars blessed by the Pope and the Catholic Church, with the stated goal of restoring Christian access to the holy places in and near Jerusalem.""

""Several hundred thousand soldiers became Crusaders by taking vows;[2] the Pope granted them plenary indulgence.[3] Their emblem was the cross—""crusade"" is derived from the French term for taking up the cross.""

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades

Seriously, if you're going to debate about history, you should be knowledgeable about that period.

&gt;This is related to the holocaust..... how?

This is more related to showing that Adolf Hitler believed himself to be doing the work of the Christian god than being directly related to the Holocaust.

Way to cherry pick the weakest two quotes though, and ignore the one that is most damning (no pun intended) to your argument. 

&gt;Because its ludicrous to hold everyone accountable for the actions of a few?

I agree, sir or madam, which is why I do not hold any living Christian 
responsible for such atrocities.  However, I hold Christianity as an entity and especially Catholicism as an entity responsible for those atrocities.

&gt;I challenge you to find any group on the face of the earth that as a whole, meaning everyone one of them with no exception, has done something beneficial. There are always negative costs, always.

I see that I was not clear on my meaning in using the phrase ""as a whole"".  My apologies.  For clarity, I use that phrase to mean not every individual within a group, but the group as an entity.  So, reworded for clarity, my challenge still stands - Point to one thing that religion as an entity has done to objectively better mankind.  I admit to a bias on the matter, but I can think of nothing unique to religion or originated by religion that fits this criteria.

&gt;If you want to play pretend and hide in a fantasy world that exists in your mind, a shining utopia that would exist if only the religious were gone you are welcome to it.

Not the religious, sir or madam, but religion.  People who want to believe in something larger than themselves and strive toward a common goal are not the problem.  Irrational beliefs that promote ignorance, intolerance, and bigotry are.

&gt;I prefer myself grounded in reality.

As do I, which is why I reject the notion of magic and impossibilities in favor of the real world.

&gt;I can point to you many atheists who are good, who have strove their entire lives to achieving benefit for mankind.  I can show you many religious people who are the same way in both.

As can I.  What I cannot show you is a person who committed atrocities in the name of atheism.  I can (and have) pointed to numerous examples of individuals who committed atrocities in the name of their religion.

&gt;But hey, keep saying religion is evil, that it provides no tangible good for society. I'm alright with that, just know you've accepted a lie, a lie you would promote as fact, but again, intellectual dishonesty is in every group.

If I have, as you claim, accepted a lie, then point out the falsehood.  As a burgeoning scientist, my main goal in life is to find the truth, even if it goes against what I previously held as truth.  So, if saying religion is evil is a lie, then please demonstrate how religion is good.

""Throughout the 20th century, Jews have been greatly over-represented in western nations among intellectual elites, in the universities, and among the higher socio-economic classes. The two principal theories that have been advanced to explain this are that Jews have high intelligence and, alternatively, that they have cultural values that promote success. We review the evidence and present new data suggesting that high intelligence is the more important of these two factors.

Jews have been greatly over-represented among intellectual elites, in the professions, the universities, among business leaders and the very rich in 20th century. Weyl and Possony (1963, p. 142) calculated that in the period 1901–1962 16% of Nobel prize-winners for science were Jewish. They estimated the world population of Jews in 1938 at 18 million and the world population of European gentiles at 718 million, and calculated that Jews were over-represented by a factor of approximately 6.6. Jews have been about half of the world’s top rated chess grandmasters between 1851 and 2000 (Rubinstein, 2004) and of the champion American bridge players and theoreticians (Storfer, 1990).""

I've played a decent amount of GW2 over the beta weekend, and would like to clarify a few things:

1- There is healing in the game. There is your self heal which you get, some classes get healing skills off the bat to let them heal others elementalists, engineers get an aoe heal and a healing turret, and even the mesmer gets an ability to heal other people just by casting unrelated mantras as a trait bonus. Keep in mind there are a lot more skills that do regen(heal over time really) and other types of healing and direct healing that i've not covered because i've not seen all the heals.

2-Tanking - the way mobs 'aggro' in the last beta weekend seems to be very centered around damage dealt and range to the target, more specifically, the more damage you do and the closer you are, the more likely you are to be targetted. Now melee classes from what i've seen and played always do more damage than ranged classes, in order to compensate for them being in range in the first place, and from what i've seen the melee warrior and guardian, and even melee mesmer do adequately at holding a mob's attention over ranged classes once they get it. Their survivability at the moment is poor though, which i hope anet improves.


3-Targetting - If you are a melee fighter, you have no need to do any targeting. If there's a mob in front of you when you swing, you hit. If there are multiple mobs in range of you, you hit them all. If there's nothing in front of you, you still attack, but obviously hit nothing.
For a ranged user, tab targeting is more useful, some may say necessary, since there is a sort of auto homing part of it (which can still be ACTIVELY dodged out of by the recipient (you get an 'evade' msg popping up after double-tapping the directional key and manually dodging out of the way) However, even with no targeting reticle, and no targeted enemy, you can still fire your skill, and if something is in the way, it hits. If something's in between you and your target, and yours is a direct projectile, that something gets hit.

4- Using skills while moving. Surprisingly enough a lot of skills i've tried that require a casting time can be cast on the move. I cannot describe how liberating this feels after having just about every caster class being forced to stand in place all the time to get a single casted spell off.

Onto the issue of tera:

I'm on the fence on getting tera. On one hand it's got combat i would definitely like, and an end game political system that i find very interesting. 

On the other hand frogster's the one publishing it in eu=( The last mmo i played published by them was also another MMO action rpg that had (surprise surprise) a combat system which you also had to aim for yourself (also built on the unreal engine). It was chronicles of spellborn.

They didn't help themselves either with the recent blood debacle with tera eu. I do not mind if they wanted to remove blood for the 12 rating, but they knew they were going for a 12 rating when the korean and us versions have a teen or 18 rating, so they should have been upfront about it and mentioned that they may have to cut blood out.

Anyway, I'll make a concession in one way: the Roman Republic/Empire might have had an even easier time conquering the Americas, as their particular technological stage might have been more adapted than the European technology of the 16th century.

Romans had steel armor and weapons, large shields and were obviously optimized for melee combat, as well as having tactics like testudo to protect themselves from archers.

Not to mention they were accustomed to being massively outnumbered by technologically inferior enemies and defeating them repeatedly. So that would be easy for them.

Whereas the British had designed their armaments for fighting other Europeans with guns, not for combat against melee opponents or those armed with bows.

In any case, if you want to see what melee combat vs European guns ends up like, simply look at the end of Japanese isolationism. There can be no doubt that Japanese samurai were far better equipped and trained than any other infantry of the era, and yet they were no match for firearms and were completely at the mercy of European technology.

It's kind of like how it would be easier to shoot down a Mig-21 with a F-22 than it would be to shoot down a hot air balloon with a F-22. If something is SO far behind technologically that your current systems can't even recognize it, it might be better to have a more low-tech solution.

Ofcourse economics are right sometimes, but it mostly depends on the scale of things, on the situation and on the question asked. Calculating price elasticity is way easier then answering what will be the consequences of the fall of the EU. We can guess, but we will never be able to grasp all the consequences.

I love vegetables and I plan meals a week in advance. This helps to minimise waste. Breakfast? I alternate between boiled eggs, fruit (combination of a banana and apples), I like to bring in a quarter or an eighth  of a galia melon to the office. I keep my bread in the freezer (NOT the fridge) so it stays fresh. I love rice too especially fried rice. Fry up yesterday's rice with a chipped union, some sesame oil, some soy sauce and some oyster sauce and perhaps an egg, cheap as chips, just like pasta. To be honest, I've never noticed any difference between the bottom-shelve-cheap-ass-pasta and the 'fresh' (not dried) pasta. Sauce? Keep it simple, like the Italians do: Fry an union (cheap! store in a cool dark place) in just a little bit of bacon add some oregano and a tin of chopped tomatoes. Bring to a simmer add a pinch of salt to your liking and you're done. Don't drown the pasta in the sauce, appreciate the flavor of the pasta itself. Quick meal? Make that sauce in bulk and put it in an ice cube tray in the freezer. the cubes will be easy to portion. Now you just need to boil the pasta. Wanna make it real gourmet? After boiling the pasta reduce the water that it was cooked in. Now you have this wonderful starchy water. Take a frying pan, put in a dash of olive oil, one portion of cooked pasta and one or two thawed cubes of sauce and a couple of spoons of starchy water.... Add a lot of stirring and heat, put on a plate (add chopped parsley if budget permits) and you're done.
Make sauces yourself. You only need a stock cube, water, flour (cheap from the bottom-shelve) and a flavouring agent (mustard, parsley (left over from the pasta), butter, whatever. It's called a roux. Goes great with potatoes. and (steamed) vegetables. 
This all is called actual cooking. ;) The nice thing? You will know what's in it! 
Tip for porridge in the morning: just buy steel rolled oats (cheap too) soak it in water or milk the evening before and in the morning, add some more milk if needed, zap it in the microwave add some apple, banana or whatever (sugar/salt/maple)and you're done. You'll be amazed how long this bag of oats will take you..
Oh, also eat slowly, drink a glass of water with your meal and you're only allowed to have seconds 15 minutes after you've finished your food and you're actually, really hungry. ;)

Populism: Appeal to the masses, generally against the elite. This can include everything from Rick Santorum (real, hardworking, religious Americans v Secular, Romneyesque, Wall Street elites) to Marx (the working class v the capitalists).

Marxism: The theories of Karl Marx that capitalism would inevitably lead to communism via the dictatorship of the proletariat. Marx predicted that this would be accomplished by the urban working class (proletariat), and would first occur in the industrialized countries of his day (Germany, the UK, the USA, etc.) as capitalism was a necessary stage in human history. He claimed all societies went through the stages of hunter-gatherer, slavery economy, feudalism, capitalism, and then communism (which is ridiculous and clearly based on only reading European history and reading that rather selectively). 

Leninism: The theories of Lenin that a country could skip the industrial/capitalist stage. Lenin felt that Russia was still in the feudal stage but that the peasants, if lead by the small urban working class acting as the Vanguard of the Proletariat, could largely skip the capitalist stage and achieve communism. Marx would have been shocked to learn that the first communist revolution was in Russia and that later communist revolutions were almost entirely limited to poor, rural countries. 

Bolshevism: A movement that arose over a split within the Russian communist movement in the early 1900s. The split with the Mensheviks arose over how to support the party. Bolsheviks wanted members to pay dues and support and participate in the party, while Mensheviks thought dues for membership was sufficient. Later splits within Bolshevism were Trotskyism and Stalinism. Splits along narrow ideological and utilitarian lines are common in far-left organisations.

**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/t2b7x/_/c4iz987?context=1) (Caozao):**

&gt; I've heard people complain about unoriginality in Hollywood, since movies now, if they're not part of an established franchises are based on either comic books or short stories. Do you share this same opinion, or perhaps do you disagree? 

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/t2b7x/_/c4izq7x?context=1) (photogc):**

&gt; Nothing can be truly original. I believe every story can be broken down into the rule of three. (Far wiser/smarter redditors can dig this up, as my brain is fried and not working properly.) Anyways there's a term in which every story ever told falls into a set group of themes/pitfalls. No matter how 'original' a story feels it can never *truly* be, because it essentially has been told before. 
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, Hollywood goes through phases. When they first made film, it was easier to do practical comedy of someone falling over because it needed no sound, falling over is funny. When sound was invented, they incorporated music because it was the best of both worlds. Then there were the crime thrillers with ace detectives, then colour happened and we started doing Westerns, and then war movies became prevalent, then we went through a weird phase in the 90's where everything had to be super melodramatic. And then super-hero stuff came into effect because of the Generation X/Y growing up on comics and having 90's heroes. Not to mention technology is so advanced now they can make ANYTHING happen, which was impossible. If they could have made people climb walls, or turn into fire back in the 70s/80s they probably would have done so more often when Fantastic Four/Spiderman was first introduced. 
&gt; 
&gt; In the end, I think we just have to accept that technology has give us the power to make everything 'better' and more flashy. This will continue until audiences show a decreased interest. Then they'll move onto the next project.

&gt; 
&gt; * Second Second AD - Typically will assist the 2nd AD, though they also are the role of the 3rd AD/TAD. It depends on the production and where they are shooting. North America/Europe...etc
&gt; 
&gt; * TAD (Trailer AD) - Travels cast from trailers to set, signs them in and out, maintains connection between honeyland and set via walkies.

&gt; Why are stand-ins really necessary? Can't the actors just work a few extra  minutes a day and just stand there themselves?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/t2b7x/_/c4iztj8?context=1) (photogc):**

&gt; It isn't really a few extra minutes a day. Lighting takes up half if not more of the day then actual shooting. A DOP and the lighting crew need individuals to stand in that are the approximate height/skin colour so that they can properly expose the footage. Also, it allows camera angles to be set, and tested before cast get there so that if there are any tricky camera movements or tricks they can be worked out and ready for the star to step on set. This saves everyones time, and also makes the actors concentrate on their job, which is acting.

&gt; I've been an extra a lot and always wonder what do the lead actors eat for lunch? They don't go to the buffet with the crew, so does catering just deliver a plate of food to their trailer?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/t2b7x/_/c4izv8q?context=1) (photogc):**

&gt; Some cast members have their own dietary restrictions that are written into their 'rider' or 'contract'. Likewise they may be trying to beef up for a role, or slim down for a role and thus have necessities that aren't always available at the craft. Sometimes cast will pay out of pocket for really extraordinary things, but more often then not they will be given per diem to cover costs such as this.

&gt; Really interesting thread you have here! You have done a fantastic job answering peoples questions. I myself work in the industry, but on the construction side of things. I work closely with my bosses privately and through union. When they do union work, they take productions on as construction co-ordinators and head positions.
&gt; 
&gt; I find a lot of the time people often overlook the construction side of things. There are a lot of ridiculous last minute requests, and having worked very closely underneath my bosses I have felt the stress of this. I feel at times they are somewhat of the unsung heroes at the end of the day. What is your experience with construction? Heads and coordinators in particular. I know there are a lot of filters from directing to design to construction, but have you ever tried to ease the blow of a last minute overhaul? Or tell people that their ideas are crazy ambitious and too much work? Or have you mainly only dealt with the production side of things?

&gt; Huge kudos to you sir. You guys are truly the unsung heroes of film work. Some of the sets that are constructed from nothing are truly breathtaking. 
&gt; 
&gt; A huge portion of my job is to call out a director on a ridiculous idea/last minute decision in a kind, effective and respectful way of course. I have seen some crazy things occur when a director comes on set and isn't happy with something he never described properly in the first place. In which case we either reschedule to give more time to change, or work around it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't dealt with too many productions with large scale construction crews. Typically they are brought in by the production designer/art director and done on off hours while we are shooting somewhere else, or during pre production. Though I do remember one instance where we arrived on set to film a police department and the interior was all done up like 50/60 cop style materials. Looked like a gritty 80's cop drama or Beverly Hills Cop when being shot in Chicago. Looked awesome. 
&gt; 
&gt; The director however freaked out and wanted it all much more 'clean' and pristine. The crew had been working all week bringing in materials, and dirtying up the place, drawing up walls and glass that they were totally floored. Eventually the DOP, myself, and the producer were all able to reason with him that the location of the police department in the story would make sense for it not to be high scale, and we worked around it. Though for a good hour he was demanding everyone put in overtime and fix it for free. 
&gt; 
&gt; We ended up just simply shooting a different exterior for the police department to fix the hiccup.

&gt; eheh yeah, sorry I was too lazy to explain it myself. just out of curiosity, where are you based? I'm in the UK and know some things are different in other countries.

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/t2b7x/_/c4j027m?context=1) (photogc):**

&gt; Canada, specifically Toronto. So some of my answers may seem off to some as we typically use both systems of UK and American. The slating is always a toss up of discussion between Script/Camera and (if present) the editor.

&gt; How do you like living in Vancouver?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/t2b7x/_/c4j05bb?context=1) (photogc):**

&gt; I lived there for about a month, and have visited on and off. It is beautiful. I love Vancouver, but the work there is mostly union and typically long term TV, or larger film production. Toronto is much more diverse and has all kinds of productions on the go at one time. 
&gt; 
&gt; The food in Vancouver is unreal, and I'm a Canucks fan. (Prepares for the flames.)
