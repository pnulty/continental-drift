True,0,"First thing to note: Labour has done very well (despite its leadership, or lack thereof). Average swing of 19% to them (or 23% ignoring Rotheram - see below). UKIP's average increase was only 7% (5% ignoring R.). Aside from Corby these were all safe seats, and all stayed that way. UKIP is nowhere near winning, even in Rotheram. Not that this isn't a good result for UKIP - it's always nice to see non-big-three parties doing well.

Looking at votes, we have a significant decrease in all votes for the big three parties (Labour, Conservatives, Lib Dems). In terms of raw numbers, they are pretty much the same - these are (mostly) people who vote at general elections, but can't be bothered to vote at other times. I would suggest they have no strong party allegiance, but vote for whichever of the three they prefer at that time. In percentage terms, the Tories and Lib Dems obviously got hit much worse - but these are (mostly) safe Labour seats, so the same number fewer votes means a bigger change. Plus they are in Government (in theory), and the Government tends to do badly in mid-term elections.

UKIP did see a vote increase (ignoring Corby, due to the lack of data), but it isn't much. The best they did was the 2,428 new votes in Rotheram, but other than that, they averaged 360 new votes (773 with R.). This suggests to me that those voting UKIP are die-hard supporters; i.e. those who *can* be bothered to go out and vote. So yes, UKIP is picking up support, but not much. And this is all with a vastly-disproportionate amount of publicity; with all the nonsense in the press about the EU and ECHR, UKIP have been getting an awful lot of coverage lately - something they may not get at a general election.

To me, then, this doesn't in any way suggest that UKIP is replacing the Lib Dems as the ""third"" party. If anything, it suggests that the Lib Dems are finally being treated as one of the mainstream parties, and UKIP is taking the place the Lib Dems used to occupy (as the ""plucky underdog""). As outsiders, they are expected to do much better in mid-term elections (although the Lib Dems still beat them in the PCC elections), but may be unable to repeat this in a general election.

But what if they do? Even if UKIP are able to replicate this sort of result at a general election (i.e. hold their vote, with a drop in Tory and Lib Dem support), it may not help them, but Labour. Given the FPTP system, coming second gets you nowhere, you have to win - and in these elections, Even where UKIP did come second, they were in second by a long way. To win, they would need to pinch an awful lot of Tory voters, in a safe Tory seat (otherwise while UKIP will do better, Labour would still end up winning).

And even if UKIP did manage to scrape a seat (possibly by pouring most of their funding and efforts there)... one seat is still pretty worthless (as far as 5-10, perhaps). Look at the Greens; they won their first seat (go them), and have been able to do nothing with it. Even the Lib Dems are barely having an impact with their 57. UKIP isn't going anywhere.

Note on Rotheram: this constituency just went crazy - the BNP came in third, Respect fourth. Without seeing polls, I don't know how much of that was due to the adoption mess, but I think this case is definitely the exception rather than a new rule. And even with this significant mess, Labour still had a comfortable lead.

**tl;dr**: While UKIP may have become the ""third"" party, that may simply be because the Lib Dems have moved up to being a ""first/second"" party (along with Labour and the Tories).

[*Disclaimer*: I fundamentally disagree with a lot of UKIP policies and positions, but the same goes for Labour and the Tories. Of the bigger parties, the closest I associate with is the Lib Dems, but am an activist (or sorts) for a different minor party. My opinion is likely to be biased by this.

True,0,"&gt; allegations that the children's birth father had sexually abused two of his daughters and had held a knife to his wife's head while she was holding their baby

Charming

&gt; it is believed social workers do not want the parents to know exactly where the children are living because of safety concerns

So they may be a danger to their children.

&gt; The children's parents, Roma who moved to Rotherham, told the Guardian they have been in and out of family courts trying to get their children back after they returned from an earlier foster placement unable to speak their mother tongue.

If they've had their children taken away at least twice, that suggests to me that they probably aren't very good parents. 

If they don't want their children speaking English, why do they want to bring them up in England where there will presumably go to English schools and if they're here for any length of time will think of themselves as English? Seems a bit unrealistic to me.

In any case, what's wrong with their kids speaking English? The whole basis of the EU from the cultural point of view is we're all Europeans now, and we welcome other European cultures. And iexpect the way the EU is going, speaking English will be a lot better for people's prospects than speaking Slovak. If these people don't like the English language and British culture, **why don't they just fuck off out of our country**?

&gt; But a family court judge ruled three of the children should be returned to the parents after the birth parents successfully argued that the council had failed in their duty to ensure the children enjoyed the linguistic right to learn and speak the language of their birth.

A bloody stupid right: if parents want their child to learn Slovak, bring them up in Slovakia; it isn't rocket science. And given that there are people in the UK from al over the world, it's unrealistic that if their children are put into care, that social services will always be able to find a foster family with the same language. Again, if immigrants don't like that, we're not forcing them to stay.

True,0,"&gt;But where do you hear that they're losing so much?

Well, to be faire, I have heard everything and it's opposite here. He did sign a contract with less money than if he would have stayed in Cleveland, that's for sure. I've seen everything from 15-20mio over the contract, to even gaining money because of the lack of state taxes (or something like this) in Mia.

&gt;I disagree. Teams like LA, Miami, and Dallas spend huge sums of money over the luxury cap and all that because they can afford it.

Well, I think that the whole concept of luxury tax is wrong. Either you allow richer teams to sign players for more money than others or you don't. 

&gt;Agreed, but older players like Duncan/Ginobli/Parker are much more susceptible to injuries, especially with so much traveling and so little rest between hard fought games. 

Yeah, but at some point this ''is life''. The league isn't supposed to offer players the longest careers possible and find formats suitable for 50 year olds. At some point that is the deal for having veterans in your squad: more experience, less minutes. Players seems to stay in the league longer and longer. I'm happy to see this as I like still watching Duncan, but it doesn't serve basketball if you have players in the league who aren't physically able to play a whole season even with limited minutes (without having a too high injury risk).

&gt;If the big teams can play the system to over spend, why can't the small ones play the system by sucking in order to improve later?

I see no problem with small teams staying small and being underdogs year after year until they somehow make x genius choice in a row and suddenly have a shot at the title. I'm supporting my hometowns icehockey team since I'm a kid. We're now in the ''first league'' for around 35 years (there are playoffs and playouts), the second longest off all teams, and haven't won a single championship. The whole town loves hockey, we have been through a lot of highs and really deep lows and we battle every year for the POs. We were only some games away from being relegated in a lower league several times a few years back and are now, after some really good work from the front office (recruiting local players, finding new local sponsors, etc.) a contender this year. The arena is fully packed with 7k people nearly every game and people feel strongly related to the team. That's passion and how sports should be imo. Less business / entertainment and more ''back to the roots'' would really do good to the major sports in NA. This said, the players still earn a shit load of money and often don't choose to go overseas in the NHL and risk a two-way contract. It's not a system limited to smaller leagues. Look at all major sport leagues in Europe for ex.

True,0,"So much hubris exhibited is one post.  It's hard to muster an actual response but I'll try:

&gt;Taking away a woman's right to choose and access to health care and sex education creates a bigger burden on taxpayers than paying for preventative care.

Like it or not many people out there would rather shoulder that burden then pay for the ""right to choose"" or rather the right to kill an unborn child that they themselves are often times at fault for conceiving.  Sex education is fine, labeling abortion simply as ""preventative care"" like breast cancer screenings or something is not.  We are not a disease before we are born.

&gt;Planned Parenthood gets most of its funding from donations. However I think it should get more funding from the government.

I've seen this and similar arguments before.  Planned Parenthood is mostly funded by private donations.  Only 15% of planned parenthood is funded by the government.  Arguably it shouldn't even be that much and we should be funding adoption agencies more so than abortion clinics.

&gt;Anyone who calls themselves pro-life and doesn't make it their #1 political priority to minimize American military occupation worldwide and end the wars in the Middle East is a fucking hypocrite. 

That's cute.  A complete and absolute stereotyping of the Pro-Life community.  Obviously I must be a pro-war nut if I'm against abortion.  I mean what else could I be?  You can't be serious here.  I will only speak for myself, unlike you, but I am against the thousands of military bases we have nation wide.  I am against the constant stream of intervention in foreign affairs that we take part in.  I am against the death penalty and I am against drone strikes.  I am not against the military but I am against those things.

&gt;Also if you don't support universal (single-payer) healthcare and you call yourself pro-life you are a god damned hypocrite.

Far be it for me to ruin your idealist nature but a single payer system would not only cost jobs but bankrupt this nation.  Are you then going to dictate what medical education costs?  How about medical equipment?  Nurses wages?  Doctors wages?  Insurance agency premiums?  Are you just up for nationalizing the whole damn thing and making so the doctor is ""owned"" by the patient.  We've already seen what government does when it gains power in the healthcare world.  The fact that I now have to pay for non-prescription (medical) birth control for others through my health insurance premium is ridiculous in and of itself.

&gt;Women's issues affect everyone. And women trapped in bumfuck flyover country should not be trapped without access to health care options.

Here's that hubris I was talking about earlier.  Fuck you for calling any part of this nation bumfuck flyover country.  Get the fuck off your high fucking horse.  Where the fuck do you get off with this shit?  Women's issues are important but to say that being against abortion is against women is wrong.  If a woman is saddled with a pregnancy that she cannot plan for then it is the role of me and you to find her the help that she needs.  That does not mean that her first stop (or even her last stop) should be the abortion clinic.

&gt;t's the end of 2012. Women's sexual health is a population issue, it's a heath care issue, and it's a basic human rights issue. 

It is the end of 2012.  Population is as much of an issue for men as it is for  women.  You are making it out to sound like the population is going to explode if women can't get free and plentiful abortions.  Please,  the US is no where close to being over populated.  We don't even come close to the population to square mile count that some European nations have let alone China or India.  Abortion, most of the time, is not healthcare.  It is two people who wanted to go at it like rabbits without any thought to what might happen and now want an ""easy"" solution.  

""Fuck the unborn child,  sucks to be them.""  That's what is what I get from your post.  Women's right issue is a bigger basic human right then the possibility of life actually existing before birth.  Screw a possible right to life, women deserve a right to an abortion whenever and for whatever reason they want. (sarcasm).

True,0,"

* First starting up the game, immediately confused about whether I was going to be locked into the side I was having to choose. 

* Confused about what the gameplay pros and cons of each side were. I'd previously assumed they were identical for balance reasons. 

* Actually, pretty much everything to do with the UI just isn't intuitive and doesn't tell you anything.

* I was surprised that my character I have been levelling is stuck to a server. What if I invest 100+ hours and want to change server? Maybe I have friends that start to play on a different server, my usual goes down or whatever... I need to start again? You're adding a lot of risk to my time-investment. My free time is precious, far more important to me than £6/month. Admittedly there's a community advantage from getting players to commit to a server, and free-switching is likely to end up with a few favourites and the rest being for those bored of queuing, but I'd feel a lot better with some kind of transfer system. 

* Found the tutorial vids but, like so many tutorial vids, they make sense to people who already know.  BTW, tutorial vids are by nature not ""tutorial"", they are a lecture. A *tutorial* would be ran in-game where you make the player go through the steps. This interactive approach is vastly better for learning, it always works better to experience doing something yourself rather than watching someone else. They also allow the player to go through it at their own pace and is less tedious than watching an hour of videos. It'd be nice just to be able to spawn into the world on my client to have a look around, learn to fly, maybe be able to trial unlocks?

* The game immediately dropped into the thick of it wondering WTF is going on. Most of the time I have no idea why the game decided to drop me somewhere, because it's invariably into enemy.

* First hour of playing my first major impression what that the game was a f'd up POS - but later I stumbled upon the thread here which gave the server IPs and it looks like the EU servers have terrible peering. Are you running them from a cheap webserver host or something? I get onto Dutch TF2 servers with ping in the mid-20's, by comparison. There is a fat cable that runs from London to Netherlands, but for unknown reasons I'm going via France and 17 other hops. Traceroute also has Telefonica on there but I'm going to assume they own something and I'm not actually going through Spain.

* I stumbled over the other continents by chance, I'd assumed different servers were different continents. 

* I'm still confused what is going on with the map. It seems like it should be an absolutely vital part of the game but it seems like they got lost somewhere between trying to give it a lot of functionality and trying to make it friendly to casual gamers, and ended up doing neither.

* Squads are awesome in the rare occasion that they are being used. Rare occasion.

* I need to investigate squads more, but why does hitting insert assign me to some random ""squad"" all over the map? Why doesn't it look for a squad that has multiple members nearby? When I do get into a good squad this game can be awesome. Most of the time without a good squad, it kinda sucks. 

* There isn't enough info for buying certs, weapons etc. Some of this gear is *expensive* but has no detail. I want *stats* for things I'm buying with a significant time/money investment. Raw stats and comparisons.

* I saw the special offers bit and saw a vehicle starter pack on sale, 2000SC from 4900SC, I think maybe I'll put some money into this game. Then I find out 2000SC is £15. Um, no. £15 for a handful of items out of very, very many. Per faction. £15, btw, is more than half what I pre-order AAA gamed like Borderlands 2 for and exactly what I just paid for Dishonoured. Aren't you supposed to be doing the nickel-and-diming thing? It's not even like the money is the problem per se, it's just that there doesn't seem to be value for that money. I buy tons of games on the Steam sale that I never get around to playing, end up spending a lot more than I normally would, but damnit they don't half seem fantastic value at the time.

* On death, there's the respawn screen with map. But... Not quite the map. It doesn't have all the map functionality, like setting waypoints. This is inconsistent and irritating. I can't even access the real map screen, or any of the other screens I might want to take the downtime to use. 

* No sure how to describe it, but there's multiple irritating things with the player model or whatever it is. Why can't I shoot directly down? Why do my arms &amp; gun seem to flail about in a distracting way? Why does player movement seem so clumsy? It's similar to but even worse than the Battlefield way of doing it, everything feels clumsy and sluggish. Games should never make the interface be a problem. I'm not going to get started on the aircraft.

* Colours are inconsistent. I'm playing the team in red armour, but blue names are friendlies and red names enemies. I think it's the same red/blue on the minimap but not sure, that thing is such a mess anyway. 

* Visually, the game is noisy like a Hawaiian shirt. I'm on low settings with washed-out textures but there still seems to be so much noise, angles and things jutting out all over the place. Hard to spot what actually matters. Oh and players just kind of merge into it. Doesn't help the player models and textures are washed out so they are kinda camo. Especially the blue &amp; yellow team, given most texture colours seem to be blue, yellow and brown.  Oh and there's all these custom skins making it even harder to determine what side that guy over there might be. 

* Bases are crazy complicated with stuff all over the place, most of which seems to be redundant, and not laid out in a coherent or intuitive way. It's difficult to figure out how things interact, like what generator does what. There's icons for things on the HUD but the icons are confusing and anyway pointless trying to follow if you're in a big building. 

* XP seems to have been designed completely at random. Joining one of the massive blitzkreig assault zergs and killing everything seems to be the only way to play, netting vastly more XP and generally being where nearly all the fun of the game is at. I don't think I've seen a successful defence against any significant assault, it's extremely tedious with a lot of dying and hardly any XP. How are defenders supposed to break out? The closest I've seen to a successful ""defence"" was when the zerg assault crew happened to roll on through and basically assaulted the base they happened to already own.

* Really surprised how quick infantry killing is. I'd assumed shields + armour and the RPG-ish thing meant quite a bit of killing but nope, it's whoever gets the drop first. 

* There's really quite a lot of incredibly laggy players just warping around, and some clearly using it as their strategy. If I was paying a monthly subscription I'd expect a ping cap. 

* Shooting things at range is quite a lot more annoying than it needs to be. On my low settings, it's hard to see where bullets/shells etc are landing. Especially for the tank, which has a bizarre arc (whereas the heavy's antitank gun is fine).",1354322679,,False,Planetside,t5_2s48x,t3_141oqf,davegod,,t1_c79dxr8,1430545962,0,1,0,c79dxr8,False,,t3_141oqf,1,

True,0,"Mileage is measured differently in Europe than it is in the US. 

&gt;The driving course and rigor set in the dynamometer is different. The fuel types used are different. The EPA estimates for diesel mileage tend to be lower than reality. For example, while the EPA says the Passat is 44 mpg, the Consumer Reports number comes in at 51 mpg. 

&gt;""The number for the combined US cycle for the US Passat is 35 mpg, whereas the same powertrain in a European Passat gets 61.2 mpg on the Euro cycle.""

That's not to say that diesel isn't more efficient than gasoline (it is, but only by 33% and not 100% like some people seem to believe), and European cars tend to be a lot smaller and lighter. There's also the fact that Europe has a much more robust mass transportation system in most of its cities and between countries.

True,0,"Oh dear... I was originally not going to answer, because frankly, you clearly don't even have a basic knowledge of history, or our culture... but alas, maybe you can learn something.

The monarchy is a product of thousands of years of civilization and evolving societal structure in western Europe. The feudal system is how Western European society has naturally structured itself through thousands of years. The monarchy is part of that structure. The interesting thing about life is that everything in the world is built off something previous. You're complaining about something which has existed for thousands of years. You're angry at a product of history, and being angry at something like that is pretty pointless.

You are not supposed to care about the King or Queen ""because they were born into the position"" but because of the role they symbolize which has developed through hundreds, if not thousands of years. I don't know what crappy news you're watching but I never see any coverage of the royal family doing ""simple tasks"". Furthermore, members of the royal family do charity work, and take part in other activities you label ""PR stunts"" because once again, that is their role in our society. They promote good causes because they can, because it's a valuable and positive use of their time.

The oath to the Monarchy is hardly something to get angry about. It's a symbolic gesture which exists from history. I don't necessarily agree with this, but it doesn't actually mean anything. No body is actually expected to give up their lives for the Queen.

You are not ""supposed to revere"" the Queen, your opinion of her can be (and obviously is) whatever you want it to be. Our respect for the monarchy, once again, is a product of our common history, a product of a time when people (yes, everyone) believed the Queen/King was **chosen by God** to have power and control, when the monarchy (and other aristocracy) was the sole provider of jobs, and safety.

True,0,"I understand, but I was trying to give his comment a charitable interpretation for a couple of reasons. 

First, Yad Vashem organizes the Righteous Among Nations according to their country of origin rather than the location of their acts. It would be impossible to do the latter, because many of the Righteous rescued Jews from multiple nations. Take, for example, [José Contreras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Castellanos_Contreras), the Salvadoran diplomat whose work saved thousands of Jews from several different countries. I suppose you could say that Contreras ""rescued Jews in Switzerland,"" because he was stationed in Geneva, but that's an odd way to categorize him and a misleading way to categorize the people he helped. 

Also, it seemed to me too obvious to be worth stating that the vast majority of Jews rescued *in* Poland were probably rescued by Poles. I'm sure that the same holds true for every European nationality.

This may sound like pedantry, but I promise that there's a good reason for it. Yad Vashem actually says it best [in their FAQ](http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/faq.asp#7):

&gt; The numbers of Righteous recognized do not reflect the full scope of help given by non-Jews since many of the rescue stories remain unknown. The number of rescuers in the different countries depends on a multitude of factors and therefore does not necessarily indicate the attitude of the local population to the Jews and their murder. Moreover, in view of the great difference in circumstances between different countries and regions, one should proceed with great caution when making such comparisons.

Our understanding of what happened in the Holocaust is incomplete. Attempts to honor - and, more to the point, catalogue and categorize - the right-thinking and right-acting individuals who stood against Nazi tyranny are hindered by spotty records, the [moral ambiguity of many so-called ""heroes,""](http://www.ejpress.org/article/week_at_a_glance_/55495) and the general fog of history.

Brazil and India are developing quickly, and they could become important regional powers. Calling China the dominant socio-economic power makes no sense at all, but they do have growing influence in Africa. Their role with Iran shows that they are able to throw some weight around, and they have strong cultural/economic ties with other countries in Asia.

True,0,"It'll probably be a host of different things all coming together at one time - and most of them will be minor. (This apocalypse is 'the total ending of our lifestyle as we know it' rather than some sort of skyfairy roasts the world bollocks.

Plague:
Antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are becoming ever more common due to profligate prescription of drugs to keep the pharma shareholders happy. The same sort of this applies to overprescription of inappropriate/useless antivirals. The end result only needs to be one nasty disease that's airborne and either severely incapacitating or lethal. 

A 10% mortality rate, or even a 10% total incapacity rate that lasts for a period of a couple of weeks (imagine appalling Norovirus) and we'd be in deep shit. Rubbish collections would go undone, infrastructure repair projects would fall behind, sewage would go untreated, rats and other vermin would multiply, corpses would build up in mortuaries, food and medicine supplies would dry up, law and order would be pressed to breaking point, we'd probably even experience several major ecological disasters globally - oil spills, nuclear leaks.

The compound effects of this, especially in urban areas, would be enough to completely destabilise Western governments and also regimes in countries with large slum populations. Brazil, Bangladesh, South Africa, China, Europe, Central and North America - all in deep shit.

Starving (or even moderately hungry) people would become murderous assholes in under a week.

Recovery time would be in the low single-figure years for a pandemic lasting a couple of months solid. Mainly because our economy is more fragile than it was in the 1920s, people are less self-sufficient and those who were born holding the shitty end of the stick are less likely to be put off getting one over on their 'betters'. Look at the fuckfight that is South Africa.

Resource Shortage:
China successfully starves the West of oil, then couples that with a rare earth monopoly that means we are suddenly at the whim of 7 men who bill the families of executed prisoners the cost of the bullet that killed them. No gadgets at reasonable prices, alternative energy generation is unrealistic, the US finally starts paying for petrol at realistic prices. Add that to the 'holy shit, why didn't anyone tell us that almost the entire former USSR is a mafia-run misery hole?' and you get a global 'D'oh!' What's next? 

US/UN led re-invasion of Afghanistan with a follow-on campaign in Iran, Iraq and so on. Richard Gere finally gets his wish when the US realises that modern technology hinges on the rare earths so rich in Tibet - war of liberation starts there too - perhaps a reverse of Afghanistan or a similar war by proxy. Pakistan and/or India are pursuaded to invade their big northern neighbor so they can secure the resources needed to keep their growing technology-manufacturing base going.

This fuels ever increasing unrest within China. The downtrodden billion+ rise up hard and fast behind a second communist revolutionary. Suddenly there's a great leap backward and a massive outflow of the very rich and the very poor. Mass illegal immigration around the world recreates the Chinese slums of the 19th Century. The super-rich expect to maintain their empires and way of life in the countries they've bought up wholesale (Aust, NZ, Central America, Africa) and the locals get piisssseeed. Spreading unrest, racially aggravated riots, central and eastern Asia near or in a low-scale series of nuclear exchanges.

All the shit made in China disappears, the Southern states of the US are abandoned as air-conditioners, cooling units, refrigerated freight and so on are in short supply. A surge in popularity for some Democratic principles in the short term (as the 'old selfish asshole' vote is diluted back amongst the younger people in the north) is rapidly lost amidst a huge upswell in isololationist, right wing, religious/racial bigotry. The US and other Western countries reduce to almost civil war and the Chinese are killed or captured/imprisoned as in the 1940s. This time things start off more delicately (ooooo, racism and PC) before getting quite fucking nasty.

Water shortage.
Really bloody simple. Southern Europe, most of Africa, Australia, Central Asia, huge chunks of North America, plus the artificially created grasslands of the Amazon basin dry up. Food is short, people are thirsty, prices go up.

Rich are OK in lamborghini's made of chocolate and Evian, but the masses are in deep do-do. Things get pretty grim, the viva la revolucion! add in lots of illegal immigration and massive real-estate price rises in places like the shores of Loch Ness and in northern Canada.

True,0,"The surviving Jews wanted to stay in Europe, but in general people did not want them back.  Especially in war-torn countries trying to rebuild with mouths to feed.  There were several factors that made the return of displace and surviving Jews to their homes..

1. The general in charge of the displaced persons camps was General Patton.  While General Patton was held as a war hero; his views of Jews were little better than the Nazis as seen in his personal journal.  As such, he put very little effort into resettlement. Especially as anti-Jewish displaced person violence began in earnest.

2. Sympathy for the Holocaust is a movement that only started decades afterward.  The rest of Europe was just as Jew-Hating as ever.  They did not want their own citizens back as they would be another mouth to feed in struggling times.  And the populace of Europe continued the practice of progroms against returned Jews in Kielce (1946 and 1918, reason: blood libel), Krakow, Bytom, Bialystok, Czestochawa, Legnica, Otwock, Rzeszow, Sosnowiec, Szezcin, and Tarnow.  This list ignores the non-program attacks such as drive by shootings, grenades, and bombs.  All of these pogroms and attacks were mostly within just 2 years after the end of the war in Europe.  As had previous pogroms, 
they were often encourage and/or led by local government officials and the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

3.  In Eastern Europe, where most Jews had lived was controlled by the Soviet Union.  And as many know Stalin was a Jew-Hater extraodinare.  He encouraged the pogroms and other libels like the Zydokomuna as a way to distract form his power grab.  Indeed, many of the actual ruling communist puppet governments were pulled from the German Nazi party and local Nazi supporters.  Stalin took advantage of the local Nazis by giving them the choice of joining his puppet governments or handed over to the allies for war crimes trials.   

Part of the reason neo-Nazis are so prevalent in Eastern Europe is for a couple of reasons.  There is an insane belief that the Nazis ""saved"" their countries from the Soviet Union.  And second, the Soviet Union did not perform the deNazification programs that were ubiquitous in western Europe.",1354326015,,False,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,t3_141xic,MightyMetricBatman,,t1_c79eok8,1430546312,0,1,0,c79eok8,False,,t1_c79d2ox,1,

True,0,"Genetically and culturally you're much more related to the peoples which your ancestors dwelt amongst than you are to the semetic groups of prehistoric Israel.

For example, you undoubtedly carry a LOT of genetic material from wherever your ancestors lived, which was not always Israel, assuming you're of diasporan descent. So you are pretty much as genetically entitled to land in Europe as you are genetically entitled to lands in Israel. By which I mean you're not genetically entitled to any lands at all, since genetic entitlement is not a thing which exists.

As for cultural descent, probably not. Depending on which part of the diaspora you descend from, you could be culturally Ashkenazi, or Sephardic, or part of many other groups. As such, your culture would be influenced again by non-semetic factors. For example, Ashkenazi culture is heavily influenced by German culture, most notably in the existance of Yiddish, which is rooted in High German.

The culture of the Jews in the bible is more related to the Palestinians, to be perfectly honest, as it's a culture which grew up in the region, unlike the diasporan Jewish cultures, which developed in Europe and elsewhere. Arabic is a semetic language, as is Hebrew. But the odds are that up until recently your ancestors didn't speak Hebrew, but spoke Yiddish, or Spanish, or any manner of non-semetic languages.

Aliás, preste atenção nas viagens presidenciais -- você pode escolher o país, o presidente (presidenta?) -- e veja que sempre vai um grupo grande de empresários do país buscando negócios, oportunidades.

I assumed some base knowledge on economic policy from the reader that isn't exactly fair and could have explained it a little better.  It's difficult not to use words like 'probably' in that context because like I said, I don't actually know what any of these people were really thinking when everything went down.  ""The US doesn't mind being pricks but they were probably trying to be nice this one time. Political motives and good intentions are not mutually exclusive."" is a pretty subjective thing if you are already convinced by the anti-Marshall Plan folks that the US knew everything in advance.  The best I can really do is say that once the effects were apparent, the IMF adopted some of that policy and used it to keep countries under their thumb.  The argument on the other side is that the European economies probably could have advanced more quickly but that is basically the same argument that is used against the New Deal and I didn't see any citations for why the US thought that making their allies less financially stable was a good thing.  Like I said, this particular subject is tricky.  I'm also impressed that you sussed out ""The US did this for political reasons and would abuse its economic power later but probably had good intentions with the Marshall Plan."" in the first few words! Usually the sides to this argument are ""The US was good, they helped those countries!"" or ""The US was evil, they just wanted to stop Russia at any cost!""

It's not racism or prejudice, these are just shitty people overall. Gypsies give Romanians a bad name and that is the truth. 

The reason they are the way they are though is actually linked to Christianity. According to gypsies, because it was a gypsy who stole nails from the Romans at the time of Jesus' crucifixion, he granted them basically carte Blanche when it comes to theft and stealing because they supposedly ""lessened"" his suffering by stealing. They firmly believe that stealing and thievery will not be counted against them in the next life and they do not have to follow the laws of man because a higher power granted them immunity. Of course we all know that's bull shit but that is their culture, a shitty, conniving, underhanded culture. You can't erase generations of that upbringing from society.

True,0,"Yiddish was not spoken by the majority of Jews, just the majority of Jews in Central and Eastern Europe.  Then came Hitler, and millions of Yiddish speakers died in the Holocaust, while many others dispersed after the war.  

Meanwhile, in the late 19th and early 20th century, Zionism, the move back to Israel (then British Palestine), had a great deal to do with the revival of Hebrew.  Some Jews considered Hebrew a holy language and did not like to see it used for mundane purposes -- but it provided a common language for Jews who immigrated from various parts of the world.  This accelerated in 1948 when Israel became an independent state.

Yiddish is a hybrid of German, Hebrew, Aramaic, and touches of Slavic and Romance languages.

True,0,"I was raised to Casey Kasem top 40 lists on weekend family trips through the 90s and carried on with the radio hits until we eventually got MTV. That got me into millennial ""alternative,"" still mostly bad music and a mixed bag of big rap names. I got angsty after a while and turned to the numetal trend, trying to find my identity (I still like Deftones and some Incubus). In high school, I found I couldn't even get in with the numetal crowd, so I looked for something more abrasive. I found Opeth and entered into actual metal territory. This pulled me into various bursts that would last for varying months at a time. I guess it started with popular (at the time) metalcore like Zao and As I Lay Dying. This quickly gave way to melodic and standard death metal (At the Gates, Death) and black metal (Mayhem, Celtic Frost). There were flourishes of some of the sillier parts of metal like viking (Finntroll) and power metal (Blind Guardian). Eventually I fell comfortably into sludge (Electric Wizard), Doom-Death (My Dying Bride, Anathema), and, strangely, obscure hip-hop. Eventually I was exposed to postrock/metal (Russian Circle, Godspeed, Mono) and fell in love through to present day. Through exploring the various territories of postrock, I discovered shoegaze, math rock, and jazz (the last recorded live version of ""My Favorite Things"" by Coltrane became a daily lunchtime tradition). Simultaneously, I began exploring the origins of punk and hardcore. I loved The Clash and Ramones, and realized that I was pretty close to the heart of where hardcore started which I found very inspiring after a time of listening to primarily European bands. So I worked my way through most of the Dischord catalogue, which introduced me to posthardcore and its evolution into emo and screamo (not as it had once been introduced to me by MTV, but instead in the likes of Drive Like Jehu, Hot Cross, Angel Hair, and Sunny Day Real Estate). After that, the particulars get fuzzy to me, but I've ended up listening to an ever increasing variety of music. I got a little into folk (Nick Drake, Jose Gonzalez), I guess you could call it IDM (Aphex Twins, Boards of Canada), avantgarde (Glenn Branca, Sonic Youth, Sun City Girls), and a metric crapton of other things. Now it just keeps branching. And though my interests grow and sway, I still keep footing in the past where I formerly found comfort. In many ways it feels like it holds a lot more brevity to just talk about what I hate or am indifferent toward.

So for me, music was a way of discovering then accepting an eclectic identity. Some things did come with age. I never could appreciate music older than I was for a decent time. Likewise, abstract music took a while to set in, and even then abstracts such as most noise music has left my interest. 

Anyway, I definitely see where lines are being blurred for listeners and musicians. Most of my exploration was facilitated by the ease of consumption through the advent of internet with decent transfer speeds. I think a lot of music lovers are like that anymore. Granted some people just consume without really taking it in, and I don't know what to say about those people. And for the music makers, individuals' interests converging bring about further genre bending as each individual of the collective wants to leave their impression on the music. Many friends who have played music under a leader/composer usually get sick of it after a time of not being allowed their input.

True,0,"&gt; Yeah, but at some point this ''is life''. The league isn't supposed to offer players the longest careers possible and find formats suitable for 50 year olds. At some point that is the deal for having veterans in your squad: more experience, less minutes. Players seems to stay in the league longer and longer. I'm happy to see this as I like still watching Duncan, but it doesn't serve basketball if you have players in the league who aren't physically able to play a whole season even with limited minutes (without having a too high injury risk).

I think this just may be a ""agree to disagree"" type thing. I mean, I feel the Spurs have every right to try to preserve their best players for later in the year and very crucial matchups. The Spurs are doing what is in the best interests for their team winning the championship. Having them wear themselves out now would make them less competitive (ie, worse for the NBA and its marketability) in crunch time.

&gt; I see no problem with small teams staying small and being underdogs year after year until they somehow make x genius choice in a row and suddenly have a shot at the title.

And yes, teams must help themselves. You can't just expect to get the first pick five years in a row and put all 5 guys as starters. But do you honestly believe the Thunder would be anywhere near as good as they are now without having a top 4 pick three years in a row (Durant 2, Westbrook 4, Harden 3)? I completely agree that they have to also do their job scouting (Ibaka 24, picking players that would develop into studs) and make good signings/trades. 

&gt;  That's passion and how sports should be imo. Less business / entertainment and more ''back to the roots'' would really do good to the major sports in NA. This said, the players still earn a shit load of money and often don't choose to go overseas in the NHL and risk a two-way contract. It's not a system limited to smaller leagues. Look at all major sport leagues in Europe for ex.

Again, I agree about it being less business, but entertainment is the whole purpose of the sports network. Without an audience, there is little reason to spend years devoting all your time to the sport to reach the professional level. The business side of it is what helps both players and teams have success. Without business, there would be nowhere near as much desire or interest to play the game. Would Kobe or Lebron or Michael Jordan really play basketball if they were only going to get $60-80K a year? Well, maybe, but then when teams rake in huge profits from tickets, marketing, sponsorships, etc, player would be completely shafted.

&gt; Long story short, being bad shouldn't be awarded. You should always be motivated by winning every single game.

The coaches and players are playing their butts off every game. That's why the Bobcats kicked Boris Diaw to the curb and rarely play Tyrus Thomas; they aren't dedicated.

THe memory of the second world war and civil wars is so distant that I don't see an inhibting factor in those horrible experiences for the current Euro crisis. The reason why comparably few and mild protests are held is in my opinion the still high standard of living, at least compared to the mid 30s and early 40s in Italy, Spain and Germany. I guess the protests will increase as  long as the crisis worsens, but the tipping point in living standards has not been reached yet.

There are also no serious attempts to make the EU a presidential system, which he calls "" nothing less than an elective dictatorship"". No country is willing to surrender their autonomy to a EU presidency, not Germany, not France. As for his assumption that presidential system is automatically a dictatorship, the US has such an ""elective dictatorship"" or whatever that means, but also a Congress and the EU has it's Parliament and memberstates which can be a counterbalance.

Naming the Pirate Party in Germany in one row with Golden Dawn or Syriza as possible destabalizers of democracy shows terrible insight into the German party system.

Furthermore, Greece was acceptet and kept into the currency union despite their attempt to veil their financial instabilitay not because of Germany's ""lingering sense of guilt"" but simply because Germany was the first one who broke the Maastrich criteriums that limited the national debt in th Euro zone.  Back in 2003 Greece and Germany were not so far off in unreasonble borroring, Germany was the ""old man of Europe"" with minimal growth. Then the Agenda2010 reforms, the biggest social reofrm package kicked in and transformed Germany into the European power house it is today.

And last of all, I don't agree that the social net is the main problem in competing with Asia. Social programs held many southern european countries back from outright conflict. It is a stabalizing factor. Inefficient social programs are a liability but not social wellfare in general. Germany f.e. has always fared well with an extensive social security net.

True,0,"As I see it, the main problem with analytic philosophy is that it privileges certain linguistic and logical speech practices over our more implicit, non-conceptual, and intuitive modes of experience, thought and understanding. At least, this seems to be the main dividing line separating the ancient and modern European traditions from their contemporary rivals in the British-American schools of analytic philosophy. There are many notable exceptions, of course, the late Gareth Evan’s philosophy of thought being one of the clearer examples. Evans is an interesting case given his Oxford pedigree and close affiliations with Michael Dummett, Galen Strawson, and John McDowell (all major analytic figures). According to Evans, we only use linguistic or referential expressions (the philosophy of language) as part of the much larger process of thinking about the world (the philosophy of thought), and it is only within that context that our attempts to verbalize the world make any sense. I don’t believe this is especially innovative mind you, given how it harks back to what would’ve been philosophical common sense as recently as the 17-19th centuries. Either way, it’s always a healthy sign when a philosopher has the humility to acknowledge that the most significant forms of human meaning are not obviously determined in the first instance by the way we use language. It’s at least a trend to look out for.

The founding principles of analytic philosophy are seemingly incomplete for this very reason: it fails to recognize how philosophical thought, like so much of human life, is messy, confusing, and contradictory. This distinction between demonstrative (scientific) knowledge and intuitive (philosophical) wisdom was clearly understood by the ancient, medieval, and modern European traditions of philosophy and no less was it realized by the British Idealists. Grasping the (relative) truth of a thing on the former view depends on our methods of empirical investigation, explicit definition, and canons of inductive and deductive reasoning. Grasping the (objective) truth of a thing on the latter view depends more on the systematic integration of scientific knowledge with the free play of imagination, emotional and intuitive depth, and other kinds of life-affirming, non-cognitive experience. If this is the primary difference in how different historical thinkers have approached philosophy, it may go some ways in explaining why the philosophers of old were so much more profound than they are today. I can only speak for myself, but I can’t help feeling edified when I read Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, or any other “great thinker.” I can’t say the same about reading the Moore’s, the Russell’s, the Popper’s, or the Quine’s of the world. It’s not like I haven’t been sympathetic or paid my due diligence to understand them. I have and still do read many analytics, mostly since you can’t remain academically relevant otherwise. They write clearly, I’ll give them that, but this doesn’t change the fact that I find them irrelevant, turgid, and narrow-minded. 

That said, I don’t want to give the impression that there aren’t any analytic philosophers out there doing interesting work (of course there are), or that the “continentals” in the vein of Foucault, Derrida, Zizek, or Badiou are a better alternative. My general point is only that philosophy today is in a serious deficit of wisdom. When a person can count on a single hand all the great minds who lived in the 20th century (honestly, I can only get to three fingers), it’s a pretty sad day, especially when that century held the highest number of working philosophers in history. Maybe there are sociological reasons for this, or maybe philosophers today are simply too jaded, as you said, to believe they can have an impact. However, making impact is exactly what a philosopher must do right now if their work is to have any lasting cultural, not just academic, value. Generally, this implies it can inform the larger scientific, moral, and political conversation, but also eventually become part of our everyday common sense. As short-lived as they were, I think this is what made Marxism, existentialism, and, gasp, post-modernism, relevant. Most academic philosophy is not relevant in this sense (the utilitarianism of people like Peter Singer is more the exception than the rule). Personally, I doubt analytic philosophy will survive beyond the next 1-2 decades unless it significantly changes it approach. At any rate, those are my own misgivings; feel free to agree or disagree.

Before 1715 Jesuit missions were somewhat common in China, and the Jesuits themselves were respected by the Chinese for their scientific learning, and often employed in important government posts. Due in large part to the influence of Matteo Ricci, the Jesuits developed a syncretic strain of Catholic thought, which tolerated and incorporated Chinese traditional practices while incorporating Catholic theology. This was long controversial in Europe, and in 1715 the pope officially forbade this syncretism and condemned traditional Chinese ritual. The emperor Kangxi quite reasonably objected to this foreign ruler dictating the actions of his subjects, and banned the Jesuits from preaching in China (Jesuits still had a presence in court and among the people so it is difficult to piece out exactly what this ban actually effected). When a Jesuit protested, Kangxi asked him whether the princes of Europe would allow him to send Buddhist teachers to preach to their subjects.

1) They have been a nation since pre-history

- See above

b) It was taken from them and handed to someone else

- This is not entirely true. Palestine was supposed to be divided up in terms of a sovereign Israel and a sovereign Palestine. That is, the Palestinian land in Israeli territory is going to be administered by a democratic Israeli government and the Palestinian territory to be administered by a Palestinian government.  What happened was Israel was attacked from all sides by 5 nations. Many Arabs had no choice but to flee out of legitimate fear and rumors that were spread... After Israel won the war, they closed their borders... Israel should apologize for the Nakhba, pay the descendants reparations and invest in social services for them. But still, there are 1.7 million Palestinians in Israel right now and many own land, many kept their land. They have Israeli citizenship, they can vote, own land, have equal civil rights, be elected, have social security, etc... They own the public land, parks, etc... in Israeli just as much as Israeli Jews do. Sure there is a lot of social tension considering the situation, but their civil rights are still enshrined in law. Overall, Israelis are very against Jewish discrimination against Arab citizens.

c) Israel is based on a claim supposedly staked thousands of years ago.

- That is completely false. Zionism is not based on the fact that Jews lived there thousands of years ago, it's an absurd oversimplification. Zionism was the idea that Jews were too persecuted in Europe and should form a nation-state. In fact, it was met with a lot of resistance at first. It began in the 19th century with Jews fleeing persecution buying huge swaths of land in Palestine. It culminated with the Holocaust. There were millions of people with nowhere left to go. Literally no country wanted them and persecution of Jews didn't just end after WWII. They weren't fortune tellers, couldn't see the future, so escaping somewhere was the best choice. So lots of Jews moved to Palestine onto the land bought by other Jews. Regional powers weren't too happy with foreigners coming in and taking over the land --even legally. So there was a lot of conflict. That's why Britain, which controlled the land at the time, decided to divide the land. Not one land for the Jews and one land for the Arabs, but simply two countries, two governments tasked with governing the land. They had no idea what would happen... After all of this and in line with the original Zionist principle, Israel decided to become a sanctuary for all Jews fleeing persecution.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries

And it's kind of a good thing. In the decades to come, over a million Arabic Jews had their businesses, property and land stolen and their citizenships revoked. They were basically expelled or fled extreme prejudice under the threat of death. They were stateless, until Israel took them in. Their descendants now comprise half of the Israeli Jewish population.

True,0,"**Okay, no. I'm going to try to make this comprehensive, so please bear with me; there is a TLDR at the end.**

The State of Israel is not a post-Holocaust occurrence, the idea of creating a Jewish State of Israel in Palestine [was being put into practice since the early 20th century](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/israel_and_the_palestinians/key_documents/1682961.stm).

""Jews"" had been living in Palestine for hundreds of years, and most of them were not keen on the idea of a ""Jewish state""; the idea of a nationalistic group of European Jewish settlers attempting to create a *Jewish state* in a land that is multi-ethnic, and especially a land that had never had a unified, modern ""state"" in the first place, was the issue.

In 1947, the British colonial authority that had taken over Palestine during World War I, as well as the UN, decided to partition Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state; the problem was, [Jews made up about a 1/3 of the population (and were mostly European settlers), and owned roughly 7% of the land, but they were given about 55% of the land. The land which they ""owned"" (the 7%) was itself purchased from absentee landlords throughout the Arab and Muslim world -- not the Palestinians who actually lived on the land and had their own legal traditions for land ownership.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leu2nnqPI51qeqc34o1_1280.gif) As a result of this partition, about 100,000 Palestinians would be displaced, even if they accepted it; the remaining Arab ""state"" would be far weaker and without European military support; and most of the Zionist leaders were not happy with the partition either, claiming that they would eventually expand further and take the ""Arab"" state as well. 

The other problem was that the idea of segregating Jews and Arabs in Palestine was a new one, and it came largely from Europe. Even as race-riots pervaded Palestinian society in the 1920's and 1930's as people became weary of Zionist settlers, Palestinian Arabs overwhelmingly sought to [protect Jews](http://mepeace.org/forum/topics/435-jews-were-saved-by-19-arab-families-the-other-side-of-the).

Seeing as this ""partition plan"" was a foreign imposition by a colonial power and the UN, they rejected it, demanding a new plan. Instead, Zionist groups decided that the plan gave them the legitimacy they wanted, and declared the State of Israel in 1948 -- ignoring the Palestinians. Between 1947 and 1948, Zionist militias **defined any and all Arab villages -- including villages that had active peace treaties with Jewish communities and villages that had no defenses -- as [""terrorist villages,](http://imeu.net/news/article008084.shtml)"" and mass expelled or massacred these Arab villages.** While Palestinian leaders had demanded no racial partition, Zionism as an ideology is based completely on race and land.

After expelling some 750,000 Palestinians during this campaign, Israel ended up dominating about 78% of the land in question. Arab states had entered the war -- but not to destroy Israel, being far too weak to even consider the option. Instead, they only attempted to salvage the ""Arab partition"". This was in 1948, after Israel had already expelled about 300,000 Palestinians. The few Palestinians that had escaped expulsion lived in the newly created state of Israel under military rule, until they were finally granted citizenship in 1966. The vast majority of Palestinians had been expelled, either to neighboring Arab countries, or to the remainder of Palestine that had not become Israel (namely Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem).

Since that point, Israel has never stopped expanding; Israeli leaders [openly admit to initiating the 1967 war](http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1982-1984/55%20Address%20by%20Prime%20Minister%20Begin%20at%20the%20National), which gave Israel military control of everything they hadn't already turned into their own country. Since that war in 1967, Israel has been settling and colonizing whatever has not already become Israel, while keeping the population in those territories under a full-fledged military occupation. 

The military occupation in question has come with mass killings by Israeli soldiers, indiscriminate fire, theft of land and resources, arbitrary detention, restriction of movement, torture, and blockade. Israel has never stopped expanding into the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It also continues to hold Gaza under a complete blockade, which was initiated to [""put the Palestinians on a diet""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/16/israel). The settlements, as well as the military occupation itself, are completely illegal according to the [UN Security Council](http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/5aa254a1c8f8b1cb852560e50075d7d5) and the [International Court of Justice](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1677.pdf). In addition, during multiple Israeli invasions and military operations, Israel has committed war crimes and potential crimes against humanity, including deliberately killing large numbers of civilians, according to [both observer groups](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jc0DHbDsRG83m4stW9JdpHz3hxSw) and [Israeli soldiers](http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Operation_Cast_Lead_Gaza_2009_Eng.pdf).

At only 3 times (to my knowledge) has Israel made concessions regarding land -- it returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1979 after a surprise attack from Egypt in 1973; it returned Lebanon to, well, Lebanon, after 18 years of guerrilla warfare in Lebanon (Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 after breaking an 11-month ceasefire with Palestinian militants in that country, and stayed until 2000 when they were driven out by Hezbollah); and it pulled its settlers out of Gaza in 2005 after heavy international pressure and high costs to maintain the small settler community. All of these suggested that Israel makes concessions when it is forced to do so. [In contrast, Israel regularly breaks ceasefires and initiates wars of aggression, even when ceasefires are effectively enforced by Palestinians and others.](http://imeu.net/news/article0022250.shtml) Likewise, almost [all serious studies on terrorism show that it happens because Palestinians (and others who use these tactics) come under military siege, not vice versa](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/18/it_s_the_occupation_stupid)

**TLDR: It is not some intolerant skepticism about Jewish culture, which has always existed in Palestine since 4,000 years ago. It is ongoing military aggression by a European-style settler-colonial state that has defined the land and its peoples by ethnicity, and continued to expel thousands of Palestinians while holding millions under a violent, deadly, and ongoing military siege.**

True,0,"Weixiaos playstyle reminds me a lot of Burning--stellar mechanics, good laner and a wide champion pool. Basically the perfect balanced player. 

I dont really expect many other Chinese hard carries to achieve a similar level of notoriety in the current meta just because of the DotA legacy since in league it requires a similar skillset for every player, until 'ADC' players have options to do things other than 2v2/2v1.

For example, Weixiao is nothing like ZSMJ who was definitely the most famous DotA player ever during his prime. ZSMJ was not even good at laning, he would take free harass and miss early CS. 

This wouldn't matter however because he had really good decision making, a great grasp of the game and high levels of synergy with his team. His team would rarely have ZSMJ in an unfavorable lane, he would almost never make fatal mistakes, he had godlike map awareness (highly tied in with CS in dota), and his team would groom creep waves for him to teleport and farm. This resulted in his ability to break CS records. CLG.EU currently does a similar thing with Froggen. 

ZSMJ ended up retiring when his team iG split in two because I believe he had less synergy (lost some games), and the DotA meta was changing so it was no longer easy to get a good lane for ZSMJ. (he could no longer guarantee 3v1 or 1v0 lanes)

You would never get a figure like ZSMJ in league, it is because every AD needs to be able to CS, decision-make, lane control, etc. 

This allows easy 'tiering' of competitive players. WX is obviously the #1 ad player right now because he is never outlaned or outfarmed, DBL coming in closely but discernably behind, Froggen is obviously the #1 mid player right now because of his simple all-roundedness, but Toyz, Misaya, Alexich trail him closely.

A few random thoughts for you:

Is the fear of mushrooms rooted in the fear of contagion? Mushrooms are decomposers, after all. They grow out of rotting things. Dead things.   Is the fear of them somehow linked to the fear of decay? 

Is a fear of mushrooms a human universal? Do all societies have it? A reason it may be so strong in America is (and this is 100% opinion here) because of look-alikes. Mushrooms that are safe to eat in Europe, where colonists originated from, had toxic look-alikes here in the US. So maybe that has something to do with it?

You could mention the nature and root of phobias in general. There are rational phobias rooted in perfectly reasonable threats to survival. Fear of snakes. Fear of spiders.

True,0,"&gt;Well, first of all, the UK have about the same taxes as the US
Bullshit.  Look up income tax rates by country - the UK's *lowest* tax rate is around the rate on the top earners in the US.  Then they have the national sales tax (VAT) of 20% - that means *everything* you purchase costs an extra 20%.  Then there's the insane fuels taxes, the TV tax, and so on that we don't have in the US.

I love how you always want to play the ""there's no such thing as a socialist"" game.  If you want the government to have the kind of control over almost every aspect of peoples lives like they do in Europe (and getting there in the US), that's a socialist.

*Overall* healthcare costs are expensive.  Costs to *individuals* are not.  It mainly has to do with two things - accounting at hospitals and the fact that old people in the US insist that they should be allowed to get super expensive procedures to extend their life by a few months.  For some stupid reason hospitals in the US massively overcharge on everything, then insurance companies tell them to piss off and refuse to pay most of it (so the cost isn't really there), and you don't have to pay any extra.  Most companies do not ""give you a health plan"".  They work out deals with insurance companies for group discounts and then pay a portion of it as well.  The cost to you is roughly $1,500-$1,800 per year to have basically everything covered at no extra cost to you.  You'll have a small amount that you have to pay and then anything over that for the year, they cover completely.  I've had major surgery before and it only cost a few hundred dollars.  I'm more than glad to, on the rare occasion that I need a medical procedure, shell out a few hundred dollars than pay several thousands of dollars a year in extra taxes - especially when most years I don't even get any benefit from it.  Please, tell me why I should be forced to pay thousands of dollars a year for something I'm not getting?

It's an old joke that the US doesn't have a ""left"" so I'll say the less extreme right might team up with the non-mainstream demographic.

The result might be an economic-based conflict, fought by two sides, each of which were economic diverse!

True,0,"The defense 'crap' absolutely provides services to the people, though I know it's not very easy to see :) granted, if the U.S prioritized it could scale back, but right now the military is essentially keeping the world peace. Ever heard of the Pax Romana? Well, how about the Pax Americana? It's a thing, and there's a reason diplomats and people who study foreign affairs have a term for it. 

Now, hear me out before you jump to your keyboard. And then go ahead and read some journals about the subject (Foreign Affairs is a great one, and there are others) and then you can decide for real how valuable the military is :) because, just FYI, when you say it doesn't serve the people, every single person whose job it is to know about these things would disagree with you. 

Firstly, the US military is why you can buy a gallon of oil for less than 15 dollars. One of its main functions is to protect access to the commons worldwide, that is, the water, air, and cyberspace which facilitate trade. If the U.S. dismantled its military, Iran (which is trying to establish regional hegemony) would monopolize access to the straight of Hormuz, as they've tried to do in the past. Additionally, the U.S. military has repeatedly used a show of force and shared training exercises to back China off from the South China sea--which, of course, is one of the most valuable economic routes in the world. China has repeatedly scuffled with Vietnam over these resources and marine territory, and if it weren't for the U.S. military it would probably monopolize (as much as it could) those waterways and economically strangle the southeast Asian tigers. They've shown their intentions before. That's why president Obama has ramped up military presence in East Asia and the Pacific, because China's neighbors are starting to get nervous about its ambitions. 

Also, the reason the Eurozone and Japan can afford to spend so little on their practically non-existent militaries is because they've essentially outsourced the job to the US. Do you think defense is obsolete in those areas? Hell, if it weren't for the military we could have seen small regional wars in Europe after the fall of the Soviets--or do you think it's a coincidence that Europe did practically nothing but war amongst itself for 2,000 years until the moment the US became a hegemony and then suddenly stopped? 

Taiwan exists because of the strength of the US military, as do a handful of other free states. The US military, and it's hegemonomic power over the entire world, is the reason there have been no major wars since 1945. The military does nothing? That's an incredibly naive belief. The only reason you have liscence to think that is because they do what they do so well--they are so powerful, they don't need to use it. And that's the definition of hegemony. 

That being said we could reduce their budget and prioritize. They've gotten used to a steadily rising budget and our economy can't sustain that. But no services? C'mon.",1354350009,,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,t3_1400gz,[deleted],,t1_c79j2c3,1430548443,0,-1,0,c79j2c3,False,,t1_c794an5,-1,

True,0,"Hey there, I'm not sure what advice I can give you, or in what ways I can help, but I might as well share this things I wrote maybe less than a week ago.

""So I was just hiding under the desk in my dorm room because everything hates me, and I can't do everything-let alone anything. This includes managing to get to more than 2 college classes a week out of 8, (though my work is up to date in 3/5 of them)- as well as being functionable for the entirety of a day due to crippling anxiety/panic attacks, lots of fear, and depression that numbs all motivation and fear of consiquences. Kinda like eeroe from Winnie the Pooh, except I'll be in my room for 5 days (more or less) afraid to leave more more than a few minutes to use the rest room or grab a gator-aid.

I'm an illustration major at Ringling College of Art and Design. (It's considered to be one of the top art schools, due to it's stressful curriculum.)
I tell you only to better understand my situation.

With all classes missed, I'm pretty sure my academic advisor would like me to go home now. But I don't know what I'm going to do once I get there. I was once super driven to get where I am today, but once the anxiety attacks took over I have now become exhausted, and don't have the drive to work on projects for more than a little bit at a time. Most of the time I simply don't want to approach them, even though my work is a *bit* above par in all my classes and I know even if they're decent they'll still do me some good, I just need to work on them. Ehen I spend a night in a studio, getting a ton of stuff done in one night, I end up in bed with anxiety the next day. Which is probably what makes doing more work even thougher to approach.

No more dreams or bigger goals exists in this place. I just want to go home and take some photos. 

If I drop out I immediently have to begin paying off loans-basically $150,000 in loans. And I don't know if I can function highly enough for a full-time job. Maybe that's what I need though? I don't know....""

 I know what you mean with the ""all I do is let down those around me"" comment as well, I can't even hold a real conversation- mostly because conversations start with ""So how are you?"" it's like a sick joke. (I'm great at parties)

And my communication with my home has been terrible, they think I'm avoiding them been in reality I just don't know what to say.

I think the only thing that's been boosting me is the idea ""You're all you've got."" And I've found that when I look at past successes, and raw talents, I don't feel entirely alone. I look at others who've got it made and complain about the little things, and realize not everyone could go through what I'm going through.

I'm 19, also not much work experience. (Though I did practically raise 4 of my sister's kids.)

It may be hard to remember now, but baseball used to be bigger and more popular than football in the USA. The NFL took the #1 spot because of the earlier baseball lockout.

Your accusation is a little vague, yet also quite emotive. What actually happened was:

1. Salmond is asked by the BBC if he has sought legal advice over EU membership. He replies ""We have, yes, in terms of the debate"".

2. The acknowledgement or denial of the receipt of legal advice is covered by what's called the Ministerial Code. This document can be changed (and has been), but currently requires that the presence or absence of legal advice is neither confirmed nor denied (unless the Lord Advocate explicitly confirms it can be acknowledged). This is not a new practice, and was used on several occasions by previous Scottish governments.

3. Post-Edinburgh Agreement, Salmond is now acknowledging that he has had legal advice: this advice won't be released as-is, but will form part of their White Paper on independence next year.

4. The inquiry is into if he breached the Ministerial Code by the above. One of the recent changes to the Ministerial Code is that, unlike previously, the actions of the First Minister are no longer reviewed by the First Minister (this was the approach used under Labour) but are done by an external party.

I disagree with the way he handled it, but I think you should be clear about what it is you disagree with.

True,0,"&gt; I have learned the same problems exist everywhere.

I strongly disagree with this. I've lived in Norway for almost 7 years now and as I said in my other comment, I could never build the life I have here in Czech Republic. The grass is many many shades greener and the problems people have in this country don't even compare to the problems people have back home.

The salaries vs. what you can afford is shockingly low in Czech Republic. I went to an excellent high school (gymnazium) and pretty much all of my classmates went to university. Most of them still live at home because they can't afford to move out, many work subpar jobs and earn about 20% of what I earn around here (no joke). Meanwhile, I rent my own place, save half my paycheck every month and can afford to come visit and go on holidays. What more, it's absolutely impossible to get a decent job as a young woman in Czech Republic because every employer expects you to get pregnant and not work for 3 years (yes, the maternity leave is ridiculously 3 years long), so they just hire guys if they can. And even if you *do* get a job, you can expect a lower salary for the same job as a woman, which is the case for example with my mother who earns half as much as my dad with same education and same job (they're both engineers). Such treatment of women is absolutely unthinkable to Norwegians. And the corruption in Czech Republic... jesus.

I miss Czechs as people. A lot, in fact. I miss being able to quote Cimrman, or just sit around a campfire with friends and sing folk songs to a guitar while roasting buřty. But I don't miss the country at all.

&gt; There was a sudden influx of Jewish refugees with nowhere to return in Europe which led to the British implementing a system of quotas for Jewish immigrants. While this happened, illegal immigration from refugees was on the rise and extremist Zionist groups began to escalate campaigns of violence against the British mandate.

All those words - ""illegal"", ""extremist"" and ""escalate campaigns of violence"" - lead a reader to think of one thing, but told another way, lead a reader to think quite a different thing:

Jews were being massacred in Europe in their millions. The British knew about it. They knew it was going to happen and they refused to allow any more Jews to move to the UK or to Palestine, because who wants refugees, right? Unless they're nuclear physicists. 

Some Jews who lived in Palestine tried to save as many European Jews as they could by trying to bring them in overcrowded boats with no food into Palestine where they were busily building a Jewish state on land they bought, and were hoping to get a country or at least an autonomy. 

The British were catching those boats and turning them around, at best keeping the people inside penned up in internment camps on Cyprus and at worst killing them (indirectly).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Bet

The Palestinian Jews were angry at the British for very good reasons, and objectively speaking, the British were guilty in facilitating a humanitarian crisis, if not the genocide. And yet, during this time, the majority Jewish party in Palestine was cooperating with the British and turning in members of the tiny minority splinter groups who were actively fighting the British in Palestine.

&gt;  In the late 1930's there were a series of Arab revolts that led to the Peel Commission which suggested partitioning the land amongst the two ethnicities. Both sides immediately rejected it.

&gt; November of 1947, UN Resolution 181 was passed calling for Palestine to be separated into a Jewish State, a Palestinian State and Jerusalem. Violence between Arab and Jewish militias (mainly composed of foreign volunteers) was immediate and led to a refugee problem on both ends

Your story implies the two sides would not agree to share the land, which is not fully true: in the 1930s, both sides rejected the British proposal (the Jews correctly believed the British were only courting the Arabs, as the British foreign office was 100% pro-Arab, and has been ever since), but in 1947 one of the sides was willing to share, and the other side told its civilians to leave their homes for a little while so they would not get hurt while the Jews were being massacred. Those people did leave their homes, but then couldn't return when the Jews failed to be properly massacred like they've done so well just a few years earlier. The people in charge then left those refugees penned up like animals instead of helping them. Those who stayed are now happy to have Israel citizenship.

&gt; There were several attempts by Jewish organizations throughout the XIXth and early XXth Centuries to purchase the land surrounding the wall which met increasing political opposition each time. These generally ended in a breakdown of the negotiations. 

An offer to buy land is not a ""dispute"". That's like saying that the land in Palestine on which Jews lived before 1948, all of which the Jews bought and paid for, was ""taken"" from Arabs because the tenants had to move after their landlord sold the land.

Yes, it sucks for a farmer who lived for generations on land which belonged to some absentee landlord in Istambul to find out the land was sold. It also sucks that the land next to your patch, which you never owned or leased but on which your sheep used to graze for generations because the previous owner didn't mind, is now fenced up and the new owner doesn't allow your animals there. But the reaction of declaring that the sale of land to non-Muslims is simply illegal and non-binding and therefore the land must be captured back by force (and given to the farmers who used it instead of the absentee owner who sold it) is not defensible.

Um, no. Just no. If you wrote this in your Masters' Thesis, you should have got it thrown back into your face, because it's entirely contradicted by historical documentary evidence. There are several medieval/Renaissance treatises with explicit instructions on how to fight in armour, and they use very sophisticated techniques to do so. They adapt joint locks and takedowns for use in armour, even full plate harness, and give instruction on how to attack weak points in the armour. 

This material was quite widespread throughout Europe, with different traditions in Italy, Germany and France, among others.

&gt;Even some light chain mail makes a soldier just about immune to most martial arts techniques. Give him a sword, and there ya go.

Weapons arts are also martial arts, last I checked - or are you going to tell the Kali practitioners that fighting with a knife isn't martial?

&gt;Asia also had a better standard of living. Most Europeans were either dead, or such a low quality of life that they had to scrounge to get by-- certainly no time for the creation of martial arts.

This is just so incredibly ignorant that I don't know where to start. 

""Asia"" where? In what era? 

You do realise that, for example, Sengoku Jidai era peasantry in Japan tended to be pretty damn impoverished because they were taxed out the wazoo in order to fund the incessant civil warfare, yeah? Or that the reason there were massive peasant uprisings in, say, late Ming China was because climate change caused repeated serious crop failures, eventually resulting in the collapse of the Ming economy (combined with hyperinflation and a drop in the money supply, but that's outside our remit here). 

""Europe"" Where? In what era? You're telling me that medieval Venice or Genoa was impoverished? That the nobles of Paris or at the court of Edward III didn't have the time and energy to train in martial arts - when that was fundamental to their position in society? People who could afford plate harness and destriers - which might easily cost the equivalent of a peasant household's entire annual income - wouldn't also spend money and time on learning how to use them properly? That everyone at the Field of Cloth of Gold was an incompetent? That sword masters like George Silver or Giovanni dell'Agocchie did not have clients and customers?

This is absolute tosh and flat-out contradicted by a large body of easily available primary evidence. I call bullshit on your claim of writing this for your masters' unless it was rejected.

True,0,"Well the relationship between Bulgaria and Serbia is good I'd say, we have less friction with them as with Macedonia and generally the people of the two countries like each other. When visiting Serbia Bulgarians are treated nicely and vice versa. After all we have a lot in common, not just the language but culture etc. Overall at the moment I think Serbia might be doing better than Bulgaria, but I haven't looked into any data to support that. Also when Bulgarians and Serbians meet in a foreign country (lots of emigrants in western Europe) they are always glad to speak and hang out komshu(short for neighbor) style. That of course means drinking, eating and listening to pop-folk music. 
Now about Bulgaria. 
After the communists regime ended in 1989 the country is trying to catch up with the rest of Europe and reform into market economy. While this reform is more or less completed, the main problem in the country is the people that ran it those 23 years. Every government and prime minister we have elected said that he will fix the country and make peoples lives better etc. However, when in power, those people mainly fixed themselves and relatives/associates etc. In the first years after 1989 a lot of nationalized factories where privatized in a very shady manner which was devastating for them but some chosen people made millions. 
Some administrations were better then others and tried to do something for the country along all the stealing they are doing. The 90s were marked by the ruling of the mafia and such structures and great financial crisis in 1997 with huge inflation etc. Small and middle size businesses were very hard to run and be profitable which created an even bigger cap between rich and poor. The big breakthrough, so to say, was when in 2007 we were accepted in the European union. This meant that millions of euro from different funds of the EU were given to Bulgaria to things better through all kinds of programs. But the EU doesn't just hang out briefcases with money. They usually pay after or during the realization of a project. But a lot of Bulgarians either don't know/don't want or are too lazy to create and manage those projects and a large portion of those millions stayed unused. However, over the time, more and more projects started happening. At the moment almost everything significant being built or bought from the government is with 90% EU money and people are very proud that we finally managed to spend the money or at least some of them. Our prime minister for the past 3 and a half years is a fireman by education, later bodyguard and policeman, and the minister of inner affairs is an gym class teacher by education. They both have connections with the underground world. However, because the prime minister (Boiko Borisov) behaves like a regular man of the people, talks like you talk at the pub with friends and stuff like that the Bulgarian people decided at the last elections that this is exactly the type of person that will fix our country. What we ended up with is a kind of unofficial dictatorship, where everything depends on Boiko, who is btw famous for only reading a couple of books. You can probably spot the problem here already. As the people who elected him, boiko borisov is not a very smart man that has the country at his disposal. He goes around the country talking about how HE built 200 km of highway and a sports arena and 10 km of subway and how bad the last ruling party was and people are cheering him. When he talks to the media, he disregards bad questions and even gets angry at the journalists why they ask him such things and not about the good things he did (see above). Almost all newspapers or tv stations in the country are getting paid by one party or another, most of them of course by the ruling party to keep the mindset positive. The biggest problem is that because He's not sure what to do with the country he often changes his mind about a law being passed through the parliament or some regulations or taxes etc. This makes the business climate in the country terrible and a lot of foreign companies decide that it's not worth it to invest here. 
So at the moment Bulgaria is the poorest country in the EU, our minimum monthly wage is 145 euro and our average monthly wage is about 350 euro. For some kind of comparison, a liter of gas costs about 1.35 euros. As you can see, most people don't have it very well. People are mostly concerned about buying food and paying their bills. Not a lot left for anything else. It must be noted that life is significantly better in the capital, Sofia, where most foreign investors are focused and salaries are better. This creates a sort of black whole effect that drains the rest of the country. Excluding another 2-3 cities, the rest is quite depressing and even poorer. Most old people live with 100-150 euro a month, god knows how, since our healthcare system is also terrible. Most people that have the opportunity to leave the country are doing it and are rarely coming back. Over the past years maybe some 1.5 million people left the country. They prefer washing dishes or similar low end jobs in Spain/England/Germany than working here and I don't blame them. But a lot of the smart and knowledgeable people are leaving as well and succeeding elsewhere.  
To sum it up, I guess I have to say that it's the people's fault. During the communists regime everyone had a job which meant the work was separated and most people did very little. After 89 they had to start working harder in order to accomplish something. Most people decided not to which is why the general productivity (and GDP) is quite low. There are of course bright and working people that managed to make profitable businesses, but most people live with the old standard in mind, trying to avoid doing actual work, so I guess it will take another 20-30 years to clear that from the system. At the time the most profitable sector in Bulgaria is probably IT, we have a lot of young people learning programming in the universities and companies find it very cheap since they pay for example 1000 euro/month for a programmer which is very low compared to western europe but very high for Bulgaria, so everybody's happy. HP, IBM, VMware and a lot of other companies have offices here, also call centers and general support centers are very popular here, we're like Europe's India:D
That's enough I think, if you have any specific questions ask away. 
Oh btw, Bulgaria is great for visiting since for most foreigners it's very cheap here and we have most modern conveniences, good food/beer/wines, summer and winter resorts etc. Also our women are good looking and they love foreigners (because they want to get the heck out of here:D).

tl;dr: Bulgaria sucks to live in, awesome for a vacation.

True,0,"Oh, that is hilarious naive and crossly incorrect. 

I don't give a flying fuck what race they are. If I saw someone of Roma origin studying on my university I would welcome them with open arms for breaking their cultural bonds. 

I was born in Norway and had relatively little experience with Roma until my parents took us on a year trip trough EU.

And boy did I learn something. You go to Berlin? Walk down any populous street and you will see a group of them with various games you can play. Watch longer and you will see that a few playing and winning is actually nicely dressed Roma that is set up to make the games look easy and secure when in reality it straight up scams. Wait a even longer you may hear an odd sound and shuddenly you will see them pack up in seconds and run away. 

That is their call signs; they have peoples down the street keeping an eye out for cops. Me and my brother had a lot fun figuring out the call signs of various groups and faking them to make them flee.


When we visited France my father was robbed in broad daylight while bicycling; someone ran up and grabbed the bag on the baggage carrier on the bicycle and ran away, leaving my father dumbfounded at the audacity. 

I had saved up for years as a kid for that trip; €250 and all of it was stolen.

And don't you dare call it an racism, because it betrays absolute ignorance of the issue. It got nothing to do with their race and everything with culture. 

To understand the Roma and the issues surrounding them you have to know their history; for various reasons the Roma is a traveling people, in past ages they made their living by things like small trade, tinkering for small villages who lacked their own professionals and entertainment. 

Of course they did also engage in criminal behavioral, like any other cultures, but they provided useful services to secluded villages so they where tolerated if not always liked. But history changes; with advent of mass production and transportation what use their  traveling culture represented to natives disappeared. No longer being able to support themselves they had the choice between having their way of life disappear and assimilate into the local cultures or turn to the last option available to them; stealing.  

So now we have a group of marginalized people who develop an extremely strong culture where family is everything and everyone non-Roma have no consideration. A short of binary caste system that allows them to live as the social parasites they have become. 

If they where willing to assimilate into normal society I would have no problem with them; I would be more than happy to provide everything they need to do so. In fact, because I live in Scandinavia where such help is provided I do so. But they are not willing because they are brought up in a culture somewhat aking to a cult. Imagine Scientology being far more widespread and centuries old and you might understand the problem. I don't care what genes they have, I care about what they do.

True,0,"Nonsense.

We have our own 'eco system' (for lack of a better word) here in the US.

We pay X amount in taxes and for products because our labor rates, safety regulations, environmental controls, infrastructure and everything else that makes up our country has a minimum cost. Its essentially the minimum cost of keeping our standard of living. Every country has a certain minimum cost to which it costs to build, design or simply sell a product.  Its the cost of doing business in that country. 

All this is one of the reasons why entertainment companies region-lock DVDs - companies have agreements which cost X amount of money and no doubt those costs are considerable higher in the US than most other places. Because of that they don't want cheap grey-market DVDs coming in from Eastern Europe. They won't make their nut.

The DVD market isn't the only one in this stuff like this happens. Books (especially textbooks), electronics, video games, even cars. These products, and more, are locked in a region to keep from undercutting prices.

Ok, what's this have to do with engineers and foreign students?  Basically everything. The same way that Product A from India is banned because it will undercut the prices for American products if sold here, is how foreign students under cut the 'eco system' of engineering talent in this country. Except that companies want to stop the importation of stuff that will hurt them, but want to increase the importation of students that will hurt the US labor market.

These companies want their cake and eat it too.",1354363273,,False,engineering,t5_2qhpi,t3_142l52,Szos,,t1_c79kbaw,1430549033,0,3,0,c79kbaw,False,,t1_c79hce6,3,
True,0,"People believed many different stupid things in the past, that is not limited to the bible at all- some hundreds of years back, dragons, giants and dwarves were not just fairy-tales either. The majority of Christians have ALWAYS KNOWN that the bible is an often-altered transcript of an oral tradition that probably shares a lot of characteristics with bard-style history recital- everything is just a bit cooler, more miracolous, and louder (think ""Die Hard"" vs. actual hostage situation). This has not invalidated Luther's belief, and it does not invalidate mine. It is when you close your eyes to evolving knowledge that you become fundamentalist, and I have no intention to.  
And before you get all huffy about your perceived ""science vs. Christians"" war, please remember who was the main proponent and vector of science throughout much of European history? That's right, the CHURCH. Without the libraries the monks carefully transcribed, all of the classical knowledge would be lost to us. Do you even know that Mendelsohn, the father of modern genetics, was a monk? That the vatican employs astronomers and physicists? Whoa, stop the presses, a PHYSICIST not only believing in Christ, but to an extent that he becomes a monk?  
Yes, yes, you have terrible fundies in America, and yes, they say some stupid shit, and yes, they have gained influence via the Tea party. But if you would pull your head out of your ass for long enough to look to the rest of the world (where the MAJORITY of Christians live) you will see that the notion of ""science vs. religion"" is a false dichotomy that, in Europe, is unheard of, and would be considered most boorish.

True,0,"The celebration of Christ's birthday at the end of December comes from Roman times.  The Roman calendar had twelve months each with 30 days, a total of 360 days.  To justify that calendar to the Solar calendar the last five days of the Solar year were dedicated to the Gods and Goddesses - one giant holiday season. 

Since those five days did not 'exist' even slaves could not be required to work.  This is when Christians could in some safety practice their religion and celebrate Christ.

There has been some research that suggests that Christ would have been born in or around mid-year, June, based on when the Roman's would have required the populace to register in their birth towns for taxation.

Moving it forward to closer to Winter Solstice came later as the church began to overwhelm and absorb other belief systems in mid-Europe, the Scandinavian countries, and the British Isles. Edit - I said closer, I should have said associating or linking it to solstice. 

If you follow Christianity's march across Europe and into the British Isles you see that many of the conquered cultures only gave lip service to the new religion.  The church was aware of this and so took over the Pagan traditions, icons, symbolism, and celebrations.

As example, and I know there are several versions of the origins of the Christmas Tree.  In pagan teaching in the British Isle's area the Goddess was the Sun and the growing sessions.  Her consort, the moon, ruled the winter.  

The moon, wanting to court the Goddess, came to earth as the Spirit of the Green - what we know as the Greenman today.  He walks the earth from Spring through Fall, but come winter and without the blessings of the Goddess he could not travel.  So he takes up his home inside of an evergreen, there to sleep until Her return.

Because the Greenman is a deity he gave special life to the evergreen, so it is the only tree that does not shed its leaves in winter.  

Pagans, not understanding astronomy, knew winter as the Small Death (of earth or nature).  For spring to return the Greenman had to awaken from his winter sleep.  And to insure that he could, that he was safe through the Small Death, they brought a living evergreen into their homes where they could protect and  tend it and therefore protect the Greenman.

When spring neared they planted back outside.

Now .... It's a Christian Christmas Tree ... not!

Another edit - The Greenman's ( aka Jack of the Green) awakening is celebrated with May Day with the return of spring and is associated with New Birth ... baby bunnies!  baby chicks!  Christian's really twisted this one into celebrating 'coming back from the dead'.  May Day is not resurrection and never was - May Day had nothing to do with death.",1354364099,,False,atheism,t5_2qh2p,t3_143l9b,WyvernWench,,t1_c79kdon,1430549063,0,2,0,c79kdon,1354364882,,t1_c79ka24,2,

By the time the British left in 1948, the only people who seemed to really maintain an active interest in the area were the Americans and the Arab world. This was particularly because of Jewish swing votes valuable to Truman in the upcoming election. American public opinion was probably more sympathetic and pronounced than most, helped by a strong Jewish community and awareness in the US which is lacking in other countries. 

The British public opinion questioned why troops were dying over in Palestine for a cause they scarcely understood; especially considering the war-weariness of a global conflict they just fought. Most Brits just wanted their boys home. The government left the mandate resigned to the possibility of conflict and that whoever was the strongest would prevail there.

True,0,"Ok, backgroud story. I'm an Italian student that this summer went on a 10 day trip around europe. We visited Amsterdam, Copenaghen and Munchen...but this is not the point.
While we were in Copenaghen, something quite unexplainable happened to me. I and two friend of mine were waiting outside a supermarket controlling our backpacks while two other friends were inside buying food for everyone. Mind you, we are Italians in Denmark, we were travelling by ourselves and we didn't knew anyone there. I was talking to my friend about nothing in particoular (how to properly put things inside a big backpack, if I remember), when we saw this woman.


She was probably around 35/40 years old, was wearing worn out clothes and was riding this old bicycle with lots of shopping bags full of empty plastic bottles (later we learned that some homeless people search plastic bottles in the dumpsters to take them to recicle points were they are given money for it). We, obviously, didn't bother...until she went near us.

 We were quite puzzled, but she didn't seem dangerous so we weren't worried. Then, she approached me, leaned toward me (I was sitting on the sidewalk) and in perfect italian wispered to my ear ""Allow me to congratulate you for the willfulness and strenght of your opinions"" (""Le faccio i complimenti per la caparbietà e solidità delle sue opinioni"", if some fellow italian has a better translation please tell me!).


What. The. Fuck. I looked at her, mumbled ""thank you"" and then she took her bike and went her merrily way without giving me an explanation. I don't know who she was, why she speaked perfectly italian and most of all I don't know if that phrase has some deeper meaning.

a) being that they are to the right of the Conservatives on most issues

b) given that Cameron is a centrist Tory who from the beginning has tried to drag his party away from the right

c) given that the Eurosceptic wing of the Conservatives tend to come from the right of the party (just like in the 70s and 80s, Eurosceptic Labour voters came from the left)

It follows that Cameron would have to drag his party to the right to win back the disaffected right.  The idea that they're all otherwise perfectly happy Conservative voters who are just a bit worried about Europe is naive; explaining the benefits of Europe really isn't going to get them back!  Nor would a referendum in the manifesto get them back, anymore than the Cameron using the veto got them back!  

Cameron is certainly not going to lose the Eurosceptic portion of his party!  That was never a realistic threat.  The bulk will always stick with the Conservatives as most sensible way of defeating Labour. A few at the margin will switch, and it may be enough to lose Cameron a few seats, and with the balance so tight right now, he can't afford to do that.

True,0,"WW2 involved the civilians into military business. There are no civil targets if civilians are supporting the military with work like manufacturing ammunition and such things. Also, the military situation was a lot different since bombarded cities were highly populated. On a military basis, a world war is not comparable with a regional one.

Even though it is a problem, my problem is not so much the possibility of dead civilians but that it takes over 100k dead civilians before the guy you actually want to catch dies. That is completely blown out of proportion.

&gt; What if one of those terrorists we killed in a bomb strike that also killed maybe 3 civilians with him would have gone on to do a dirty bomb strike in another country - US or not - and killed thousands?

Terrorist organisations don't work like that. There are always people that just step one level higher and take their place. One dead terrorist doesn't do anything. The war in the middle east just gave those terrorists more recruits because of in the other comment mentioned reasons (anger and hate).

The money invested into the military could have been invested into prevention in western cities. Instead of sending thousands of soldiers into the middle east, you could easily secure airports and train stations. Al'Qaeda has people in other countries anyway to recruit. So even if terrorists can't leave Iraq or Afghanistan, there are plenty of people in Europe and the US who are already there. 

Look at Israel. How long is that whole Israel vs Palestine thing going on? Terrorists still blow themselves up in Tel Aviv even though Israel has already won plenty of wars in that region.

There is nothing exotic about these devices or magnets. You can build a monopole magnet with instructions from video no 5 ( Magnetic sheilding-manipulation of magnetic field ). Its in French, but you can see the magnets marked N(orth) and S(outh) clearly to replicate the effect. Keep an open mind.

Commercial magnet motors are available from this European manufacturer if you don't trust homemade videos :(

Dota2 wont catch up to LoL in any meaningful time frame (&lt;2 years upon F2P release). Thats if it catches up at all, LoL appeals to a wider demographic while Dota is more punishing and rewards persistent (avoiding the word hardcore) gamers rather than casual gamers. Dota's player base will probably always be smaller, but offset by the fact that the playerbase is more likely to respond to targetted ads (Corsair's DH tourney for example) and more dedicated to the scene. (Starcraft's playerbase is smaller than LoL's but its scene is far more massive due to how dedicated people get)

That being said, Dota2 will never be a bust (like your fears about HoN). From this vantage point already in the beta, you can tell it isnt a CS:GO. Its going to be one of Valve's big titles. Compare daily player statistics and its already rubbing out the big one, TF2 from the #1 position by 3X more players. You arent the first person who has responded to me about Valve time and dota2 losing to LoL because of it. Im sure that if you are aware of it, Valve are aware of it and it would appear they prefer quality of the game over quantity of players. The players will always be drawn to quality. In my honest opinion, there is no competition between the games and if you point out that there is, it doesnt matter. The games are different and they appeal to different audiences and play styles and tastes. 1 million players might go to LoL and enjoy it while if they were to try Dota, they would not like the experience at all as it is more demanding and less ""cute"" (teemo). At the same time, Dota has nigh on 10 years of solid growth and ideas. So many things in LoL are considered inferior ranging from the client itself to the item differentiation and ability. This appeals to a different demographic and while there is interlap, it shouldnt be too bad, I know people who play both and enjoy both.

That said, Valve could rummage up a couple more heroes, more items, tutorial and coaching system implemented, LAN support, begin uploading the base support into the client for custom games (much like how hero materials are uploaded beforehand). They could probably pull this off in ~3 months imo and it will be presentable for release as F2P.

Tutorial has things already prepared. Materials for 4 new heroes are already in the client ([dusa, troll, shredder, bristle](http://www.dota2wiki.com/wiki/Unreleased_Content#Unreleased_Hero_Status)). Polycount contest is drawing to a close meaning hero models are prepared for items (Valve just need to port them over, everything from textures, ideas and colours is user done). Coaching system would simply be minor interface upgrades. LAN support has us relatively in the dark but its extremely important so its priority must be high up there if Dota2 is to move into places like China and SEA where personal computers are less accessible but player base is high for dota1 (dont think that they cant afford to game though, kids are in LAN cafes all day every day)

Valve dont fuck up. Its why /r/gaming is a massive GabeN circle jerk. You look at Bethesda (good games, glitchy, released too fast too poorly). You look at Blizzard (good games, poor service/money grabbing). You look at Valve (Great games, high quality, great service all round).

1) Jews aren't Christians.  Europe was heavily under the influence of the Church, so those who did not follow the Church were bad.

2) The Church blamed the Jews for lots of very nasty things, the chief among them being *the killing of Jesus*(which in its own ironic way is very beneficial for the Christians, but that is another point). The story goes that when Jesus  was being put to death, there was another man being put to death as well, a man named Barrabas.  Following a local tradition the crowd (this is Jerusalem in ~30CE, they're mostly Jews) was given the choice to pardon one of the men, the crowd called out Barrabas (or Bar Abba (*which is hebrew for ""Son of the Father""*)) and Jesus was killed.

3) Jewish immigrants tended to live in their own communities apart from the Christians.

4) Jewish culture tended to place a higher value on education then the native Christian cultures

5) Judaism places a higher value on Hygenie, requiring ritual bathing VERY frequently (after sex, after menstration, after touching a grave, really all the time basically).  This frequent bathing led to a lower rate of disease so certain illnesses (see: Black Plague) were less prevalent in the Jewish communities

6) Christians tended to be banned (religiously) from charging interest or fees in banking. Jews (religiously) were only banned from doing so *to other Jews*.  This led to many of the bankers, lenders, money changers, etc. being Jews who charged interest and thus made substantial amounts of money.

7) In summation, to the European Christians the Jews were: Heathens, who killed our Lord then moved to our land, refused to live in our towns, didn't get sick (zomg they must be CAUSING the Black Plague), and then became rich off our money.

&gt;The policy of racial separation used in South Africa from 1948 to 1990.

&gt;(by extension) Any similar policy of racial separation.

Per Miriam Webster:

&gt;: racial segregation; specifically : a former policy of segregation and political and economic discrimination against non-European groups in the Republic of South Africa

Per Dictionary.com, quoting the Collins World Dictionary:

&gt;(in South Africa) the official government policy of racial segregation; officially renounced in 1992

True,0,"Often war is necessary for change, and definitely has been. Existing elites are just too much against change to allow it to happen typically.

There's really no ELI5 that doesn't hint that violence is an option even as a child, so it's pretty tough to write as a parent :P

Still, I guess you could say this for it: imagine you're arguing about the way you and your friend do things. Say, equipping your character in a video game. He's just doing it so wrong - none cares about dexterity in this game, focus on the other stats! Even if all your attempts to prove your point to him go unheeded and he even tries to impose his 'dex' focus on you (its his computer), eventually you'll find that a duel with him might be an easy way to teach him a lesson. If his character dies in that, then oh well, he was being pretty annoying anyway.


Examples of BIG changes ushered in by violence:      

**Meritocracy** (letting the most capable rule, instead of the most connected): Genghis Khan's conquering rampage drove this point home quite nicely. In the past while neighbours had been a threat, the biggest threat to you - as a noble - was internal enemies slipping past your children on the totem pole. Mongols changed that by showing that if you played the internal games, you could seriously get yourself impaled on a spike.     

**Democracy**: In the US, but more critically in Europe (France), the reaction to democracy was immediate and quite extreme violence from the neighbours (isolation can allow for doing things with more limited violence, as US and UK experiences with democracy show).     

**Workers Rights**: While terrible for its own citizens and those under its direct control, it's hard to deny that the existence of the Soviet Union was essential in the development of workers rights in Europe in particular - the elites had to compromise to guarantee that everyone in the country would side with the country rather than the (rather rose-tinted view of) Soviet Union. 

Then there's the technological development that has been mentioned in many posts, but there is a big place for war in the final arbiter of ideas as well.

Then there's the Czech Republic, he's known for bringing everybody good home brewed beer. His family has been brewing beer longer than pretty much any other kid in school, and have learned how to do a great job with it.


Slovakia used to be best buddies with the Czech Republic but they recently grew apart. Slovakia has been getting better at mountain sports and always tries to invite everybody over to ski near his parents' place.


Hungary is an interesting kid, back in the day he had a bright future together with his friend Austria. But now he's butthurt because Austria stopped being friends with him, and then all countries around him (especially Romania) stole his stuff. He's still having a hard time getting over his loss.


Romania is a nice girl, she's smarter than many people think she is, and recently started a singing career.


Ukraine used to be in a relationship with Russia. Now she's having an identity crisis, part of her wants to rekindle the relationship with Russia, another part of her doesn't want to see Russia ever again.

True,0,"To have a go at answering your questions:

Religion is strong in the US, in a way that (I've noticed) consistently surprises Europeans. A lot of it is political and tribal. Politicians and religious leaders have learned, quite well, that bringing up religion gets a lot of people to skip whatever logical reasoning they have and just go to a mob mentality. 

I think, ironically, that the reason religion is so strong in the US is because our government hasn't been involved in it. Look at the state-sponsored Church of England (or Norway or Sweden). No one goes, and the CofE hasn't had to be very flexible or appealing, since they're covered by the state. But the US is a petri dish for the evolution of marketing-savvy churches.

Furthermore, since the safety net in the US is pretty pathetic relative to European countries (no universal health care, for example), people either need churches for help (a small portion) or they need religion to salve their worried minds (the bigger portion, I suspect).

The break came in and, to my surprise, they didn't look like they had that fire in them for S3...I saw them playing Smite...I saw them do nothing but stream Solo Q...it looked to me that they didn't care much about their loss at the S2 Championship, as if it was just another game. I look at the European Teams and the Asian Teams...they are practicing, they are taking it to heart and then I look at my favorite team and...they just don't seem to care.

MLG Dallas showed me that, they were not prepared at all, I know they had recently moved from NY to LA and they didn't care much about it, I gave them the benefit of the doubt to show me I was wrong at IPL 5 but...on comes the first game, against Curse.EU...and they get embarrassed. Yes, not only beaten, but embarrassed, they just don't have that fire in them to be the best, and as a fan, that hurts. 

I won't say they suck, because they don't, they are great players but they certainly are not the same team that during the S2 played so well and took things seriously, they have grown to be a team that plays just for fun, and boy do they do it, the game yesterday against Blaze was one of the best series I have seen, they were amazing, but I knew they weren't going to win, because that fire is gone, I no longer expect TSM to be a contender, and as a fan it disappoints and saddens me.

There's a reason that the coin operated vending machine industry lobbies for larger denomination coins. Those cash bill receivers on vending machines are the most maintenance intensive and failure prone parts of the whole machine. Coins are much easier to accept. In america where the highest value common coin is worth $.25, there's a limit to what is practical to purchase at a machine.

True,0,"China didn't become anything. Its behaviors are explained by the way that  its culture structured the order of the universe (cosmology) and particular economic and political concerns.

A couple of days ago I made a slightly more detailed comment on the nature of the Chinese cosmology [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13u0kp/when_chinese_records_speak_of_barbarians_do_they/c77bau3). For even more info, look at Schoppa, Escherick and Qin's articles in *China's Rise in Historical Perspective* edited by Brantley Womack. Or, I'm sure wikipedia has some good articles. The moral of the story is: China is the center, and the most important place. The fact that they are concerned with primarily themselves explains a lack of interest in engaging in the sort of colonialism that European powers did, a topic that came up in a thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13x928/what_was_going_on_in_asia_around_the_time_of_the/c781ng6?context=3). This also addresses why they choose to be primarily an exporter.

**However**, if you mean to ask how China became so isolationist particularly during the Maoist period, well simply look to what the western powers did as explained in my first linked comment above. They pillaged China by force and exploited it, completely upending its understanding of how the world worked. So there was an obvious reaction against allowing European powers to engage them in almost any fashion. And this European invasion was in 1900- not that long ago. And the United States was fighting a proxy war with the Chinese in Korea only 60 years ago. So there's a lot of fresh memory there about exploitation and confrontation with Europe and America. 

The reason they have opened up more is because of the post-Mao reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping and the policy of ""Communism with Chinese characteristics"" that all but eradicated true communist ideology from the CCP. ""Communism with Chinese Characteristics"" said that, ""if it works, it's communist"" and so called for a small, highly controlled market economy that they have allowed to grow gradually. Before that, the country was couched in Maoist ideology that prevented capitalist ventures, and rendered international trade nearly impossible.

The [United States holds four of the eleven largest refineries in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_refineries#.28World.27s_largest_refineries.29). Scrolling down that list, you'll find that we have state**s** that outnumber other 1st world countries in terms of refineries. 

So we produce a massive amount of oil in enough places across the country to make it cheaper sure, but that's only half of the reason for our low fuel prices compared to EU countries. According to [this site](http://www.cfe-eutax.org/taxation/excise-duties/denmark), the minimum excise tax on unleaded petrol for EU countries is €0.359 per liter. Converted to USD/gallon, that's $1.76 per gallon. The federal excise tax on gasoline in the States is $0.18 per gallon. So the EU minimum tax on petrol is ~10 times the American tax (although [each state is allowed to levy their own taxes on petrol](http://www.api.org/Oil-and-Natural-Gas-Overview/Industry-Economics/~/media/Files/Statistics/Gasoline-Tax-Map.ashx) as well, even our highest taxing states of California, New York, and Hawaii still charge less than $0.70  per gallon (€0.14/ liter)).

So it's not that our gasoline is incredibly cheap as much as most other countries have artificially inflated prices. We probably should too, but unfortunately Americans spent the last 60 years of (sub)urban planning, mass transit planning, and culture conditioning focusing on the idea of most people in the country having a personal automobile using the internal combustion engine, so we can't just join the rest of the 1st world country raise our prices on fuel tomorrow by 20-30% without serious implications for a massive amount of our public.

One of the reasons the black plague killed so many people in Europe was because a large part of the dog population had been killed, and so the rats flourished. As soon as people starting letting the dogs back, things started getting better.

So on a large scale the rat-eating dogs have saved millions, possibly billions of lives, whereas the bomb-sniffing cats have saved maybe some thousands.

My theory on the real reason:  the original plan for City of Villains was that you would join one of the 4 existing factions, as Arachnos didn't exist yet.  The 5th Column was supposed to be one of those factions.  Smashing Nazis is one thing, but playing them is quite another and *that* wouldn't have played well in Germany so we got the Council instead.  

Also possibly the reason for the long-standing patron pool lock-in; I'm guessing that system was written before they came up with Arachnos.

The overall budget allocation for bilateral EU assistance to Egypt under the ENPI for 2011-2013 is €449.29 million, and the total allocation to Egypt for 2007- 2013 is over € 1 billion.

and 

&gt;Between 2000 and 2006, Egypt received about €600 million in funding from the MEDA II programme. 

Also

&gt;In 2006, priority was given to improving the Egyptian health sector, especially the on-going reform of the national health system. To this end, €88 million was committed during 2006. In addition, €20 million was committed in support of social development, €11 million in support of research, development and innovation, and €10 million for an interest-rate subsidy relating to a project on environmental pollution abatement.

True,0,"This question is huge, and honestly you'd be best off just starting with the wiki. The elements you suggest have to do with the history of a massive portion of Asia and indeed the Indian Ocean for more than two centuries, and the interactions of Britons with millions of Asians of all kinds. Cricket is an example of cultural interchange between the two groups, while *The Secret Garden* is probably best seen as how Britons rendered their imperial experience culturally. 

I don't think any ""nation"" can be ""sneakily stolen""; nations--as imagined communities--are MADE, and cannot be possessed. Further, if you want to think about the land of India, I don't think we can say it was ""sneakily stolen"" either, since what you're talking about it is a colonial government that both mapped onto and transformed already-existing social, political, economic, environmental, and cultural formations. There was nothing sneaky about it.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""truly British."" Sure, the British controlled it, and benefited from their dominance, and brought about substantial change to Indian society. But what is ""truly"" British? I don't think British people then or now would agree on what is ""truly"" British. I think the more important point to remember--particularly when looking at colonialism--is not to get caught up in a binaries that divide the whole process into British/Indian. People from Britain and people from India interacted for a LONG time, and there were many people who crossed borders, could consider themselves both British and Indian, and show that those boundaries are fluid at best, if not outright fictional. Moreover, people in India obviously adopted a variety of cultural, social, economic, and political forms from Britons, most importantly the idea of the nation. People in Britain adopted the same from India, like curry. In both cases, adopting some kind of cultural or other formation from elsewhere always involves negotiation, adaptation, and change. Broadly, we might think of modern Britain and modern India having MADE EACH OTHER, in the ways that they exchanged and interacted so much.

As for whether it was better or worse for India to have experienced colonialism, that depends entirely on what you think is good or bad. We can say with certainty that the India that existed at the fall of the Mughal Empire was dramatically changed by British rule, with the introduction over several centuries of economic change in the imposition of European forms of capitalism, reorganization of political systems such as the government of India itself, environmental transformation in the use of forests, and cultural norms such as the abolition of sati. So, are those things ""good""? Some of them would seem to be, although others are more ambiguous. There were many devastating famines in India under British rule, so that we could say are obviously bad. Moreover, in every single case, Indians themselves were deeply involved. Indeed, Britain could not have ruled India WITHOUT Indians.

It's difficult--and probably not that useful--to say whether British rule was on balance ""good"" or bad. We CAN say that changes in India from the mid-18th to the mid-20th century were often imposed from the outside, forced on them by British administrators or businessmen, although as I noted above, nearly always involving Indians at every level. Does that make them good or bad? Again, that's hard to say, although I think it is fair to say that Britain is blamed for many of the problems that contemporary India faces: economic underdevelopment, religious conflict, or caste-based conflicts.

Great talking points, except:

* Every high speed internet infrasturcture project I've heard of gives money to telecoms so they build in places where they would normally skip.

If there is another type of public works internet project please let me know, and I will correct the above.

* The United States is huge and empty while most other developed nations are much denser. It's more expensive to provide access in a sprawl or out in the middle of nowhere than a extremely dense european city. It isn't a good use of money to lay optical fiber in some far off corner of Montana.

True,0,"Wittgenstein certainly does appear to have the characteristics of a genius (he would be one of the three I can count of one hand, the others being Martin Heidegger and John Rawls). I also wouldn't dismiss him on the same grounds as I would someone like Russell or Popper, but this is only because I see Wittgenstein as breaking out of the predictable analytic mold. I can't speak on the value of his *Tractatus* as I stopped reading somewhere half-way, but according to my general understanding of his *Philosophical Investigations* he was far more entrenched in modern European philosophy than his contemporaries. For example, he has a considerable amount in common with the traditions of existentialism and pragmatism. From a pragmatic point of view, it isn't our linguistic usage that supplies things with meaning, but rather the entire field of normative commitments and practices that shape different forms of human life (a position quite similar to the German idealists). Similarly, from an existential point of view, it's also true that meaning is located somewhere in the ineffable depths of subjectivity. Wittgenstein's distinction between *sense* and *non-sense* is apparently informed by this kind of outlook. I doubt many analytics are sensitized to this religious dimension of his work. In either case, he betrays a debt to the late enlightenment and romantic traditions of German philosophy, which is itself a continuation of the tradition of continental rationalism, and not the strict empiricism of figures such as Locke, Hume, or Mill. His later work therefore acts as a bridge between the Kantianism of the early 18th century and the mathematical and linguistic turns of the later parts of the 19th and 20th centuries. It's this historical gulf in the self-understanding of many working day analytic philosophers that a lot of people find offensive. Wittgenstein, for his part, doesn't seem to be guilty of this error. For these reasons, he seems to have one foot deeply planted in ordinary language philosophy, and the other in old school continental philosophy. In that sense, I do think he's worth reading, albeit with some measured skepticism.

However, as this conversation was initially about the Golden Company that changes things a bit.  The entire Golden Company is made of (presumably) well-trained and disciplined professional soldiers.

True,0,"I suppose I can agree to that. Personally, as a Christian, I am biased towards and adhere to the idea of 'unselfishness.' I think sacrifice is an extremely important thing for humans to do. 

Assuming you're a Westerner (either American or European), it's easy for us to understand the concept of unselfishness that Christianity teaches. I guess what's difficult to grasp is the idea of selflessness and how it's practically different. Selflessness, first of all, predominates India (Hindus and Buddhists alike) as well as a large part of the rest of Asia. Selfless people will sacrifice for one another, but not necessarily out of ""love"" as we perceive it, but out of the need to transform their 'atman' (self) to 'brahman' (which is like their god only it's a spirit or reality that they become part of). Marriages in these parts of the world don't happen out of love - that's a concept that really doesn't exist in their cultures. 

It's hard to put it in words, but these people don't really love themselves in the same way Christians do. I'm not saying they don't care for themselves, I think it is human nature to be at least somewhat self-important, but I think that they don't view themselves in the same light we do. 

I think the reason unselfishness is better for the human condition is that because we love ourselves so much, having the motivation to bring others to our level and loving them just as much actually drives us to act and be charitable. Unfortunately this also leads to corruption and the culture of greed that exists in our country. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about helping yourself (I'm politically conservative, I think competition is the greatest thing). But the upside is that there are tons of charities in America and Europe and people really do help the less fortunate here. 

Whereas countries like India, or even Japan and China in some parts, they simply care about others more. It's hard to differentiate - but they don't have cultures of greed there. Things like healthcare are seen as a right that they'll gladly give up for, not out of love for the fellow man, but simply because these people are also a part of the same reality and the only way to become one with it is to help them out. Does that make sense? If not, I'm probably not going to be of much help for you. It makes sense to me, I'm bad at communicating it.

True,0,"A bunch of these are valid questions, so I have no problem answering.

As to your question about Benito's fascist credentials, he actually began as a Socialist. He was the editor of a newspaper called Avanti, which was an up front socialist publication. However, when he came to power in 1922, thus began the Fascist movement.

Now, this is why it's vastly different from President Obama. If one were to claim (not saying this is or isn't true) that Obama passed Socialist policies, that would be him following in the footsteps of past socialist leaders. Mussolini, on the other hand, helped define fascism. And I mean that literally. In 1932, he wrote an entry in the Italian Encyclopedia for the definition of fascism. [You can find it here, if you're curious.](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/mussolini-fascism.asp)

Mussolini *is* Fascism. I'm hesitant to use the word 'founded', because that's not really true. But in terms of how he ran Italy, it wasn't really a mixed system, if that's what you were implying. It was the first official Fascist government in the world.

Okay, onto the anti-semitism. Mussolini was a fierce anti-semite. In many cases, he claimed his hatred for Jews preceded Adolf Hitler's. [Here's a secondary source on that.](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33973018/ns/world_news-europe/t/lovers-diary-mussolini-wanted-destroy-jews/#.ULpui5Pjn5g). Whether or not he began the anti-Jew movement in the 30s and 40s is debatable, and probably not true. Hitler and Mussolini had a serious narcissistic bromance, where each usually tried to one up the other.

As for official legislation against Jews, there was the [Manifesto of Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_Race), passed in 1938. This law stripped Jews of citizenship, prevented intermarriage, and excluded them from civil service, military service, and ownership of companies or property in Italy.

Lastly, fascism is the direct opposite of communism. It's explained further in the link at the top of my comment, but communists were equal to Jews in the eyes of Fascists and Nazis. Many were sent to concentration camps across Europe.

True,0,"&gt;You simply must be joking. Sam makes a clear statement and has a clear argument behind it. Why is it that no one actually argues the logic behind his positions. 

People do argue the logic behind Sam's positions. What you are doing is putting words in Sam's mouth, and trying to argue that logic, which is not his. Nobody else argues that because nobody else knows what you are talking about.

&gt;Some Muslims Suicide Bomb. 

Sam does not ignore Christian atrocities. You may not be familiar with all his positions, but he is anti-faith in all its forms. He also recognizes that some forms of faith are more deadly than others, whether that faith is in an ideology or nationalism or a religious faith. And second, you of course agree that some Muslims do suicide bomb, so this point is not in contention.

&gt;A country run by Muslim people may get a nuke. 

You agree with Sam again.

&gt;Because some Muslims are suicide bombers, if a Muslim nation were to create a nuke, we should pre-emptively nuke them. 

This is where your misunderstanding comes in. Sam does not say this. You are pointing to a sentence where Sam does not say this, and you are claiming ""Look! There he supports a nuclear first strike!"" But Sam's sentence does not actually say that, the rest of the paragraph makes it clear he does not support that, and his many clarifications after accusations of such also make it clear he does not support that. You are just wrong.

&gt;The suicide bombings carried out by Muslims are unjust actions carried out against innocent targets. 

Well, this is just objectively true. In the case of the 9/11 attacks, the attacks were unjust and against innocent targets: we cannot possibly disagree on this.

Your response is saying terrorism is a reasonable military tactic against occupying nations, and that America's aggression in the middle east was unjust and also killed innocent civilians - both of which I agree with, and I suspect Harris also agrees with - but ""tu quoque"" does not actually answer the charges levied against suicide bombing.

&gt;If he wishes to blame Islam for suicide bombing, he must show that Islam itself instructs people to engage in suicidal activity. 

You and Harris disagree on this. Harris has evidence for his claims that Islam is a dangerous idea, and I have laid out some of them in our previous posts. Harris does not say that all Muslims are suicide bombers, or that all Muslims support the killing of innocents, merely that the set of ideas called ""Islam"" is more prone to violent extremism than the set of ideas called ""Jainism."" Both are bad ideas, in Harris' view, but Islam is more likely to hurt our global society. Even if it is 0.1% of Muslims who are misled this way - vs 0.001% of Jains - that's all it takes. And Harris argues that it is much more than that (and of course provides evidence for it.)

&gt;He must show that the Muslim world is capable and willing to use a nuke against an innocent population. 

He doesn't show this, doesn't try to show this, and doesn't have to show this. The one part of the book where he talks about nuclear first-strike involves a hypothetical scenario where the Muslim world has already acquired a long-range nuke. The part about ""willing"" to nuke is the whole point of the book: bad ideas make normal people do crazy things. Islam is a bad idea, like Christianity, like Stalinism. You are under the impression that bad ideas don't matter, that people do what people do regardless of the culture they grow up in and the ideas they are exposed to. You are wrong.

A few quotes from Harris, that might finally change your mind:

[From:](http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/response-to-controversy2)

&gt;The journalist Chris Hedges has repeatedly claimed (in print, in public lectures, on the radio, and on television) that I advocate a nuclear first-strike on the Muslim world ... Wherever they appear, Hedges’ comments seem calculated to leave the impression that I want the U.S. government to start killing Muslims by the millions. 

(He doesn't)

About Islam:

&gt;Some critics of my work have claimed that my critique of Islam is “racist.” This charge is almost too silly to merit a response. But, as prominent writers can sometimes be this silly, here goes:

&gt;My analysis of religion in general, and of Islam in particular, focuses on what I consider to be bad ideas, held for bad reasons, leading to bad behavior. My antipathy toward Islam—which is, in truth, difficult to exaggerate—applies to ideas, not to people, and certainly not to the color of a person’s skin.  My criticism of the logical and behavioral consequences of certain ideas (e.g. martyrdom, jihad, honor, etc.) impugns white converts to Islam—like Adam Gadahn—every bit as much as Arabs like Ayman al-Zawahiri. I am also in the habit of making invidious comparisons between Islam and other religions, like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Must I point out that most Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains are not white like me? One would hope there would be no such need—but the work of writers like Chris Hedges suggests that the need is pressing.

&gt;As I regularly emphasize when discussing Islam, no one is suffering under the doctrine of Islam more than Muslims are—particularly Muslim women. Those who object to any attack upon the religion of Islam as “racist” or as a symptom of “Islamophobia” display a nauseating insensitivity to the subjugation of women throughout the Muslim world. At this moment, millions of women and girls have been abandoned to illiteracy, forced marriage, and lives of slavery and abuse under the guise of “multiculturalism” and “religious sensitivity.” This is a crime to which every apologist for Islam is now an accomplice. 

About Iraq:

&gt;I have never written or spoken in support of the war in Iraq. The truth is, I have never known what to think about this war, apart from the obvious: 1) prospectively, it seemed like a very dangerous distraction from the ongoing war in Afghanistan; 2) retrospectively, it has been a disaster.  While much of the responsibility for this disaster falls on the Bush administration, one of the administration’s great failings was to underestimate the religious sectarianism of the Iraqi people. Whatever one thinks about the rationale for invading Iraq and the subsequent prosecution of the war, there is nothing about the resulting conflict that makes Islam look benign—not the reflexive solidarity expressed throughout the Muslim world for Saddam Hussein (merely because an army of “infidels” attacked him), not the endless supply of suicide bombers willing to kill Iraqi noncombatants, not the insurgency’s use of women and children as human shields, not the ritual slaughter of journalists and aid-workers, not the steady influx of jihadis from neighboring countries, and not the current state of public opinion among European and American Muslims. It seems to me that no reasonable person can conclude that these phenomena are purely the result of U.S. foreign policy, however inept.

[From:](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/response-to-chris-hedges)

&gt;After my first book was published, the journalist Chris Hedges seemed to make a career out of misrepresenting its contents—asserting, among other calumnies, that somewhere in its pages I call for an immediate, nuclear first strike on the entire Muslim world. Hedges spread this lie so sedulously that I could have spent years writing letters to the editor.

&gt;Although Wilhelm Marr is generally credited with coining the word anti-Semitism (see below), Alex Bein writes that the word was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider in the phrase ""anti-Semitic prejudices"".[12] Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize Ernest Renan's ideas about how ""Semitic races"" were inferior to ""Aryan races."" These pseudo-scientific theories concerning race, civilization, and ""progress"" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as Prussian nationalistic historian Heinrich von Treitschke did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the term ""the Jews are our misfortune"" which would later be widely used by Nazis.[13] In Treitschke's writings Semitic was synonymous with Jewish, in contrast to its use by Renan and others.

&gt;In 1873 German journalist Wilhelm Marr published a pamphlet ""The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective."" (""Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet."")[14] in which he used the word ""Semitismus"" interchangeably with the word ""Judentum"" to denote both ""Jewry"" (the Jews as a collective) and ""jewishness"" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit). Although he did not use the word ""Antisemitismus"" in the pamphlet, the coining of the latter word followed naturally from the word ""Semitismus"" and indicated either opposition to the Jews as a people, or else opposition to Jewishness or the Jewish spirit, which he saw as infiltrating German culture. In his next pamphlet, ""The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit"", published in 1880, Marr developed his ideas further and coined the related German word Antisemitismus – antisemitism, derived from the word ""Semitismus"" that he had earlier used.

&gt;The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ""League of Antisemites"" (""Antisemiten-Liga""), the first German organization committed specifically to combatting the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their forced removal from the country.

&gt;So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ""Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte,"" and Wilhelm Scherer used the term ""Antisemiten"" in the January issue of ""Neue Freie Presse"". The related word semitism was coined around 1885.

True,0,"As far as copyright law goes, the first question is going to be whether or not the data was subject to copyright. In the US, the most important case on data copyright is FEIST PUBLICATIONS, INC. v. RURAL TELEPHONE SERVICE CO., 499 U.S. 340 (1991). [Wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural).

The gist of Feist is that there must be some spark of creativity in a work in order for it to be eligible for copyright--it is not enough that it merely took a lot of work to put together. The data involved in Feist was the listings in a telephone directory. Simply making an alphabetical list of everyone who subscribes to a particular phone service did not have the necessary spark of creativity, according to the Supreme Court, and so was not subject to copyright.

For a collection of facts, like a telephone book, to be creative enough to be subject to copyright there had to be some creative aspect, such is in how to chose who to include or exclude, or in how to present the data. The underlying data would still not be subject to copyright, but the collection might be if the selection was creative enough or the presentation was creative enough.

I suspect that a lot of datasets used in machine learning will be safe under the Feist rule, especially comprehensive datasets. For instance, a dataset of all airline flight times in the US for the last decade, or a dataset of all closing prices of the NYSE for the last 5 years, or the final scores of the all regular season NBA games for the last 7 years, would be hard to argue do not fall under the Feist rule.

Where it would get trickier would be with datasets that aren't comprehensive. I don't know if there has been much guidance in the courts as to what kind of selection criteria is sufficiently creative to get away from Feist.

Let's assume that the dataset in question IS subject to copyright. Then the question arises as to what was copied when the data was used to train a model. This is important because under Feist the data itself (assuming it consists of facts) is not copyrightable--no matter what a data collector does when it comes to choosing and presenting data on, say stock closing prices, the price of IBM at closing on November 30, 2012 is not subject to copyright. If you copy that fact from them and use it, they cannot sue you over the copyright on the fact since there is no such copyright.

If the model isn't learning anything from the copyrightable aspects of the collection, then it is hard to see how the model could be either a copy or derivative work of the copyrightable aspects of the data. For instance, suppose there is a dataset of stock data. Suppose the choice of what stocks to include and which to exclude was sufficiently creative to allow the collection to be copyrighted. Now someone uses this data to train a model that is trying to model how trading volume changes in reaction to breaking political scandals, and so all that is being taken are the stock names, the dates, and the volumes. If the criteria that was used to select which stocks go in the dataset had nothing to do with trading volume, then there is a decent chance that the model has not used any of the copyrightable parts of the dataset.

The above is theory--now let's switch and talk practical matters. Unless it is a very clear cut case (like doing machine learning on the white pages of a phone book, so that it clearly falls square under the Feist rules), it is best to work out these issues beforehand with the source of the dataset. Even if you are pretty sure you are in the clear using the data, if the source disagrees and it goes to court, you are not going to have a happy time even if you ultimately prevail in court.

OK, back to theory. So let's suppose now that some aspects of the dataset are covered by copyright, and your model ends up using those aspects in such a way that it would be considered to have copied them from the dataset, or to be a derivative work of the copyrighted portions of the dataset. The answer then to the question ""Can the 'owner' of the data claim ownership of the model?"" is no. When you infringe someone's copyright they do not become the owner of the infringing work. They simply have the legal right to force you to stop distributing the infringing work, and to collect monetary damages in an amount determined by the court. So, for instance, if you develop a revolutionary and commercially valuable model from someone's dataset, and they sue you and win, you'll have to stop using that model and give them profits you made from it--but they don't get your work. If you could find similar data somewhere else not covered by copyright (or from a source that you can come to terms with), you could retrain your model with that data, and you'd be back in business.

Another interesting question, assuming that all the data you use is public domain so we don't have to worry about any data copyright issues, is do YOU own the model that results from training? For instance, suppose you train a neural network. The final model consists of the architecture of the network, plus the learned weights of the connections. You certainly own the implementation of any code you wrote to do the training. I'm not sure whether or not the architecture of a neural net would be subject to copyright, but if it is you would be the owner. If the model had not been learned, but rather you had hand picked all the weights, I could see an argument that you could copyright that set of weights. However, when the weights are learned by running a learning algorithm on data, it is unlikely that they can be copyrighted. You didn't ""author"" the weights--the program did, and a program cannot hold a copyright.

I expect that if it is decided that the results of machine learning algorithms need some kind of legal protection, we'll have to specifically legislate it similar to the way integrated circuit layouts were protected by the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, which introduced a copyright-like protection for chip layouts.

The above is for US law. In Europe, I believe that are specific laws for protection of databases which you might have to worry about.",1354397602,,False,MachineLearning,t5_2r3gv,t3_13zvxe,harlows_monkeys,,t1_c79qhgu,1430552005,0,2,0,c79qhgu,False,,t3_13zvxe,2,

If you go to http://www.stateoftheusa.org/content/diabetes-on-the-rise.php you can see the rise since about 1980, roughly tripled between 1980 and 2010 for anyone who's too lazy to click the link.
More indicative, if you go all the way back to the early 1920s (when treatment by insulin produced by other means began) the rise in cases of diabetes is even more exponential. Little known interesting fact; insulin was originally attained from the pancreas of pigs. The body doesn't like foreign molecules like this, and there were ""allergic"" reactions, but for the vast majority of people, this was life saving. As the number of cases rose, it became apparent that we wouldn't be able to continue raising more and more pigs for this purpose. The estimation was that around the mid 1980s, we would have to start rationing insulin (horrible for those that have the disease, but the trend of growth would've stopped there and become stable most likely). Luckily, this is about the time when we discovered Bioprocessing through recombinant DNA. Now, instead of pig pancreases, we just have E. Coli produce insulin for diabetics (in the US anyway, I think Europe has a different main process).
However, since we know how the manage it, diabetes isn't the life destroying disease it used to be, just something to be aware of. If you had a close personal friend who had diabetes and never told you, you would never know. These individuals aren't any weaker than the rest of us, they just have to be conscious of their diets more. So, to answer the question, the frequency of genetic diseases will rise quickly after they are effectively ""cured"", but we won't deteriorate into a race of weak humans, because the curing of the diseases will curb the damage to quality of life that we associate with those diseases today.",1354398681,,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,t3_143qhd,rockchalk411,,t1_c79qq8h,1430552120,0,2,0,c79qq8h,False,,t3_143qhd,2,

True,0,"&gt;This sounds like the exact opposite, and an argument against private property. These farmers took private property owned by the Chinese government and decided to treat it as possessive property.

I do not view private property being owned by the government as private property, along with most of the world. Property owned by the government is public property.

In regards to resource pool economies, I addressed this a bit later with what happens when everyone receives the full benefits of his/her labor.

&gt;Poverty is ""deprivation of food, shelter, money and clothing that occurs when people cannot satisfy their basic needs.""

This may be the wikipedia definition, but the poverty line in America that most people use as an indicator of such is nowhere near true poverty.

&gt;And it makes sense. Baring those where human intervention or some other form of external intervention has altered ecology, animals mostly live in sustainable communities. Considering that they evolved to fit their environments, I am not surprised.

There are really no true free market societies today, but there are some historical examples. I have not seen cases of rampant starvation except in primitive government-run countries in Africa, and communist government-run economies in China and the USSR. I don't really see people starving in America or Europe, except for the occasional homeless man, who I feel would be much better off if there was no minimum wage preventing him from obtaining a job.

&gt;Private property is property (whether that be land, resources, commodities, the means to produce, intellectual property, what have you...) used by one person and owned by another.

Not sure where you heard this definition. I have never heard it before. That is called being a tenant in a piece of property. What you define as possessive property is the equivalent of private property; it's just that your definition of private property is someone's possessive property rented out to another person.

&gt;Naturally it is difficult to have industrial wealth without an industrial society. Perhaps it would be more fair to look at actual instances of industrial anarchism: The RFM in Argentina, or the CNT-FAI in Spain, where, in both cases, productivity and wealth increased following the transition to anarchism.

To be honest, I'm not surprised that material conditions increase following the abolition of government, as you can probably tell from my flair. That's not to say that they would not be better off with a capitalist economy. I'm having trouble finding information on the Argentinian community, but I find it hard to attribute any actual gain in Spain at the time to that group, considering Spain never really was truly anarchistic, unless you could find a better article than I can.",1354399508,,False,DebateaCommunist,t5_2t9dp,t3_13wx0e,topgunsarg,ancap,t1_c79qwv9,1430552207,0,1,0,c79qwv9,False,,t1_c79qkte,1,

'Scottishness' arose earlier than in most European nations because of English occupation. The church in Scotland didn't answer to an Arch-Bishop, rather, they simply went straight to the Pope- a situation that suited them nicely and was jeapordised by English invasion. The Bruces wanted the throne but had little support outside of their own lands. To help build support for the struggle at home and abroad they had to emphasise their differences from the English. They were fairly successful in this, eventually, getting Papal recognition of Scottish difference and independence and managing to get the entirety of the nobility behind the independence movement. In correspondence between Scottish rebels (Wishart, Bruce, Wallace and all that) and trading partners, France, and the Vatican they often use terms like ""the Scottish people"", the ""free people of Scotland"", and another term which is brilliant but I cannot place... something like ""unity of the Kingdom"" or ""people of the realm"", I'll double check when I get home. The end result of all this PR work and social engineering was that there a distinct sense of ""Scottishness"" that was lacking in other European nations of the time. The final part of this was making the nobility choose between their foreign holdings and their holdings in Scotland- they stopped being part of the transient nobility with holdings across Europe and started being *Scottish* nobles.

True,0,"&gt;I think that European system is more convenient for the consumer

The European system is much more convenient for almost *everyone*. The US system (if one can call it that) is based on the revenue needs of a particular state, county or city.

The sales tax in CA varies from 7.25% to 9.75% depending on where you are and what you are buying in that location. In New Mexico it varies from 5.125% to 8.5625%. In Illinois it varies from 6.25% to 11.5%. 

One great (or crazy, depending on your point of view) example is Colorado, it gives you an idea *why* there are so many different tax rates on products sold:

&gt;*Colorado's state sales tax is 2.9% with some cities and counties levying additional taxes. Denver's tangibles tax is 3.62%, with food eaten away from the home being taxed at 4%, most unprepared food (groceries) are exempt. There is also a football stadium tax, mass transit tax, and scientific and cultural facilities tax. The total sales tax varies by city and county. Total sales tax on an item purchased in Falcon, Colorado, would be 4.9% (2.9% state, 1% county, and 1% RTA). The sales tax rate in Larimer County is roughly 7.5%. Most transactions in Denver and the surrounding area are taxed at a total of about 8%. The sales tax rate for non food items in Denver is 7.62%. Food &amp; Beverage items total 8.00%, and Rental Cars total 11.25%.*

Massachusetts taxes clothing purchases over $175, and New York taxes clothing purchases over $110. This is intended to keep poorer people from having to pay taxes on a necessity like clothing.

the lower limits of publicly reported amounts all above 600 billion.  *however, audits revealed trading activity in the 16-17 trillion dollar range.*

&gt; The trillions of dollars the fed pumps into the economy is done via asset exchange. That is, the fed buys bonds on the free market, replacing assets in bank's books to cash, causing the bank to lower interest rates to offload the cash. This is then magnified as they lend it out and multiplied as it's invested back in other banks. This has the effect of devaluing currency but at the same time providing low interest loans to small businesses and other borrowers.

I would tell anyone I meet here to go visit India atleast once in their life. You'll develop an appreciation of how great and how horrible the world can be at the same time.

Visit the Taj Mahal; Visit Kashmir, one of the most beautiful places on the planet (I do not say this lightly - I've traveled to a lot of the US National parks and several European countries and only very few places come close to the sheer beauty of Kashmir); Visit Goa, enjoy the finest sea food and some great parties; Visit Rajasthan for some fantastic palaces and architecture. Visit south of India, my home. The temples here have the most stunning and intricate architecture you can lay your eyes on. (As an aside, did you know that the Angkor Wat was a hindu temple? We take religion very seriously, maybe too seriously for some). You'd be amazed at how far a dollar can get you. The moment it truly hit me was when I found out that the unemployment cheques in the US fetch you ~700$ a month. That is the average wage of a software developer in India.

But also visit Mumbai, take the local train during rush hour. See how horrible the public transit system is and how absurd it is that people still accept it mutely. Look at the highrises, multiplexes, the malls; Watch the noveau richè scutter past the slums seemingly apathetic to the fact that they're probably walking past a child dying of malnutrition right at that moment. Get heckled by cops for bribes and by kids deseprately trying to rip you off by selling you something. But also learn to give the cop a break because he probably doesn't make more than 100$ a month if he lives by the book. Learn how you need to bargain for absolutely everything. Learn about the number of terrorist attacks that happen every year and the apathy of the people in power. 

And then you can come back to your cushy white collar job, centrally air conditioned houses and complain about the weather. Only, you don't any more.

Let's take 2004 for example where the US was the world's leading donor as far as dollar amount is concerned at $12 Billion. The United Kingdom was at $4.8 Billion for foreign aid. You're claim is absolutely false that the US is the smallest donor when it comes to the overall amount donated. Now, if you were to compare that to the EU just Germany, France, and the UK will overcome the US at 14 Billion. However, the EU as a whole actually produces a larger GDP than the US: 17 Trillion versus 15 Trillion. Now, I will agree that if it's about giving according to GDP the US is clearly behind.

Having a few coins was convenient, but having a pocket full of one and two Euro coins was uncomfortable and annoying.

Also its easier for me to take my wallet out then to dig into my pockets to take out coins. I was very happy to get back to the states and use one dollar bills. Having the coins was cool at first, but the novelty wore off after awhile. What i did like about the Euro was the size of the different notes and the different colors, although sometimes the 20 Euro bills were mistakes as 5 Euro bills due to their color by cashiers who aren't paying enough attention, which was always awkward when I had to tell them they skimped on 15 Euros of my change.
