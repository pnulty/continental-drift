t5_2cneq,1362096471,"&gt;To all those highly talented bankers in Europe, let me be the first to welcome you to the United States, Singapore, Canada, Hong Kong, or wherever you decide to move.

They won't move. They'll probably go to hedge funds. Which is fine. That's the whole point of this exercise.  For the last few years, banks profits have been pumped up by a very small amount of employees in their trading departments working with complex financial instruments, and motivated by giant bonuses, while the other thousands of workers working in normal banking areas missed out. This was one of the main causes of the financial crisis. Capping bonuses will mean several things:

1. If the investment people go to hedge funds, banks will need to make money from traditional areas - mortgages, business and personal loans, financing etc. This means pumping money into the real economy, and making use of the majority of the workers not involved in high risk instruments.  

2. If they want to keep their traders with bonuses, then they'll need to separate the investment and retail parts of the bank, something which was previously the case. 

3. They could also focus more on longer term incentives, rather than reward short term, high risk activities. 

  
The basic premise is to remove the rewards for excessive risk taking behavior on commercial and retail banking, thus separating the high risk financial sector from the banking sector servicing the real economy.

A decent team isn't enough to keep an AD safe vs certain comps/champions

Mid lane jarvan is a good example. With a E+Q+Passive+R+Ignite combo he can kill any AD carry in that combo and nothing more until they build a warmogs. They won't even have time to flash, and the only thing that stops it is either

1. Avoiding Jarvan completely so he can't chain is combo together, which is hard but not impossible due to his incredible mobility

2. Someone throwing exhaust on Jarvan mid flight

So, an AD needs to get an IE+PD+LW+Warmogs before they'd be ""ok"" against Jarvan, unless it's vayne, kog and trist they would not be able to 1 on 1 him at this point

It will take a good 35-40 minutes for an AD to reach these items, now my issue with this is that most games are simply already decided at this point

AD's have 2 strong points that is hard to replace

1. They have superior tower sieging/pushing, it's really hard to push down turrets vs certain champions as melee

2. They are superior in taking down baron/dragons since they are allowed to put on that constant DPS over a long time where they truly shine

The best examples of AD's struggling was CLG.EU vs WE (or was it Azubu?)

Yellowpete had late game kog'maw, he didn't have 6 items but he was fairly close, the enemy team had a fat Olaf.

Olaf didn't have a single offensive item, he ran in and 1 vs 2 Kog+Support and popped Kog's guardian angel before dying.

Traditionally, 

Labour are the working mans party, funded by the unions, pioneered the welfare state, care about the working man and maintaining his livelihood.

Tories are the old boys club, focus on what I suppose is known as trickle down economics or, if the rich are doing well, we are all doing well.

Lib Dems, well liberal means allowing a man to be the master of his own fate essentially. As long as you don't hurt anyone else crack on with it. For this reason they are generally more popular with youth (scoff) 

Reality

Labour - Power hungry individuals formed together to run a country the way they want to; under the guise of being the working mans party but generally ignoring this whilst in power. In my opinion the lesser of the evils but just because she's wearing pretty make up doesn't mean she's not going to fuck you. 

Tories - Power hungry individuals formed together to run a country the way that their dad is telling them to; under the guise of understanding the way the country works because of all of their heritage. They really don't care about helping out the little guy it's all about pumping money into the pockets of their old school friends. Slick, well polished snake oil salesmen who don't care about you or your opinion. They are the worst of the three

Lib Dems - Never, been in power, never really expecting to be in power often perceived as a wasted vote and have well and truly shot themselves in the foot by pissing off student voters. Having said that this is the place where you will find well meaning politicians who genuinely believe in what they say. Vince Cable really knows his stuff and is an asset to them. They were forced into a hike in tuition fees in exchange for the AV referendum which the Tories then fucked them on by lying about the way it worked to the general populous. 

In truth they are all probably as bad as each other, I vote for whoever I have to in order to keep the Tories out. It's a slimy mess best summed up by [this](http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=e2HQaF_vfes&amp;amp;amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3De2HQaF_vfes)

No. Was he important to Liverpool? absolutely. When those three left, Liverpool were shit. Yes Madrid and Barca were big clubs, but at the time Liverpool was a massive club as well, so aside from Rafa being a prick there was no real reason to move to the other clubs. 

He won the Super cup and Club World Cup, as any Italian will tell you, two completely useless and meaningless trophies. The club world cup required little or no effort to win. If he was a good manager, he would make do without Milito. Again, when you inherent such a strong squad, how do you screw it up so bad? This Inter team beat the invincible Barcelona. The continued struggles of both clubs just show how detrimental he was to both! Compare the legacy of Mourinho at Porto and Chelsea or Guardiola and Barca!

We were playing fine at the beginning of the year. With the exception of a few losses, the United loss was the result of twatenburg NOT a failure on the part of our team, Juve are a good side full stop, and Falcao is a beast not much you can do. I wouldn't say we were well on our way out, we just really underestimated Shakhtar and Juve. Not to mention had to put up with the twattenburg affair, JT racial allegations, and Roman never giving Robbie the full backing he deserved. 

At least we played with passion and purpose. We may have let a few goals slide, but no matter the score you always had the feeling we would catch up and at LEAST fight back.  If we had RDM, we would still have a manager who could inspire the players, something that Rafa is completely incapable of doing. For crying out loud Yossi said it in his interview before coming here that Rafa is a rubbish manager for building confidence. 

It is no coincidence now that our players have no confidence, no cohesion and play like shit since Rafa took over. Every single one of our most promising players have looked like shit since Rafa took over from RDM. Oscar, Hazard, Ba (from newcastle), Cahill, Luiz even Moses isn't as good as he was. He has weakened us offensively, and has done nothing to solidify the back. Yes each of those players show glimpses of their quality, but god damn, under RDM Hazmatar was unstoppable. Even bloody Torres was scoring more. 

We have been in transition for years now. In 2009 everyone said we were too old and wouldn't go anywhere, Hiddink changed that in a shorter time than Rafa had. Last year everyone said we were shit and wouldn't make it passed the group stages of CL, RDM changed that again in a shorter time than Rafa had. This year we have the most promising talent in Europe, the most promising player in Brazil after bloody Neymar, and no injuries. Rafa is completely cocking it up.

No, I hate the Islamic religion. I don't hate the people who adhere to the religion, unless they are violent/hate-filled/etc. Unfortunately, the Quran is a violent, hate-filled book, so it causes many muslims to be violent and hate-filled. I think this is very unfortunate. Still, I do not hate muslims. I hate their religion.

Every citizen in Greenland can for all purposes be considered a citizen of Denmark aswell - that adds a whole 5.4 million people to interact with. Every Greenlander is taught Danish and English in schools; most are fluent in both languages, and some even speak Danish as a first language. They are not more isolated than people are in places like Alaska, Yukon, or any other arctic community. They can choose to relocate to anywhere within the Kingdom of Denmark, and by extent, the European Union. They don't have to be in one place, doing nothing, only talking to people they already know. I do agree, however, that the young people of Greenland have very little to do within their community due to the harsh conditions and low population density, but I really don't think that that is why so many young folks get the idea that suicide would be easier. Greenland isn't much more isolated that some towns in Europe, Asia, or even within the US. If people are brought up in small communities, they will have often have other priorities and values than you and me (I presume you are a city child, like me) and will be happy right where they are.

I don't have an answer as to why so many Greenlanders decide to commit suicide, it's a bit of a mystery, but spikes in suicide counts within other countries have been observed before. The article speaks of how impressionable young people are, and of how even such a thing as suicide can become ""fashionable"". It's a romantic idea of death that fuels it, and in such a small community, something like that it spreads faster I'd wager. Your friend commits suicide and suddenly it doesn't seem so 'out of reach' anymore, and becomes a seemingly viable solution to all of your insecurities and troubles. Suddenly it becomes something that you can do. If your friend did it, why shouldn't you be able to?

t5_2qh2p,1362109815,"Are you sure that's you point? Because as I said, you chose some fucking horrendous examples. Let's, again, take the agriculture one, and lets look at how moronic that is:

Your claim is that the catholic church funded agricultural reform allowing urban society to form and allowing subsistance farming populations to move into cities. This is patently ridiculous. The rest of the planet had been doing this for centuries. Millennia, even. Hell, Sumeria had been doing it for longer than the Catholic church believed the planet to have existed for. They marginally improved on Roman agricultural practices.

Now lets look at that ""funded"" bit, again. You're intentionally portraying this as if it were done in charity. Like the Church just paid farmers to try out these fancy new ideas. Which again, is ridiculous. The Church didn't even do this. It wasn't part of the Papacy's operations. Some factions of the church owned metric fuck tones of land in various european nations. Just obscene amounts of land. And with that land came serfs. Low paid, hard-worked and heavily-taxed people who were quite literally owned by their liege.

So your entire damn argument on this point is that the Catholic Church was the fucking bees knees because in the middle ages they worked thousands upon thousands of pressed labour on meagre wages to make the church as much fucking money as possible. They were slavers, working the poor for profit to accomplish exactly what the Romans had accomplished centuries prior.

I definitely see the point you're making about the will of the people expressed as a referendum, and I agree that the idea that the citizens would fund their own destruction through their tax money is quite ridiculous.  Unfortunately, I'm not as familiar with the Cataluña issue as I am with the Basque secessionist issue. 

I'm going to disagree with you about the military being a valued institution, though. I've lived in Spain, and I have half my family that lives there, some of which are active LEO/Military. Obviously, there are segments of the population that will support the military because it is a symbol of the ""enduring order"", but I don't think that there's widespread hero worship or anything like that, that can be seen in countries like the US. I don't think the spanish military would be able to get away with the kind of things that some segments of the US military do. 

Also, I think to generalize and say that the whole military as an institution is in support of violent intervention is a pretty bold claim. Look at the '82 coup. Certainly, part of the military was active in attempting to depose the new democracy. But, due to the intervention of the king (which, to be fair, has been brought into question), and the support of other segments of the military, the coup failed. In any situation where you have the military taking action against the populace, there will always be dissent. There's plenty of historical examples. But, this is just my opinion, and like I said earlier, I'm not as familiar with the topic as I am with the Basque topic. 

I think that it should be up to the people, personally, and I don't think that the broader spanish population would support military intervention. I think it would start a second civil war.

&gt; A new poll by the Pew Global Attitudes Project shows that a growing number of Europeans think the currency union has not been good for their countries and are more skeptical of the European Central Bank.
&gt;
&gt; Majorities in five countries now believe that the economic integration of Europe has weakened their national economies. Seventy percent of Greeks, 63 percent of French, 61 percent of Italians and 61 percent of British citizens believe that economic integration has hurt them.
&gt;
&gt; Germany, the country with the EU’s largest economy, stands in stark contrast with 59 percent saying that economic integration has helped their country.
&gt;
&gt; Most European countries have seen huge declines since 2009 in the number of people who believe EU membership has been a good thing.
&gt;
&gt; Only Spain and Germany have majorities who still think EU membership is a good thing, with 54 percent and 65 percent, respectively.

I agree that for a variety of complex historical reasons, Scotland can be allocated the prized 'country' label. 

Unfortunately, not many people are as educated in the historical and legal arena and so that will not play a big part in their decision come 2014. 

My problem is this. For all intents and purposes, Scotland is a region, or state, or province. Your argument lays out the reasons why Scotland is in fact, much more than that, but in the practical sense (national powers, governance, democracy, resources) Scotland is really just a region. 

A Yes vote in 2014 will allow Scotland to 'graduate' from region to country. (Technically 'constituent country' to 'nation state') and this is why I support it.

The UK establishment however tries to confuse the matter by suggesting that Scotland will actually be 'demoted' from country to EU state. This is where the bastards seem to get one over upon so many Scots that are for lack of a better word 'simple'. 

By the average Joe not having the basic knowledge that Scotland is in fact a 'region' of the UK and not a 'Country' of the world then Joe will vote without a true understanding of what we are actually trying to achieve here (Nation State status).

I think that all YES campaigners should push the idea that Scotland really is just a 'region' (I've already stated that this is my view) and that by becoming a nation state, we will have truly earned the name 'Country'. Otherwise we will forever be an anomaly in the world, where Scotland is *seen* as a country, but in reality we still have less power than Florida does.

Or NATO is the biggest military in the world … but activities in Libya and Mali (where the USA only helps a little bit) shows that's not the case.

Greece and Turkey are both in a mutual defense alliance called NATO and they have killed each others' military men in recent years.

Meanwhile China is a huge country with a bunch of people but they don't all speak the same language.

t5_2rbnb,1362120860,"&gt;So since Beckham came from Real and Henry from Barca that means MLS is better than La Liga? Obviously not, players leave for many different reasons. 

Come on you know that is a useless analogy.  Beckham and Henry were not good enough for La Liga, so they cashed in on some endorsement opportunities and the chance to play in a low pressure league in semi-retirement.  

Let me be a little more concrete:

Rolfe was offered significantly more money than MLS could pay him from a number of crappy teams in crappy leagues in Europe.  He ended up in Denmark, where he couldn't cut it in the Denmark league.  So he comes back to MLS to be a top player once again.

Wilmond Conde was an MLS Best XI so he left for 200% pay to Mexico.  Couldn't cut it there, and has ended up back in MLS once again.

Segares left for Cyprus and made 180% more than MLS offered.  He almost never even saw the field.  He's back playing every game for the Fire.

Soumare was sold for millions of dollars to a Ligue 2 team, where he played for a few years before they loaned him to a German 2nd division team.  He couldn't cut it there either so he's back in MLS.

&gt;We are miles ahead of Cyprus.

The IFFHS (not that their rankings are in any way definitive) thinks Cyprus is miles ahead of MLS:

http://www.iffhs.de/?b6e28fa3002f71504e52d17f7370eff3702bb1c2bb11

And while 1 guy doesn't prove anything, Segares was basically the best LB in MLS when he went over there, and he 1) went to one of the crappier teams in the Cyprus league and 2) he hardly ever made the roster.  If he was going to a weaker league, like the USL, he'd have been tearing it up, not sitting in the stands.

Lycanthropy was more prevalent in Europe, though there are threads that can be traced through Slavic countries down to the Mediterranean (it is a Greek word, after all), and all the way up to the Steppes and the Lappland shamans. As you follow it back chronologically, the underlying theme of the procession of the dead becomes more and more prominent, and some scholars argue that it is prehistoric, likely arising from the Neolithic era.

So it is quite possible that the ideas made it up there, particularly considering the arrival of the proto-Indo-Europeans around 3000BC (I think...can't recall the precise period), whose religious rites (rather, the traces of those we know about) suggest a shamanic basis. Going further back, this therianthropic motif has been suggested in interpretations of Paleolithic cave paintings, like Lascaux.

  Having handled a variety of mid spectrum replicas of both European and Japanese swords, there is a lot to be said for each. What I have found is that European swords tend to be a bit tougher (Through-hardened European swords vs. Differentially-hardened Japanese swords), but also tend towards being a bit heavier. Also, low-grade European sword replicas can tend towards being a bit ""Whippy"". Low grade replicas: Not even once.
  Regardless, I agree with you about medieval european swords being underrated. Hand-and-a-half swords are more fun than any large, dangerous piece of double-edged steel has any right to be. The one I am most familiar with, the Hanwei...I-forget-the-actual-name-Bastard-Sword, is actually closer in blade- and hilt-length to a Two-hander, but still.

t5_2r4v8,1362124880,"Austria has been influenced by many cultures that surrounded it. After all it was a big empire until about a hundred years ago. Now it is a small country with no political influence whatsoever. But still, I feel that Vienna is not clearly Eastern or Western Europe, but in between. Austrians have a special sense of irony, they are (like Waltz stated) less straightforward than Germans. I think it is a result of influence byJewish and Slavic culture.
You can see it in the language as well. We have several (very different) German dialects which are heavily influenced by Slavic languages (although many Austrians don`t know about this or won`t admit it ;-) Also the dishes. We say ¨Palatschinken¨ (pancakes) whereas the Germans say ¨Pfannkuchen¨. Palatschinken can be found in other Slavic languages whereas Pfannkuchen is clearly a German word.
Especially Vienna was very multicultural before WWII. A lot of Czechs, Polish people, Jews etc. etc. lived here and influenced the culture. Especially Jews played a major role in culture, arts, science (take Freud for example). The Holocaust caused wounds that are still present. 
For the past and WWII, I think that Austria plays a unique role. Austria wasn`t occupied by the Nazis (like the Austrians wanted to make the world believe afterwards) but it collaborated with the Nazis and cheered to them as they marched in. Working on this past still continues until today. The Austrian Nazis didn`t just dissappear after the war. Of course, the really bad ones were executed, but there were enough left. I think every Austrian could tell you about at least one family member who was a Nazi (although this is a hard thing to talk about).
Take the movies for example. You maybe know the movies about Empress Sisi. It was made at a time at which people simply wanted to forget WWII and display Austria as a kind of beautiful fairy tale country. Many movies of this kind were made after the war. 

A thing I love about Vienna is that is still becoming more and more multicultural (Turks, former Yugoslavians, Polish, Germans .....). My parents are also not from Austria. There are of course people who don`t like this. But they can`t deny that Vienna was and alwys will be multicultural.
Austrians are a little conservative sometimes.

t5_2ryq7,1362125722,"I downvoted you for these particular reasons:

1.) Your views on the playoff system, which you approached critically and ended up generalizing you point - to which end you insulted myself and presumably others - contributed little to the conversation as your focus was not on the system itself but a general distaste towards not only the structure of sports in the US but also the culture in general.

2.) The mobility of teams in europe is not indicative of the teams in the United States, the focus is on individual players (such as farm teams in baseball, collegiate athletes, ect); thus, we have established a playoff system. I'm not saying it is good or bad in anyway, but the links between a teams mobility and a playoff system are there. America: the cream rises to the top, and the best individuals play at the highest levels of competition.
Europe: the collective cream rises to the top, and while individuals with a high level of skill may be picked from a global talent pool, the focus is on the team.
These perspectives are integral into fandom as well as money to be earned by the owners of the club.
Population density plays an important role in this, football clubs are generally located in highly populated areas with smaller football clubs acting as even more local subsets... given the amount of land these dense populations occupy, it is fairly logical that they overlap with one another(just look at all the clubs in all the Burroughs of London). It is quite different in the United States given that teams are located in valuable economic markets which is correlated by the population density of the region; however, it is not determined by the density. Even teams whose names overlap are not located in the same area but instead speak to a relative (non-cartographic) location. It is rare to have two teams fan-bases intersect on central and non peripheral locations (excluding a few outliers.)

As Western European winter weather is mostly dependent on weather formation over the northern Atlantic, it is unlikely that vegetation destruction in France would have more than a local effect. The effects of extreme weather are often magnified during wartime. 

For example, on 19 June 1944 the worst storm in nearly 40 years unexpectedly lashed Normandy.

Allied shipping between England and Normandy suffered heavy losses. About 800 ships of all sizes were beached or lost. The mobile Mulberry harbour at Omaha beach was totally destroyed and never replaced. The British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was damaged, but not lost.

The storm continued for three full days. Few men or supplies could be landed in the invasion area during this period, and the 'Great Storm' in three days destroyed more vessels than the German army managed to take out during the entire campaign. The losses in material amounted to more than 140,000 tons and seriously interfered with the planned buildup of the Allied military strength in Normandy. 

The winter of 1944 was early and and especially harsh in Western Europe, influencing the Battle of the Bulge (where bad weather often kept the allied air forces grounded). In the Netherlands, the combination of a railway strike, German occupation policies and the terrible winter weather lead to the [Hunger Winter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_famine_of_1944), causing over 22,000 deaths.

I mean all exploration and discovery is bullshit if you want to take the point of view of original settlement. The Bugis didn't discover Australia, the Aborigines did. The Vikings didn't discover America, the Native Americans did.

But exploration and discovery is a valid point of view from the perspective of the culture doing the exploring.

So there is a European Age of Discovery: when the Europeans first drew maps showing distant lands they never knew of before.

In the same way we can talk about a Viking age of discovery and a Bugis age of discovery.

t5_2ssp3,1362132879,"The usual narrative for the region doesn't involve exploration or discovery, just trade:  
&gt; Beginning in the sixteenth century, [Makassar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujung_Pandang#History) was the dominant trading center of eastern Indonesia, and soon became one of the largest cities in island Southeast Asia. The Makassarese kings maintained a policy of free trade, insisting on the right of any visitor to do business in the city, and rejecting the attempts of the Dutch to establish a monopoly over the city.    
  
  
Exploration and discovery for the Dutch, sure, but for the locals:  
&gt; The first European settlers were the Portuguese sailors. When the Portuguese reached Sulawesi in 1511, they found Makassar a thriving cosmopolitan entre-port where Chinese, Arabs, Indians, Siamese, Javanese, and Malays came to trade their manufactured metal goods and fine textiles for precious pearls, gold, copper, camphor and spices - nutmeg, cloves and mace imported from the interior and the neighbouring Spice Islands of Maluku.   
  
I have no knowledge of what drove the local area trade culture into high gear a hundred years or so earlier, I strongly suspect that it wasn't connected to a sudden exploration and discovery of other cultures in the region, I would guess it had to do with a cultural shift towards doing business. It bears looking into and doesn't necessarily involve fresh discovery.   
  
As for Australia,  
&gt; [Makassan trepangers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macassan_contact_with_Australia) from the southwest corner of Sulawesi (formerly Celebes) visited the coast of northern Australia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to collect and process trepang (also known as sea cucumber), a marine invertebrate prized for its culinary and medicinal values in Chinese markets. The term Makassan (or Macassan) is generally used to apply to all the trepangers who came to Australia, although some were from other islands in the Indonesian Archipelago, including Timor, Rote and Aru.   
  
I read that as Northern Australian trade expanded to include Makassan trepangers who came to get more trepang for growing Chinese markets.   
  
It was a time of trade volume expansion for the people of Sulawesi, yes. Did they explore and discover islands and people that they previously had *no* knowledge of? Kind of sort of seems unlikely - it's an easy area to sail about in.   
  
EDIT: For what it's worth I'm in the camp that believes in probable Makassan (and other regional fishing cultures) contact with Northern Australian in the mid-1600s and probably even earlier going back many many years.

Moreover, the most premature babies — those with the highest likelihood of dying — are the least likely to be recorded in infant and neonatal mortality statistics in other countries. Compounding that difficulty, in other countries the underreporting is greatest for deaths that occur very soon after birth. Since the earliest deaths make up 75 percent of all neonatal deaths, underreporting by other countries — often misclassifying what were really live births as fetal demise (stillbirths) — would falsely exclude most neonatal deaths. Any assumption that the practice of underreporting is confined to less-developed nations is incorrect. In fact, a number of published peer-reviewed studies show that underreporting of early neonatal deaths has varied between 10 percent and 30 percent in highly developed Western European and Asian countries.""

There's Montjuïc and the Olympic stadium and swimming pool, take the cable car from there down to the old port and Barceloneta, a great place to get good paella and seafood.

You wonder why atheists do not see historical accuracies in the bible as proof that the claims made in the bible are true. So, please answer to yourself the following questions:

Everyone knows of World War 2. Not a nation was left untouched in some way. So, if WW2 existed does that mean you believe there was a ragtag group of American soldiers who went to Europe to scalp 'Nazis', one of which was a 7 foot Jew who used a baseball bat, because that's what Inglorious Basterds claims?

Furthermore, if everyone knows WW2 existed do you believe that there was once a Major in the American forces called Major Major Major Major who only achieved the rank of Major because the higher-up (Company Commander?) disliked disorder and so had Private Major Major Major promoted immediately, as is claimed by Catch 22?

And finally I think we can agree that WW2 existed, and some would say that the arc of the covenant is likely to be found somewhere in Africa (if it ever truly existed) so do you believe that a box was opened which melted the faces off several 'Nazis' as claimed in the Indiana Jones series?

This final question is the most important.

They are very bad with viewing angle stability though, meaning if you are not optimally in front of the monitor colours will shift. Not cool.

IPS panels have very good viewing stability. That's it.

VA panels are between TN and IPS for viewing angles, but are very good static contrast, which helps a lot with nice black and white points. 

Now most consumer monitors at 200 and below are cheap TN stuff. Bad factory calibrations, bad stands, bad contrast, bad overall quality. Most professional grades ones are way more expensive, mostly using IPS panels with a lot better quality, higher resolution and very usable factory calibration. They also have an extended colour space, mostly useful for print graphics designer and the real world colour stuff for products, CI etc. Those top ones are somewhere in the 1000USD range easily.

Now you want cheap and good. Hah. The closest you can get are for example the Dell U2412HM or the very low priced Ben GW2450HM (former is IPS, latter VA). The Benq has a very nice panel in a cheap body, the Dell is overall a good quality choice.

While it's a bit tricky to measure for inflation accurately as far back as the 1980's in Europe because of the Euro, you can use the UK or Sweden as a frame of reference. If we assume - and I know it's a flawed assumption, but it should give us a ballpark figure - that the Euro follows the same inflation curve as the pound, then we can just check how much 60 pounds in 1990 is worth today to see what a game ""should"" cost today if it cost 60 euro in 1990. For reference, it fits rather well with the Swedish krona.

Anyway, 60 pounds in 1990 would be about 120 pounds today. So given my assumptions, if games had followed the inflation since 1990, you'd be paying about 120 euros for them today.

Making a snow fort/igloo/godzilla/cathedral is one of life's simple pleasures. 

I spent a lot of time living in London, 5 snow-deprived years. I'd lost all hope. Being an Australian I don't get many chances to build shit out of snow. I thought I was destined to live my life iglooless. 

This is reddit, so I'll indulge in a story. 

Wifey and I had packed up, ready to start the journey back home to the land that stereotypically knows no snow (with the exception of the numerous snowfields). 

It was the winter of 2010, my last European winter, that they finally delivered. T'was early Febuary, the season of depression had well and truly set in. January had passed, drinks were no longer half price in the 'trendy' inner-city bars. There wasn't much to do, except get drunk and wait for Autumn (a.k.a. Fall). One morning we were woken by a frenzied phone call from a teacher colleague of my wife, ""School has been cancelled! Let's hang out"". 

""Oh yeah, let's go and do something girly and not of any interest to any man ever"" said my wife (I've paraphrased a little).

""Yeah, have a good day, I'm going buy a bottle of whiskey and then go to the park to fulfill my lifelong dream of build an ice structure. I'll see you tonight"" was my reply (also paraphrased).

She actually thought that sounded pretty cool, so she decided to join me and asked her friends down. She also asked me to pick up a bottle of Vodka as well. I'm a nice guy, so I did that.

So, by 2 in the afternoon we were pretty well set up. Juiced up after a couple of pints and a pub lunch, we finally got to the snow covered fields of East Finchley. After a whiskey &amp; coke, I laid out the plan of the grand structure, the ""dream"". It was an Ice Catheadral. A 30sqft structure with a 4.5 foot arched entrance, gabled roof (6ft at the peak), 1sqft window in the back (for air flow) and drink holders in each corner. 
By the time it got dark (4pm) we'd only managed to get half way towards the dream. By that time we'd captured the imagination of most people in the park, who'd come to help. We'd had about 15 randoms coming up with their families taking photos, helping, hindering, annoying, etc. Most of them didn't even notice our covert bar. That was good. No sharing, more for us. 
Anyway, to make a long story even longer, we ended up having a little bit too much to drink, lost focus, the dream never came to fruition, but it was one of the most fucking awesomely fun days I've ever had.

&gt;I should also add that IMNSHO, people who take their baby children into a land under military occupation should have their heads' examined or charged with criminal negligence, since they are intentionally putting them into danger.

t5_2qh4j,1362140133,"There are several points to consider here. NATO, the transition from a complete national army to a specialized one, and the structure of command.

Most European states are already part of a transnational army : NATO. Its supreme command is American, it is an alliance of several national armies. Each participating country, IIRC, accepts in advance to engage a certain amount of military means in any operation deemed necessary by the supreme command. In exchange, NATO ensures to defend any member with all its means in case of attacks.

Therefore, is it possible to make a EU army while still staying in the NATO? It imposes a few constraints : EU army won't be able to oppose NATO in any operation (but could choose to act in case NATO decides to stay neutral, and vice-versa). It also causes the problem that if a member participates both in a NATO operation and a EU operation, there may be a conflict of resources. If you have a single aircraft carrier, you will have to choose where to allocate it. This may be incompatible with NATO membership.

Why is it a big deal to leave NATO? Because small countries with little national armies currently rely on it to defend against mammoths like Russia. See what happened to Georgia for an example of what Estonia may fear. If it leaves NATO, it will need immediately a trustworthy alliance of a similar strength. 

And EU has shown to be far less reactive than US for instance on several issues. This is a structural problem : we have too many processes where consensus is necessary. Solidarity is also not EU's strong point, as the Greek crisis currently shows. If you can't be trusted to quickly help a country financially, why should you be trusted to help it militarily? Could Greece trust the EU to fight over Cyprus? Would the French or Spanish be concerned enough about Baltic states being attacked by Russia? The trust is simply not there for small countries to rely on EU yet.

Which leads to the last point : for a small country like Estonia, does it make sense to have a complete army? Air force, ground troups, navy, etc... If it is invaded, it won't be able to resist but still, it makes an invasion more costly than if there were no army. There were talks a few years ago, where NATO proposed that one of the Baltic countries specialized in demining operation (apparently they have good expertise in this field) and funds this sector more than others. In an alliance where you can rely on other armies, this is indeed cost effective, but you really need to trust the chain of commands there, to be able to send the tanks you need a few hours after enemy tanks are spotted. Not weeks, not days, but hours. It requires a high level of military cooperation.

Finally, US fears (rightly, I believe) that a EU army would weaken NATO. I think they will go to great length to prevent it from happening. They may even open the supreme command to non-US countries, which would be a big deal.

In the end, contrary to my pessimistic tone, I am in favor of a EU army, but I see no one in EU proposing a credible path to get there. I think that my country could have led the way for such a thing to happen when Sarkozy instead supidly joined back NATO.

Alone, we still have a functional and powerful army. If for instance we had gone to Mali with two or three other EU countries, it would have been possible to put into place a proto-EU command (everything in the EU seem to start from a 3-4 countries alliance, I think it is the way to go). If successful, it would have given arguments to leave NATO for these countries and reinforce cooperation, make a new defense alliance, a democratic structure of command and grow organically from there, partner after partner.

The political will seems to be absent. I am not in the knows of the military secrets, so it is quite possible that it makes more sense to rely on NATO for now, but as an europhile, I would love to see something as cementing as a EU army appear.",4,,1431448409,t3_19f9as,0,keepthepace,,c8nt3t6,True,4,europe,0,t1_c8nt3t6,False,t3_19f9as,0,France,FRAN,False

t5_2qmie,1362140435,"Para teres uma ideia do que é a produtividade e os ganhos de produtividade, imagina a seguinte cena antes e pós revolução industrial, por exemplo na agricultura;

* **Antes** tinhas um aldeia toda de 20 ou 30 homens a abrir um poço para dar água para as terras ou para o consumo, durante alguns dias ou semanas;
* **Depois** uma máquina abre um furo cartesiano e põe uma torneira a jorrar água desse furo em poucas horas, com 2 ou tres pessoas a trabalharem.

Hoje a evolução tecnologica não te permite os mesmo ganhos; Quero eu dizer que a culpa não é só dos Portugueses, a ciência não evolui de forma a permitir ganhos de produtividade semelhantes; a sociedade da informação e da Internet não permite produtividades próximas disto.

No dia a dia as pessoas para sustentarem um bom nível de vida, vá com dois carros a andar, férias, supermecado, casa, roupa ... têm duas hipoteses;

* Ou ganham o suficiente para sustentar a tipo de vida e ainda conseguir pôr algum de parte;
* Endividam-se para sustentar o mesmo estilo de vida.

Muita gente endividou-se a pensar que podia contar com um emprego para a vida, e quando as coisas correram mal, ficaram com as ""calças na mão""

Com os Estado é a mesma coisa; Quando a sociedade não produz o suficiente para manter determinado nivel de despesa, endivida-se. Como esse endividamento não é acompanhado por niveis de aumento de produtividade correspondentes, a ""barraca"" acaba por cair por falta de alicerces e deixas de conseguir emprestar dinheiro emprestado.

O problema da nossa economia não é só nosso, é vasto e complexo para ser resumido em algumas linhas, mas a culpa não é só dos Portugueses claro, acabamos por ser vitimas de um sistema de crescimento que ruiu na base.

I wonder how some would take the truthful fact that the long-haired Jesus is nothing more than poetic license created by artists a couple of centuries ago, and that he usually portrayed as white because, sadly, people identify quicker to something they look like or have an affinity towards.   That's why in some parts of Africa, Jesus is dark-skinned, and in some parts of the Far East, Jesus is portrayed as having Asian characteristics.  However, the predominant image of Jesus is that of a long-haired, blue-eyed, white hippie dude who is graceful and angelic.

I think the problem with Hitler was the genocide and racial theories. There's quite a few other things, but if I had to choose, I'd say that was the foremost issue. I also think the whole point of WW2 was to have 'one Caesar' (in this case Hitler) that united all of Europe. Thing is, people aren't too fond of being conquered.

I can't believe I'm doing this, but here's a slightly more serious response. The difference between Europe and the US/Canada is that we are a collection of countries. The differences between France/Germany vs. New York/Massachusetts doesn't need clarifying. As a result we have the EU, a bespoke solution to a bespoke probem.

t5_2ssp3,1362148211,"Great question, but there are a few problems with what you're asking.

&gt;How do you go from European colonialism, for example, which seems almost like a free-for-all with countries acting purely out of self-interest to an expectation of responsibility to other nations?

There is *a lot* of criticism about humanitarian intervention, R2P (responsibility to protect) and its relation to state interests / self-interest. It's not accurate to assume that R2P always translates into action and that action is motivated purely out of *selflessness*. Humanitarian intervention is very rarely out of altruistic means. In fact, morality is more commonly used as a way to provide a moral glossing that serves to de-legitimize criticism. I know this violates the 20 year rule, but if you'll remember the US adventure into Afghanistan was in part justified as a mission to support/uphold women's rights.

Understanding R2P and humanitarian intervention requires some understanding of the understanding of state sovereignty and the R2P doctrine actually denotes a minor shift in international thinking away from the 'sacredness' of state sovereignty to the view that sovereignty is actually a privilege and that it carries responsibilities with it. 

To answer the question though, it really depends on which country we're looking at. Defence policies may share common characteristics, but they are by no means universal. Here's the interesting thing though, governments in the West have begun to acknowledge that they don't actually need armies to defend against conventional threats like they did in the past. For example, the strategic defence review, in 1998, noted that 'there is no direct military threat to the United Kingdom or Western Europe'. So if there is no military threat, what is the justification for retaining military capabilities designed to respond to conventional threats? 

Again, I have to violate the the 20 year rule, because your question is fairly modern in scope. In 2003, the United Kingdom published a white paper that identified three characteristics/strategies for the British armed forces. They are:

1. Defending the UK and its interests.

2. Strengthening international peace and security.

3. [Being] a force for good in the world. 

Historically, the first point is the one that has informed most military strategies. The Army is there to provide defend the territory and interests of the State. Points two and three are relatively new but are immensely problematic as they raise a number of important questions. Namely, if they are a 'force for good' how are they defining good? Who's 'good' is being protected? To what end is 'good' being promoted? How we can define when enough 'good' has been done? But I digress. 

The point is that the defence planners and strategists in the 1990s noted that there is a risk of regional destabilization / conflict spill-over in countries engaged in civil war. Its for this reason that people are currently fearing regional destabilization as a result of the Syrian civil-war. Since peace and stability, in part, relies on confident markets and a strong economy, anything that is seen to jeopardize the market/economy is seen to be a threat to regional and national security. So stable economies and strong markets become a matter of 'national defence'. Humanitarian intervention and R2P gained mainstream recognition during the Rwanda genocide when it was very clear that the international community dropped the ball. 

That being said.. the success of PSOs, humanitarian intervention, and military intervention for moral reasons is highly questionable and there is a compelling amount of evidence to indicate that intervention can actually make things worse by exacerbating tensions; by failing to understanding the social/historical roots of the conflict; and by over simplifying the conflict in general.

Hopefully this answers part of your question.

The TL/DR is: 1990s and 2000s due to Yugoslav war &amp; Rwanda Genocide, respectively. And R2P/R2I is not altruistic even if its presented as such.

**Edit:** Wanted to mention too that the concept of R2P and R2I dates back a few hundred years and there are issues that stem from the Holocaust and WW2. However, I focused on more modern events because it is more relevant to your question and, I would argue (people are welcome to challenge me on this though!!), that it's not until the late 20th century that we really see R2P, R2I, and humanitarian intervention beginning to replace conventional defence policy in the West.

""username_humor""'s comment is pretty good. If you're full time with the platform owner (usually a producer like Exxon, BP, etc.), you'll be on a pretty decent work schedule with equal time on and off. Pay is usually pretty awesome, especially considering you spend half your time at home. I know the guys in Australia said they were getting &gt;$3000 per two week stint. In Thailand there was talk of Indian dudes that would go work six months straight on the platform, then take their money home and live like kings for a couple years, then come back and do it again.

Food and living conditions vary by platform, though most places I've been have decent food as it's your one real luxury. On one four week stint offshore in Australia I put on 8 pounds - unlimited food, candy, soda, and ice cream combined with 12 hours of not-much-happening will do that.

Most places have some kind of workout facility and some kind of hangout facility with computers, TVs, movies, video games, and more. The Thai guys had a soccer field under the helipad. The Dutch guys had a music room with drums, guitars, keys, and more.

It's a different lifestyle, and if you're the type of person or if you're in a relationship with the type of person that needs to see you everyday, it will be hard. There's no cell phone access, so you're stuck with using the onboard wired phone, chatting (if they have wi-fi, which most places do), or if you're lucky enough, Skype (if their internet is fast enough).

Depending on how many people are onboard at the moment, you could be sharing a room with 1-3 other people. Curtains around your bunk and a little discretion are important...

*quoting ""daarkside""*
&gt; In interview blahblahblah talking about how crappy it is that dota 2 is so small in comparison to lol and when he has the opportunity to further the scene he pisses off and lets down German dota. What VP and Navi/Empire were for the Russian scene, mouz should have been for the German scene. Individual Germans in top clans don't have even close to the same effect for the growth/enthusiasm/high stream viewer counts like a German top team. Typically unpro, unable to see the harm/gain for the scene as an entirety, with a horizon reaching only the tip of his nose

In order for my comment to not just be a dumb, but justified, flame, I'll write a bit more detailed about the situation in itself.

To begin with, I would like to suggest the lecture of this older blog post:
http://www.gosugamers.net/dota/blogs/3094

Kuroky is the German dota scene. Him and nobody else. Without him there would be no mousesports with German players (not to mention a mousesports which made in to the top 6/7 of europe which hasn't been achieved by a German team ever before which is rather pathetic considering the amount of Germans playing dota). Without kuro people like pas, fata and I wouldn't even play competitive dota and definitely not on a level where we have won against every eu/us top team a bo3 at least once. He is basically the reason for there even being mouz fanbois in this forum and you seriously claim that he's arrogant and short sighted because he leaves mouz now to join Navi? Re-read that blog. The little Iranian has dreams and aspirations in dota and very high ones at that. He wants to be the best and own everyone in dota. And he is the most talented and smartest player this country has to offer. Needless to say I was sad at first when he mentioned that navi made him an offer (not the first time, mind you) and that that he'll probably accept it this time around. I thought, fuck, what's gonna happen to the team now, can we stomach that, kuro is someone nobody can replace in western dota and if there was one it would be puppey. But now thankfulness prevails, that he even got us that far and that he has given us the opportunity to live our dream in the first place. Namely having a somewhat capable sponsor, being in the EU top 6 and getting paid for the game we love so much. It's not kuros fault that he leaves now, nobody has the right to blame him for living his dream. With this Navi lineup he has better chances of winning the International rather than with the mouz lineup, you have to objectively admit that. In Europe there is nobody that can play positions 3-5 better than funn1k, kuro and puppey. Dendi is maybe not always on the same level as the first three but he just has an enormous wealth of experience and skill, having laned against the best mids in the world and succeeded. Owned IG and LGD with Rubick. Hvost is in comparison to the rest the worst, but if you come right down to it it doesn't matter, he still plays well enough. And yeah, that Navi is paying him about 3-5 times the salary and that you somehow need money to live and play professional dota is something that I probably should mention in passing.

""Its in the darkest times, we find ourselves growing""

It's now up to us (meaning the remaining players) what we do with the remaining legacy. We could all bury our heads in the sand facing the obvious truth that nobody can replace kruo or we can finally begin to make something of ourselves and give our fucking best to become as good as possible. I know that it would make kuro proud if the team pulls its shit together and fights. Kuro tought us so much about dota, team spirit and the human factor that I now see it as my duty to continue. I owe it to him because back in the day he got me into mouz despite any public opinion because he believed in me (I still remember how almost everyone on dotasource thought I would be too bad for it anyway and somebody else should have been picked) and I owe it to myself because I want to prove that a German team can be successful without kuro. I reread kuro's old blog post earlier and I partially recognized myself in it. It's now just down to ourselves, whether we trust in ourselves and believe that we can make it and have the motivation and discipline to do what it takes, aka training hard and pushing each other. Because the beginning will certainly be very hard because fata and/or I now need to switch from ""listen to kuros call and just play well"" to ""decide yourself when and what needs to be done"". But fuck yeah, I really damn feel like and want to achieve that and I hope so very much that my teammates (including the new one[s]) pull through as well to allow us to further live our dream. To not throw away the achieved. To not let kuros done work go to waste. To not disappoint you guys on dotasource. To beat the status quo. To get to the International and not suck like ggnet 0:4. I just don't want to give up only to again participate with random teams at 4PL cup and the defense qualifier. And I also don't want to belong to that part of the German Scene that throws away those chances and either out of lazyness, idiocy or social ineptness managed to be utterly irrelevent in comp dota for 6 years.

I also don't know why Kuro and Hanni are the only internationally successful German dota personas. But then I see that a somewhat heavier German player in TI3 lowerbracket in a BO1, aka win or die, seriously played with mouse only while picking his nose with the other hand because he just doesn't care about his team and didn't want to win and yet, I come to think, he has achieved more with this retarded attitude because he made it that far and and I just wonder what kind of confession of failure it is for the German scene and that I just want to, pretty please, be better than that.

""I know that what's in front of me is a reflection of what is inside of me""

But however the future develops. I have decided not to give up and not to let off, just because it became slightly more difficult now and I will direct my will and inspiration to what's in front of me. And that is to improve personally, to get top mechanics and pull my teammates with me and hoping that they share my goals. Maybe we will crash and burn, but I at least want to try it with everything I've got and if I fail, I will stand up and try again because at the moment, I want to play dota. Because I don't want to see a German team in a few years which accomplished to achieve, while I didn't try properly and rather buried my head in the sand than to march on. I don't want to be the guy who then sits in TS, joining a channel shortly before a match to wish ""good luck"" and then rants about us two channels down while wishing with almost every fibre of his body that we lose (hi kev-, yes I know that you're doing that).

Apart from that, just a quick tldr version: Daarkside, you were in the wrong. Kuro, I thank you for everything that you've done for us and I hope from the bottom of my heart that you'll be successful and that we can meet on the International and when you win I'll be the first one to congratulate you. Someday we will be reunited again in a team and I will be bigger and better than I am now.

Dotasource, I thank you for all the comments and the small hype, for your fanboydom and every celebration when we win and for every time you're pissed off when we lose. I read the commentary here after almost every game and I'm just thrilled by how many there are and how big this has become. Continue to cheer for us if you want - cheer for kuro, I've written above why he deserves it - and I will give my best to not disappoint you even if it will be tough. It's great and inspiring to know that this forum exists and that there are people that feel with you, win or lose. Thank you for everything in the name of the entire team.

Lord Harrington is such a charming man. The South East corner has the corner stone engraved in large lettres: Château Woda Nymphée. He explained it means Water Nymph. He has a museum too, the museum is really interesting. Lord Harrington is a portrait painter and Surrealist Artist. The museum has some truly wild paintings, really strange and I did not really understand all of the meaning of many of them. They look just like photographs in paint somehow. His Lordshippe told me the Château is an European folly that isn't a folly. I think he means it were fun for him to build it himself. He and a friend of his named Benny built the whole thing from the secret underground crypt to the top of the tower he calls the Witches Crowne. I really can't talk any more about what I saw as he asked me for my confidence. He has an orchard and a garden with fresh peaches and gave me some peach cider. He lets me take my children over on Sundays to play croquet under the willow trees.

The official name of the castle is Chateau Woda Nymphée. It were built by Rodney, Lord Härringtón. He is the 27th Earl Harrington of Harrington. What one sees now in 2012 is but half of the intended structure. There are two more towers intended, as well a wrap around balcony verandah. The castle is inspired by His ancestral castle in Preussiae, His castle in Northern Europa, as well the many manor houses and mansions in Europe he has built as an architectae. The future towers, one of which shall be an electrical generator powered by solar and wind stimuli, shall be constructed later. There is a dinosaur sculpted of stone inlay in the East side of the Château with a real rare Indian ruby he found while on an expedition in India in the Punjab region that is in place for the glittering eye of the dinosaur or dragon. The Château is due South of Fort Worth Texas by 30 miles in a village East of Joshua. Dinosaur bones and remains were found whilst excavation ensued in the preliminary construction phase. The Estate is closed to the public and the museum is open by invitation only.",3,,1431449266,t3_19gqg9,0,ApocolipticBeulah,,c8nux6d,True,3,Dallas,0,t1_c8nux6d,False,t3_19gqg9,0,Addison,,False

do you think people would do that? just make up lies?

&gt;  Things like people supposedly walk up to them with broken bones and leave without any pain whatsoever...

Funny how amputees are never healed!

&gt; I don't think that miracles are nearly as prevalent in the western world as they are in some of the eastern countries.

Does that mean God is working in Asia, but not Europe and North America?

&gt; However, from MY experience, and I'm a preacher, I have many people say to me, ""There were many small things that led me on my way to Christ."" A conversation here, a Bible study there, etc. 

Yeah, that's my point. I think *all* of the stories are like that, because no one has actually witnessed a *miracle*, and therefore no one is going to come to you and say ""yeah, all those amputees that were being healed live on TV really showed me that there is in fact a mystical force that I consider to be God""

It's always ""yeah, that vague ambiguous thing that could also be explained by any number of other caused has convinced me""

&gt; But I don't think Jesus will resort to that kind of thing. If one holds Christianity to be true, and I do, I have to accept that God had a very particular plan in mind.

The flaw in your logic, of course, is that the lack of miracles is more a proof of their being no agency able to perform miracles than it is of a miracle performer not wanting to perform miracles.

If you hold Christianity to be lies, as I do, then the lack of miracles makes perfect sense.

Also, it's funny how Jesus wouldn't ""resort"" to proving miracles in order to proof the fundamental fact that he exists, even though your own religious texts recorded him as resorting to miracles.

Which is it? he resorted to parlour tricks back in the day?

Also, if his existence is a fundamental to the entire universe, why then kind of hide it? but not hide it? If it's a fact just be honest about it?

And if you think 'resorting' to tricks to prove his existence is bad, why doe she have to resort to letting children starve to death through famine?

&gt; I do believe that many people would be converted through Jesus hovering over capital cities, but I still think that there would be holdouts. Perhaps these people would be viewed the same way as holocaust deniers

So what if there are holdouts? There are holdouts now. It would mean less holdouts.

Though we would probably strongly disagree with its humanitarian value today, missions in the 15th-19th centuries were vital to the Christian of the time. Think of it this way: if you knew that your neighbor was going to die in a horrible house fire, you would justify doing just about anything to ""save"" your neighbor from a fiery death.

t5_2ssp3,1362150723,"Essentially, this video presents some actual evidence but misrepresents it to fit his thesis - that pre-Norman Ireland was some sort of libertarian free market utopia.

The most glaring issue with it is that the author assumes that presence of tuatha as social units and the lack of administrative powers by kings implied a completely free society. This is blatantly false. Ireland was intensely aristocratic and intrinsically hierarchical; nobles had higher honour-prices and could not be subject to base clientship (sort of like serfdom). Early Ireland had well developed notions of social class and guidelines for interactions between the two: a good example is marriage, where it was against custom to marry your family into any social class below you. Indeed, Ireland was so hierarchical that even the clothing worn by different classes was regulated by law; IIRC commoners could only wear brown or saffron coloured cloth, while the colour purple was restricted to the noblitiy. As well, slavery and bonded labour were widespread and regulated by the same law tracts the author cites. 

The video misrepresents the notion of kingship, claiming that Irish kings were ceremonial high priests, which I have never heard from an academic source. Irish inaugurations were highly ritual, to be sure, but kings had an important societal and political role. He correctly asserts that the king had no judicial powers (though kings could issue decrees in times of crisis), however a king had real social and political power that was realized through clientship. Essentially Irish society was a big chain of clients, and at the top were the kings; although state coercion did not exist, coercion through custom and law did exist and kings had the right to call upon his clients for labour, warfare and tribute. Indeed, as early as the 8th century, the power of kings had eclipsed the tuath system the author extolls. Ireland had basically abandoned archaic systems of tribal identity and sacred tribal kings in favour of a political order which increasingly resembled feudalism. Donnachadh O Corrain explains this well:

&gt;Ireland had become [by the 8th century] (if in reality it was ever otherwise, I doubt) a land of dynastic overlordship in which kings of paramount dynasties extended their authority and their kindred in every direction which their resources allowed. 

There was no state institutions to enforce inequality, but custom and societal consent - this is the biggest error the author makes. As a libertarian, they have a preconceived notion that the lack of a centralized state implies greater individual liberties etc., however in early Ireland liberties were restricted by the same independent customs the author uses (somewhat spuriously) to make his point. Not to mention that the notion of the individual as the primary unit of social interaction did not exist; during this era that position was held by the extended family.

What makes this video even more questionable is that anyone who did more than just cursory reading on the subject (which the author undoubtedly did) would have come across all this information in one way or another. The author either relied on out-of-date and discredited sources, or chose to represent only the information which proved his thesis while knowingly excluded the massive amounts of information which disprove it. So no, Ireland was not some libertarian utopia free of coercion filled with free acting agents; it was an incredibly hierarchical society defined by social subordination, regulated class roles and a political system that seems to have been evolving to something resembling European feudalism.

&gt;that is the very nature of any modern news org with an editing staff. 

This is my point, bias cannot be escaped, everyone has bias from News Editors to bloggers and both myself and you. So the only way we can get credible info is by realising this and filtering the bias.

&gt;I don't classify ANY news source as credible by default. 

I agree, but from my experience the BBC and Al Jazeera have demonstrated themselves to give credible information. Al Jazeera in particular has excellent 'citizen journalism' resources. 

&gt;According to you, all news sources are credible, so long as the person reading the news is able to properly interpret the information being presented. 

Not so, like you I do not classify any news source as credible by default, I base that assessment on there past record. For instance, Natural News, Prison Planet imo opinion have proven themselves to not only be bias (like everyone else) but to also report (intentionally or otherwise) false information. 

&gt;The problem with that position is that most people are too uninformed to eliminate bias properly from a news report. 

This is a massive problem,( and I think for peoples cognitive processes in general, not just when they are watching the news!) this is why Fox News stories get lapped up by the unthinking masses and most people in UK believe the BBC could never lie to them.

Precisely why it should be preserved, so that people know it's possible.

In Communist Romania, the last dictator built a series of domed superstructures called hunger circuses that would serve as food and supply distribution points after the economy normalised. In essence, they were the ultimate symbol of Ceausescu's Romania.

t5_2qh03,1362151200,"Machiavelli's character in AC2 was rather, direct.

Machiavelli at the time was extremely well know, he did actually coordinate some small military action (which wasn't uncommon at the time). He was one of the most powerful people in Florence at the time, when the Medici family and the Papacy were vying for power over the city. (The Medici family having controlled, been cast out, and then returned several times before).

His character in game was definitely a bit lack-luster. I have a feeling the RL Machiavelli wouldn't have been seen with the Assassin anywhere near as much. I'm thinking he would have been more well known, and easily recognizable. It's also hard for me to say, because the people would probably only know his name, and not his appearance (as today we know generally everything).

There's a lot to consider about it, it's really cool to think about.

t5_2qh1n,1362151214,"&gt;About 90% of the corn, soy and cotton now grown in the U.S. is genetically modified, and that has led to less use of pesticides, more targeted insect control, a shift to fewer toxic chemicals and less soil erosion compared with conventional farms, according to a 250-page analysis from the National Academies in 2010.

Less pesticides compared to what? Farmers are still spraying a shit ton of roundup (glyphosate, a carcinogen) on roundup ready crops, more than they would've used if they were not growing roundup ready crops. We've seen the creation of ""superweeds"" which have either developed tolerances to glyphosate through natural selection or horizontal gene transfer, leading farmers to use more harmful pesticides such as [2,4-D or dicamba](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18783o/75yearold_soybean_farmer_sees_monsanto_lawsuit/c8cg56i).

Its also not true that GMOs have led to a decrease in pesticide usage...

[Impacts of genetically engineered crops on pesticide use in the U.S. -- the first sixteen years](http://www.enveurope.com/content/24/1/24/abstract)

&gt;Herbicide-resistant crop technology has led to a 239 million kilogram (527 million pound) increase in herbicide use in the United States between 1996 and 2011, while Bt crops have reduced insecticide applications by 56 million kilograms (123 million pounds). Overall, pesticide use increased by an estimated 183 million kgs (404 million pounds), or about 7%.

Ha...

&gt;ethidium-bromide; Glyphosate is incredibally safe

[Cancer incidence among glyphosate-exposed pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15626647)

&gt;There was a suggested association with multiple myeloma incidence that should be followed up as more cases occur in the AHS.

[Cytotoxic and DNA-damaging properties of glyphosate and Roundup in human-derived buccal epithelial cells.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22331240)

&gt;Since we found genotoxic effects after short exposure to concentrations that correspond to a 450-fold dilution of spraying used in agriculture, our findings indicate that inhalation may cause DNA damage in exposed individuals.

[Studies on glyphosate-induced carcinogenicity in mouse skin: a proteomic approach.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20045496)

&gt;Altogether, these results suggested that glyphosate has tumor promoting potential in skin carcinogenesis and its mechanism seems to be similar to TPA.

[Biomonitoring of genotoxic risk in agricultural workers from five colombian regions: association to occupational exposure to glyphosate.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19672767)

&gt;Overall, data suggest that genotoxic damage associated with glyphosate spraying for control of illicit crops as evidenced by MN test is small and appears to be transient. Evidence indicates that the genotoxic risk potentially associated with exposure to glyphosate in the areas where the herbicide is applied for coca and poppy eradication is low.

Low risk, but certainly within the realm of possibility of contracting cancer from it.

[Genotoxicity of AMPA, the environmental metabolite of glyphosate, assessed by the Comet assay and cytogenetic tests.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19013644)

&gt;AMPA was genotoxic in the three performed tests. Very scarce data are available about AMPA potential genotoxicity.

&gt;ethidium-bromide; Don't inject herbicides and you'll be fine.

Or inhale them...or let glyphosate touch your skin.

&gt;ethidium-bromide; This is an idiotic argument because in your mind the end-result ""problem"" of using glyphosate is literally the same as if you never used glyphosate ever. Resistance is only a problem if you advocate for using a herbicide, if you advocate against it then resistance is a moot point from your side.

Glyphosate-resistant weeds wouldn't exist unless they were sprayed with glyphosate, correct?

&gt;ethidium-bromide; You can't just call pesticides harmful without any scientific evidence behind it.

Dicamba and 2,4-D are known carcinogens.

t5_2rq9c,1362153476," Keep in mind I'm playing with the Imperial Splendour mod.
I'm Great Britain, the others are Poland,Russia, Denmark, and the Mughal Empire. 

Normally the Marathas take over India and become aggressive pricks, but the Mughals have been different because in the 5-10 campaigns I've played through the Marathas ALWAYS take over India.

From the beginning of the campaign I immediately took Paris because it's such a strategic point in Europe besides the obvious tax income and large territory. This of course led to a multi-decade war where I ended up defeating France in Europe through blockading/economy warfare and the occasional city siege.

Year? 1730ish:

Spain declares war on me turns after America declares independence and overthrows my colonies on that side of the world, but alas that was my plan after all. By this time I've established plenty of trade and infrastructure giving me the title of best nation. The war with Spain didn't last long in Europe and the Mediterranean. 

With Spain, France, and the Mainland running at full economic capacity I was able to amass a massive fleet full of troops to [literally steamroll across America](http://i.imgur.com/vi4ive1.jpg) and quickly take hold of the whole western hemisphere.  

I developed this new territory to bring trade to Europe and dominate the global economy. 

yada yada yada... I take over Italy, the islands, and North Africa.
As I'm about to take my focus on Poland, the sleeping curry that is the Mughal Empire makes its FIRST move in the whole game. [Over the course of a turn or two these guys appeared](http://i.imgur.com/tF0UGGC.jpg) Their amphibious assault on Italy  didn't last long, but each turn was lasting as long as they are now because of the amount of people. 



Year? 1750ish:

What about Poland, Russia, Denmark, and the Mughals?

Denmark has just been chillin' and enjoying its economic benefits of being my ally after all of my conquest on the west side of Europe and all of North Africa. While playing a defensive role in Europe.

Poland has had minor stints with Russia here and there but have enjoyed many many years of peace and prosperity. They took over Prussia and some Austria. Those center countries get fucked up.

Russia has been doing the same thing I've been doing, but on the East side of Europe. I as Great Britain, and Russia sandwiched Europe over the years with Russia getting the Middle-East as well. 

Guess which country is between our Sandwich? Poland.

Guess which country hasn't had to spend any money on anything for the last 75 years or so? Poland

[Poland is so thick with units that it's a blood bath on all sides](http://i.imgur.com/NZZnoOb.jpg). This picture was taken after some thinning out, each flag is a 20 unit army and I can't even see their whole territory. But the thinning is not stopping Poland a bit because they amassed a treasure trove of gold over the years and produce units almost as fast as me.

t5_2t4ad,1362154026,"In a way, what you're doing is similar to MMA, Major League Baseball, European Football, or College Basketball (etc... ad infinitum) rankings.  In some ways, MLB and MMA might be the best similarities.  Here's why:

In MLB, you have a vast array of scouts and others who are constantly trying to evaluate and find the best pieces for their team.  There are rules in place to keep everyone on the same playing field.  Once someone is in your organization, you are responsible for their development - you've invested a considerable amount of money with them so it makes sense to push them.  I'm sure the major players in your universe could do something similar.  There's even an Evil Empire within MLB, so there's that. ;-)  Within each organization and throughout all of MLB, there are rankings.  If you're going to make a trade, you want to be able to see what you're giving up and what you're getting in return.  

MMA is very similar - you have these fighters who fight in small, regional matches, many of which will be monitored by people from larger matches looking for the next big someone.  As a fighter progresses through the ranking system, they are evaluated and screened - you don't want a guy who is one of the best in the world fighting a kid who has never fought a bout - it wouldn't make financial sense because the fight would be over so quickly that you couldn't get any revenue from it.  

In both of those examples, you are going to have a vast array of talent scouts, evaluators, and so on whose single job is to find the next big thing.  They monitor all sorts of places (newspaper reports, internet videos, etc...) to see what's going on.  If there is a specific ranking system that is done by an outside group (as unconundrum stated earlier) that stays neutral, feeding info to both sides, it could make sense that each side would put in a lot of effort trying to recruit those that will balance what the other side has.  

Most professional sports have something similar to what I've described going on.  Granted, the minor leagues (as it would be) for the NFL is College Football, and gymnastics pros compete at a much younger age than many, but there is still something in place that puts a known quantity in place that everyone can agree on.  If you put something like that into your work, I think your fascinating idea would work a lot better in your head and resolve some of those quandaries you find yourself mired in at the moment.

I too was in a similar position back in 2008: I had graduated college, and was working in a field completely unrelated to my major. I wanted to go back to Europe, but couldn't find work there, or anywhere else, as a French translator or teacher.

So I got a job in computers. Long days, lot of late-night projects. After about 3 months, I was going crazy. At weekends, all I'd want to do was sleep. The commute into NYC was killing me, and I hated taking the train.

So I drove the car in a few times. Bad idea, very expensive. This made me even more depressed, since I was working so much, but had no money.

Then a friend suggested I get my motorcycle endorsement. So I did. Went out and bought a cheap EX500 to tool around on, and fell in love with it. Started commuting into the city on the bike everyday, and found I actually enjoyed going to work again.

I made friends, and started riding every weekend. I realised I wanted to go long distance, and ride every set of twisties I could find. So I upgraded from the EX to an older Concours, which I fell in love with. Rode that bike over 50k miles in the past 4 years, but I always wanted something more - something faster and newer. At the time I bought it, I had spent my entire tax return and some money I had saved to get it, leaving me almost broke. I didn't care though, as I wanted to try to ""find myself"" with this bike. I did: I was motivated to pay off my credit cards now, which helped with the depression, so I could start saving for a ""new"" new bike. Only took me three years, and last Tuesday, I bought [my dream bike.](http://imgur.com/a/QNwKU) Part of the process for this too was getting in shape, which I am convinced also helps with depression.

     I was against AV and am a pretty staunch Eurosceptic - if there isn't a grand 
     renegotiation of terms I'm quite sure we'll get a No in the referendum.  So on 
     reflection I think I'm probably the sort of somebody you made this submission about.

     I thought this result was great, for my own goals.  

     If anything this pushes any negotiation of UK EU commitments to be more *extensive*.  
     If they're going to placate these protest voters they'll have to make even more demands 
     in negotiations.  If they don't manage to gain willingness to make concessions from Europe 
     by 2015 it's only going to swing more in the Independent's favour come 2017.

     The greater the discord and political instability surrounding Europe, the more likely it is that 
     I will get *my* way.  Voting electorate turnout being down, a Liberal seat becoming more 
     marginal, a protest anti-EU vote in second detracting from all, Conservatives with a split 
     base,  Labour pushed into 4th, and all the while an entrenched European crisis?  

     It's utterly Machiavellian of me but the stars are coming back into the same alignment for 
     2014 that saw UKIP do so well in the last European elections.   Won't be a popular 
     sentiment *here*, but here is not where it counts.

     I'd hold off the schadenfreude for a bit.   This is a result that can only be sour for the 
     pro-EU crowd, and many aligned with UKIP and Conservative backbenchers will 
     understand it as such.

t5_2rfxx,1362156986,"&gt; The idea that Riot would take over IPL6, a tournament with SC2 and Shootmania as competing interests makes no sense.

Which is exactly why I didn't suggest Riot ""take over IPL6"". What I suggested was that Riot let IPL6 get cancelled and then hold the LoL LCS matches and tournament that were planned as part of IPL6 on their own.

&gt; Even if LoL was the only event going on, the top NA and EU teams would not be able to attend, since they are already engaged in the LCS. 

Riot had planned to have that week's LCS matches take place at IPL6 as part of the event. There was supposed to be 11 matches for LCS NA (same number as ""Super Wednesday"") taking place on the Sunday of IPL6 at the Vegas venue. 

&gt; Marketing has diminishing returns, and if the number-crunchers at Riot felt that on top of the LCS, MLG, the World Championships, and OGN, that more marketing would result in greater profit, they would have already made another such tournament.

Riot was one of the sponsors for IPL6 and were planning on holding 11 LCS matches at the event. They were already invested in IPL6 for marketing purposes. IPL6 was to be an event with shared costs by another organization, like MLG or OGN. Riot clearly believes there was value in the event so running the LoL portion of the event as a stand alone event on their own isn't that much of a stretch.

&gt; Riot faces no PR problem from letting IPL get canceled because it's not their fault that the IPL LoL teams are left without a tournament. No one is blaming Riot for it.

Except all the people in this thread who blame Riot for undercutting every tournament like IPL6 with the LCS.",-4,,1431450217,t3_19gjyh,0,JokerSmilez,,c8nwx8d,True,-4,leagueoflegends,0,t1_c8nwx8d,False,t1_c8nvv62,0,,01 team,False

Every action a man takes is caused by reasons.  Those reason can be the hunt for bread or a higher salary. The thief calculates his risk against the profit. The finance manager does the same and most poeple are very focussed on getting money into their pocket. They choice how to do this can produce very different results. 

Marx itself showed in his books there is a clash of interests between simple employees and the capitalists. The capitalists try to secure their fortune and this is logical in a world based on money. They need the help of a government of a nation  that is acting with violence in the case of serious critics against capitalism. 

Marx wanted a society based on no fundamental clash of interests and with no government at the top, because there is no need for a government, when no one gets hungry and the poeple are handle the problems   self. That means property on manufacturing machines has to be dissolved. A machine should be working to cover the need for all the poeple not just a group of people. A prerequisite for this is a developed industrial region. Production efficiency must be high enough. He named this the dictorship of proletariate, because they dont wish to get back to the former state. 

Now the marxistic movements in Europe and the US: 
They have never realized that Karl Marx meant a new society without a national government. They wanted to be a part of the system and being emancipated. The russian movement had a massive problem of a violent opression by the tsar. They choosed to remove the remaining rests of the opressors in 1918. Because the french, british and the US supportet mercenaries in the upcomming civil war the bolchewists transformed from a party of interlectuals into a halv military organisation and the european mistake, the discussion about Marx was litterally dead. Russians were all the time great patriots in contradiction of Karl Marx his writings. Later everyone making mistakes came under the suspicion not being a patriot. Later every polictical officer had to fullfil detention rates to fullfill to show his patriotism. We know such practices from New York too. 

We have to make a difference between attitudes and real interests. Morality like Marx lead to Stalin is based of quicksand and  is not based on reasons. All generations and humans have always to choose their future itself.

&gt;Cheyenne was found to make two kinds of cigars that look like cigarettes yet weigh enough to be taxed as big cigars. One of the two has a regular fiber filter; the other has filters made of white fiber cylinders surrounding a granular clay substance. 

&gt; X-ray diffraction tests on the weightier Cheyenne product... found the clay filters were made of sepiolite. The weighty mineral is used for absorption in waste treatment, industrial cleaners and pet litters, according to the European Industrial Minerals Association. 

**The real issue (to the majority of /r/cigars) is what Dick Durbin whats to do:**
&gt;U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, introduced legislation Jan. 31 to close the loophole. The bill would equalize the tax structure [on cigars and cigarettes] so there wouldn’t be an incentive to manipulate products...

&gt;(e) Clarifying Tobacco Product Definition and Tax Rate-

&gt;(1) IN GENERAL- **Subsection (c) of section 5702** of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 **is amended** to read as follows:

&gt;‘(c) Tobacco Products- The term ‘tobacco products’ means--

&gt;‘(1) cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco, and

&gt;‘(2) any other product containing tobacco that is intended or expected to be consumed.’.

&gt;(2) TAX RATE- Section 5701 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

&gt;‘(i) Other Tobacco Products- **Any product described in section 5702(c)(2)** or not otherwise described under this section, including any product that has been determined to be a tobacco product by the Food and Drug Administration through its authorities under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, **shall be taxed at a level of tax equivalent to the tax rate for cigarettes** on an estimated per use basis as determined by the Secretary.’.",5,,1431450502,t3_19gtzr,0,tempmike,,c8nxjr0,True,5,cigars,0,t1_c8nxjr0,False,t1_c8nw2dy,0,,T1 rus,False

They were already going to do this for the LCS matches at IPL. That's why I'm suggesting that it wouldn't be much of a stretch for Riot.

&gt; Riot is already running LCS on their terms, they lose little money if IPL6 is canceled because they already have their EU and NA studios.

This opens the opportunity for them to run a ""challenger"" type tournament on their terms as well, which may or may not be something their interested in, but the opportunity is there. They may completely ignore what was to be the IPL6 tournament, in which case all the teams that qualified for IPL6 are left out to dry, but Riot is not in the habit of doing this.

&gt; If they ran an event like IPL6 by themselves, they stand a chance at incurring 1M+ losses like IGN did at IPL5

Granted, I have no inside knowledge of the finacial situation of IPL6 or previous IPL's, but by cutting out Starcraft and Shootmania and only running the LoL portion, which seems to be by far the most popular and profitable of e-sports, I woudln't imagine any losses sustained (if any) would come near the 1mil figure of IPL5.

&gt;Now, it cannot be God allowed the holocaust to prevent an even worse evil; i cannot make sense of that idea. 

Why not?  Perhaps Hitler prevented a communist totalitarian state in Germany, which would've been worse.  Perhaps Germany would've been plunged into long-term civil war and anarchy, spreading a far longer-term conflict throughout Europe.

It is not even a case of passive inaction either, it has clear it is possible for him to pull of saving them, he did it once but he didn't this time, why is that?

Maybe God stopped intervening in the time in between.  Alternatively, perhaps God's intervention in Egypt wasn't as drastic as you assume.

The question of whether or not to buy an iPad really comes down to your use case. iPad will not offer a better note-taking nor essay-writing than your MacBook. It's good that you store your docs in the cloud though, as one area in which iPad excels is when you just want to review the documents you've written, and make minor edits. 

Despite the marketing push behind iPad being a productive device, it still is at its best when used for consumption. Sure, you can write an entire essay on it (I'd recommend a Bluetooth keyboard), edit a movie, etc., but these tasks are still more flexible and efficient on a laptop/desktop OS. On the other hand, light photo editing and drawing/painting can be very gratifying given some of the better apps out there (iPhoto, Paper).

t5_2qh1f,1362164063,"As a US citizen currently doing an MA in Turkey, I feel like our situations are not too dissimilar. I have and use all three, but they have different purposes. If you're not scrapped for cash (I teach part-time at the school where I study), I would encourage you to do the same. As you have a 15"" MBP, an iPad is an even more logical fit in your life than mine (mine is 13""). 

I think the phone and computer are pretty obvious, so here's how I think of the iPad: 

First, as you have already acknowledged, a MBP is not a pleasant thing to carry around all day. It gets heavy (especially with a bunch of library books in the same bag), but there's more to it than that. A MBP is an expensive beast. If it were to get lost or stolen, life would suck. In my case, it has years of writing, research, and travel photos on it. While Time Machine ensures that all could be recovered on a new computer and Dropbox acts as a fail-safe for the documents, the fact remains that I would be severely inconvenienced if something were to happen to my laptop. I cannot always afford to buy a new one at the drop of a hat. 

If something were to happen to my iPad, life would go on with ease. Not only because I'd have my MBP as a backup also because the iPad backs up - as iPhones do - to both computer and cloud. That fact and its lower price point allow me to think of it as a laptop I can afford to lose. Whenever I can make do without a full computer (which is quite often) I take the iPad out. If I'm going to write in a cafe for a few hours: iPad. If it gets snatched off the table, the majority of my work will be safely at home. If want to do some work in the city before meeting my friends for drinks: iPad. If we end up in a club, I have few worries about it breaking through my own negligence or stupidity. 

It's a convenient, but inessential thing. Buy an external keyboard (I use the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover), and it can be your primary tool for taking notes in class and recording research. I find reading PDF documents more comfortable to read and easier to annotate on the iPad than my MBP (check out Readdle's PDF Expert). If you're not already into ebooks, the price of English books abroad might drive you into the fold. The iPad provides a more pleasant experience here than either an iPhone or MBP. I could go on and on... 

Let me conclude my commenting on what supersweettees has said below. I think what he meant is that the iPad makes a pretty good device for dicking round (See Alien Blue). Hence, he sees it as a splurge rather than an investment. I would argue that is up to you and how you put it to use. 

That said, Europe is an amazing place and $500 could go a long way. If purchasing an iPad is going to keep you from flying off to Italy for a long weekend, I'd say fuck it. Put priority on the experience. If you've got a good scholarship and few financial worries, go for it. I doubt you'll regret it.

* There exists a subjective measure for testing enlightenment. Therefore a teacher can verify it.

t5_2qhcv,1362166424,"The reason for me supporting FPTP has nothing to do with what party it appears to favour at the time.  

I don't think it was entirely unfair to say sometimes 'the loser wins', or the claim that it wasn't fairer.  Rather than voting for what people wanted, it would have been people voting along the lines of 'anything but'.  Everybody knew this - that some people would never vote for a certain polarising 'Marmite' party and use the new system to keep someone out rather than getting someone in.  I don't want a compromise of least offensive party or candidate.  The reason why there's such mediocrity running the European Commission (and it really really is dominated by mediocrity) is exactly because of a culture of compromise and least offensive candidate.  There can be several solutions to something, but if everyone compromises there's every chance you won't have an effective solution (AV itself was a compromise)   FPTP, whether it goes left or right, addresses this.

That said, the No campaign wasn't run with a sense of fair play.  They absolutely capitalised on people's distrust and reluctance for change.  When it came to political maneuvering the AV campaign were completely outflanked and outplayed, nasty tactics included.  

Then again that's part (only part) of the reason I support FPTP.  There is no actual qualification as such to be an MP but FPTP puts a bar in place.  If you can't get a constituency to turn out and vote more for you than any other candidate, by whatever means at your disposal, then by the time you walk the political corridors of Westminster and all its machinations, and then enter the bear pit of the Commons - then you're going to get eaten alive.  

Simply getting more votes, each on their own, first past the post, does require a candidate to have more fight in them.

I also really didn't want AV to start momentum towards PR which I really didn't want.

Then people with money would have lost it by putting it in a bank. But I think that's more fair than what you have now:

Can a big bank can go bankrupt as if it were a bar? Banks are key parts of the financial infrastructure of a country's economy, in particular in Europe where they do the most of the capital raising for companies (as opposed to the USA where there are more private investors). Too big to fail is a reality. Limiting the size of banks is an option for the future, but that's not the case now. Bankrupt banks would have caused economic disturbance just as well, but the difference would be that the governments would have had less leverage to do actual reforms.

&gt;These things might have been incentiviced by the bonusses, but the bonusses themselves are not the culprit.

The situation right now is that banks are living on emergency rations, and you don't get to throw parties in that situation. It's just a marginal issue, no one thinks the size of the bonuses matters. The proposal does impose limits on *how* the bonuses are calculated, emphasizing longer-term benefits. Limiting the size is just a matter of making the short-term political measures palatable.

&gt;Algorithmic High Frequency Trading, short selling: This has increased liquidity &gt; making spreads smaller &gt; investments cheaper.

It makes the system more efficent, but therefore inevitably also less robust. Driving around without a spare fuel jerrycan is more fuel-efficient, but you'll be in a lot more trouble when you run out of gas. As we have seen, the system required governement intervention to resolve a bubble (and that's even ignoring where the bubble came from in first place).

&gt;Hedge Funds: They only make out a small percentage of the traded volume, they don't move the markets, and cannot possible be responsible for the crisis.

A small volume traded at high frequency has a disproportional influence. Even a small difference accumulated over time can be grown into a bubble.

&gt;A bank would never give out a bonus if it's not proportional for the profit this person has made.

It's a small world over there. They all hope to be eligible for bonus pay one day, and therefore have a mutual interest in keeping bonuses as high as possible.

I did this with two uncles and they told me stuff their wives had never heard. ""He never talked about it before,"" my Aunt said.

""The worst day we had was the day in Normandy we were bombed by the British Air Force,"" said my Uncle, who was an officer with the Canadian artillery.  ""Still can't figure out how they didn't know they were bombing the wrong people.  All the guns were pointed south.""

My uncle who was drafted into the Canadian army:  ""When I was sent to Europe, around February 1945, they had us out on the parade ground in England.  Told every second man to take one step forward.  Those guys went to Belgium as replacements, and a lot of them got killed.  I was one of the ones who wasn't sent, and by the time I was sent, six weeks later, there wasn't any shooting any more.  I fired my rifle once in the direction of the Germans but I'm sure I didn't hit anything.""

He told me how he got out of army.  ""I volunteered for the Pacific so they gave me a month leave;  went home;  in the meantime they announced the war was over, so that was that.  I just never went back.""

My brother did this with my own Grandfather, one of the first Canadians in world war 1, and put it on tape.

Some of the things he said were just riveting, and are in no history books.

""There were about 600 of us who left Vancouver in 1914,"" he said.  ""You know?  I think I was the only one who came back.""

""The Germans called us 'geltsoldaten'.  Mercenaries.""

""When I was captured the Germans said we Canadians must really hate Germans.  The German soldiers were all conscripted;  they had no choice, they had to be there.  We were volunteers.  We didn't have to be there.  So we must have really hated Germans.""

After he escaped (after three tries) from a German POW camp, and got to Holland, he was in England, and they put him in a camp for new recruits from Canada, because they didn't know what to do with him- this was 1918.  ""One day they had a parade, and a General was reviewing the troops with his staff;  when he came by me, he turned on his heel, stopped dead, and pointed to my shoulder flash, which was the 1915 Canadian First Division flash.   'What, in God's name, are you doing here, ' he asked.  I told him how I'd got there, and he said, 'well, you don't belong here.  Do you want to go home?'""

Jungle. Chauster brings map awareness and have good mechanics with certain champs like lee sin, but he needs a bigger pool imo

&gt;But within the EU your movement of capital can come under no scrutiny, if you wish to send money from Malaga Spain to Warsaw Poland it can be done hassle free.

Not quite. You can move money and equivalent (precious metals, bearer bonds) without problems but it must be declared if over a certain threshold ~€10K. If you move money via bank transfer , the declaration is automatic.

&gt;You don't have to deal with any visa's or relocation hassle, as the EU protects your right to live anywhere in the Union.

You have a right to work anywhere in the EU, and to look for work anywhere. If you do not have a job, you can only remain for a finite period unless you apply for residence which will be granted pretty much automatically if you have your own means of support.

&gt;So as a citizen of the UK if you should ever feel that David Cameron or the legal system is discriminating against you and you feel you can't get any relief, you are fully entitled to take to the European Court of Justice.

Not to be confused with the European Court of Human Rights which is a Council of Europe (non-EU) body. The ECJ gets involved  when a European law or directive may not have been properly implemented or interpreted in the British justice system.

&gt;Border Security, a lot of people within the UK have been very vocal on the fact that people with criminal backgrounds have been let into the UK under the free movement of people laws.

I can visit Germany without problems if travelling within Schengen. I cannot reside there if they don't want me to unless I have family already there. Most of the rest of Europe implements some kind of registration system.

&gt;Factions within the EU have made the EU as a whole a lot less democratic. The emergence of the Franco-German alliance has been pushing smaller nation around for quite some time. 

The non-democratic institutions are the European Council (heads of government) and the commission (government appointees). More democracy/accountability is good and there, it is possible to find a deficit. This is the fault of the various governments who are more scare about the European Parliament, which is directly elected.

&gt;They forced democratically elected heads of states to abdicate in favor of someone with a more ""pro-European outlook""(this of course is debatable, and in my opinion horribly wrong).

If a government goes back on its commitments to the EU, especially on failing to implement legal and institutional reforms then pressure will be brought to bear.

The NBA season is so unnecessarily long and admits so many teams into the playoffs, the regular season is irrelevant. Likewise in baseball, an MLB team can lose 60 games and that's considered an AMAZING season (the MLB is also expanding their playoff bracket to allow two more wild card teams to compete).

The points system in European league football takes away those ""meaningless"" games we see in American professional sports where one team already has a good enough W/L to make the playoffs and the result doesn't make one bit of difference for them.

t5_2ssp3,1362170679,"Southern Africa?  What pages are these?  Southern Africa's experience with slavery was very limited, though its experience with labor exploitation was quite long.  It also wasn't subject to the same range of experience as more northerly regions of Africa, not in quite the same way.  So I'm not sure where ""southern Africa"" fits into all of this.  I need to read Diamond again, because I do recall being annoyed at aspects of his consideration of southern Africa.  But in southern African generally, slave-generated wealth was exceptionally small, and (unless you consider Angola and later northern Mozambique as part of the broader ""southern Africa"") they did not generate significant numbers of slave exports.

In general: the African trades in slaves and raw materials wasn't itself the most profitable thing, but via cyclical trade (triangular trade, if simplified) profit could accrete to particular enterprises.  (Slaves to the Caribbean, processed goods to Europe, manufactures back to Africa, though with lots of other eddies too; after the end of the slave trade and slavery in the 1800s, the system was a little different, with the plantations just relocated often to Africa itself or the Indian Ocean.) So capital accumulated in Europe in important ways that they did not in Africa and even among the plantation colonies of the Americas.  As to where raw materials went, well, they went into European manufactures.  You can find the occasional imperial blue book or trade estimate (look in the British Parliamentary Papers, particularly those dealing with African trade) [edit: [Or here, in the Statistical Abstracts](http://books.google.com/books/about/Statistical_Abstract_for_the_British_Emp.html?id=TAQSAAAAYAAJ)] that will tell you about Britain's commercial statistics across the Empire as reported annually.  I assume other powers compiled these statistics for publication too, but I know the British examples best and they at least are in English.  

Most raw materials were intended for consumer goods but some things (rubber and palm oil for example) had other uses too.  Mining wealth only starts coming out of Africa and directly into European hands in the 20th century, outside of South Africa and (in a few places) North Africa.  Otherwise it was part of a network of exchange, and the mining of precious minerals and so forth were limited and governed internally by Africans.

The Leopold experience (Belgian king, but be careful, **his Congo Free State entity was *not* an arm of the Belgian state**) comes much later, after the 1880s, and what they were doing was *in effect* mass enslavement through coercion, but it wasn't legally defined as such.    Basically by that time, colonies were expected to be self-supporting but almost never were, not for the purposes European concessionaires needed them.  Leopold made a very specific regime designed to make a colony pay.  In fact, without the rubber monopoly that caused so much misery in the Congo, the Free State probably would have bankrupted King Leopold and forced the Belgian state to take over earlier than it did (1908).  In many other cases where companies took over in the name of colonial rule, they went under for exactly this reason.  Re-engineering functional African societies for purposes of extraction and ""management"" by European models required massive investment and that was almost never a proposition that generated profits by itself.  Many people got rich off of empire in Africa, but very few imperial states did.",4,,1435576829,t3_19ggun,0,khosikulu,,c8o1hfn,True,4,AskHistorians,0,t1_c8o1hfn,1362187361,t3_19ggun,0,Southern Africa | European Expansion,africa,False

t5_2qh2p,1362170843,"&gt;He ruled politically because he had so many followers across the world, right?

If you consider Western/Northern Europe to be the world...sure. 

I can only assume that this is in reference to this graph (http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/darkages.gif), that conveniently leaves out that the only reason that there is anything at all in the ""Christian Dark Ages"" section is because of the Roman Catholic Church.

Apart from that, there are a few historical things in this post that just...irk me:

1) Following the usual academic line of thought, if you're discussing the ""Dark Ages"" (which itself is generally frowned upon), that time period does not usually include the Crusades.

2) The reasons you gave for people not caring about education are not exactly...strongly based in fact. To a vast majority of the population, you would be needing to keep your children at home to help with family work (farming, shopkeeping, etc) and sending them to get an education would not be worthwhile. Also, you need to remember that to a large extent, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, those territories faced nearly complete economic, political, and social collapse. If you're not sure where tomorrow's food is going to come from, education is less important.

3) As I see has been hinted at already (and will hopefully be said more), the place you would go to find educated people during the Middle Ages would be the Church/religion. If you're going to argue that the Church/religion held back scientific advancement, there are far more applicable time periods to use.

4) The original point of the First Crusade was to assist the Byzantine Emperor, not to capture Jerusalem. Admittedly, it isn't that much of a jump from ""help the Byzantines fight the Turks"" to ""Retake Jerusalem"", but still.

* The free world, which, by the way, wouldn't exist outside our borders if it weren't for Americans willing to die on foreign soil to defend the freedoms of our allies and our enemies.

And we're damn proud of it. We look conceited (learn to spell, commie bastard) compared to other countries because the other ones don't have a damn thing to be proud of.

t5_2s7tt,1362171666,"While this is all true, the possibilities of automated piloting and multiple vertical lanes reduce space constraints, increasing safety and traffic flow. 

I can dig what you mean about parking infrastructure placing a certain size constraint on vehicles. Still, some pretty amazing automated car parking systems have been implemented in Europe and Japan, most cities in North America would already benefit from something similar -- major American metropolises like New York City and Los Angeles in particular.

Note that a combination of underground automated parking and moving a significant portion of the traffic into air lanes would significantly reduce traffic on the ground, increasing the viability of ground-based public transit. 

An increased level of public transit coverage could also be combined with the implementation of a high-speed rail system as a kind of transportation macrostructure offering rides in between city districts.

All of this would in turn reduce the amount of vehicles traveling in air traffic lanes, further increasing safety and traffic flow.

Regarding the issue of size, lift and propulsion: City commuters have over time shown a dominant preference for smaller vehicles. Dig the Smart Car, itty bitty. Much of the parking infrastructure in North America is designed around the larger cars of the mid-20th century, so we've got a bit of wiggle-room when we consider the size of current infrastructure vs. the consumer's minimum space requirements.

Given significant advances in rotor technology, it's conceivable that a multi-rotor arrangement could generate enough lift for turbines to provide forward momentum. This would enable VTOL, taking care of many possible problems.

Mounting the rotors to the fore and aft with the turbines on the top left and right allows enough space for wings that would allow gliding with limited maneuverability. In the worse case, the addition of a ""no fly"" buffer zone between lanes enables the use of ejection seats as a last resort.

The point is, even if Jews and other persecuted classes would have owned weapons, they wouldn't have had any better chances against the Nazi state.

It is a very strange and, please don't take this as an offense, *American* idea that owning guns would grant citizens a better protection against a tyrannical government.

&gt;“those able to hold onto their arms and their basic right to self-defense were much more successful in resisting the Nazi genocide.” But as the Tablet’s Michael Moynihan points out, Napolitano’s history (curiously based on a citation of work by French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson) is a bit off. In reality, only about 20 Germans were killed, while some 13,000 Jews were massacred. The remaining 50,000 who survived were promptly sent off to concentration camps. 

Even armed individuals never stand a chance against modern security services and especially armed forces. This was true in the past and is even more true today.

Why is it that people think their leader must be a certain demographic to be effective?  

God isn't a certain age, He isn't black or white.  This crap doesn't matter.

What matters is the Faith.  Why is it that our churches were expanding at a breakneck pace in the 1950s?  Why did the Faith spread from the Middle East to Rome, to Europe, to the New World?  

It's not because the missionaries were a demographic.  The first ones were some MidEast Jews.  Then they were white Romans.  Then they were Spanish and Portuguese and Italian.  

It's the FAITH that will convert.   And in these post-conciliar times, we don't know what the Faith is.  Our churchmen muddle the waters with crap and heterodoxy.

&gt;Priests. While the number of priests in the United States more than doubled to 58,000, between 1930 and 1965, since then that number has fallen to 45,000. By 2020, there will be only 31,000 priests left, and more than half of these priests will be over 70.

&gt;Attendance at Mass. A 1958 Gallup Poll reported that three in four Catholics attended church on Sundays. A recent study by the University of Notre Dame found that only one in four now attend.

&gt;Again, in all areas there has been a dramatic decline. In 1965 there were 1.3 million infant baptisms, in 2002 there were 1 million. (In the same period the number of Catholics in the United States rose from 45 million to 65 million.) In 1965 there were 126,000 adult baptisms - converts - in 2002 there were 80,000. In 1965 there were 352,000 Catholic marriages, in 2002 there were 256,000. In 1968 there were 338 annulments, in 2002 there were 50,000.

t5_2qh1i,1362175945,"This is quite true.  Flemish is a dialect of dutch, which I think the wiki article mentions, in the same way that, say, West Ulster English is a dialect of English.  However, a speaker of American English would have an extremely difficult time understanding West Ulster English, as it allows for things like Quantifier Float, where American English simply does not. 

Example:

American English: ""Where all did they go for their holidays?""
West Ulster English: ""Where did they go all for their holidays? ""

While I realize that these are simple examples, West Ulster English can create much odder constructions.  The point I suppose I'm trying to make is that, yes, Flemish is a kind of Dutch, but is significantly different enough that it can be considered a dialect, and so, I thought it worth mentioning in the context of the conversation regarding whether or not there is a Belgian language per se.  Also:

American English: Buffet
Australian English: Duchess
British English: Sideboard

Dialects can vary widely on syntax, morphology, semantics, and phonology.

Sadly, Flemish and European languages are not my field of study (that being theoretical syntax), so I can't really comment on specific differences between Flemish and other Dutch Dialects.

*10AM*

A bright morning and Alan Lightbody is driving around town in his mobile office. He wears his grimy business suit while driving like a mad man. Due to the fact the he is driving with his knees, drinking a coffee with one hand and fixing his tie with the other. Crammed into the tiny car is the RWF.com crew filming Alan.

AL: Hello RWF interweb fans! It is I, Fireproof Alan Lightbody! You people will have the pleasure of seeing my in-ring debut this week on Battleground. Now Mondo wanted me to go and train or “actually learn to wrestle” but instead I thought id give my millions of loyal fans the double pleasure and see a day in my life. So welcome to the Lightbody pleasure dome!

The car swerves as Lightbody hit’s the pavement

AL: Get off the road you stupid Americans!

*11AM*

Lightbody is still cruising around the town of San Jose. He has the window rolled down letting the wind blow threw his hair.

*So what are we actually doing today?*

AL: This is our 64th lap of the town now, you never know when a business opportunity will come along. Like right here!

Lightbody slows down as he drives by two old women, he shouts out the window at them.

AL: Here ladies! You want a lift? Real cheap! I’ll give you the ride of your life!

Lightbody speeds off as the old women ignore him

*Maybe you should take Armondo’s advice and hit the gym*

AL: Let me tell you spider web nerds a secret, Amy is a killer. She may not look it, or act it, or smell it but she is a killer! The things she used to do to me when we were kids. Well I was nearly a grown man and she was a toddler but God damn she could swing a highchair! They should just give the Lightbodies the tag titles right here, right now!

*So no concerns about Jay Saker and Andrea Carson?*

AL: Who? I have no idea who that is. But do they have agents?

*12:30PM*

Alan Lightbody is now pulled over in a supermarket car park drinking a red bull and talking shite.

AL:…so then I gave him the denim and the lace combo…

Lightbody starts to flex is arms but then his giant 80s phone starts to ring.

AL: Ah its Derrick! Watch as the master talks business!

Lightbody answers the phone

AL: Derrick! I assume you want my….yes…sir….well yes sir…no well I don’t think I’ll….ok…well I have to disagree and…ok….well Amy is….goodbye Mr. Anderson.

Lightbody puts down the phone and slicks back his hair and the sighs.

AL: Just business talk you guys wouldn’t understand. Insurance for me being in the ring and what not. Maybe I will hit the gym…

*2PM*

Alan Lightbody has been stuck in a traffic jam for the last hour trying to get to the gym.

AL: COME ON!! Who is driving that mini van, Lee Mercer?

*While were stuck here, what are your thoughts on the Armondo vs. Shane Storm match?*

AL: Mondo is going to kill him. He always has and always will. What I don’t like about that match is how Derrick Anderson tried to make himself the ref! I mean what’s with that? Clearly he doesn’t like RevX!

*What about the stuff Shane has said about you personally?*

AL: I don’t know what his problem is. I got him two damn good contracts which he has done nothing to earn! Then he just ups and turns his back on all of us again. I bet its that Hans guy. I know him from Europe. Major scumbag.

*4PM*

Lightbody has now made it to a gym. The film crew follow him inside.

AL: Alright I got lost many times but we’re here! Alright lets hit the floor. Just watch as all these women are checking me out.

*Shouldn’t you change into your gear*

AL: Gear? Im wearing it! People should always know im a top class business man.

A Montage is now shown of Lightbody struggling to lift dumbbells and the heavy weights falls across his neck nearly choking him. Running and falling off treadmills even at the slowest pace. Drowning as he swims (still in full business suit) in the pool. Soaking wet trying to impress some ladies by slapping a punching bag. Then finally resting in the sauna.

*4:10PM*

AL: Alrighty that was one hell of a work out! Now to hit the ring and mess up some squares!

The Lightbody now walks up to a wrestling ring that has been set up in the gym. A man and a women stand inside it. Lightbody enters and talks to the pair.

AL: Now these two are going to be my victims! Ok…eh…guy! You pretend your that Delhi Dongo Saker and gal your that Vanson girl! Two on one lets do this!

Alan puts on an old school wrestling helmet and starts to talk thrash

AL: Look at this boy! He is even stupider then Saker! If that’s possible! And this girl looks just as tough as Jay Saker! I bet he punches like a women on her women issues. Alright lets do this Greco Roman style! One hour time limit, I bet Saker cant even go that long and I don’t mean in the ring! OOOOH!

Lightbody makes his move but just ends up getting beat down in the ring. He is clobbered from one side of the ring to the other. It’s a mess. The cameras turn away its gets so graphic. All that can be heard is the tud of Lightbodies face on the canvass and his girl like screams.

*5PM*

Lightbody is now driving his office around again. His face is covered in cuts and pot marks from his beating.

AL: I don’t think the camera picked it up but I whipped those two like cream! Sweet Irish cream! And that’s exactly what Im going to do to Jay Saker! So Jay I will see you on Battleground. Better bring your doctor! Or your Mom! OOOH snap!

It lives in the waters that flow underground through this extensive limestone region, including waters of the Soča river basin near Trieste, Italy, through to southern Slovenia, southwestern Croatia, and Herzegovina.[2] The olm is the only species in the Proteus genus, the only European species of the Proteidae family, and the only cave-dwelling chordate found only in Europe. It is also occasionally called the ""human fish"" by locals because of its skin color, similar to that of white people (translated literally from Slovene: človeška ribica and Croatian: čovječja ribica), as well as ""cave salamander"" or ""white salamander.""[3] In Slovenia, it is also known by the name močeril, which translates as ""the one that burrows into wetness.""[4]

This animal is most notable for its adaptations to a life of complete darkness in its underground habitat. The olm's eyes are undeveloped, leaving it blind, while its other senses, particularly those of smell and hearing, are acutely developed. It also lacks any pigmentation in its skin. In contrast to most amphibians, the olm is entirely aquatic, and it eats, sleeps, and breeds underwater. It has three toes on its forelimbs, but two toes on its hind feet.

The biggest trading partners by volume in the world are the United States and China, and differing currencies doesn't seem to have hindered bilateral trade. Another example is Turkey, whose biggest trading partner is the EU, and differing currencies doesn't seem to have hindered trade here either. 

Some of the arguments that you cite in favor of the euro, do not actually require it to realize their benefits. The cost of exchanging money can be reduced by modernizing and streamlining FOREX trading platforms, or allowing banks to issue payments cards that do the conversion automatically depending on where the customers is using them. Red tape when transferring money across borders has been already largely resolved by the SEPA system. Low interest rates are not necessarily a good thing - they are the main culprit for the inflating of the housing bubble and the subsequent burst in 2008 that wrought havoc all over the world financial markets. Playing with and manipulating interests rates is the most egregious form of price controls, and as the recent LIBOR scandal in the UK has shown it can have disastrous consequences on savers, especially pension funds and the insurance industry. 

You can write volumes of theoretical arguments about the benefits of the euro, but the facts on the ground are that the euro has been a complete and unmitigated disaster for the people in Greece, Spain, and now increasingly Italy and France. I predict that it won't last for much longer in its current form. It will probably split into two - with the Germanic countries of the north maintaining a monetary union, while the Latin countries of the south + Greece revert back to their national currencies that they can then inflate at will.

t5_2s8o5,1362177681,"As a Korean, girlsack seems like the product of insane Asian parents. Didn't she get like 2 degrees in 3 yrs, one being a hard science? (Lol as I struggle to keep up with 2 science classes a semester.) It's basically a life of insane parental pressure to be the best, which gets drilled into your head so much that many of them take on a very selfish, egoistic viewpoint on life and start to behave elitist or with fake confidence. There's also the matter of 2nd-generation guilt, because most first-gen immigrants left everything to come to America and pretty much work themselves to the bone (generally service-oriented jobs, hence the stereotypical Korean grocer) to make sure their kids could ""make it"" in America (aka go to an Ivy League and become a doctor).

I myself have experienced this. I was like a chill English major and then decided I wanted to pursue medicine, which is something I avoided because I chickened out and thought I wasn't smart enough to get through the weed-out classes. Granted, I'm not naturally inclined towards science, so my life was literally consumed by academics. I didn't go out, I made no attempts to make friends, because every moment was me thinking about school or studying or freaking out about my grades. (It sounds crazy but I think the whole pre-med track and admissions process is fucking ridiculous and corrupt, and can make students insane.) I was pretty miserable and caught myself adapting a weird elitist mindset sometimes, especially towards liberal arts majors and such (funny because I still *am* a libarts major). I mean in the end I'm glad I'm sticking with it and proved to myself I could lead the pack in science and libarts, but it can seriously mess with someone's head. I'm guessing girlsack went to a prestigious university, where it's worse because a lot of the students are rich and hypercompetitive (not to brag but I go to a well-recognized school and the students here can seriously be... nut-jobs.)

Also a lot of Koreans are very superficial. From a historical perspective it is most likely driven by a quick rise from poverty to first-world economy (as a country) in such a short amount of time. A good analogy are people who were poor and run into a lot of money-- they don't handle it very well and are captivated by the power of appearing rich or high-class (as a soccer fan, you see this with a lot of young soccer stars plucked from South America/the poor parts of England/Europe and given riches to play in world-class teams). That kind of financial change for a family generally breeds superficiality and it gets passed on forever.

t5_2qh6p,1362180222,"&gt; Scandinavian countries have relatively low public debt per capita, high median wages, largely homogeneous populations, and extremely low poverty rates. Therefore they can sustain social welfare programs far better than the UK or Greece for example, because these programs put less strain on Scandinavian countries' balance sheets both in terms of added debt per capita and the overall cost of welfare programs. 

You're making some mistakes. You seem to think all European governments have exactly the same form of government in terms of entitlements. This isn't true. Scandinavian countries for instance are completely different from the UK, and are way more socialist than the latter. Plus, you could argue that those high median wages, low public debt and low poverty rates are the result of their policies, instead of the reason they're able to implement their policies. Though I suppose it's a chicken vs egg thing.

Next, the real problem Europe is facing isn't the consequence of socialist policies (though you could argue the overspending in some countries is a result of that), but mostly having a common currency without having some common policies.

Europe as a whole doesn't have a homogeneous population. The North is MUCH richer than the South, and their economies are much stronger. Before, people thought after unifying that gap in terms of productivity would disappear fast, and the Southern countries (they have the most trouble, not the more socialist northern ones) started spending accordingly. This has proven to be a massive failure. 

Normally, when you see your economy lagging versus other countries, you devaluate your own currency (what china has been doing for a decade, and what Obama has been doing the last years: printing a shitload of money). Europe as a whole can decide to devaluate, but this would have effect on the entire Eurozone. So the PIGS countries are only left with one option: fix things internally by cutting spending and boosting taxes, which has an awful impact on the domestic economy in the short run, but is theorized to have a good impact in the long run (Germany did this a couple years back).

There's also the other option, which is loads of government spending to get the economy going again, which is what Obama (wants) to do now. Here people think that boosting government spending might lead to a deteriorating government debt in the short run, but would provide a jumpstart to the economy. I don't know which one is better, there's a lot of debate on this in the economic world as we speak.

Yes, Hollande's taxation policies have failed miserably because he was making promises he couldn't keep. Anyone with a decent brain saw that. If you raise the income taxes of the rich to 75%, the rich people simply move to another country.

t5_2sxwp,1362180598,"Ahh cheap flights to Europe... get a job for an airline! Our flights over there cost anywhere from $20 - $80 bucks (we just pay taxes to the country we are visiting). But for real, my best suggestion if your flexible and have some extra time is to be willing to fly to any city. Getting to the continent is the hard part. Getting around Europe is much easier and cheaper. So if for example you find a cheap flight to Frankfurt, Germany but you really want to end up in Rome buy the cheap flight to Germany and then buy a cheap flight from Frankfurt to Rome on an European discount carrier like RyanAir, EasyJet, etc. There are 15 or so cheap carriers over there these days. 

Also, if you fly to somewhere in Europe and you want to get to another city check out the country's train system. (I don't mean EuroRail which is much more expensive a lot of times) In Rome we were able to take a cheaper train ride up to Venice on the Italian train instead of EuroRail)

At the end of the day if you want to travel on the cheap you have to go with the flow and go where the cheapest tickets will take you. The down seasons (the time I like to go because much much fewer tourists and things will be a little cheaper) are Sept/Oct and Jan/Feb.

t5_2s8kf,1362181093,"Oops, yep, that'll do it!  As some of the other posters have commented, you'll most likely want to start using UK sizing, since most of the bras you'll likely be looking at will be made in the UK (or by a couple other European countries that use UK sizing).  With your measurements, you may want to look into a 34E or 34F, or if you want to stick with the 36 band, a 36DD or 36E (if you're looking at US sizes, a UK-E cup is equivalent to a US-DDD).

Also, regarding the breast tissue migration, my understanding is that bras tend to work kind of like braces: the correctly-fitting ones keep the tissue front and center, where it should be, whereas incorrectly fitting ones can push the tissue where it shouldn't be, like to the back and sides.  However, I believe you can still get tissue migration without a bra, since the bra isn't directing the tissue forward into the cups where it should be.  BUT I would say it's not so much migration as it is your natural distribution without a bra telling the tissue where to go.  Does that make sense?

So if you start wearing a correctly fitted bra in a 36 band, you may find that after some time it feels less supportive and you need a 34 band, once the tissue starts redistributing itself.  If that's the case, you might want to get a 34 band and use an extender until the bra stretches and/or your tissue migrates.  But if you're not going to be wearing a bra that often, and are just looking for something for occasional use, you might want to stick with the 36 if you think a 34 would be too uncomfortable.

I think that adoreme.com mostly sells rebranded Affinitas bras, and it's worth noting that those bras do tend to run very tight in the band.

Of course this countries are doing fine and will be ok inside eurozone, outside of it or in other places, because there are 3-5 times richer per capita than Poland, have good institutions, developed economies, strong industry. On the other side Poland's fast growth depends in large degree on funds from the EU. These funds will be flowing till 2020 (if current EU budget is accepted), but after that date EU will probably divide and a separate budget for closer bounded Eurozone will appear. This is the main rationale for the current polish government to get Euro. If EU stayed in its current shape then joining the Eurozone would be less profitable, but now in the face of changes in EU there is a significant risk of being left behind without (or with severley diminished) funds.

t5_2qzb6,1362182418,"Slavery was a problem long before America showed up on the shores of Africa, and we often over look the ""indentured servitude"" that many white people also suffered from.

Now slave trading goes back a long way and I have no interest in determining its origins, but along the way many people overlook other forms of slave trade; 

* The Irish slave trade began when James II sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World.  

Slavery tends to be though of as whites owning blacks in America, yet it is surprising how often other forms of slavery are over looked.  What some people also find shocking is that white people were enslaved in Northern Africa.

&gt;  But from 1500 to 1650, when trans-Atlantic slaving was still in its infancy, more white Christian slaves were probably taken to Barbary than black African slaves to the Americas, according to Davis. 

Slavery was a common and accepted practice long before blacks were being shipped across the Atlantic to America.  Even the Arabs had an extensive slave trade system and many think the word slave is derived from the Eastern European term ""Slav""

&gt; During the 8th and 9th centuries of the Fatimid Caliphate, most of the slaves were Slavic Eastern Europeans.  

You also made reference to a ""good indicator"" that Africa was in shambles because of their slave trade.  It was something that occurred in that region for hundreds of years before America was even invented.  It was a form of business, like any other at the time, that was accepted and still to this day exists (whether we want to admit it or not).   

History is written by the winners and is often one sided, hence HIS-STORY.  Growing up and looking at the history books I was taught from I can see the through the lies and the bullshit that history tries to cover up.  Colonialism and Imperialism have tried to white wash history as best they can but they cant hide everything, and in time the truth does come out.  Slavery even exists to this day.  Just look at what happens to women all around the world who are bought and sold into the sex trade business.   

&gt; White, self-hating liberals and greed-head conservatives who claim to care for the ""civil rights"" of Black and Third World people, discard the working class of their own people on the garbage heap of history.

t5_2ssp3,1362182515,"This is not correct regarding Jews in Germany (the subject of the question), although it is more or less correct (albeit oversimplified) vis a vis what actually happened on the ground with Jews in eastern Europe (where the vast majority of the Jews killed in the Holocaust lived).

The Nuremberg Laws, which legally defined Jewishness in Nazi Germany, provided very specific definitions of who counted as Jewish in cases of people having mixed heritage.  As /u/grapp speculated, the Nazi definition of Jewishness was not in any way related to how Jews actually define themselves, religiously or otherwise; the Nazis conceived of Jews as a concrete, scientific race, and therefore someone defined as a Jew was a Jew legally whether or not s/he held to Jewish beliefs, acted as part of the Jewish community, or was considered Jewish by the relevant religious authorities.

t5_2qhcv,1362183507,"&gt; leaving EU

UKIP's planned increase to the defence budget alone would appear to amount to roughly £16 billion.  The net UK contribution to the EU is around £6 billion, so they have already blown that saving just by paying for part of their increase in defence spending (which would achieve what exactly?).

&gt; ending subsidies for wind power

Apparently the government spends around £1 billion on renewables subsidies, about 40% of which goes to wind power.  UKIP, however, want to subsidise nuclear power, which is now a little more expensive than onshore wind (though a lot cheaper than offshore wind).  So we are saving small change here at best.

&gt; My point though, is that out of the lot of a bad bunch, they are least bad party.

The three main parties' 2010 manifestos are all far more realistic than this.  Quite a lot of the promises in the Tory and Lib Dem manifestos have already been implemented (obviously the coalition government isn't going to be able to satisfy all of them), and all three parties listed significant and very specific spending cuts.  None of them have a long shopping list of tax cuts like UKIP's does.",2,,1431454583,t3_19ehha,0,Jeqf,,c8o5gq8,True,2,ukpolitics,0,t1_c8o5gq8,False,t1_c8o3i87,0,,,False
