1. By the end of their rule they were
2. I was using roman era accounts as examples
3. Both romans and celts were moralised by christianity. Generally post christianity blood sports/sacrifice were out.

&gt;  Particularly if using it to praise Christianity in particular, since other religions during the era colonized areas with slightly less genocide.

You continually move away from my point.  Early christianity was not late medieval christianity.  The early christians converted through strength of argument, not genocide and colonization. 

&gt; Or any number of other religions, particularly those that don't emphasize spreading their religion and subjugating personal morality and scientific research to authority ruling in the name of God.

This i feel is atypical of the anti-christian brigade.

1. All religions subjugate personal morality (thats the point).
2. Christianity was not always anti-science: modern day evangelism is.  The monastries were centres of science, but back then they studied the world through a divine lens.  Christianity increasingly became anti-science the more science disproved their beliefs.

&gt; It's common for people to take the good parts, and define it as Christianity. But since it's no more faithful to the text than those who use it's commandments of violence and obedience, the WBC isn't more corrupted than the Unitarians.

Christianity = a follower of christ, and his teachings.  If you don't love thy neighbour then you aint a christian, everything else is just layers of shit human ""organisation"".  Corruption happens almost immediately away from this with use of gospel truths that were not the teachings of christ.

&gt; I would far rather it had been the Athenians. Or the Buddhists. Or Hindus.

Athenians would have enslaved everyone, Buddhists didn't give too hoots about social well being (you're a slave? Meditate and escape your earthly prison). And Hinduism (though again, contrary to original beliefs) led to castism, which is fucking appalling.  Racism without race.

&gt;  Not all religions contain such principles, and even more importantly, when religion is absent people are left to justify their own actions and principles to others in order to be followed. 

Jesus! When people are left to justify their own actions it is straight back to facism.  The law of the jungle.  Thank the sweet baby ganesh that christianity was the moral driver of European development and not facism (which I guess is just an entirely morally relative political system: we shit on the poor, they shit on the different.).

You're not wearing the same suits I'm wearing.  Of course they're not comfortable.  They're vaguely military in origin, and cut narrow.  They're really open in the front, with the button waaaayy down by the waist (another thing you complained about).  It's got high arm holes that make the shoulders stiff and cut your range of motion.

The standard American suit, in contrast, was called the ""sack suit"" originally.  They fit loose.  They button up higher.  They often have more buttons, too.  They have natural, unpadded shoulders.  They have wider, lower arm holes to keep range of motion.  In short, they sound like a solution to most of your gripes.

Not at all, they're protected by public interest and the laws of western liberal democracy, and should that not be enough, there is plenty of room in Europe and elsewhere for those critical of U.S actions and policy. 

The evidence does not support your position of intimidated or directed advocacy - these NGO's were, among other things: regularly and loudly critical of the U.S invasion of Iraq, the secret transportation of terror suspects to torture cells in the middle east and the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo (which by the way you wouldn't even know about to cite in this discussion if it weren't for such groups).

In addition to this, like i said in my previous comment, and which you ignored, we would (at the very least) have websites calling out such foul practice as U.S intimidation or coercion of these NGO's, and if it was happening as you say they would also be unlikely to push for prosecuting U.S presidents and other members of government as they have been doing.    

&gt;Persecuting isn't necessary, in the same way that persecuting media organizations isn't necessary to keep them in line. Merely withholding support and access is sufficient....

This is apples and oranges. Human Rights NGO's don't need government support, that's the whole point. they rely on public networks for both finances and for developing their investigations. ie... http://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are/faq#who-finances-ai

In fact, besides a hand full of driven/proactive students who did things on their own, the only scholarships that people in my class got outside of the military were gender or race based... which certainly didn't help out us whites or us men.

This conversion to US$ is totally moronic and killed even more my desire to play. The RMAHs will be separated by regions so why should players be punished by real world currency fluctuations if they live, in example, in Europe or Japan where players will not use US dollars to pay for their items?

Another personal matter is that I live in Brazil and I was hoping for a Brazilian or at least a South American server after Blizzard opened their Brazilian WoW realms last year, but now I'm skeptical.

To SELL PRODUCTS.

Nietzsche could not answer this, nor have I ever found a sufficient atheist response besides yours, the unbelievably weak ""C'mon. You are just born with it!"" Not true. You have your morals in the same way you have your religion. The accusations you level at religion (cultural, familial, inherited, etc) that paint it false can be leveled just as easily at your moral values.

&gt;It's simple, people with greed created religion to control masses of people.

Case in point: Nietzsche believed that weak people created morality to control the strong. Would you believe in your system of morality if you were born in a different family in a different part of the world? No, but you would swear whatever morality you were following was the correct path.

I've seen that Zeitgeist video many times. Most of it is bogus conspiracy theory. Much speculation of the Egyptian ""origins"" of Christianity has been based on the work of pseudo-Egyptologist Gerald Massey and [largely discredited amongst actual scholars.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_in_comparative_mythology) Other origin theories are similarly speculative. If you want to see those connections then you will, as is true with all conspiracy theories (the convenient thing about such theories is they can never be disproven). If you want to disregard all of Christian theology and history to try and tell them what they actually believe in, good luck. Type similarities are present of course, but they are not mysterious; Christians have always understood allegory and symbolism. Case in point- Christians consciously decided to celebrate the birth of Christ on the winter solstice. They celebrated that day because they saw the sun as a fitting symbol of Christ (and Christmas a fitting replacement for the pagan holiday). For some bizarre reason you are obsessed with convincing Christians that no, Christ is a symbol for the sun. We are looking at the same data, except where you see a mysterious cult origin shrouded in secret, I see what is obvious and what is documented in Church documents and theological writings throughout history. The similarity of Horus, or Mithras or whoever and Christ is not new. Christian scholars who were contemporary with the Mithraic cult wrote about it, as did those who saw similarities between Christ and other religious figures. Such similarities were traditionally seen as prefigurements of the true Christ, or diabolical imitations. Such similarities are not, however, new findings, nor are they substitutes for the claims of Christianity, which is definitely not sun-worship, but has for itself very distinct and unique religious claims whether you believe them or not. Whether you believe the claims of Christianity is irrelevant; but to claim that Christianity is ""basically the same"" as pagan sun worship or Hinduism or Egyptian mythology or astrology is just plain incorrect and remarkably ignorant. 

&gt;Absolutely not. It's sort of funny because the earth being flat theory and the earth being 6,000 years old comes from Europe. 

Why is that funny? Flat earth theory is not exclusive to Europe, many ancient myths about the world imagined it as flat or on the back of an animal. What is exclusively European in origin [is the truth that the earth is not flat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth), and that the earth is not 6,000 years old. In fact, just about anything that you really care about, from science to modern civilization came out of Europe, and not just Europe but Christian Europe specifically.

1.  We can't really be totally wiped off the planet.  Straight people have gay kids, so even if each and every one of us were gone, we would be back in a generation.  It's still horrible that such a thing could happen, but we're in a slightly different shade of grey than what happens in other genocides.  I don't condone genocide in any way, but you've got to admit that differing sexual orientations are impossible to wipe out entirely.  

2.  Every German I've ever met spends just about as much time learning about the Holocaust as they do math or English. That Germany didn't officially acknowledge GLBT victims until 2002 seems like a technicality.  I'm sure German people were very aware of that fact prior to 2002, and the claim that the EU is bad because it didn't acknowledge those victims until 2005 seems trivial.  Most EU countries are pretty advanced when it comes to GLBT stuff, and homophobia is hardly acceptable among most residents.  

3.  There are better ways to draw support than comparing ourselves to the Holocaust.  That comparison gets made all the time for other stuff.   It may be more appropriate than other comparisons given the GLBT people suffering in prison and being executed, but it's still an overused comparison.  Again, the Holocaust is horrible, but using that comparison risks putting us in the crowd of every other Tom, Dick and Mary that uses it too.  Pro-immigrant people say that draconian immigration punishments resemble Nazi Germany.  People who want to build a second story to their house that violates zoning laws are apt to draw that comparison too.  Given the importance of our cause, can't we come up with a more original argument?  

4.  Besides, lots of people even outside Germany sort of agreed that rounding up the Jews was a good idea.  (It wasn't).  The ""Jewish problem"" wasn't something Hitler conceived of, but that had centuries of support behind it (albeit misinformed support).  Do we really want to run parallel to that history?  We've got a similar climate today that says you can do things like pray away the gay, and that sodomy is can be a capital offense.  Making the argument that we're experiencing genocide invites the idea that we also have to wait until it's all over to fix everything.  We don't.  Drawing this comparison is not only a mild form of disrespect to other genocide victims, it's also suggests an ending I don't want us to be destined for.  

Overall, I guess I'm saying that there are better arguments supporting GLBT rights than this one.  I appreciate the author's intentions, but don't think the idea she's proposing is effective enough to change the minds of all the homophobes each and every one of us deal with.

Of course it is. But the reason I used that question was to show you that cost-per-square-foot is not a useful metric. Nobody shops that way for housing.

&gt; In fact, people are on waiting lists to pay 10 times as much for a 1-bedroom as they'd pay a 45-minute drive away in New Jersey.

But you know this is artificial scarcity. Rent control artificially reduces the available apartments, which means prices for the remaining non-controlled apartments goes up, and wait lists appear. If the economics were allowed to act naturally, there would be no wait lists. There would only be price movement.  

&gt; If indeed people didn't want to live in cities, then this would lead to empty homes throughout Manhattan.

That would be true if NO people wanted to live in the city. But of course we are not speaking in absolutes here. I never said that no people want to live in cites.  We're talking about trends and majorities. And the trend is that people are moving out of cities, and they have been doing  so for a long time, for the same reasons all along, and that trend isn't reversing. If anything NYC is an outlier, special among  American cities. 


-----

I didn't quite get your point in your followup discussion of Europe.  Also, you didn't respond to my point, around  the reality of the maturation of American cities: They were not ""altered"" to be less human friendly, as you said earlier. In general, from the beginning cities were factory friendly, not human friendly. The suburbs are what people have wanted all along. That isn't changing. There is nothing we in the US can ""go back to""; what we used to have was sweatshops, factories hard by houses, pollution, cramped living quarters, and labor exploitation. As soon as you pay people enough money, they will move out of that.

While it is clear that traditionally the more ""leftist"" parties and organizations were the most independentist, in the last few years, at least since 2006, there has been a huge, huge movement and change in the catalan society, and where the topic of independence was some kind of taboo, or something that concerned very few people, now it has become a central part (maybe the central issue in fact) of the catalan political and economical life. The thing is, that as you've said, catalan speakers or even nationalist people are not a majority of the population, and that's the thing; now, what the people in general wants, wether liberal or conservative, is to have a better quality of life, to be able to made and have more money, better infrastructure, and off course there is a part, a minor one, that also cares about the culture and language above all. Independence is transversal, from the left to the right, all parties now have an independentist sector, specially the current catalan government. The catalan president is an open supporter of catalan independence, as is all the government's ""core group"" of interior, economy and party secretaries, even the former president, Jordi Pujol, arguablily one of the most if not the most respected public figure in catalan politics, is openly in favor of independence. And all of those people are really wht you would call classic liberal conservatives. Some data I can offer you; for example a newspaper you cited, La Vanguardia: in 2010, there was a 47% in favor of independence, and 36% against http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20100718/53967434806/el-fallo-del-tc-catapulta-el-respaldo-a-la-independencia-que-roza-el-50.html

Then we had the CEO poll, the official ""poll"" institute that is, in 2011, which again surprised many people: 43% in favor, 28% against and 23% do not vote (btw, vilaweb is the most important online catalan newspaper, they just reported the facts, did not cook anything)

http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3904342/20110629/majoria-catalans-votaria-favor-independencia-barometre-ceo.html

Then in 2012, 27 january , el periodico, not a small leftist newspaper by any means: 53% in favor, 32% against 

http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/politica/els-partidaris-independencia-arriben-per-primer-cop-1358982

The thing is that, unlike in other parts of europe, let's say scotland, the proponents of continuing within spain don't have many arguments supporting their thesis, other than spanish nationalism, or some ""constitutional rap"". Economically speaking, it is clear that catalonia would do much better alone, or at least NOT within spain, which is the same, in the end. Socially speaking, the divorce of the catalan and spanish society happened long ago, the relationship is very bitter now and there is constant quarrelling everywere whenever a catalan brings up the topic of independence or catalan language and national identity. Off course you can feel catalan and spanish if you wish, but this option has been always minor, and now it is tragically shrinking into nothingness as the lines of identity are becoming clearer.

You can start on lower levels like the fact that atheists are discriminated against in schools, like Jessica Alquist (who is a teen getting death threats... imagine if this were 10 years ago prior to reddit being out there to be so supportive of her), then it goes on to atheism or the lack thereof in political laws that govern our schools and society, and then on to actual violence. It may seem ridiculous to think there is going to be an anti-atheist crusades, and personally I don't see that happening, but at the same time, I've read the transcripts of testimonies from my Jewish grandfather born in Greece and who fought in the Greek army during the beginning of WWII, and there wasn't an inkling of what was happening in the rest of Europe to the Jews was going to happen in Greece.

1. Music is good but it doesn't help much, if you get interested in a genre she disapproves of, she might take it away...

2. Having a journal helps wonders, write down everything you feel, every hurtful feeling, hateful one even. It's a great escape... but if she finds that, she might ban you from having one.

3. Religion is no way out either...

Look, i was there once too. I went to a psychologist who told me to do these things... the 1st 2 anyways and they worked but may parents messed it up for me and took it all away. Then to top it off she made it seem like it was my fault.... (funny side story, she ended up being my mother in-laws god mother!)
The religion part came to me later when i was dating someone I thought understood me. But i was wrong, the problem with the curch (and it was christian) was that ""suffering"" was a good thing because i was feeling what jesus would... excuse me but i was still depressed and hurting, with the person i was dating or without him. It didn't help.. sure it loosened the grip my parent's had on me but over all i was still miserable.

This is my advice to you, I'm not that old putting aside the fact that I'm already married...
Look for the help yourself. Find someone who will listen and give honest sound advice. Someone Logical. You'll want to talk to this person weekly if not daily, they have to have no bias point of view, meaning they can't be a friend or a family member of any kind. This person has to act and be like a personal psychologist without being tainted by real world psychs, &lt;&lt; I say that because now a days doctors only want one thing, your $ and a psychologist would take your whole college fund. They don't help much unless you live in the UK or Europe all together. It's hard to find honest helpers where I'm from... 
Furthermore, you have to get out, get out and LIVE, you're young, there are school functions, if not there will be awesome Places you can find by just walking around your town or city (fresno still surprises me at times)... you can take a train to a new location and explore. 
Do anything possible to feel good for yourself!!
Drugs and alcohol are not the answer, sure they will make you feel a bit euphoric, but that does not last, and afterwards it makes you feel lower than dirt. Don't listen to peer pressure about this...
Find your bliss... a subject, a hobby, a sport, anything that will get your mind off of things... meditate, if not go learn a martial art. Learn how to cook, play an instrument!
Lastly, stop telling your mom how you feel... it did me no good and unless she's willing to really really listen to you she wont change her mind about finding help. You are your only help, and it may sound scary but hell it's a lot easier when you realize that all you needed was... yourself, your logic, your own mind and thought. You can make the right choices without parenting. And let me tell you i learned this the hard way at 14... now my mom asks me for her mental help. She needs me to vent, not the other way around.

 Venezuela today received the last shipment of gold bars in an operation that repatriated 160 tons of the South American country's reserves of the metal held abroad, said Nelson Merentes, president of the country's central bank.

 The gold bars were transported in a caravan, broadcast on state television, to vaults at the central bank where street banners proclaimed ""Mission Complete.""

 President Hugo Chavez in August ordered the central bank to repatriate the country's gold reserves as a safeguard against instability in financial markets.

 The South American country, which has the 15th-largest holdings in the world, according to the World Gold Council, held 211 tons of its 365 tons of gold reserves in U.S., European and Canadian banks as of August.

 He said on Jan. 3 that the country would leave 15 tons of gold in banks outside the country.

 A central bank report released in August showed that Venezuela held gold reserves with the Bank of England, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays Plc and Standard Chartered Plc among other banks.

All these can now be treated by Vaser liposuction, also called Lipo Selection. It is an alternate technology to traditional liposuction. If you are healthy and seeking a fast, low-pain solution to losing stubborn fat deposits, Vaser Lipo Selection procedure could be your answer. 
   In the USA and Europe, this is called the ‘Lunch Break Procedure’ as it is quick and safe with a track record of over 300,000 procedures, done up to date without any serious complications. It is soon catching up in India as people, who previously had misconceptions about this treatment, are now convinced due to its success and popularity. 
   Optimally, patients who are treated by Vaser liposuction are in good physical condition and are looking for contouring or body sculpturing as opposed to using liposuction as a way to lose weight. The cosmetic surgeon uses Vaser ultrasonic probes, inserted into the fatty tissue to gently break the fat cells down. The vibration gently disengages and loosens the fat cells and ultimately emulsifies the tumescent fluid that has been infused into the body area. 
   Once the emulsification is in process, a small cannula is used to remove the liquid and the fat cells. Some of the local anesthetic remains in the tissue and that helps to reduce post-procedural pain. The abdomen is an area where the body stores a lot of fat. Therefore, this procedure is highly recommended to target the unsightly middle bulge and get you a desirable figure. About six to eight litres of excess fat can be safely removed from this particular area alone. 
   Aakruthi is among the few cosmetic surgery centers in India that offers this breakthrough surgical technique. Excess fat is eliminated from your hips, abdomen, back and thighs — all at the same time with this innovative third generation technology, under local anesthesia and using highly sophisticated equipment. Unsightly fat is now a thing of the past. Say hello to a sleek back, slim hips, trim thighs and a flat tummy. This is a sure way to boost your confidence and improve your figure.

 31 January 2012 Last updated at 06:44 ET Unemployment in the eurozone hit a record high at the end of last year, the Eurostat agency has said.

 The jobless rate in the 17 countries that use the single currency was 10.4% in December, unchanged from November's figure which was revised up from 10.3%. Some 16.5 million people were out of work in the eurozone in December, up 751,000 on the year before.

 The highest unemployment rate remains in Spain, while the lowest is in Austria.

 Unemployment has been rising throughout 2011, as the debt crisis in the region has continued.

 In December 2010, the unemployment rate in the euro area was 10%. Investment delays.

 In the 27 EU countries, the unemployment rate was 9.9% in December, with 23.8 million people out of work.

1,t5_2rete,0,c3mpzix,t3_p4xhg,1428275755,True,0,1,,True,"&gt; Who is in those unavailable apartments? Mice? 

Mice?  No.  The apartments are off the market. Rent-controlling the market distorts the market; it  removes apartments from the market.  It's not that people are not living in them. It's that they are not included in the market. This causes the price to go up everywhere. Seriously, take some time and think a little more before challenging every idea I present. 

&gt; And why does it work the same way in cities without rent control?

It doesn't. There are not waiting lists in cities without rent control. But you know this. In other cities, the waits may exist briefly, but they don't persist. Only in NYC is the wait list persistent. You know this.  Just a side note: This is getting to be like any other reddit conversation, where one party just challenges everything the other party says.  Which is not my thing.

The bottom line is, it's not about price per sq ft.  Price per sq.ft. does not say anything about where people want to live. Price per apartment also doesn't say anything. It's not instructive to compare the price of super-dense housing with the price of spread-out housing.  The thing that makes a statement about where people want to live is..... where people actually live.  In the USA,  that's mostly in the burbs. And it's growing.

&gt; I freely admit that what I'm about to say really says a lot about me and where I'm coming from, and possibly *very little about the topic.*

Well, yeah. But you don't need to rely solely on your own experience. There's real data you can rely on. The flux is from rural communities to cities and from there to the burbs. This is a longstanding, persistent trend. This is how people have been moving in the USA since 1840. The census tells this story.

All those people in the burbs are not hypnotized, they are not all under duress, they are not all being dragged to the suburbs. To suggest that ""they all regret it"" and ""they can't escape"" ... I know you prefaced it with ""this *might* just be my experience""... but come on.  You are clinging to your own perspective in the face of contrary evidence. 

Suburbanites live in the suburbs *on purpose*.  They *all* have real options to change their minds, but THEY DON'T (by and large).  More and more, Americans live in the burbs, notwithstanding your own social circle. That's what the data say.

&gt; Cities have existed long before the industrial revolution.

Yes, in Europe. But not in the USA.  Philadelphia existed before then, and Manhattan, and Boston, Montreal, and a few more cities. But most urban centers in the USA (and North America) grew around industrialization, and that's why they look unlike European cities.

I can see what needs to be done, but effectively no idea how to actually do it or what would be required. My idea is basically steam for movies/tv. You pay for it once, you can stream it on any computer you have wherever you are as many times as you like and then download it for a nominal fee. Now obviously it can't be expensive, say 5 bucks for a movie (10-15 to download), $1 for an episode of tv (say 3-5 bucks to download an episode, and 25 or 30 to download a whole season) just as a starting point. Now obviously even if this is super popular, there is no way that that is going to generate enough profit to both run the service, pay myself and any employees and kick back enough to the various networks and studios that give me permission to run my service. So you would need ads, which (in my opinion) isn't a terrible thing as long as they aren't overly pervasive. 15 seconds at the start of a show or movie, discreet banner ads on the service itself, as well as possibly a trailer reel before streamed tv and movie a la theatres. I wouldn't know how much to charge a company for ad space, assuming anyone would even pay for it before the service became popular if it ever did.

The entire idea behind the service is that it competes with the convenience and non-existent cost of pirating. So the library of available titles would have to be huge. It would also have to be fast... in the sense that a show would have to air on this service either at the same time or within 24 hours of being aired on cable. How do you get licenses for everything? How do you get major studios and networks to agree to air their stuff on your fledgling service that isn't going to make them the kind of money that cable is making them now? This isn't a money making scheme for the networks, this is almost entirely a ""don't download illegally"" option for the grudging pirates like myself who cant possibly afford to watch everything they want to watch. And the true ""malicious"" pirates who pirate just for the sake of it, will still exist. Just in writing this I have a much larger appreciation for the frustration that studios and networks must have. The difference being is that they have the initial capital and staff and knowledge and ability to implement such a service, but don't.

Add on top of that, you'd have to convince the ENTIRE television industry that this is indicative of what people are watching and allow networks to generate revenue similar to what the neilson system does. Initially I feel this is almost impossible. If it managed to catch on then yeah, networks are going to see that the for example 2 million viewers they have through neilson in a night for a particular show is actually more like 10 or 20 or 50. Stargate Universe was a good example of this, They were cancelled because they had virtually no ratings through nielson. The show got generally good reviews and tons of people watched it... but no one watched it on cable and so the network couldn't generate ad revenue from it and so couldn't justify paying to make the show. The entire concept rests on the ability to be able to generate enough revenue for the studios and networks that they could take it seriously as a replacement or at least a major player against cable.

This is what Internet TV is facing. It lacks coherence, it lacks everyone working together to get as much content as possible to as many people as possible. It has to work through competing networks that are protective of their IPs, and protective of their profit margins. How do you get Fox, CBS, Syfy (shitty as it's become), NBC, ABC, UPN etc... to allow not just their currently airing shows, but also their back catalog of shows to be shown on the same service, at a price that, at least initially, and possibly indefinately, won't gain them the kind of revenue they are gaining now?

That's not even getting into international broadcasting laws. I'm in Canada, the reason I can't view Hulu for example is a Canadian law that states that no foreign broadcasting can be done in Canada for free, or without paying exorbitant taxes/tariffs. This is done to protect Canadian broadcasters and for good reason, but it still puts added financial pressure on a service that intends to be international. That's just Canada, I'm not even sure of the laws in the UK or the rest of Europe, but I'm quite sure they have something similar... hell I'm sure the US has something similar. To have a truly international service i'd ideally like to have shows from all over the world, so getting through American red tape will be just as hard.


Wow, I didn't intend to write this much, and apparently could go for much longer. Suffice to say it's much easier to see what needs to be done than it is to actually do it.  I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a broadcaster, I'm not a producer, I'm not a programmer, I'm not an advertising expert, and I don't have connections in any of those industries. I can't do it. There are people that can, and maybe if enough people raise enough shit about it and provide enough constructive ideas then someone will step up and actually do it. There are enough diverse professions on Reddit, someone or a group of someones might see this and get it done. Needless to say I'd pay for it, and I'm very certain there are millions of other who would too.

Hinduism is the most direct descendant from ancient Veda's, which influenced ancient religion from Europe, to Egypt and Mesopotamia to India. 

Abraham came from a society which was aware of Veda's and of course from him we get Judaism (which shows Vedic influence, particularly the Torah, but not directly). 

Buddhism is a direct descendant from Hinduism, and although the Buddha exclusively focused on specific practices to living a good life and didn't elaborate a lot of theology, his conception of Karma and Reincarnation shows he had a similar world-view. 

Christianty shows a ton of Hindu and Buddhist influence, though it most obviously came from Judaism. The story of Krishna is too hard to ignore, and (like the Old Testament) makes predictions of a rebirth for ""Krishna"" as a messiah and full-filler of prophecy. Christ insistence on abstaining from excess, living a spiritual life, and a ton of his sayings and parables are very similar in theme to the Buddha. There is even evidence that during Christ's ""lost years"" he traveled the world and came in contact with Eastern religion, bringing those themes back to the Jews.

Of course, I am not convinced Christ actually existed, but what I mean is that whoever came up with those stories was aware they were blending Eastern and Western theologies. The Chruch has had a lot of influence on how modern Christianity looks, but if you actually look at the texts (including Gnostic texts), it is obviously a syncretic tradition.",t1_c3mq35r,,ILikeToDebate,,atheism,0,False,t1_c3movag,1328074085,

For example: Let's say a farmer has 200 acres of land he/she wishes to farm (in this case soy beans). At today's price, that's $463.05 (354.23 euros) per metric ton (1999 lbs and 15.97 oz). Let's say that it takes 10 metric tons (mt) to plant all of that ($4,630.50/3,518.14 euro). 

Unless you want to do it by hand, you're going to need a tractor (good one for this size is around $200,000/151,791 euros), plus the gas ($3.85 per gallon/$.99 a liter[.75 euros per liter/2.84 per gallon] and times it by 500 gallons (50 gallon tank just to say), which equals $1,925/1,460.99 euros. 

Now you need a combine/harvester, which one for this size can throw you back $268,000/203,400 euros, plus 100 gallons ($385/292.2 euros) to harvest everything. This ends the machine use of this example.

Counting for loss of crop over time (bad/never grew/etc.), which averages 2-5%, plus transport loss (roughly the same), you're guaranteed to lose 4-10% ($3,704.40-9,261/2,833.84-7,084.60 euros) based on luck alone, assuming prices hold steady (which they won't). 

Wild card time! Maintenance costs could run from 0 to ___. The weather may hamper things (shorten season, drought, too much rain, wind damage, etc.), with the possibility of knocking out a crop completely. Also, farmers tend to rent land (cheaper than paying property taxes) so that's included as well. Finally, there's labor costs (and for the sake of math and my sanity, I'll exclude it, since the US and the EU tend to do things differently).

While I don't know the costs per acre of gathering the soybeans (est. is $30.10/22.84 euros from 2008), you need to make that much in order to just break even per acre. Keep in mind, most farmers don't have the money upfront for everything, so they borrow from banks and have to pay back the loans with interest. Finally, this doesn't include pesticides and other materials needed to keep things off the crops. 

In conclusion, while this is a very bad example (missing a lot of data and information), the point is, farming is not a very profitable enterprise on its own, unless you have a lot of land, profitable product, and luck. 

**TL:DR (for the lazy)- It's expensive to farm.

 Unemployment figures increase as debt crisis continues to engulf the region.

 According to the Eurostat agency, unemployment across the eurozone hit record levels at the end of 2011, with the jobless rate standing at 10.4 per cent at the end of December.

 With 16.5 million people across the 17 single currency countries unemployed, an increase of 751,000 on the 2010 figures, it represents the worst unemployment levels since the euro was launched in 1999.

 Spain has the highest rate, with 22.9 per cent of people out of work, while Austria has the lowest with 4.1 per cent unemployed.

 The debt crisis that has flooded the region has seen unemployment rise steadily throughout 2011 and the problems show little sign of abating.

 Employment difficulties extend to the EU, with 23.8 million unemployed across the 27 EU nations.

 End Quote James Hardy IHS Jane's Defence Weekly A spokesman for the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium told the BBC they were disappointed, but stressed that the decision was not final and negotiations were still going on.

 ""However, we respect the decision of the Indian MoD. With the Eurofighter Typhoon, we offered the Indian Air Force the most modern combat aircraft available,"" he said.

 ""Based on the Indian government feedback, we will now carefully analyse and evaluate this situation together with our European partner companies and their respective governments.""

 He says various reasons were in play in the Indian decision, including diversifying from Russian hardware and contractual problems with other bidders.

 Indian Defence Minister AK Antony had earlier cautioned that this remained a ""Long process"" and that no deal would be signed before the end of March.

 One Indian defence ministry source confirmed to Reuters that the Rafale had been ""Much cheaper unit-wise"", adding: ""Moreover, the Indian air force, which is well-equipped with French fighters, is favouring the French.""

 The cylinders, from 1889 and 1890, include the only known recording of the voice of the powerful chancellor Otto von Bismarck.

 Until now, the only available recording from Wangemann's European trip has been a well-known and well-worn cylinder of Brahms playing an excerpt from his first Hungarian Dance.

 Bismarck ends the recording with some advice, apparently for his son Herbert, who heard the recording a few weeks later in Budapest, to live life in moderation.

 ""Bismarck's name is not mentioned in the recording, but I had collected all available information about his cylinder in the contemporary press, and the content of the cylinder matched perfectly.""

 The Wangemann cylinders are just the latest in an explosion of discoveries in early recorded sound over the last five years, said Tim Brooks, a sound historian in Greenwich, Conn.

 The ability to digitize old recordings and the use of new imaging techniques to map the grooves of damaged cylinder records without touching them has contributed to the onslaught, Mr. Brooks said, adding, ""You can actually hear history as well as read about it.""

 India mulls using rupee to pay for Iran oil imports.

 NEW DELHI - India said Monday it may use its own currency, the rupee, to pay for oil imports from Iran in the face of a US-led sanctions campaign aimed at forcing Tehran to abandon its nuclear programme.

 India has said it will continue to import oil from Iran, joining China in refusing to bow to intensifying US pressure not to do business with Iran.

 India pays Iran about $1 billion every month through Turkey for the 370,000 barrels a day of crude oil it buys from the world's fourth-largest oil producer.

 India's Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters in Chicago on the weekend that New Delhi would not scale down its petroleum imports from Iran despite US and European sanctions against the Islamic republic.

 ""Iran is an important country for India despite US and European sanctions on Iran."".

 Even by 2030, the world will need at least 50 percent more food, 45 percent more energy and 30 percent more water, according to U.N. estimates, at a time when a changing environment is creating new limits to supply.

 Efforts towards sustainable development are neither fast enough nor deep enough, as well as suffering from a lack of political will, the United Nations' high-level panel on global sustainability said.

 Although the number of people living in absolute poverty has been reduced to 27 percent of world population from 46 percent in 1990 and the global economy has grown 75 percent since 1992, improved lifestyles and changing consumer habits have put natural resources under increasing strain.

 The panel, which made 56 recommendations for sustainable development to be included in economic policy as quickly as possible, said a ""New political economy"" was needed.

 ""Let's use the upcoming Rio 20 summit to kick off this global transition towards a sustainable growth model for the 21st century that the world so badly needs,"" EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said in response to the report, referring to a U.N. sustainable development summit this June in Brazil.

 Among the panel's recommendations, it urged governments to agree on a set of sustainable development goals which would complement the eight Millennium Development Goals to 2015 and create a framework for action after 2015.

 India, which imports 12 per cent of its oil from Iran, will not scale down its petroleum imports from Tehran despite US and European sanctions against the Islamic republic, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has said.

 Speaking at the end of a two-day visit aimed at wooing U.S. investment, Mr. Mukherjee, on Sunday, said ""Some other countries, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, the other Gulf countries they also contribute but Iran contributes substantially.""

 ""We imports 110 million tonnes of crude per year. We will not decrease imports from Iran. Iran is an important country for India despite U.S. and European sanctions on Iran,"" the finance minister said.

 India, the world's fourth-largest oil consumer, is Iran's second-biggest oil client after China.

 Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Nirupama Rao last week said that India's purchase of oil from Iran has dropped slightly in last two years and is expected to drop further given the difficulties New Delhi might have in making payments through banks due to tough sanctions imposed against Iranian banks.

 Ms. Rao had said India was in touch with the U.S. Government and closely monitoring the developing situation concerning Iran, when asked about the pressure from the U.S. that India needs to reduce its dependency on Iranian oil.

 Germany's campaign to set the terms for saving the euro was heading for success tonight with EU leaders edging towards agreement on a new ""Fiscal compact"" for the single currency zone enshrining Berlin's insistence on rigour and discipline and establishing a new punitive regime for budgetary profligacy.

 The summit is expected to set out the terms of a new ""Fiscal compact"" to tighten controls on all eurozone economies, and summit chairman Herman Van Rompuy is determined to send out a tough message that the emergency aid to struggling eurozone economies will be backed up by solid measures to boost jobs and restore growth.

 Unsurprisingly, we have had no news at all on a Greek debt deal, and it seems as if negotiations in Brussels over new fiscal rules will also prove long and drawn-out.

 P&gt;1.51pm: Quick update on Portugal - its sovereign debt has continued to fall in value today, pushing up the yield on its 10-year bonds to a new high of 17.2%.As Peterbracken points out in the reader comments below, price changes in the secondary bond market don't have an immediate impact on Portugal's borrowing costs - but do reflect how much it would have to pay if it sold new debt.

 Another worrying development today - the cost of insuring Portuguese debt against default has hit a new record high.

 On the to-do list: discussing ways of catalysing economic recovery in Europe, and signing off two new treaties - creating the fiscal compact that will tie eurozone members to tougher budget rules, and establishing the European Stability Mechanism, Europe's new bailout vehicle.

 LONDON/HAMBURG, Jan 30 - European Union sanctions have paralysed food import deals to Iran leaving about 400,000 tonnes of grain held up on at least 10 ships outside Iranian ports for as long as three weeks, trade sources say.

 The tougher trade embargo has meant major EU banks have pulled back from financing grain shipments to Iran, a major importer of foodstuffs and animal feed.

 ""The myriad of sanctions have worked to the point where the Iranian banking system is virtually defunct, thereby not allowing international trade houses to receive workable letters of credit,"" one European grain trader said.

 Iran imports around 4.5 million tonnes of grain a year, including about 3.5 million tonnes of corn, the leading world grain for animal feed, according to International Grains Council figures.

 The trade source said up to 350,000 tonnes of grain, especially milling wheat from Russia and corn and feed wheat from Ukraine, were stuck outside ports.

 ""There are now 11 to 12 ships waiting to unload. About 90 percent of the cargo is grains, mostly from Russia and Ukraine or elsewhere in the Black Sea region,"" another grain trader said.

Really, the tl;dr is that this whole list is absurd and supported only by personal religious opinion and sexism against both genders, thinly-veiled by casting claims of sexism on others, while actual facts are ignored.

First, I'd like to just put in a word about the tone.  The author is clearly trying to appeal to modern women--sarcastic remarks like ""oh, it must be women's fault"" to insinuate that people who promote birth control availability are victim-blamers when really the Catholic Church is historically victim-blame central, or to imply that the Church is a hotbed of women's rights, when really it opposes them.  Let's be clear--entirely aside from firing priests who so much as hint that the Vatican should even *consider* female ordination, the church doesn't want women to be able to make these decisions for themselves.  You'd think, by the way, that if all these reasons were so convincing and the author were so pro-women-as-equal-human-beings, he would just let women make their own damn decisions because the facts are so clear and women are equal people capable of logic and making their own decisions.  

1.  The pill does not ""more than double"" or quadruple breast cancer risk.  It increases risk by 10-30 percent-percent (that is, a 10% risk becomes 11% or 13%), according to [data from over 50 studies](http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/CurrentorRecentUseofBirthControlPills.html), as opposed to the single study cited here (evidently the author or someone he cited just trolled for the highest number).  Plenty of other voluntary activities and medications with other useful effects increase cancer risk in this range.  We don't ban them, and we don't don't drape our banning in ""protect the poor womens"" language--we assume that people and their doctors will decide when the risk is appropriate for them and when it is not.  You know, like adults, because the author of this article seems to like claiming how woman-friendly he is.  By the way, the pill also has some positive health effects, including lowering the risk of endometriosis and complications of the same--and lowering the risk of pregnancy and all the complications that can come with it, especially unplanned pregnancies.  Obvious, but worth mentioning

2.  The connection of Margaret Sanger to wiping out black babies is absurd but persistent propaganda, and is in fact based on a blatant out-of-context quote that gets passed around (it's easily searchable).  In a letter explaining why she felt a black doctor would be appropriate to a position at a clinic, Sanger wrote that there have been expressed fears that a eugenics approach might be their motivation, and they thought having a black doctor would help allay those unfounded fears.  However, just a fragment of this is often taken to imply some sort of eugenics motivation (it's what one of his sources cites).  (Also, really?  In previous decades male doctors and advertisers could get away with being more obviously sexist; news at 11!)  But even if this were the case, even if the pill were *originally* steeped in racism and sexism, why does that mean that we cannot use it now?  Lots of drugs, lots of medical advances, were made by unethical experimentation or questionable ethical decisions--consider for example how many medical advances came from insufficiently consented experimentation before standardized ethical rules or illegal cadaver theft and dissection, or tales like those of Henrietta Lacks.  These origins are not an argument for why women should not instead take the pill and use it to empower themselves to make their own reproductive decisions--in fact, it would be something of a ""take that!"" to turn it around and use it as a way to empower both women and minorities to have families on their own terms, which in turn statistically makes them more likely to be financially successful.  It's suspicious that the author wants to hold only the pill to this standard, and not other drugs.  

3.  Yes and no.  Research has suggested that women who first start dating while on hormonal contraception did score lower on measures of sexual satisfaction--but they scored *higher* on measures of happiness with their partner's stability and parenting skills, and were less likely to break up or divorce.  Given the Catholic Church's stances, I find it strange that ""sexual satisfaction"" could outweigh ""better parenting"" and ""less divorce"".  Probably why the author neglected to mention it.  Honest, that.

4. This is false when the data are properly controlled, at least as far as there are current data, as I noted above (I love how their source is not a scientific study, by the way, but *unofficial results* posted on the web page of the organization ""Physicians for Life"".  Really trying hard for objectivity, there.)

5.  Again, funny that a Catholic organization is going to rate ""bad sex"" as a defining reason.  I think we should leave the decisions about sex life to the people whose sex life it is, not an organization of celibates--and again, let's weigh sex life against divorce in a Catholic worldview.   Again, I must emphasize that it's really odd that the author seems to be trying to seem pro-woman and feminist, but is using all these arguments to support the conclusion that women who happen to work for Catholic organizations or go to Catholic colleges shouldn't be able to weigh these points for themselves as the author (a man, natch) has, but rather should be barred from making the decision for their own good.  Real progressive, there.  (Furthermore, 3-5 should all be one point; this is just inflation to make it seem like there are more reasons.)

6.  This is where the sexism really starts to shine through.  Think of the poor men!  Women shouldn't be able to decide what they want to put into their bodies, because of how that makes men feel.  And really, it's two-way sexism.  Not only should we ban women from controlling their bodies because men's sexual reactions, but apparently the author thinks men are so primal that they must be *driven* to engage in confused and destructive behaviors if they sense that there are no impregnatable women nearby.  (It's worth noting that this has not been backed up with any human data).  Bonus points for attacking modern men as being emasculated and implying there's just one right type of manhood.  (Note, also, that the video features one Dr. Janet Smith, a Catholic seminary teacher who sits on various Catholic councils and is a ""Chair of Life Ethics"" and whose doctorates (the only named one of which is not in science but ""Christian ethics"") are *honorary*.  She has no credentials to be making arguments from behavioral science, and conveniently does not cite sources who do have any  Also, she makes a shit-ton of money off this stuff).

7. This is 100% dependent on whether you buy into the church line on when life begins.  But even if you do, most birth control pills act by preventing ovulation and conception; only a few prevent implantation, and those as a last line.  So this is only an argument against some birth control pills, and is entirely dependent on individual faith.  So why are we taking away choices from people again?

8.  The drinking water argument is the only valid one he's raised.  However, this is true for many types of medications--it's why they say not to flush your old drugs down the toilet.  Why is it that he's only concerned about this one type?  Oh, right.  (Also, there are ways to mitigate these issues without taking, again, medical choices out of the hands of women, and a lot of them are good for water sheds in general).  Also, while he starts with a real argument here, his first yet, he quickly flies off the handle with the slippery slope fallacy that we should stop birth control because it might give the government ideas about sterilization.  Commonly prescribed blood thinners are also rat poison; should we take those away in case Obama wants to taint the water supply of certain states with them and kill off the opposition?

9.  Again with the ""no, I like women, I swear"".  If your problem is that the onus of birth control is on women (totally disingenuous, by the way, given that the Catholic church is against birth control, full stop, and thus would be against male birth control), the solution is not to take options away from women.  It is to provide options for men.  Pretending to care so much about the treatment of women while simultaneously advocating taking their health decisions out of their hands is old hat and it's wearing thin in this production.  How about, if you care about women so much, you let them make their own decisions?

10.  Again, with the same speaker who has no credentials in epidemiology, biology, medicine, or reproductive science, merely an honorary doctorate in ""Christian ethics"".  Again, with the not citing facts or relevant authorities but spouting the Catholic line with no evidence.  And the reason for this is that birth control access and information about it *decreases abortion rates*.  The fact is that in the raw data of some a couple big studies looking at contraceptive use and abortion rates in certain nations, *before the data were controlled* for factors like fertility rates, etc., there was a positive correlation.  When the data were controlled for compounding factors, the opposite was true, and other studies have confirmed--for example, while abortion rates were high in eastern Europe, even where illegal, increasing access to contraceptives [dropped those rates](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/world/12abortion.html).

 The word is that ACTA probably doesn't change U.S. law.

 Why ACTA Is Unacceptable ACTA was negotiated in secret - For me, this is reason enough to oppose any legislation or regulation.

 The ACTA committee is not accountable - ACTA creates a body outside of national and even international bodies, called the ""ACTA Committee."" The committee would not be accountable to the people governed by the agreement.

 While President Obama is carrying the torch for ACTA right now, the treaty goes back to October 2007 when the U.S., Japan, Switzerland and the European Community said they'd be working on a new intellectual property enforcement treaty.

 The word is that ACTA probably doesn't change U.S. law.

 Why ACTA Is Unacceptable ACTA was negotiated in secret - For me, this is reason enough to oppose any legislation or regulation.

 The ACTA committee is not accountable - ACTA creates a body outside of national and even international bodies, called the ""ACTA Committee."" The committee would not be accountable to the people governed by the agreement.

I did not write it down, but in Northern Europe the amount of people outside increases a lot during summer, I'm not sure, but have a vague memory that the percentage of rape outside increases about half, even then, it is clear that most rape cases happen indoors - and these cases are of course included in results saying the rapist is someone the woman knows in 8 cases out of 10. It is also worth to note that even though rape by someone close by the woman is the most common type of rape, that is also the type where the victim is least likely to report it to police, while rape committed by unknown rapist is the type that seems to be reported most frequently - strengthening the assumption that outdoor-rape-by-unknown-rapist is the least common form of rape. In the least mentioned cases, about half of the victims had consumed alcohol. 

I see what you mean and agree with the logic. However, there is nothing to my knowledge that shows that the risk at being attacked in parks IS particularly high. It undoubtedly exists, but the question is how high that risk is. For instance, people seem to think that Central Park in New York is a bad place to be at late hours while it in fact seems to be among the more safe places in the city. The thing is that it is not reasonable to expect there to be a rapist behind every bush. Most women passing a park on their way to/from work, walking their dog or going out jogging are NOT assaulted. In fact, statistically speaking, young men are much more prone to be subjected to violence when outside than women. Still, we are not constantly telling men to not go out alone. Again, I am not saying women should go alone to sketchy places just because. Nothing wrong with being careful. What I'm trying to get through is that it is ridiculous to have outside rape by unknown person to represent what rape is and how it happens - when that is not the case! I believe that if more focus was put on the most typical types of rape their occurrence might just drop (at least those in the category where rapist is a date/acquaintance rather than a boyfriend or ex). Also, if women knew that to be one of the big risk factors they could avoid... it couldn't hurt. Now we are creating a false image of one being fine as long as one does not visit desolate places alone. Putting the focus on park rapes by a stranger when it being rare (regardless the reason) is misdirecting the resources. ",t1_c3mrbt5,,misscastaway,,TwoXChromosomes,0,False,t1_c3mm96y,1328083717,

The smallest unlimited data plan comes with 1000 minutes and 1000 texts, and costs (in the super SIM variant - only the SIM card) 12 euros a month.

Keep in mind, 'unlimited' here means that beyond a certain amount you get throttled down in speed.

bob, which terrorobe mentioned, is a good low cost carrier operated by A1, the largest telecom provider in Austria. Among the plans there, there is one where you only pay-as-you-go; no monthly fee, and you pay a flat 4 cents per minute or text. You can add a data plan to that, which is 4 euros a month for a Gigabyte; if you go over that you automatically purchase another Gigabyte for 4 euros. As A1's low cost option it naturally uses A1's network, which has the distinct advantage of generally having good coverage even in rural areas. If you won't get out of urban areas too much, there's in my experience little difference between carriers.

As for living in Vienna, bicycles are a viable mode of transportation. The city has extensive bike lanes to my knowledge.
Other than that, the public transit system kicks ass as well. We have a comprehensive network of trams, buses and subway lines which usually enables you to go from any one point in the city to another in 30 minutes, tops. There are monthly tickets available, which cost ~50 euros flat for a month of usage (I'd have to look up the exact number - I live outside of Vienna, so my monthly ticket is more expensive).

Coffee shops.. well, they're all over the city (and you tend to find them more concentrated the more you get to the city center). Popular choices are the Hawelka, or the Café Schwarzenberg.

As for pubs, two popular ones I can name off the top of my head are [Charlie P's](http://www.charlieps.at/) and [Flanagans](http://www.flanagans.at). There are a number of other Australian and Irish pubs around. As for other regular bars, I'm not too well educated on those ;)

Spices, specialities, foods and fruits otherwise hard to come by, there's a good chance you'll find it there, or in the number of import stores surrounding the area.

I've heard good things about this series though, with the apparent exception of Asohka Tano, though I'm in no position to judge.

As for Lando and the Lady luck... I've always assumed he was of an age with Han, therefore he would have been quite young, either a child or an early teenager during the events of the Clone Wars. Han didn't really become a smuggler until he dropped out of the imperial naval academy after rescuing chewy, implying that he (and by extension Lando) would have been around 18 or 20 well after the events of the prequel films. Age is never explicitly stated in any of the novels for either Han of Lando that I can recall, though it is mentioned a couple of times that Leia was 18 at the time of A New Hope and that Han was considerably her senior but not in a creepy way, so if I had to guess, I'd say somwhere between 25 and 30 puting him between 7 and 12 during the events of Revenge of the Sith. Extrapolating that Lando is within a few years of Han's age give or take a few years, the oldest I would put Lando in this time period would be 17... far too young to be buying his own ship. Its also stated that he bought the Lady Luck to replace the Falcon, so he would have owned the Falcon for a least a few years.

First, when is our turning point from ""pre-Christian Europe"" to ""Christian Europe""?

Slavery: There was serfdom, as another poster pointed out, throughout the height of Christian domination in Europe. Slavery and the much more despicable slave trade took place for roughly three centuries under Christian rule. Imperialist monarchs ravaged foreign lands under the auspices of ""civilizing"" and ""saving"" the savages of non-Western lands.

So, give me one example of slavery in [a] European society that ceased because of Christianity. Hell, I'll even remove the causation element: just give me some circumstantial evidence.

1. What the hell is morality, as an initial point? Since when is ""morality"" a good thing? The examples you cited are among the most nearly universal values out there. Pre-Christian European societies hadn't developed rules against stealing, murder, etc.? Are you serious?

And are you aware what ""law"" is? When was this law established?

2. Pan-Europeanism even now has only a tenuous grasp on European society. There's no doubt that the Holy Roman Empire unified (as well as divided) various European societies. But that's about five centuries after Christianity was accepted into Roman society. That's a long time. And you seem to reject such a timeframe in the context of slavery.

If you're looking for cheap flights and such, check websites like Kayak.com and studentuniverse.com. 

Oh, and check out Rick Steve's guide to Europe if you're going there. He has some great tips out there for that entire region.

If you're looking for a more relaxing vacation sans exploring cities and such, check out deals that are all-inclusive. A week in Mexico with flight, food, drinks, lodging, and all can be as low as $700 or lower if you plan it right.

Expedia.com seems to have great deals on occasion. However, the fares and fees of the airlines are what screw you over. But the good thing is that now they are legally required to include all fees in the total price.

Oh, and one more thing. Groupon has partnered with Expedia and created Groupon Getaways. Follow this closely! You'll find a week in Jamaica for two for $500! It depends on the region as well that you're looking for.

Best of luck and don't be afraid to ask for more specific details from me if you'd like.

To your question (and btw. I really appreciate you profiling yourself so neatly):

Yes, as eveninghope writes, SEA would be much much cheaper living, and considering a bit chunk of your cash will automatically be eaten up by the plane fair wherever you might go, that is a big thing to consider.

However, I would still like to present the idea of Europe to you. Especially considering you speak German, I think this is a great opportunity to perfect it. 

I am thinking a route roughly like Berlin - Dresden - Carlsbad - Prague - Cesky Krumlov - Vienna - Graz - Salzburg - Munich.
Taking into account that Frankfurt is Germany's biggest airport and should get you the cheapest plane ticket from and to your home airport you should fly in and out of Frankfurt. 

Now. I will try and sell you this route :)  


* Although you mention you did not want to bother: consider renting a car for a day each for your trip from Frankfurt to Berlin, and from Munich to Frankfurt. German Autobahn!!! The greatest public roads in the world! No speed limit! I am not saying you should rent a Porsche and do 200mph (though if you experience a windfall in the next weeks, please, absolutely do it!); a decent mid sized car like an Audi A3 will not totally kill you and still be an amazing ride. Or perhaps, take the Autobahn on one of the two legs, and the high-speed ICE since you are into trains on the other (book it several weeks in advance online and you should get a hugely reduced price).
You could also consider getting some passengers at http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/ to chip in. If you get 2 people you should be able to cover at least half of the rental cost. Plus: the people using it are 95% students, so you will meet people your age.

* Berlin. arguably the most bustling and hip city in Europe, possibly the world these days. Living and eating is top notch, and (for Western European standards super cheap). Massive amount of some of the finest museums in Europe. In a way the city itself is a museum (Checkpoint Charley, Reichstag, Brandenburger Tor etc.)

* If you feel like some nature and hiking, you could take a few days to the [Mecklenburgische Seenplatte](http://www.mecklenburgische-seenplatte.de/) ([random pretty pic](http://jugendherbergen-mv.de/uploads/pics/mb_seenplatte_41.jpg))

* [Carlsbad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlovy_Vary) (Czech Republic): picturesque little town where Charles IV  would go for the mineral springs and spas. Worth a one day stop to chill.

*Prague. Gorgeous city with rich history, great food, beautiful women, great nightlife. The Czech republic is quite affordable, too. One of my favourite museums ever in the castle, the Lobkowicz Museum.

* [Cesky Krumlov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesky_Krumlov). Little town in Southern Bohemia living up to the region's name. You will feel like having taken a time machine back to the 1600s. Swim in the Moldau, and jump off the cliffs a few hundred meters upstream from the city center. You could also go paddling or kayaking in it.

* Vienna. Oh beautiful Vienna. Capital of the Habsburg Empire. Another city that is a museum in itself. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Museumsquartier, Albertina. Cool nightlife again. Chill out on the ""beach"" on a side arm of the Danube at [Strandbar Hermann](http://www.strandbarherrmann.at/).

* Take the train through the edges of the Alps to Graz. medium sized student town, with lots of wonderful cafes.

* Salzburg. Home of Mozart and the eponymous chocolates. (and another train ride through the Alps where you could always add a stop to do some hiking or canyoning).

* On the way from Salzburg to Munich, stop for some nature again at the epic [Konigssee](https://www.google.com/search?q=k%C3%B6nigssee&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=s8s&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ei=IBMpT5izHo3LrQeVqKnZAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=614) ([moar](http://imgur.com/gallery/oIoSN), [another pic](http://imgur.com/r/earthporn/XI9Gq)).

* Munich. Home of the Oktoberfest. In fact, why not start your trip in August and experience all the places I mentioned thus far during the prettiest time of summer, then end your trip in September during the Oktoberfest? Deutsches Museum, the best museum of engineering and sciences in Germany (you being into cars and trains makes me think you should enjoy it) is another highlight in Munich. If you like BMWs I think they have a museum, as well.

* If you like beer you will have spent several weeks in 2 of the 3 countries regularly named as the countries with the best beer in the world (the third would be Belgium).

* fantastic food, which is not too exotic and weird for your stomach. Berlin and Czech republic will be very affordable, too.

* perfect your German learning from native speakers! Wrap your ears around the charming Viennese dialect.


Man, I am so jealous already lol. What a great trip this would be. Great balance of quiet, nature segments, and city living... ;)

You are leaving out huge swaths of Israeli or pro Israeli portions of your timeline, from the pro-Israeli push of Iranian sanctions to the Israel switch on Iran after the first gulf war.  See below where Israel was pushing the US to be friendlier on iran during the 1980's, then flipped in the 1990's.  Also, see the information below on the sanctions. 

You have been told how you are [misreading a 1955 document](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/djo8z/why_is_the_worlds_worst_violence_ignored_congo/c10shxk) and how these policies dont work in the current oil markets, or how Brzezinski goes against this idea of control.

Your biggest problem is noticing this, in the appropriately named [Oil industry sees China winning, West losing from Iran sanctions](http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE80Q0OA20120127),  *""""What we say is that oil is fungible. Iranian oil will still find its way into the market, to Asian markets, China and possibly at a lower price,"" a top Saudi source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.""*  
In other words, the concept of controlling where the oil goes, like a selective embargo to a country like China, doesnt work.  Plus, you admittedly didn't even know what the word fungible meant, one of the key concepts in understanding the global oil market. [(context)](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/djo8z/why_is_the_worlds_worst_violence_ignored_congo/c10vktf) You can try to shut down Iran from exporting, but All the big players are going to have to get on board for it to really work.  By the way, heres [part of the reason](http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=106549) why the EU went on board.

Ok, lets go on, first, to the problem behind your statement *""2003-9 Israel calls for Iran to be bombed, launches practice raids,""* and how it leaves out the Israelis.

&gt;""Within three to five years, we can assume that Iran will become autonomous in its ability to develop and produce a nuclear bomb, without having to import either the technology or the material,"" Netanyahu said. ""[The nuclear threat] must be uprooted by an international front headed by the US. It necessitates economic sanctions on Iran.""

[1995](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/world/iran-may-be-able-build-atomic-bomb-5-years-us-israeli-officials-fear.html) The reassessment of Iran's nuclear potential is now described by Israeli officials as the most serious threat facing their country.

[1996](http://www.salon.com/2010/12/05/israeli_predictions_iranian_nukes/) “On February 15, 1996, Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak told members of the UN Security Council that Iran would be able to produce nuclear weapons within eight years.”

[1996](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/opinion/09iht-edcohen.html) Shimon Peres “Iran is the center of terrorism, fundamentalism and subversion and is in my view more dangerous than Nazism, because Hitler did not possess a nuclear bomb, whereas the Iranians are trying to perfect a nuclear option.”

[1997](http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-05/news/mn-55699_1_nuclear-weapons-program) ""They are going to make it in the end,"" a senior Israeli intelligence official said, ""but it will be the middle of the next decade."" The delay, the result in part of U.S. pressure on Iran's nuclear suppliers, could ease international concern that Israel will follow through on threats to attack Iran's nuclear sites. Iran denies it is developing nuclear arms.

[1997](http://www.israelfaxx.com/webarchive/1997/09/97fax0925.php)  Netanyahu ""Iran is on the verge of becoming a fundamentalist world power,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned this week. ""Its efforts to procure weapons of mass destruction and long-range delivery systems may be the most dangerous development in the 21st century.""

Devil's Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam(297)

&gt;Within the Reagan administration, a small clique of conservatives, and neoconservatives, were most intimately involved in the Iran-contra initiative, especially those U.S. officials and consultants who were closest to the Israeli military and intelligence establishment


Treacherous alliance: the secret dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States (110)
&gt;The world was a different place in 1983 than it is today.  As a special envoy of president Ronald Reagan, Donald Rumsfeld was courting Saddam Hussein in Baghdad; Israel was lobbying Washington not to pay attention to Tehran's calls for the destruction of the Jewish State; neoconservatives were masterminding a rapprochement with Khomeini’s government; and iran- not the US - was considered out of touch with reality for fantasizing about a rising Shia Crescent. 

----

An interesting neoconservative here is Leeden.  He flipped hard on Iran once Israeli policy turned to antagonistic. Here's his positions before the first gulf war.

[1987 NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/30/world/key-sections-from-senate-select-panel-on-iran-arms-affair.html?pagewanted=4)

&gt;Secretary of State Shultz learned of Ledeen's activities and, in a message date 5 June, complained to McFarlane that Ledeen's contact with Israel had bypassed the Department of State. Shultz noted that Israel's agenda regarding Iran ''is not the same as ours'' and that an intelligence relationship with Israel concerning Iran ''could seriously skew our own perception and analysis of the Iranian scene.'' He added that we ''are interested to know what Israel thinks about Iran, but we should treat it as having a bias built in,''

Ledeen 1988

&gt;The United States, which should have been exploring improved relations with Iran before Iran's acceptance of the United Nations-sponsored cease-fire, should now seize the opportunity to do so. . .  The Iranian advocates of a war to the death against Iraq have been discredited by Iraqi battlefield victories, by the recent military successes of the Iraq-supported anti-Khomeini Iranian fighters and by the humiliation inflicted on Iran by the American military in the Persian Gulf

So I would say that our military is pretty high-tech. We also have a central role when the EU and USA together arm for future cyber war. Our regular/traditional army is also pretty high tech.

All that said, Sweden has really downsized its military over the years and some parties would like downsize it to zero. I would like to say that the quality is really really high, both on the net and in the traditional way, but the army is too small to defend the country by itself and would be overrun rather quickly (according to my not very educated impression). So we would be depended on EU and the USA if we where to be involved in a war. Then again, that would be a world war, and you would probably have joined before we did.

In the schools they teach (as I remember it at least) that Sweden tried to be as neutral as possible during the whole world war 2. We helped both sides to maintain our neutrality. (Swedish companies sold iron to Germany, but we also let the Allied forces spy on the Nazis and their allies.) We are also taught that Sweden saved many German and Danish Jews, but also from other countries. I also remember something about how they said that we helped Finland.

Now when I looked it up to see what you said about Swedes joining the German SS and the Finnish army: Yes, there where Swedes that on their own free will enrolled the German SS, it was about 180 people.

For people living in Europe, the closest Amazon EC2 region is in Ireland.  Everybody living in UK will have a grand time but I'm not sure what ping times are from Sweden or anywhere else to that datacenter.  Maybe we can setup a test for everybody in Europe.

For others, I'm not sure results would be so great:

* Closest EC2 region to Australia is Singapore - I'm fairly certain that even if you live in a major city in Australia, lag will be bad.
* For Canada, if you live near Vancouver I think you'd be fine (you'd be connecting to Seattle), *but* if you live near Montreal and Toronto, you'll probably be connecting to Virginia which won't be so good.

It also seems unlikely that something that lasts 2000 odd years through revolutions and political fads could ever be threatened by anything like 60s radicalism or political correctness.

I look at the world and see powerful countries located around the temperate zones of the Earth and poor countries focused around the equator. I can't think this is some historical fluke. It looks like geography matters a lot.

Regarding seeing the importance of war in the history of civilization, I don't mind this. War is important. And you can view Western domination in a dispassionate way as a dominant imperial culture. But then its hard to take his moralising seriously when he turns to politics.

The video was fascinating to watch. It really was a specific moment. I did wonder what a summary of his take on things since then has been since then. I did find his presumption of US military power, economics and moral supremacy baffling from my centrist European in 2012 perspective. Though I share a skepticism that something has been found better than the liberal democracy in its many forms.

I'm never sure how much culture matters. Perhaps a lot in the short term and less in the long run.

now with this evolution in human behavior and logic and the creation of ""discussion, law, and punishment"", for us, it is not moral to kill someone for these kind of things anymore, yet we still see those same countries that are bashing us, like england, france, germany, japan, america, and europe overall, doing things more hideous than those in the past, like colonization, profit invading....etc.

In the presence of dogs, muslims should take care not to get their saliva on themselves.

war is not longer neccesary in so many cases. i know this is an american website, and your whole society is dealing with the topic war in a way i will never understand. and as a german i have a really strong opinion on what is going on. both of my grandfathers went to war and one of them told me everything about it in an truly and hurtful hornest way. the other waked me up often during sleepovers with his screams of horror at nights but never talked to me about his time in war. but both of them said, never go to war or join the army son. my grandfather told me besides from beeing in the war itself, the hardest thing he has to deal with, is the fact that it all seems so point- and useless in hindsight.
to know that you have fought and seen a lot of friends die in horrible ways for the wrong cause is something he cant get over for the rest of his life.
i think this is the cause why so many people, even after knowing the true facts, are still supporting the cause. nothing is more hurtfull then to admit that it is all wrong and pointless and loved ones died for no reason.

 i used to travel a lot through europe and had the oportunity to speak to so many people from so many nations. and it always baffeld me how indoctrinate some of them were in so many aspects and never made a real afford to get their facts straight.
and in so many cases its all there. all the facts to really understand why such things happend. all you need to do is to make an afford to find it out by yourself and not to use the common media to edjucate yourself. 
why bush went to war is pretty obvious if you look at the facts. 
why they invaded iraq is also pretty easy to understand. 
why israel still fights and still has such a good image in general is hard to understand but if you look at their society and history its also understandable.  
why germany is doing his politics with the euro and the worldbank is also pretty easy to understand if i look up the straight facts. why greece is bankrupt and why they still spend their most money for the army. its all their. all you need to do is to stop listening to brainwash media and look it up in the books.

most people will not believe me or think im a lunatic. but its all there. but im not rich nor i have power. all i have is my life and the luck to live where i live. i will keep talking and try to do the best i can. i want people happy. i want them to live their life the way they want and if they die it is caused by the universe, missfortune or whatever. but i dont want them to die because some old men want to get richer and more powerfull.

I live in Denmark and studying is free for Danes, because you pay for education of all via taxes. The upside to this is of course that anyone in principle can get a doctoral degree and what limits you are your brains and willingness to study. Of course the books still cost money and they are often not cheap, but this is only an issue for college and up. Everything below that is free.

The downside is that government meddles in how education works and teachers spend as much time on administration as on teaching, so it doesn't really help on the quality. Also, many universities are often financially strapped and they are making cuts every year.

I'm not sure how it works for foreigners paying for school here. I went to engineering school a decade ago and it was required that you knew Danish as no courses were ever taught in English. Some English-only speaking class mates quickly dropped out.

Another problem, which I hope is going to be fixed, is that we have some really stupid laws regarding foreigners staying long term in the country. They must uphold to a point score system, requiring them to do various silly things in order to be allowed to stay long term in the country.

Do some research and figure out how to apply directly to these institutions and see if it will work for you, I'm sure there are institutions that will be able to transfer credits back to your school at home (depending on your major).

Uma familia pode muito bem ter um defice de orçamento de 3% no final do més se conseguir ganhar mais 3% no proximo més.
Um defice de 3% como o Euro exigia não teria efeito tendo em consideração que supostamente o cresciamento do PIB da zona euro seria de 3% ou pelo menos por ai perto. Mas quando se tem um defice de substantivamente maior que o crescimento do PIB, os mercados claro que vêm que o risco é muito maior.
Um defice é de 3% e o crescimento do PIB é de 2%  é muito diferente de um defice de 8% com um crescimento de 1 ou 2%.

É verdade que as economias e vivem do crescimento continuo do futuro, mas,(e este é o grande mas), o defice não pode ultrapassar o crescimento dessa mesma economia.
Alguem acredita que a economia de Portugal vai crescer assim? Nem nos anos de de vacas gordas antes da crise portugal consegui crescer á media europeia.

Lot higher pop density. The suburbia basically means the next village becomes a commuter village, then incorporated into the city (because of taxes), then the next village is a commuter village. So people find some cheap old cottage in the village, tear it dow, build a house, or something like that. Doing that commercially would be difficult as it would coordinating between 100 different houses built in 100 different streets. So commercial projects tend to be apartment houses on former pastures and suchlike, as land is expensive. It's not like people move out to empty land and build houses: there is no empty land. Not much near the cities anyway. This is sort of changing as urbanization and back-asswards demographics (below reproduction level) create empty land now, although in far-away places. But actually there could be such a thing as a rehomesteading movement in Europe as whole counties became almost depopulated, with a few old folks holding it out in otherwise empty and crumbling villages, and the young and unemployed of the cities could move out and begin farming... sort of could be a good idea.

Also by small lawns I mean over here tend to be rules that 75% to 90% of the plot must be left for vegetation, either lawn or bushes or whatever, so the house, garage, shed, swimming pool, terrace and roads in the garden can occupy 10% up to 25% of it. Such rules tend to be perceived mixedly, as people sort of like that the garden-ish, semi-rural character of the neighborhood is preserved in general, but are pissed off if they are personally not allowed to build a garage or swimming pool. In the ""less germanic"" (south, east) countries people just go ahead and build them without permit, as enforcement is sporadic and bribeable.

To think about it, enforcing such a low density in a suburbia in a continent / country where the density is very high in general sounds like a bad idea... there is just this general sentiment that ""being green"" means a lot of green vegetation around primarily, ""having good air"", and energy use and suchlike are sort of secondary.

&gt;The people who are gung-ho for having more babies tend to be the same people who want to kill off social programs to help take care of the unwanted children.

&gt;This is where the other liberal trope ""pro-lifers only care about life until it's outside of the womb"" comes from. 

Ludicrous bullshit of course.  No one is going to cut money from social programs and hurt children.  The idea that you need an unlimited entitlement state in order to not kill your children is foolish.  This is an insane argument.  You kill children so that they don't have to grow up poor?  Not everyone can live in the suburbs like you, so they might as well cease to be?  Give me a break, you don't want women to be responsible for their bodies.  You aren't doing children any good by killing them.  You sure as SHIT aren't doing society any good. 

&gt;Can't expand forever. I can see overpopulation in the US not being an issue but to say overpopulation isn't a problem, that its a liberal fiction is just silly.

Where is it a problem?  Are you talking about global over population?  The idea that Western European society should cease to procreate for any reason is beyond silly... Not worth bringing up. 

&gt;Of course you do, don't pretend to be thick. 

What does a 10 year old need to know about sex?  Why does the public school system need to teach them?  

&gt;Where's the data? Of course knowledge of how sexual reproduction, proper birth control usage, and the dangers of STD, pregnancy help.

Well just take a look at statistics.  30 years ago there was less teen pregnancy and STDs, 20 years ago the same... so on so forth. What changed?  The culture became permissive.  Schools started handing out condoms... Ect, ect, ect.  Liberalism happened.

&gt;Most teenagers are going to have sex, you can't fight biology. Only the misguided think keeping them in the dark will stop the sex from happening.

Funny, how did society ever get along without the federal government teaching their kids about procreation?  Why wasn't teen pregnancy some all encompassing issue in the 50s?

&gt;Knowing the basic facts of life shouldn't be controversial. Nobody is talking about making school erotic. When a boy can achieve an erection and a girl has her period, the whole idea of ""they're too young"" is just ridiculous and puritan.

Women can have periods as young as 9.  Boys start getting erections at like the age of 6...  Again I would refer you to history.  Why can't parents teach their children about sex when they decide to?  A 10 year old doesn't need to be learning about sex.

&gt;Apparently you do since you seem ill-equipped to do so, which means you'll be raising ignorant biggots. If your teenagers aren't ready to talk about psychology 101, including basic human sexuality then the fault is yours, not liberals. 

Hrm?  I'm a little confused.  Not sure why actually, a condescending liberal thinking society must be structured in the way he seems fit, and anyone who disagrees is an ignorant bigot.  You know I've never seen a group of people damage society so much and have such a big smile on their face as a result...  My kid can learn ""Sex Ed"" from me.  When he is in science learning about reproduction that is a serious difference then when he is in a health class learning about orgasms and transgenders and homosexuals, so on and so forth.  Being force fed Orwellian bullshit about equality before he even understands the issue.  Fuck you.  Teach your own shitty kid to be a blind liberal moron.

&gt;It's the worst of them that are actively trying to repeal women's rights.

Haha.  Womens ""rights.""  In this case the sacred right to murder your unborn child because you are too ignorant and irresponsible to take care of the child or yourself...  The ""right"" of women to let men ejaculate inside them while bearing no responsibility for that action.  How brave of you, what a paragon of virtue. 

&gt;You sure use the language of the worst of them. Comparing disposing of a fertilized egg to killing a child is ridiculous.

No it isn't really.  You are killing a living, functioning, human organism.  It is a developing child.  Every human being at one point was a ""fetus.""  You murder a living developing child in the womb.  Don't be a coward.  Do you even have a problem with partial birth abortion?  Or is that none of my business?

The Taiwanese government keeps claiming sovereignty over all Chinese territory and as the International community can't accept two sovereign states on the same territory so the ROC's sovereignty isn't recognized.

This is actually a big deal in Taiwanese domestic politics, one of the two major political parties have had the policy of eventually declaring independence for the island of Taiwan as an separate entity from the mainland while the traditional ruling party hasn't wanted to go into that direction.

You are asking which event will come first when it is likely psychological which will come first. A better question might be, ""If everyone acts with maximum ignorance, when will mathematical reality force these events to happen.""

Eventually, you run out of people with hundreds of billions of dollars to buy bonds, and by eventually I mean probably by the end of 2012.

A loan made today won't be due for 4 - 5 years. So, banks will hold it on their books at par even though that's retarded.

In Sweden 23 % says they don't believe in a God or a spirit or life force. So 23 % is atheist.

* the three hadiths are true, and official, and have been said by muhammed, and yes in that time they were moral and valid, today they are not moral nor valid, because islam is a tree with branches, when a branch contradicts the tree, you dismiss it for another that match it, in islam there is also ""islam is a religion of ease not a religion of hardships"" and also another stating that we should try every single thing to correct then resort to punishment, so in islam, ""implying 9/11 wasn't an inside job"" bin laden would have been in trials for the crime and sin of killing innocents and ruining a community good, if there was no chance of redemption, he will be punished, in mother america he was killed without trials, so why do you still think islam is evil, if he is matching what you believe is right, will you think europe and USA are not evil, just normal, while they are doing strange things, in summary, now that there many ways to ask and get feedback of ex-muslims as to why they left, and now that we are SURE law would punish them if they tried to harm us after leaving islam, ""not sure about this though as israel is raping palestine with no one speaking"" it IS not right immoral and invalid to kill them. ""if the word crime wasn't the right word to use"".

*  at one point yes, anyone who is going to potentially be against islam, in an already outnumbered war, was to be killed, i don't say this is saint and angelic, but am saying that even if there were ten or twenty official cases about this actually happening in muhammed's days, (not today were they don't even understand there own religion) and that you are so righteous, why are you so stuck up on this, instead of actually going to [/r/Israel](/r/Israel) or [/r/politics](/r/politics) to ask them why the hell are they doing this to palestine and iraq? not even because they are afraid of them, but only because of profit, KILING, INVADING, LYING because of profit, why are you so stuck on a case of ""kinda"" self defense in war time where death for traitors is not uncommon, is it because you are a coward? i doubt so, i say you are misinformed. A LOT.

* muhammed was a shepherd, so, (regardless of it being from god or not, because me i CAN imply, to show my point, atheists logic will cease to exist once they have the courage to imply) you atheists are claiming a 41 years old illiterate shepherd TOOK THE PAIN and created an entire religion FOR EVIL that he gains nothing from, studying books he never ever know existed nor knew what language they are, and got that religion to the leading religion in middle east in 100 years while fighting people who want him dead, with moral war rules that are not even applied today in an age where eating your enemy, and burying children alive was normal, and that religion is 2 billion strong now? you should stop reading US comics. or else start following the guy, and while you are at it, follow the devil, why not, they are badass?

*  in other surprising news, SOME atheists who claim they want the good of the world, are siding with american and israel governments, against muslims and religious people, even knowing those same governments are doing NOW X million times the atrocities religious people do, either you are way too brainwashed, or is it that you have a bad case of revenge over your ancestor Banu Quraysh soldier, some muslim killed in the past centuries before your grandparents even existed as raw material.",t1_c3mujs0,,[deleted],,DebateAnAtheist,0,False,t1_c3mtoy6,1328115254,

One of my favourite things about the Modern Warfare series is how it aproaches story telling. I'm going to put this whole thing in spoiler tags, in case anyone reading this hasn't played the Modern Warfare games. I'm about halfway through MW3 myself. Major character spoilers/storytelling techniques within:

[In the vast majority of games it doesn't matter if you mess up. You die, and then your character starts again at the last checkpoint. Modern Warfare kills player characters all over the shop, something I've not seen in games of this generation. It totally changes the way I aproach the game, because that element of ""my character will be fine no matter what"" is gone. Any mission could potentially end with someone dying. It was a huge shock when it first happened in MW1, and since then no characters are permanent, they could die at any point. Even though it's not as shocking as it was the first time, it still works as a technique.](/spoiler)

If they're going for impact, why not have a game that upsets our ""West is good guys"" attitude?

3 of the 10 commandments contain moral rules that are included in US law.  Those rules (don't kill, don't steal, don't commit perjury) are fairly common across all cultures, including those not based on the 10 commandments.  The other 7 are not represented in US law, with the arguable exception of adultery, which is illegal in some states.  Are there laws in the US against idolatry?  Requiring that we keep the Sabbath holy?  US law intersects with the 10C in a few places, but to say our law is based on it is stretching the concept of 'descent'. US legal code as about as much in common with the 10C as it does with Confucianism.  To say that the laws are universally recognized in most countries is also false; most developed nations in Europe, for instance, don't completely close down on Sunday or any other commonly-accepted Sabbath day.  I'm no expert, though, so take anything I say about Europe with a grain of salt.  Europe aside, though, you're ignoring a huge number of people in India and China that definitely don't consider the 10C to be universal law. And between the two of them, that's about a third of the world's population.

Leaving that aside, though, what do you mean by acknowledging?  Hanging copies of the 10C up in courthouses and schools?  Discussing them in a public school class about the history of law?  One of those is legal, the other is illegal, and there's a good reason for both. Hint:  the second is legal.

&gt;We used to pray before football games, not because we were told to by the coach but because we wanted to. However, the school system has decided that there is too much risk associated with a law suit, despite this being directly constitutionally enumerated freedom.

You still can pray before a football game, provided it's not led by the school employees. Student-led prayer groups are fine, and always have been.  

&gt;So yeah, when atheists start actively lobbying to restrict the freedoms of others, it is no surprise that a bias towards them develops and/or grows

Show me one case where atheists have lobbied against religious freedom, rather than religious privilege. 

&gt;So when anyone engages in discussion of the question of God's existence without any intent to seek the truth and the answer to the question, that is very disingenuous. 

This, after I *directly asked you to provide a definition/evidence of God so that the discussion could continue*? And you haven't even provided the definition. As I said, I haven't heard everything, but I'm wiling to learn.  Provide me with something to talk about and I'll do so.  Until then, ask yourself which one of us is being evasive and disingenuous.

&gt; There is a ton of evidence for theism

Then provide it.

&gt; That question has a subjective answer, but whatever a person concludes the answer to be it is apparent that they are not applying that standard equally to all matters. 

It's apparent that whatever they choose, they aren't applying it equally? How does that follow?  This is just blatantly assuming that skepticism can't be applied equally, which to a degree is true (due to human physiology), but doesn't make skepticism any less valuable.  In general, the more skeptical you are, the less likely you are to be taken in by a bad argument.  Just because I don't feel skepticism about, say, what I choose to have for a drink with lunch (""Do I *really* feel like Dr. Pepper?"") doesn't mean that skepticism can't be applied equally to other areas of life, nor that it shouldn't.

&gt; C. You're assuming one person, not a multitude of individuals with different perspectives which is the actual case 

I most certainly am not. As I've said in my last **3** replies, I provided the 9/11 example to show why the beliefs of a large group of individuals say nothing about whether or not those beliefs are true.  Thus far, the subjective experiences of those people are all that you've provided in the way of an argument for the existence of a god, and that argument is unconvincing. 

&gt;assuming that a ebing that can break the laws of physics is an irrational assumption but when compared to our current scientific view is actually quite reasonable to expect.

No, I said that psychological explanations are *more likely* than the existence of this being as the cause of the beliefs.  It's an application of Occam's Razor.  Sloppy reading aside, though, I am curious to know what you mean when you say there's scientific research showing that we can expect some being to break the laws of physics. First I've heard of it.

&gt; So in all of those cases, there is room for legitimate criticism of someone who denies those claims without reasonable basis.

You are trying to tell me that the Egyptians had maps of the entire world before white people even came out of the mountains? How could they make maps of things they had never seen? Unless you want to say that Ancient Egyptians discovered the Americas, which you hopefully should know to be patent bullshit.

You are hilarious my friend. The scientific method and nearly all significant scientific discoveries are a result of the last 300 years, and have their roots in Europe. I'm not saying that ancient civilizations contributed nothing; mathematics and philosophy have very real roots, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. But if you want to talk any sort of modern understanding of astronomy, physics, biology, medicine or mathematics (ie calculus), the origins are obviously European. By the way, drilling holes in people's heads does not constitute ""brain surgery"", at least not in the way you think; modern Western medicine obviously has its roots in, well, the West. That means Europe. If you want to go chew herbs and get your skull cut open to treat your melancholy instead of going to see the Western medical doctor (who bases his treatments on science) when you need, then yea, go to Ancient Egypt. Read more [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_medicine) You also should realize that the reason computers are built off of binary is not because it is better or more efficient (it is in fact far less so, which is why nobody uses it outside of the digital realm) but because computers can only function in binary due to their electrical based system (inherently ""on-off"", open-closed, 1-0). There is no other reason to translate ""9"" into ""1001"". I didn't know Egyptians used binary, but it speaks about their primitiveness, not their intelligence. Decimal, base-ten mathematics are far superior, which is obviously why we use it...

Basically, I don't know where you are getting your bullshit. My guess is that the same people that are telling you that Christians are secret astrologists are the same ones telling you that the Egyptians were the smartest guys ever and that every modern discovery can be explained by the ""fact"" that everyone learned everything through Egyptian mystery schools. Dude. Not even the craziest historian would endorse such an idiotic belief. It is a conspiracy theory. If you don't see that, no one can help you.

You should be careful of talking about things you do not understand, and I would say that ""misunderstanding"" covers pretty much everything, from your misplaced ideas of Ancient Egypt to your vindictiveness toward Europe, to your understanding of Christianity. Think about it for a second- have you ever sat down and talked to anyone about these beliefs you hold, or are you caught in the cycle of online self-affirmation? Real people will give you a reality check. Go talk to a real historian. Go read some books from another perspective. Read some wikipedia for Pete's sake, even that alone would be enough to dispel 99% of what you've said to me.

You think you know more about Christianity than I do. Believe me, you do not. You throw around all these ideas of secret societies and shit (which conveniently cannot be proved or disproved, as they are ""secret"") and disregard actual evidence and contemporary documents. If you want to say that secret societies and hidden astrological allegories are responsible for Christianity, then you can join Giorgio Tsoukalos in the corner, because that is the very definition of a fringe belief with no academic backing whatsoever. Are you humble enough to recognize that you are ignorant of what you are talking about? Have you studied early Christianity? Do you know the origins of Christmas better than Christians? Do you know the patristic and devotional heritage of Christianity and Judaism which has seen solar symbolism applied to God since time immemorial? Here is an excerpt from the Catholic Encyclopedia (1908 pub) about Christmas:

&gt;The well-known solar feast, however, of Natalis Invicti, celebrated on 25 December, has a strong claim on the responsibility for our December date. For the history of the solar cult, its position in the Roman Empire, and syncretism with Mithraism, see Cumont's epoch-making ""Textes et Monuments"" etc., I, ii, 4, 6, p. 355. Mommsen (Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, 12, p. 338) has collected the evidence for the feast, which reached its climax of popularity under Aurelian in 274. Filippo del Torre in 1700 first saw its importance; it is marked, as has been said, without addition in Philocalus' Calendar. It would be impossible here even to outline the history of solar symbolism and language as applied to God, the Messiah, and Christ in Jewish or Christian canonical, patristic, or devotional works. Hymns and Christmas offices abound in instances; the texts are well arranged by Cumont (op. cit., addit. Note C, p. 355).

&gt;The earliest rapprochement of the births of Christ and the sun is in Cyprian, ""De pasch. Comp."", xix, ""O quam præclare providentia ut illo die quo natus est Sol . . . nasceretur Christus."" — ""O, how wonderfully acted Providence that on that day on which that Sun was born . . . Christ should be born.""

&gt;In the fourth century, Chrysostom, ""del Solst. Et Æquin."" (II, p. 118, ed. 1588), says: ""Sed et dominus noster nascitur mense decembris . . . VIII Kal. Ian. . . . Sed et Invicti Natalem appelant. Quis utique tam invictus nisi dominus noster? . . . Vel quod dicant Solis esse natalem, ipse est Sol iustitiæ."" — ""But Our Lord, too, is born in the month of December . . . the eight before the calends of January [25 December] . . ., But they call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'. Who indeed is so unconquered as Our Lord . . .? Or, if they say that it is the birthday of the Sun, He is the Sun of Justice.""

&gt;Already Tertullian (Apol., 16; cf. Ad. Nat., I, 13; Orig. c. Cels., VIII, 67, etc) had to assert that Sol was not the Christians' God; Augustine (Tract xxxiv, in Joan. In P.L., XXXV, 1652) denounces the heretical identification of Christ with Sol.

&gt;Pope Leo I (Serm. xxxvii in nat. dom., VII, 4; xxii, II, 6 in P.L., LIV, 218 and 198) bitterly reproves solar survivals — Christians, on the very doorstep of the Apostles' basilica, turn to adore the rising sun. Sun-worship has bequeathed features to modern popular worship in Armenia, where Christians had once temporarily and externally conformed to the cult of the material sun (Cumont, op. cit., p. 356).

&gt;But even should a deliberate and legitimate ""baptism"" of a pagan feast be seen here no more than the transference of the date need be supposed. The ""mountain-birth"" of Mithra and Christ's in the ""grotto"" have nothing in common: Mithra's adoring shepherds (Cumont, op. cit., I, ii, 4, p. 304 sqq.) are rather borrowed from Christian sources than vice versa.

We are not idiots. If you want to actually learn more, original source is [here under “Origin of Date”.](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm)

I'm trying to help you break out of an unhealthy pseudo-intellectualism that I find in a lot of atheists.

He's obviously not an anthropologist or a scientist. He just seems like some naive dude who decided to blithely go about documenting the tribe (itself an ethical and moral violation) with the heavy-handed criticism that the tribe doesn't conform to the social ethics of 2012. I mean, what was he expecting to find? 

Don't forget, throughout human history, people have practiced the same behaviors and beliefs we see in this video. Drug use, group suicide - it's nothing new or shocking. Even the euthanasia of disabled children is something that continues today in every corner of the globe, and it's practiced by ""civilized"" people who ""should"" know better. Saying the tribal people in the video are guilty of some insane, outlandish practice is completely naive. 

My favorite part is when the host said that the tribe is divided between ""good"" and ""evil"". WTF? Good and evil is a binary thought process that finds its roots in Judeo-Christian belief, which obviously (and thankfully) this tribe hasn't been exposed to. The host's sense of superiority and the way he cast judgement on the tribe's beliefs made me feel a little ill, because that's exactly the same attitude early Europeans and missionaries took with them when they began colonizing and converting every ""savage"" person on the planet.

The Soviet Union hasn't even existed for centuries. It's colonialism by Western-European countries that set the precedent for the mess Africa's in today. China and Russia are relative newcomers to the continent, but they're largely picking over the bones of an already depleted portfolio of natural resources. 

Ever wonder why contemporary European governments are so silent on the exploitation of natural resources in Africa by emerging economies like China in particular? It's because the African continent wouldn't allow it, as those governments would be hypocritical speaking out against something they themselves did en masse up to the early 20th century.  

You're absolutely right about no-one on the world stage wanting to risk irking China, it'd be economic suicide. Because of that in the US as well as Europe, few fucks are given about the plight of Africa as China is a strategic partner, and if a largely third world continent has to suffer to get us cheap consumer goods, it's too easy for those with power to turn a blind eye.

 His lawyers told the Supreme Court judges the Swedish prosecutor who issued his European Arrest Warrant did not have the authority to do.

 The key legal question for the seven judges is whether the prosecutor who issued the arrest warrant had the judicial authority to do so under provisions of the 2003 Extradition Act.

 End Quote Dinah Rose QC Ms Rose submitted: ""Since the Swedish prosecutor cannot fulfil those conditions, she is not a judicial authority and not capable of issuing a warrant for the purposes of the 2003 Act."".

 Ms Rose said it had ""Nonetheless concluded that the Swedish prosecutor was a 'judicial' authority within the meaning of Part 1 of the 2003 Act"" and was ""Wrong to reach that conclusion"".

 In the Balkans, a 72-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman were found dead of cold in central and southern Serbia respectively, where the temperatures have fallen to minus 33 degrees, private B92 television reported.

 Temperatures plunged to minus 29 degrees Celsius in central Romania on Monday night, sending gas consumption to a record high and forcing a huge increase in gas imports, an official said.

From Michael Lewis:

&gt; As it turned out, what the Greeks wanted to do, once the lights went out and they were alone in the dark with a pile of borrowed money, was turn their government into a piñata stuffed with fantastic sums and give as many citizens as possible a whack at it. In just the past decade the wage bill of the Greek public sector has doubled, in real terms—and that number doesn’t take into account the bribes collected by public officials. The average government job pays almost three times the average private-sector job. The national railroad has annual revenues of 100 million euros against an annual wage bill of 400 million, plus 300 million euros in other expenses. The average state railroad employee earns 65,000 euros a year. Twenty years ago a successful businessman turned minister of finance named Stefanos Manos pointed out that it would be cheaper to put all Greece’s rail passengers into taxicabs: it’s still true. “We have a railroad company which is bankrupt beyond comprehension,” Manos put it to me. “And yet there isn’t a single private company in Greece with that kind of average pay.” The Greek public-school system is the site of breathtaking inefficiency: one of the lowest-ranked systems in Europe, it nonetheless employs four times as many teachers per pupil as the highest-ranked, Finland’s. Greeks who send their children to public schools simply assume that they will need to hire private tutors to make sure they actually learn something. There are three government-owned defense companies: together they have billions of euros in debts, and mounting losses.

Not true. One of the reasons circumcision was popularised in the US was to prevent males to be able to masturbate properly.

&gt;A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment. In females, the author has found the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal excitement.

It's also pretty obvious that it reduces sensation, given that the foreskin has tons of nerves and is capable of.. sensation.

Foreskin also serves to protect the penis:

 The South American country, which has the 15th-largest holdings in the world, according to the World Gold Council, held 211 tons of its 365 tons of gold reserves in U.S., European and Canadian banks as of August.

 He said on Jan. 3 that the country would leave 15 tons of gold in banks outside the country.

 A central bank report released in August showed that Venezuela held gold reserves with the Bank of England, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays Plc and Standard Chartered Plc among other banks.

Can you honestly expect van Persie who is in his prime right this second that he should wait another 4 years for that awesome team that will dominate Europe?

No, of course not. He will leave, soon, if there is no change in the right direction. Van Persie is not the only case. While we are waiting for talent to mature, players that have already matured will move on to better teams. And when the current talent matures, when Jack is in his prime, we will probably be waiting for a few other players to fill positions that the likes of Song, Sagna, Vermaelen etc. will leave empty when they inevitably leave.

So then we are caught in this endless loop of being 4 years from glory. We get a reputation of a selling club, fan support dwindles, international marketing revenue fades, we are unable to sign profitable sponsor deals, Champion's league is nowhere in sight ... I know this is a bit of an exaggeration (snowball effect I guess), but only to illustrate my point.

We are not far from being that awesome team to dominate all. In my opinion, 2 top quality signings away from it - maybe 60m. To go with current trends, Hazard + awesome striker to complement van Persie in my opinion. And some deadwood clearing with a couple of new backup players for rotation so players can get the rest they need in order to not be injured for entire season. Then we would have a mix of experienced players in first team and as backup, stars in their prime and young talent dying to prove themselves. And that's how you win trophies in my opinion. And also how the likes of Fabregas don't see Barcelona as incredible leap forward and they actually believe they can win trophies with us instead of them.

&gt;The French MEP who resigned his position in charge of negotiating the international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement has said it ""Goes too far"" by potentially cutting access to lifesaving generic drugs and restricting internet freedom.
&gt;
&gt;In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Kader Arif - a member of the European parliament's international trade group, who was the lead negotiator over Acta - said that despite talks over the agreement having begun in 2007, ""The European parliament, which represents the rights of the people, had no access to this mandate, neither had it information of the position defended by the commission or the demands of the other parties to the agreement"".
&gt;
&gt;Asked what he thought European citizens should do, Mr Arif said: ""Showing that there is interest and concern about this agreement is the best way of creating a real public debate, which was never possible until now because of the lack of transparency on this dossier. Especially if the timeframe is short, raising awareness of members of parliament will be crucial. And because Acta is a mixed agreement, it will have to be ratified both by the European parliament and by every member state of the union, so there is also an opportunity to organise debates at the national level.""
&gt;
&gt;""There are international agreements, such as the Trips agreement, which foresees this last possibility,"" he said.

Wasn't an overnight process but slavery was on the decline post rome, post christianization.  Laws were made to abolish it (though it took longer than I thought).

""Medieval canon lawyers concluded that slavery was contrary to the spirit of Christianity, and by the 11th century when almost all of Europe had been Christianized, the laws of slavery in civil law codes were now antiquated and unenforceable."" (from the wiki article)

This is a problem of semantics. Capitalism, for the most of us, is a system based on the private ownership of the means of production. 

For you, however, you believe that Capitalism *necessarily* demands the ""workers to be able to compete to truly provide the best service possible"". Unfortunately, your definition is not the typical definition of Capitalism. The majority of us recognize that pure Capitalism has no ability to guarantee healthy competition, due to tyranny and monopolizing forces. And in particular, for Cruise Ships, the capitalists own *all of the capital*, while the workers are mere wage earners. Such a scenario is well within the accepted domain of ""Capitalism"". 

You've attached a property to Capitalism which it doesn't necessarily have without exposition on why that property should be attached to Capitalism. It sort of makes you sound like a Libertarian ideologue - a person who believes Capitalism is the best system possible, and that any hint of ""impurity"" of Capitalism makes it Not-Capitalism.


However, in the real world outside of Libertarian theory, pure-Capitalism is impossible. Thus when we use the word Capitalism to describe the real world, we use it to describe systems that are on the high end of the Capitalist-Socialist **spectrum**. 


Finally, the Cruise ship system as described in the article is *more capitalistic than the experience of the average American and European*. On the spectrum, in comparison to all world governments, the Cruise Ship system *still ranks higher than all of them*. Thus, comparatively and realistically, Cruise ships are far more capitalistic. In comparing to real life, Cruise ships are ""like a pure vision of capitalism"".

1). Always use gifting in PayPal and tell the person sending the money to add ""This is a gift, will not refund"" as a note.

2). Don't trade for high amounts of money, there are fees in many cases when doing a charge back through PayPal. (I think it's around $15? I could be wrong.) With a lower amount there is a lower chance to get a chargeback.

3). Ask the person how their PayPal is funded, you have a higher risk of a charge back if they are using a Credit Card, since most CC allow charge backs and often don't have a fee to do it.

4). Avoid trading for money with people from countries that have poor infrastructure to deal with fraud. Asia, Eastern Europe, South America, etc. There is limited repercussion for credit card fraud in these areas, more poor people and a higher chance of being scammed. It may not be politically correct to say, but from my experience it's accurate.

5). For high amounts of money, get in contact with a person by phone and talk to them, get some information about them, confirm their location by their phone number. Share some general information about each other to be comfortable with a trade.

6). Record as much evidence as you can during a PayPal transaction, verify the user through steamrep, sourceop, Google them, ask about them, etc. Some information can help you fight a paypal dispute, or at least you will have evidence to warn others and get that user tagged as a scammer.

7). If you get a chargeback, attempt to contact the person and deal with them directly before contacting PayPal. Sometimes the issue could be the result of a mistake, but always record evidence of your interaction.

8). If you have a high-end unusual split it up into promo items like Buds, Bills and Keys. Then sell these, less of a chance to be scammed and you will take a lower hit.

Good luck.

Welcome to the club. The vast majority of Americans couldn't care less about this stuff, just give them their American idol and Nascar and they're content.

As far as the real crisis, no, this current system is definitely not sustainable for 100 years. Europe is in crisis at the moment and we are very close to reaching those debt levels, just on a much bigger scale. Dont expect anything to happen this year since it's an election year, and governments will do everything in their power to get reelected, but I have heard many predict the crisis could come sometime 2013-2014. That seems reasonable. Most analysts that I follow have great track records like Peter Schiff but if they ever get something wrong it's underestimate the government's ability to further kick the can down the road. So the timing is never easy or maybe even possible to foretell, but it's obvious that we are running out of road and that the end is near. The real bubble, the one fueled by the fiat dollar system, first started to inflate in 1971 when Nixon took the dollar of the gold standard ( ""We are all Keynesians now"") and began to pop in 2000 with the Nasdaq bubble. That could have been the end there, but they found a way to reinflate the bubble into housing in 2001 and that bubble popped in 08. No real wealth was created over that period, but they were able to keep the system going. Now, after QE, QE2, ZIRP, and massive fiscal stimulus and public debt, we our out of bullets, it's about time to face reality and hopefully it will wake up a lot of people.

Just because there is some sort of link between Greece and Ancient Egypt does NOT mean that heliocentrism came from Ancient Egypt, nor does it mean that the scientific method, calculus, or any of the significant discoveries that have catapulted us into the modern age ALSO came from Egypt. Ancient Egypt achieved its peak thousands of years before the pinnacle of Greek society, and by the time of such people you are referencing and that we look to as the real contributors of Western thought (your example of Aristarchus, and also Plato, Aristotle, Socrates) Egypt was in its death throes, a stagnant kingdom swept away by Alexander the Great (the Library of Alexandria was built in Egypt, but by the Greeks, by the way).

The doctor is paid the same amount whether he treats the patient or not.  A patient takes time and resources from the hospital.  A patient is not a customer, a patient is a burden.  

Doctors in socialized systems employ a variety of strategies to kill patients.  One is the wait time.  Make someone wait a long time for treatment, and hope they die.

Another is to not test the patient for illness.  If the patient has persistent pain, give them some painkillers and delay testing them.  If they have cancer, well, by they time the doctor tests for it, the patient will die = cost savings.

Most socialized systems in europe employ euthanasia and rationing, and have death panels.  So as a patient, you have no choice.  You could have been healthy all your life, paid hundreds of thousands of taxes into the system, but if you are old and sick, they won't treat you.  

And as I said before, mis-allocation of resources, no competition, and no growth, means there won't be much healthcare to go around anyway.  I don't get why you think this is desirable.

It is expensive, but I still think having a ""home base"" in a European city and traveling Europe is the best opportunity to get all of it. A $600 Eurail pass took me on two different trips and to about 9 countries and countless cities. Plus I got to travel with people I got to know and considered friends, it was a blast.

The best part that you 'may' miss out on if you don't study abroad is the friendships you'll make (don't get me wrong). Traveling a couple months through Europe will be a blast, and probably a blur, but spending 5 months everyday with people from all over the world is truly great. You'll have stories and memories for the rest of your life because of the people you hung out with, and you'll always get to visit them again!

Also, scholarships money. Some schools are just waiting to hand out money for kids to study abroad, and will often pay your plane ticket. That's a good $1000 saved right there.

writeoffs don't do someone without income any good.  it doesn't do anybody with a low income any good either.  if someone is making 20 grand a year and living paycheck to paycheck, if one of their kids gets sick and ends up w/ a $10,000 hospital stay no amount of tax breaks will help with that.

you can't simply ignore the downtrodden with a ""if they're poor it's because they're lazy"" attitude a la bush 2.0; sick people only get sicker, and if they cant get basic medical care they will eventually need emergency medical care which costs much more.

*Cryptovariable in 1942:*

Europe is, as a continent, the all-time leader in death and destruction. The blood-thirsty lust of Europeans for violence is unmatched in human history, going back to before the conquest of Britain by the Romans, some part of Europe was at war every single year for a millenium.

Tribalistic? Tell that to the Germans. You know those beautiful castles that dot the Rhine? Well each one of them used to belong to a Lord who ruled over his pathetically small valley with an iron fist, extracting tolls from all of the other ""tribes"" who dared sail up or down the Rhine. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Germany was a loose conglomeration of hundreds of small tribal feifdoms, who constantly warred with each other.

The international borders have been redrawn so many times in Europe, that it's almost impossible to get a wholly accurate historical record of what belonged to who, when. The lust for conquest is inherent in the European race.

Religiousness? Ha! Muslims know NOTHING about religious furvor. Catholics killing protestants, pagans killing christians, christians invading the middle east, orthodox vs. catholic, the Europeans are fanatic to a degree which would make Bin Laden himself shit his pants (if he didn't wear man-dresses). The rivers of Europe have run red with blood for hundreds of years due to inter-religious violence.

In fact, it was **europeans** who first pioneered the use of VBIEDs and suicide bombs both in Northern Ireland and during Bosnia/Chechnya (whoops slipped out of time-machine mode), filthy fucking savages.

**AND YOU KNOW WHAT?!?!?** Add in the colonial bloodshed of almost 1000 years of invasions and conquests of African, American, and Asian people and you'll find that the tiny continent of Europe has been responsible for killing more people than any other single geographical region, anywhere, from anytime.

A river of blood bisects the Earth and its source is in Europe.

Even the current woes of the middle east are due primarily to European meddling and the arbitrary lines the titled gentry drew on maps from parlors located thousands of miles away.

Denmark did that and went from having the highest teen pregnancy and STI rate in Europe (and, not coincidentally, a really high abortion rate) to having one of the lowest.

They could fund contraception for the poor programs.

Heck, if their focus is exclusively on fetuses and they just absolutely refuse to even consider contraception programs or sex ed, they could start an education program for women on how diet and nutrition directly affect implantation rates.  Odds are good that you aren't aware that somewhere between 50% and 80% of all fertilized eggs self abort; I say ""odds are good"" because most people aren't aware of that.

you don't need a fully developed lung to draw from the benefits of gaseous O2 over the diffused O2 in water, even a very primitive breathing aparatus will be superior to a relatively advanced fish counterpart, so you see the oxygen rich atmosphere is the driving force. limbs were only developed then to move in the new oxygen rich environment

This distrust leads to micromanagement by Congress through proliferating rules and complex, self-contradictory legislative mandates which make poor quality governance a self-fulfilling prophecy. The US is thus caught in a low-level equilibrium trap, in which a hobbled bureaucracy validates everyone’s view that the government can’t do anything competently.

You should definitely read Carnage and Culture because it actually does address all of your points in great detail and with a great deal more evidence than its so-called counterpart in Guns, Germs, and Steel.

&gt;the idea that one culture has survived for 2000 years across hundreds of nations. 

That's only a fraction of the argument.  The idea is that the Western way of war developed over those 2500+ years from the concept of open democracy and capitalism (free citizens) that arose in Ancient Greece.  Sort of like a seed being planted.  To this notion of war Alexander added the idea of decisive battle, the Romans added civic militarism and citizenship, The Franks added the concept of heavy infantry, and so on up to the Americans at Midway (individualism) and Vietnam (dissent).  Throughout all of these characteristics have developed as a result of western societies generally being freer than those elsewhere in the world for the purposes of democratic and capitalist development.  Generally speaking this is true.

&gt;I look at the world and see powerful countries located around the temperate zones of the Earth and poor countries focused around the equator.  

Geography isn't completely discounted, but culture defines how the geography of the surrounding area is used as well as the ability of items to be openly researched and for markets to be competitive or restricted.  I'd need a whole book to explain this but the simplest counter-example to your argument is China vs Japan in the 19th and 20th century.  Same location vs latitude and the geography of the world highly favours China to be the dominant power in these periods.  Why then did Japan develop more successfully and conquer Korea, capture Manchukuo and defeat the Russians at the turn of the 20th century? The answer is purely cultural.  There are so many other examples.  All of the resources were available in mexico for the Aztecs to develop the technologies of the west, they had an environment that favoured heavy agriculture, they had all the resources for gunpowder, but because of cultural limitations on individualism and development, they did not develop these technologies.  Likewise, Natives in North America did not develop significant technologies capable of combating European settlers when they arrived/invaded lands.  Why? The answer can't be geography, they had all the resources and plenty of successful local crops to allow for an urban society supporting specialists/merchants.  Geography alone is simply inadequate.

&gt;But then its hard to take his moralising seriously when he turns to politics. 

His arguments are amoral.  A generally unrestricted capitalist society will inevitably produce more individual innovation than a restricted society.  The same goes generally speaking for democracy.  You'd do good to read the book as he doesn't say that democracy and capitalism are the just things, just that they have historically worked better and allowed for greater errors of margin, as demonstrated with his analysis of Cannae.  

&gt;I did find his presumption of US military power, economics and moral supremacy baffling from my centrist European in 2012 perspective.

Those statements must be taken within the context of when they were spoken, I'm not American either but the perspective was of a moral righteousness within a society following a military attack, much like the American response to Pearl Harbor or a British/French response to Germany invading Poland.  Not that America was the most righteous country in the world period.

Natural determinists point to natural resources/climate being the only answer and that DOES play a role.  It's only natural that the islands in pacific like Hawaii did not develop on the same scale as China, Persia, or other ancient empires, but culture heavily influenced the rate of that development as well as civilizations' ability to triumph over one another militarily.

However the quote you posted is more about creating a government that does to sway to the daily whims of the average people, a concern shared by many that prompted the foundation of our the U.S.'s bicameral system and it's one of the reasons  passing a bill is not an overnight process.  Our governments legislative system is deliberately slow to ensure debate and that bad decisions aren't ratified too rashly (exceptions happen e.g. Patriot Act). I see no mention of financial gain or or financial motivation in the quote's elitism.  Not to mention the dubious nature of the source since it cites an admitted ""opponent of Hamilton"" in the text. Also in the 18th century the ""well born and wealthy"" were usually the only ones who had college educations so that probably played a role in his assessment when it came to national leadership.   

Anyway, I don't mean to seem argumentative.  I've pretty well read on the period and AH is probably my favorite founding father.  Being a West Indies bastard child who grew up a poor orphan and rose to prominence to eventually play a key role in founding the country is a uniquely American story. Also he truly believed America could be a powerful financial force internationally and not some backwater joke to the Europeans. Founding the B.U.S. and imposing early taxes ensured our financial system could make such a goal feasible.  The fact that the link you've sent me is to a Thomas Jefferson-based site at least leads me to think that you likely are just as knowledgeable but have your own bias towards TJ (Hamilton's nemesis) which is fair, but I've never cared for his strict interpretation of the Constitution (though thank god he compromised his own beliefs to make the Louisiana Purchase) nor his championing of the American farmer as both were shortsighted and would not have prepared us for the challenges of the following centuries.  

Regardless, I don't think it's fair to compare today's Republicans to Hamilton since Hamilton's elitism wasn't purely a money issue and that Hamilton was a champion for a strong federal government in matters of finance, something Republicans do not (officially) stand for in practice or ideology, and while they have contradicted this that is a sign of their hypocrisy and nothing else. Hamilton's belief in the dominance of the elites and well born was not due to financial advantage, but their higher education, better understanding of politics and economic concerns when compared to the uneducated masses of the time.

And then with *2001*... well, I don't think anyone can imagine that film *not* being in color, and after that color was simply the norm...

Generally Kubrick wasn't fond of super-widescreen (Cinemascope, 2.20:1 or 2.35:1). He preferred height to width, giving more headroom and space to depict the characters' environment. But Sci-Fi or historical epics like *2001* and *Spartacus* have a tradition of being shot in a suitably ""epic,"" super-widescreen aspect ratio, so that was probably partly why they deviate from the rest of his films in this respect. (Also, you have to remember with *Spartacus* Kubrick had only partial creative control so such a decision may not have been his to make).

Anyway, all of Kubrick's early pictures are in the standard (for the time) 1.33:1 or 1.66:1 squarer aspect ratio. And from *Clockwork Orange* on, he still preferred the ""tallest,"" least wide ratio possible of 1.66:1 (as 1.33:1 was no longer accepted by most cinemas). Both that film and *Barry Lyndon* were composed for 1.66, but although that aspect ratio was very common in European cinemas, American ones increasingly projected nothing less wide than 1.85:1. Hence why Kubrick's last three films were framed for both 1.85:1 theatrical showing and 1.33:1 home video. There's been, of course, much debate about which is really Kubrick's preferred aspect ratio for these films, but in reality it's probably closer to 1.66:1 (which the films were projected at in Europe) than either of the two available extremes.",t1_c3mz5y8,,somerton,,StanleyKubrick,0,False,t3_p5sg4,1328138465,

But in the interest of full disclosure I should point out I regularly debate this subject, with the likes of Eric Hovind and the folks at ppsimmons, and am already familiar with a lot of the stuff published by the Discovery Institute in this area.  So, as I say, I'm always willing to consider any new information which might come along, but the debate over how cogent some of their ideas are is perhaps for another time.

All I would add to that (since I was looking more for political debate than one surrounding the overwhelming amount of mutually corroborative, independently acquired evidence for natural selection) is to politely correct you when you say scientists 'look for evidence which fits their worldview'.  You might want to check out a book by Karl Popper's called The Logic of Scientific Discovery, which sets out his deductive process of falsifiability, and how it underpins the scientific method as a way to specifically cancel out any personal or politically motivated biases which individual scientists and scientific organisations might bring to a particular area of study.

I would agree with you that the Christian thing to do is give money voluntarily rather than have it taken regardless of whether or not you agree with the programs on which it is being spent.  But, sadly again, this is often characterised as the religious becoming the thing they fear the most, by making decisions based upon bad information.  This is a cultural thing which gets into areas where it might be easy to take offence, and it's not intended that way.  But the stereotypes I'm trying to explore tend to persist because of how often they are reenforced, so it is worth mentioning 'Obamacare'.  

There's no doubting it was a poorly made argument from the get go, and the least said about how it was whittled away into something barely recognisable by the time it was implemented the better.  But, at its core, was an honestly motivated attempt to bring America up to speed with something every single industrialised nation on Earth addressed immediately after the second world war.  Providing healthcare for our fellow human beings is a privilege.  And it seems absurd, even to Europeans who are far from being left leaning in their politics, that the world's only superpower still has such a coldhearted approach to healthcare.

I visited her a few times, and the way she was processed like an animal on a meat factory production line was almost as shocking as the final cost.  We have our fair share of problems, which occasionally hit the headlines, but the level of professionalism and duty of care in the NHS is probably one of the last few things about this country of which everyone, regardless of their political affiliations, are tremendously proud.

But to listen to the Fox News version of the British healthcare system, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a poorly run, overly expensive, hugely unpopular millstone around our necks.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  But it was sold to you guys like that, to make you fearful for the prospect of change.  And some of the blatant lies that were told in the rightwing media left us scratching our heads in amazement, that no-one thought to check up on where they were getting their information.  It came as little surprise to find that it was the insurance companies and pharmaceutical industry which was behind a lot of it.  

And this speaks to the real strength of the NHS.  It's got nothing to do with it being ""free at the point of use"", and everything to do with it shielding the poor, vulnerable and, frankly, the less educated from the commercial abuses of the drug manufacturers.  And with the words ""that which you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me"" ringing in their ears, each successive Conservative government, from Thatcher on up to Cameron, has attempted to maintain that safety gap while struggling to find better more efficient ways of funding it.

No such attempt is being made, by those who readily invoke their Christian faith, on the Republican benches.  ""I will scrap Obamacare"" might get the crowds hollering ever louder, but few of them realise that such things are only said because of the money the private healthcare industry are shovelling into their pockets, not because they genuinely believe that social medicine is an inherently bad thing.  These guys go on fact finding missions to other countries and research their policies years in advance of announcing their intention to stand for office.  They know full well that healthcare in countries like the UK is working way better than the US media would have you guys believe, but there's just too much political milage to be had over their opponents, in using it as a way to stir up fears, for them to admit as much out loud.

I did not think myself as ignorant, because most of what you said I, somewhat, already knew to be true.

To be honest I still did sense the hurt feeling you have when you wrote this.

Second I think you there in Canada, and the people from USA might *sense* that racism more because you countries, especially USA, are a country that nowadays is very very very multicultural, so minorities and descendants groups might easily form, and with that inter-ostracism.

If there is someone who majored in recreational studies and then couldn't find a job, what the fuck did he expect when he majored in rec studies?

You're absolutely right about the information thing.  Some people are just born in environments where they are heavily disadvantaged from the get go.  However, people who attend for profit universities probably didn't do enough research or are just plain stupid (for lack of a better term).  Before you make a major financial decision such as paying tuition, I would assume you would research the university you are paying for.  All it takes is a trip to a tax payer funded library that offers internet service (for free).  http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ITT+tech 

2008 was terrible and the banks that caused it shouldn't have been bailed out, but rather wiped out by the free market.  If you studied hard and worked hard and were wiped out by what happened, then you have the right to blame the banks.  However, when I look at movements such as Occupy wall st, especially the Occupy movement in my town, I see mostly people who have failed themselves.

There's an NFL women's club that specifically caters to that demographic, something they want to expand into. The NFL is going to hold one game in London over the next 3 years in order to gain more fans in Europe. They make a huge deal out of the half-time show and the commercials. They create a presence off the field by supporting causes such as helping defeat child obesity. They actively create hype around star players, ESPECIALLY quarterbacks, with constant interviews, analysis, and whatnot. The NFL is a business, and they're doing it well.

So well, in fact, that its influence is near viral. The exploding popularity of the NFL is probably partially due to the fact that watching football, like any other sports game, is a group activity. Friends who are not remotely interested in football might start to learn about the game if their friend invites them over to watch. People buy fan gear to fit in, to feel like they're part of something. There's something about being a fan that's hard to describe.

While the game is a bit hard to explain, and even I don't fully understand the rules, it is easy to pick up the basic rules - get first down, try to score points. The game consists of brief moments of action coupled with the tension between plays. It's almost like watching a thriller movie in a sense, especially when the time is running out.

I like the guy and enjoy watching him fight, and it would be awesome to see him fight Floyd. Maybe it is a more difficult fight than Cotto but Miguel is no slouch, has only ever looked bad in one or two fights and he really is a major step up for Floyd since he took on Oscar.

It isn't a bad match-up, I mean, many wanted him to fight Manny at 150 (or 154) if the Floyd fight couldn't be made. If he's good enough for that (after a loss no less) then he's good enough opposition for Floyd.",t1_c3n052t,,sittingonahillside,,Boxing,0,False,t1_c3mzqrn,1328143847,

I think we ultimately both agree...I think. 

I'm in agreement that there should be time spent discussing other areas of the world. Moving the spotlight from America and Europe is important.

I also think that in order to properly understand the Civil Rights movement, or the reason why Manifest Destiny is such an important issue...I think you need to focus on narratives and the why and the how. 

In some ways it feels like Black History Month misses the mark. Especially in post-1900 context. We got a lot of education on the Underground Railroad and Slavery. There's not as much discussion on the very heated post-1900 racial stuff. 

Look at Reddit as a prime example. The comments that surface on MLK Day are embarrassing. That's a good sample of what US education has failed to do. There's a lot of interesting people in Black History who are ignored. There are dynamics and motivations that are ignored. So yeah. 

I don't care so much that my kid knows who MLK is...I want my kid to know why MLK is important, and how he came to be so important. And the chain of events leading up to MLK and after MLK requires more than a month. So integrate that shit into the curriculum I say! MLK is probably most famous for having a dream...I wonder how many kids know about the riots or the protests or the turbulent social climate that were the impetus.

&gt;The women's rights movement tends to be covered in brief in US history classes (again, it's important to keep time constraints in mind). AP Psychology is devoted almost entirely to studying mental health.

These two areas need to be better integrated. Our US Education system isn't dynamic enough. It hasn't kept up with the times or progressed. That's why this country is so racist and backwards still.

I've noticed in other discussions on this that a lot of Swedes are pretty insulted by this accusation. It also raises the question as to why the US can't just simply directly ask the UK for extradition; it's not as if the UK is rabidly anti-US.

[Here's a different view (from somebody who definitely isn't on Assange's side](http://jantervonen.com/alleged-rapist-and-sexual-predator-mr-julian)

&gt; ... the so called temporary surrender does not enable Mr. Assange's removal ""... to the United States without the appropriate legal processes that accompany normal extradition cases ..."" Before temporary surrender can even be asked it requires (i) an extradition request and (ii) a decision granting that extradition. It is not the case, as the letter in question appears to suggest, that with the use of temporary surrender normal procedures could be bypassed. In addition, before that extradition request from Sweden to the USA could be granted, it would require consent from the UK in accordance with Article 15 of the European Convention on extradition concerning so called re-extradition to a third state.

So if Reddit is not liable under title 17 based on the safe harbor provisions, SOPA by its own operation would not have expanded this liability.

The first thing that should be clear is that a holocaust of people and cultural genocide are two VERY different things. 

What I think my fellow redditor was trying to point out is that no one is going to deny that what Europeans did to American Indians was horrible, tragic, and down-right brutal. But world-history isn’t a portrayal of black and white forces, nor is it a simple story like Avatar or Pocahontas. As horrible as the US government (and others) has treated American Indian groups all across the continent, it never became a process of mass extermination. That’s not to say that the policy was never proposed or expected by a lot of people,  but by-and-large, the governments of North America never manufactured a full-scale assault on ALL American Indians.

Furthermore, as it has already been pointed out several times, most American Indians died due to sicknesses and illnesses brought over from the “Old World.” So, to blame 90% of American Indian deaths on a purposeful policy of the Europeans is not only false, but it perpetuates a myth that American Indians are a weak people that were overwhelmed by European power, rather than just genetically unresistant to certain diseases. The latter explanation is not only a more logical conclusion, but it also shows that American Indians were not victims of some large holocaust, that they were able to still determine much of their future despite this unforeseen tragedy, and that they survived and thrived after these horrible policies were enacted. 

Also, as I said cultural eradication is very different from a Holocaust, but no less horrible and sickening. This is one thing I think that needs to be highlighted more in history text books is the cultural genocide that took place, and the loss of certain practices, traditions, languages and rituals that was brought about by western “civilization.” The death toll is certainly tragic, but I feel like the insidious motive to destroy native American culture by “Killing the Indian to Save the man” shows a much more grim reality of European/American hubris and over-confidence.

First: Why was and still am I outraged?

After a purely factual comment from me you accuse the Jews of making the world only see the Jewish victims of Nazi genocide. After a comment in which I say that six million Jews – the by far largest group of victims – were murdered by Germany. Do you have no empathy?

Second: Why are you wrong?

I’m not aware of any Jews anywhere claiming to be the only victims of German genocide. It is certainly their privilege to look at the Holocaust from a Jewish perspective and it is not our right to tell them how they should remember the Holocaust.

Whenever I encountered remembrance of the Holocaust in general all victims of German genocide were included (even though the term Holocaust is historically used to only describe the systematic murder of Jews). [Take this introduction from the United States Holocaust Museum as an example.](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005143)

Yes, there is a focus on Jews, but that focus has reasons. As I already said, they were the by far largest group of victims with six million murdered. Other notable groups include Soviet prisoners of war (2–3 million), Poles (2 million), Sinti and Roma (200,000–1.5 million) and the disabled (250,000).

That’s absolute numbers. If you look at relative numbers it becomes very obvious why the Jews were such a disproportionate victim of German genocide. Germany murdered two thirds of all European Jews – six million out of the nine million. They murdered nearly all Jews they had access to. Six million are more than one third of the pre-WWII Jewish population on the planet (17 million). Put in another way: Most Jews the Germans had access to were murdered. Most Poles the Germans had access to were not.

It’s true that Nazi ideology viewed for example Poles similarly than Jews – not human, to be exterminated – but Germany did put a lot of effort into systematically and quickly killing every last Jew on the planet. That same dedication just wasn’t there for other groups. The plan was to eventually murder and enslave all Poles, not however with the same speed Germany was murdering Jews.

Discrimination, oppression and murder of Jews was systematic and started early. I encourage you to read about the [Nuremberg Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws), [ghettos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghettos_in_Nazi-occupied_Europe) and the [Wannsee Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannsee_Conference). During that conference Nazi officials decided and explicitly stated that their goal was to murder every last Jew they could get their hands on. That wasn’t some abstract notion that was part of their ideology, it was a concrete plan that was – sadly – by and large successful. If the end of the war hadn’t stopped them, Germany would indeed have murdered all Jews they had access to. Sure, similar plans existed for other Groups (for example the Poles and Sinti and Roma) but there was luckily not really time to execute them, at least not with the same thoroughness.

I'll start off by saying the parties _aren't_ worth the pilgrimage. I've been at nicer parties in the UK in the summertime and at psytrance music festivals in Europe.

About the people, you will meet some interesting psychonauts, some hardcore travellers who've been in SE asia for the last 30 years, some kids from Aus, UK and Russia who came to party and get fucked up, and loads of I guess what you would call Indian bros. These are pretty wealthy young Indian guys from the big cities who come to Goa to drink a lot of cheap booze, dance until they pass out, and hassle the women. This was the biggest downside for me. They make up more than half of the people at the mainstream parties, (it's also extremely rare to find Indian women at parties). There's nothing worse than being high around a lot of drunk people who are all trying to come on to you. I didn't even bother tripping on New Years because I knew there would be problems.

The best time of year for parties is around xmas and New Years. Dark psy is really popular here, but you also hear some oldschool goa psy, and a little bit of progressive. I didn't hear any ambient the whole time I was there, and no where I went had ambient stages or chillout rooms. I guess the beach is your chillout stage. I was also surprised to find parties playing house, techno and other kinds of electronic music. I guess that's what happens when it became so popular, not everyone wants to listen to psytrance.

You can fly to Mumbai, Dehli or Bangalore, and then get a connecting flight to Goa. It's also possible to take a bus or train from Mumbai, or a bus from Bangalore. If it's your first time in India I recommend just getting the flight, it will be way less hassle.

You can stay in pretty nice guest basic houses right by the beach, they have attached bathrooms, generally clean, usually no hot water, but that doesn't matter, costs &lt;1000 Rs. If you are super cheap it's possible to stay in a hut made from palm tree leaves with a floor of sand and shared bathroom, should be &lt;300 Rs. If you want to spend like $100 a night you can stay in a resort with a swimming pool and every luxury. You can get all kinds of food easily in Goa: western, indian, chinese, etc. usually in the same restaurant.

I was kinda disappointed by Goa, although I had a good time there, and did find some great parties. There is something special about listening to the music in its natural environment, and the countryside there is beautiful. The biggest downsides for me were the Indian guys I already described, and all the beggars on the beach and people trying to rip you off when they are selling you stuff. Goa is one of the worst places in the country for this, especially around xmas because they know a lot of people just landed in the country.

Ok, so that's all about Goa.

I can think of scenarios where it might become a good idea in the *long run*, but that depends entirely on how Germany would have decided to organise Europe. Maybe someone can shed some light on what they actually had planned if they won (if it's known): but if the intention was to redraw the national boundaries in Europe while disarming all threats, Europe would still be independent states.

Brother F.C. Sowell held two tent meetings years before the Spring Hill Church of Christ was established. The seed, which is the word of God (Luke 8:11 ), was sown at that time. Later, a few Christians began to conduct worship services, the first being held on May 1, 1915 . Seventeen people were present for the first service. 

The first gospel meeting for the newly formed church was held by Brother E.A. Elam. Brother H.W. Rye held meetings the next two years. The services were held for three years each Sunday afternoon in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church building. 

The elders who served at that time were Brothers Lee Prentice, Albert Carpenter and R.L. Hays. The deacons were Jim Goad, J.W. Beasley and J.A.C. Jones. Brother W.L. Green served as treasurer. In the year 1918, the elders bought lots on Depot Street from Brother Charlie Mahon, and the first building owned by Spring Hill Church of Christ was erected. 

Brother Rye held the first meeting in the new church building. In the years following, gospel meetings were held by such men as C.M. Pullias, Ben Harding and Andy Largen. The church had preachers from David Lipscomb College once a month. Brother Clifford was one of those who came from time to time. In those early years of the church’s existence, the weekly contributions were often just two or three dollars. 

Bible class teachers in those days were Brother R.L. Hays, Sister R.L. Hays, Sister J.A.C. Jones and Sister Will Green. During the first years in the new building there were no classrooms. They divided into different groups in the auditorium. When someone obeyed the gospel they were taken to a little creek not far away to be baptized. 

In 1936 the Tennessee Orphans’ Home moved to Spring Hill from Columbia . There were a total of forty-eight (48) children under the supervision of Brother S.O. Owens. With those additional people, it was necessary to build three classrooms. With a rather steady increase in number, especially children, the church began to hold classes outside under the trees and put chairs in the aisles. 

By this time, the elders of years before were gone. The names of three men were put before the church for consideration for serving as elders. Those men, W.B. Richter, W.A. Walker and Ed Smith, were approved and appointed to be elders in 1947. 

As time went by the old building was just not large enough to meet the needs for seating, classrooms, etc. In a report made by Brother Ed Smith, he said, “With only six or eight wage earning families in the congregation, there was only one thing to do and that was to make an appeal for support for a new building. The good Lord blessed us abundantly in this effort. We set aside a certain day for a special contribution in our own congregation. With this, and the goodness of many Christians, we now have a nice meeting house on Highway 31 with a seating capacity of four hundred…” In 1964 an annex was completed and this gave the brethren an addition of a fellowship room (which was also used for several classes) and four other classrooms making a total of fifteen classrooms. In 1997, one of the classrooms was converted to a church library with the remaining classrooms further enlarging the fellowship room. 

Numerous preachers have held gospel meeting at Spring Hill in years past including: Andy Largen, H.W. Rye, C.M. Pullias, Gus Nichols, F.C. Sowell, Ben Harding, George DeHoff, Willard Collins, Bob Anderson, Roger Mills, Wayne Poucher, Myron Keith, Bill Smotherman, Dean Buchanan, Billy Brewer, John Hurt, Bob Kerce, Danny Cottrell, Curtis Cates, Ted Burleson, Curtis Dowdy, Roger Banks, Elmer Lusk, Billy Bland, Coy Hathcock, Mike Greene and Randy Kersey. 

According to available information, it seems that Brother H.W. Rye was the first full-time preacher with this congregation. Others who have served over the years include: Charles Brewer, Thomas J. Wagner, Steve North, Joe K. Alley, Roger Mills, Hillard Storey, Enoch Thweet, A.T. Pate, Rudolph Hunt, Harold Baker, Bert Brown, Harry Anderson, Dean Buchanan, Bobby Williams, David Swanger, Glen Alexander, and Jonathan Jones II who serves as the current preacher having been here since January 1, 2004 . 

Men who have served as elders are: Lee Prentice, R.L. Hays, Albert Carpenter, Charles Mahon, Brother Blair, Ed Smith, Andy Walker, W.B. Richter, Bill Andrews, Kenneth Maynard, Van Ingram, Kenneth Harris, Lloyd Baxter Sr., Harry Edwards and Johnny Tomlin. Those presently serving are: Clyde Farmer, Steve Bowman and Billy Wright. Serving under the elders at this time as deacons are: Phil Bennett, Randall Chesnut, Jay Farmer, Jon Farmer and Dale Walton. Cheryl Primm has served as this congregation’s first and only church secretary since March, 1990. 

The following are current works supported by the Spring Hill Church of Christ. Missionary work: Steve Waller in Indonesia, Samson Octobre in the Philippines, Eastern European Mission Fund, Korea Ministry, Spanish Literature Ministry in Cuba, and Cherokee Church of Christ. TV gospel preachers: James Watkins “Preaching the Gospel” and Mack Lyons “In Search of the Lord’s Way.” Preaching Students supported include: Lajohn McDonald, Matt Brown, and Coy Lydell Hathcock.

&gt; has given us the principle of seperation of church and state.

That specific phrasing comes from Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists.  The particular issue that Jefferson was responding to was brought up because the Connecticut State government was using religious taxes to support the Congregationalist church - the Baptists thought the law unfair, as the State was supporting the Congregationalist church over other denominations.  Note that such taxes *would have been illegal* had they been Federal taxes, specifically because of the Establishment clause.

&gt; The 'congress shall make no law' bit has been expanded to things 
&gt; like 'funding' an establishment of religion.

It is an over-broad interpretation.  The Founders were rightfully averse to the idea of there being a State Religion, not least because many of the original colonists left Europe specifically due to religious persecution.  

In this case, no State Religion is being established, which is the entire point of the clause.

If a religious banner offends you, ignore it.  Nowhere does the Constitution guarantee a right to not be offended.

Regarding ""Funding,"" in this case, the State and local community provides six times as much funding per student as the Federal Government does.

At what point does the Federal Government's contribution allow them to dictate how the State can operate when they cannot legally do so otherwise?

Israel does **not** put up with those terrorist organisations and from all their posturing is most certainly not intending to tolerate Iran either. Yet, Iran has most notably done very well to stay in a position where it does not appear to be the aggressor despite the relentless propaganda to suggest otherwise. The general trend of the matter goes as such that it is U.S/Israeli or EU statements against Iran, and then Iran responding to such statements, (which are more than likely hollow threats to save face within their own country). I'm sure you are aware of this though, so you are either, trying to stir the pot (my comment about hate speech was a bit strong, I did apologise, but I see you are still hung up on it, so I will apologise again), or are somewhat misinformed that you believe to counter supposed Iranian funding of terrorist organisations by dropping white phosphorus on residential areas, and threatening to bomb Iran is a credit to Israels tolerance?

But if you are in an urban academic setting you are going to easily find people who think like you, especially if you are going for grad school.

&gt;as if anyone who still has a problem with it is a whining foreigner that just doesn't understand?

If everywhere in Japan is like that, and all that Japanese are okay with that, then whether someone understands or not, they're a whining foreigner. I lived in the blizzard lands of Fukui for a few years, and I got used to it. It's amusing to see people whine, though.

&gt; So why does most of Europe get by with insulated homes that use localized heating? I lived in the UK using little electric heaters, but it least it took more than 10 seconds for the room to go cold after I turned them off.

Most of Europe doesn't have monsoon seasons, or other long periods of 100%-or-close humidity. The UK especially doesn't have that. 

&gt;it least it took more than 10 seconds for the room to go cold after I turned them off.

You might just be living in a shittily constructed house. My previous apartment in Fukui and my current apartment both would stay warm for half the night - unless I didn't have my windows covered. And this is including the air vents my current apartment has that go straight outside.

&gt;""Tradition"" is a stupid reason.

If you say so. It doesn't do your argument much justice. Their homes have for a thousand years been constructed to encourage the removal of stagnate air and keep airflow fresh, and that's colored their current building methods. 

&gt; But that's because their ""building methods"" are shoddy and substandard. That's a big reason why Japanese homes lose most of their value after a couple decades, and why there's a growing market for foreign-designed homes using other materials.

Perhaps. My old host family's house was built by hand over 100 years ago, and is still in pretty good condition. I don't think that the falling price of used houses has anything to do with the building quality, but more to do with a population that is adverse to used goods in general. 

&gt;foreign-designed homes

How many of these are there, really? I'd be curious to see some. I'd also be curious to see how insulation actually fares in the Japanese summer, because most anecdotes I've heard are that it makes the inside of the house insufferably humid.

&gt;The average consumer is finally starting to catch on that homes here are built like shit, even as expats here passionately defend them.

That's a pretty bold statement. I mean, this IS the country where a shitton of houses were hit by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and remained standing (including a ton of buildings that were later destroyed by tsunamis). I don't think my house in the US could deal with a 9.0 magnitude quake, and looking at NZ's recent quakes and the resultant damage there... 

To summarize, I suppose: what makes you think they're shitty? Other than their lack of insulation?

Had D-Day failed it's very likely we never would have gotten a chance to make a landing like that again and very unlikely that we would have gotten a foothold in Europe. Everything came together so smoothly on that day that we were able to actually make it in. 

Secondly, Hitler's engineers had come up with massive battleship designs that were to combat the US's carriers at the time. I'm having a hard time finding a source for this, but I remember reading about it a number of years ago. We managed to capture one of these partway through construction.

A number of tank designs that would have been quite effective were not completed by the time we started hitting Germany's borders. These were cancelled, but had they been given time to be properly developed they would have been very effective combat platforms.

Here's a short list of things they don't tell you in high school history classes: 

The US was predominantly isolationist at the time and the US did want to stay out of European affairs. The US got involved for a few reasons. The Lusitania had a lot to do with it, but not as much as high school history classes would lead you to believe. Everyone in America was fully aware that the Lusitania was carrying arms to Britain and had armed Canadian soldiers on board and everyone in the country was warned against traveling to Europe because of the Germans' submarine warfare. 

But everyone seems to be missing the biggest point: Great Britain was one of the US's biggest trading partners. America got involved for economic reasons as much as anything else. They couldn't risk the loss of such an important trading partner to Germany. 

Furthermore, Germany broke the long-standing cruiser rules set out by Great Britain long before WWI broke out. It was an international understanding about not interfering in economic trade during war, especially with neutral countries. Well, Germany had a shitty navy compared to Britain, so they broke a lot of cruiser rules with submarine warfare, which was a no-no. 

The British were also much more effective at propaganda than the Germans were, which affected how Americans reacted to the war. The British told the American press that German soldiers were going into Belgium and France and killing and eating babies. No shit. (Interestingly enough, these lies were the reason the Americans didn't believe England when they told the Americans about the Holocaust - they figured the British were just feeding them lies again). 

Americans have always had a strong cultural connection to Britain. I mean, they owned us. American culture was much more sympathetic to the British and their parliamentary government and desire for democracy than they were for the autocracy of the Kaiser.

Neither the Upper nor Lower Canadians were interested in the American cause - many Upper Canadians having been Loyalists who found everything about the United States to be odious. Britain was tied up in Europe against Napoleon and didn't care enough about the Canadas to bolster their regiments by much until late in 1814 after the first defeat of Napoleon.

Portraying the War of 1812 as the US defending itself against Britain is a propagandistic recasting of an aggressive war against a weak enemy as a conflict that neatly ignores all the massive fuck ups committed by inept US forces in the first year and a half of the war.

1,t5_2qh5b,0,c3n4p1e,t3_p5oww,1428282845,True,0,1,,True,"A) ""Disturbing view of history..."" - care to show me any other version of history in which it is not dominated, written by, and inevitably actualized by the victors of war? Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States is the first major and recognized work to document, in detail, the plight of the disenfranchised and conquered from a sympathetic and more honest historical view. I'm not saying this is right (see below for arguments regarding this), simply that it just is. Human history, post-nomadic tribes, has been one long aim for conquest between peoples. We've created ethno-national-cultural boundaries, delineated our arguments as to which exceptionalism should stand, and then attempted to conquer ""the other"" (and I mean that in the most postmodern sense). And I don't want to hear any crap about the innocent bloodless herbal medicine Native Americans; the Iriquois wiped out the Apaches through nighttime raids on the females weaving baskets. The Okahanas invaded the Aztec descendants of present day northern Mexico, scalped them, and made coats out of the scalps. All of this leading me to my next point...

B) ""He's arguing that the genocide of the Native America and, really, any indigenous group is alright..."" - please point out where I said this. The distinction I made is a fairly clear one that I have no problem defending: groups will conquer one another, history has shown that inevitability (humanity, as it turns out, hates singing kumbiya when power and resources are available in lieu of said kumbiya-ing) but that stronger group no doubt, even in victory, has a moral obligation to responsibility over its weaker counterparts. (see Cal comment #5). Enter, once again, my argument for thinking vegetarianism (morally) is stupid: we are the dominant species on the planet (for now, and probably not much longer) and so we have the right to consume other animals for food. Because if lions had opposable thumbs and more developed cerebral cortexes they would conquer and eat the crap out of us too (equate to: stronger more technologically savvy Western Europeans conquering weaker less organized and tech-savvy Natives). However, being the dominant species does not mean that we can club baby seals so J-Lo can turn a profit. That is cruel, unusual, and, in my opinion, unjust abuse of the power we've attained as a species (equate to: wiping out reserves, tweaking legal statutes so that Native religious practices are outlawed, giving them no quarter, trail of tears, general abolishing of an entire cultural race, etc).

C) ""I would argue that might does not simply make right."" - Then you should argue that. Even though I'm not saying that (see above... and below).

D) ""What I see there is a version of the naturalistic fallacy."" - I'm assuming this is your argument. Which would be incorrect. Moore pretty clearly stipulates that a naturalistic fallacy is one in which I originate my argument for something from the position of equating it to the ""good"" by using natural properties. I never even came close to doing so. I pointed out an inevitability of history and then saying that while it may not be moral, it simply is; while, mind you, pointing out that there is indeed a moral element to it that many cultures who have exercised the aforementioned inevitabilities have not adhered to. What you really mean is that my general argument is akin to an ""is-ought"" problem, otherwise known as Hume's Guillotine (which, to your credit, is often conflated with Moore's naturalistic fallacy). Still though, it's not. But I can see how you could think I was presenting a Hume's Law type argument. 

E) ""He also conflates morality with legality, which seems wholly unjustified."" - That's actually the opposite of what I did. (see Cal comment #9). It pretty clearly outlines my view of this: morality is up for grabs, I won't definitively take a stance on it, other than saying that I argue that abuse of power is probably not moral. However, legality, while being peddled under the guise of morality (directly in contrast to your claim) has actually been used as a power of oppression for the further empowerment of the colonizers against the colonized. All of my arguments were pretty consistent with this point. 

F) I basically don't want to respond to your second paragraph. I request a re-write with more warrants and argumentation other than assumptions about our agency. Especially seeing as how incredibly off the mark you are about our identity, as well as our bias. Also read the whole thing. It'll help rebut some of the claims in your second paragraph.

You mention history, but does the club still have to be a relevant force and title contender? Is the integrity and deservedness relevant to you, or are you looking for a club that's on the rise and recently became big so that you can witness its history being created? Do you like being the underdog who still manages to challenge the top at times?

Manchester United has one of the most impressive legacies in the game. It was a great club back when football was just becoming globalized in the 50s and 60s, suffered and recovered from an iconic tragedy, has had the same (arguably greatest in the game) manager for 25 years, and can certainly be said to have earned their place at the top. The most consistently winning team since the 90s, having been home to some of the game's greatest players. Be aware that people will boo you off the proverbial stage for supporting United without an official certificate that qualifies you as a United fan whose family has been with the club for eight generations. Rivals: Liverpool, Manchester City.

Liverpool were the kings of English football in the 70s and 80s, winning everything and cementing their place in history as a dominant force for so many years. They have their own somewhat more controversial but no less iconical tragedy to base their history around. They've remained strong since then, but haven't won much in the last twenty years. Popular amongst our dads, their having been young when Liverpool was at the top. Rivals: Manchester United, Everton.

Arsenal and Tottenham are two London clubs and traditional local rivals. Arsenal have won more, being at their peak in the late 90s and early 2000s, and having an iconic veteran manager in Arsene Wenger. Tottenham haven't been big winners, but they typically play attractive football and have raised some great players, being impressive this season and fairly certain to play in next year's Champions League. One of the healthiest and most interesting rivalries in the league.

Chelsea and Manchester City are the two recent arrivals at the top. Both clubs were bought by foreign billionaires within the last decade, bringing them from mediocre status to European forces. Many dislike the way their success has been purchased exclusively by money pumped into the clubs by individuals with no connection to the sport, both being considered ""oil clubs"" who have become strong by chance instead of by climbing their way up and earning their spot at the top, but the fact remains that this is an exciting time for both. Chelsea have won a few titles in recent years but have failed to keep up this season while City, who were bought and bolstered more recently, are just coming into their own and leading the league. Chelsea were the stronger of the two before they were bought, sometimes sneaking their way into third place and having some big names such as Gianfranco Zola, while City were a strong club back in the 60s or so but were relegated to the 1st Division as recently as 1998.

Then you have a variety of other clubs to pick and choose from. Many of them are worth supporting - maybe not Wigan if it's not your local team, but clubs like Stoke and Newcastle are exciting as well. Stoke, though a small club, manage to be surprisingly strong at home, ""away at Stoke"" being one of the hardest games of the season even for top clubs. They play a unique brand of exceedingly rough and physical football, and though it isn't exactly beautiful to behold, it is their own and often effective way. Newcastle have been a semi-consistent player at the top of the league for a long time, often threatening the very top despite having considerably lesser means than the traditional winners. They've won some titles and are doing quite well this season, having lingered even in the top four at times and still compete for a spot in next year's Champions League.",t1_c3n4plc,,Jakabov,2,soccer,0,False,t3_p7ek5,1328175245,

Obviously, he's one of their top players, but that also means they will have to keep his wages high enough to keep him happy. If he does eventually leave LA for a European team, whether it be Everton or another, I don't think it will be a big blow for the MLS.

only TWR (including clearance delivery)

APP+ACC (center)
only ACC

During the education the class will get a certain number of trainee-positions (example: 4 TWR and 4 ACC) and the class can decide internally whom will go where according to what they desire... 

So you can basically decide yourself (in most cases) what kind of position you would like to work, and then you get the correlating ""rating"" in your certificate (TWR, TWR/APP, APP, ACC or APP/ACC).

I guess more to the point is; was there something intrinsic about the organization and general tactics of a legion (maniple rotation, hurling of pila, etc) which would have rendered it impotent in Medieval warfare?

That being said, I think the socioeconomic factors you listed seem more likely to have taken the legion off the table than anything else.",t1_c3n5tnf,,WatchForCharlie,,AskHistory,0,False,t1_c3n3vy3,1328190717,

A common oversight is that connection speeds are rated in megabits, when transfer rates (i.e. your download speed) are usually measured in megabytes. The difference is the same as between a bit and a byte, where one byte equals eight bits. Ergo, one megabyte equals eight megabits. Therefore, when you hit 2.1 megabytes per second, in terms of your connection speed rating, you are actually hitting 16.2 megabits per second (around the higher end of ADSL2+ line speeds).

Chances are, if you had a faster link to your exchange, you would notice speed increases, and your 2.1MBps could become 21MBps, or even 210MBps depending on where the content you are accessing is geographically stored (i.e. where the server is located, e.g. Locally, America, Europe, etc).",t1_c3n5tz0,,Sleelin,,australia,0,False,t1_c3n4xui,1328190798,

1,t5_2qhsb,0,c3n5udn,t3_p7o19,1428283375,False,0,1,,True,"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, under house arrest in Britain for more than a year, appeared at the UK Supreme Court on Wednesday to fight his extradition to Sweden.

His lawyers argued a Swedish warrant for Assange's arrest is invalid because it was issued by a Swedish prosecutor, who they say is not an independent and impartial judicial authority.

The warrant is an effort to bring Assange to Sweden to face questioning about accusations, unrelated to WikiLeaks, that he sexually assaulted two women in 2010. Assange has not been charged with a crime and has denied wrongdoing.

The prosecution is expected to make its case at the Supreme Court on Thursday; a decision is not expected for weeks.

Assange, who made no statement Wednesday, has been living at the Suffolk country mansion of one of his supporters since December 2010. He lost a court battle last November against extradition, but the High Court ruled in December that he could appeal.

Assange's lawyers have vowed to take their fight all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

The extradition case is not linked to Assange's work as founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, which has put him on the wrong side of U.S. authorities.

The organization, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published some 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others.

It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But the organization has come under increasing financial pressure in recent months, leading Assange to announce in October that WikiLeaks was temporarily stopping publication to ""aggressively fundraise"" in order to stay afloat.

While Assange waits for the Supreme Court to rule on his extradition, he plans to host a talk show on Russian TV. The Alyona Show, which appears on the Kremlin-funded, pro-Russian network Russia Today, said Wednesday that Assange will conduct interviews from the Suffolk mansion, with an electronic bracelet monitoring his movements.

Assange will also voice a character in an upcoming episode of the animated series ""The Simpsons,"" the magazine Entertainment Weekly reported Wednesday.",t1_c3n5udn,,alcornhaggard,,legal,0,False,t3_p7o19,1328190899,

This sounds very surprising because these sentiments in America and Western Europe were traditionally called left-wing and correlated with social liberalism - but in Eastern Europe this is no longer the case.

So for example it is a fairly popular sentiment that the extension of gay rights or the legalisation of marijuana is a scheme financed by global corporations and bankers and financiers in order to destroy the last safeguard against brainwashed zombie consumerism: the traditional family life and religion with its values. 

This is a very unusual (to the West) but almost perfect blend of left-wing and right-wing values (social conservatism combined with anti-capitalism, anti-financism, anti-profit-motive etc. etc.) yet it is getting very popular - and very popular especially amongst the young people, the university students, which is always a sign that there is something big going on. Amongst the young people almost a perfect blend of OWS-style, 1968's style left-radicalism combined with right-wing social conservatism, nationalism, christianism. It is usually called ""national radicalism"". There are even very popular rock bands playing what could be called national rock or national radical rock.

The international treaty is important, because we need a single rally point: the ratification of global treaty.

And competitive markets? Give me a break. Voluntary exchange doesn't exist either. If someone steps in and says ""you can exchange this and I don't care, but don't you dare exchange that other stuff""... then by definition exchange isn't voluntary.

The middle east got pushed back because of the surge of radical Islamist beliefs, while back in 0-1000 AD they were far surpassing Europe.  Africa was still in tribes when the Whites came and tried to colonize them.  Imagine living in huts and hunting for food with spears and basic axes, and seeing people wearing metal as clothing and weapons that explode like thunder and can slaughter people.  It was very hard to just rush Africa to the current age, and now we see the repercussions of that-- the dictators and armies see technology as power over the people, and one form of that technology is in the weapons they buy and use.

In Asian, a lot of it is Communism-- the government by itself cannot ever drive such huge surges in profit and success as thousands of entrepreneurs and millions of businessman can.  As for other various places-- Mongolia, Lithunia, etc they're just along for the ride, and are satisfied just living as they are.

So in other words, there will always be ""third world"" countries.

I'd say that to have any arguments about independence taken seriously, you've got to look at it from the point of view of making everyone involved better off. It just comes across as self-centred when people argue that it's in Scotland's best interests to become independent. What about the rest of Britain?
