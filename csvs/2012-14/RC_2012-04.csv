Lol. Hardly. That's a paternalistic joke. The football team at my alma mater had *maybe* five people on it who were students in the genuine sense of the word. There was a multimillion dollar student-athlete center put in while I was there, mandatory tutoring, etc. 

&gt;They get to showcase their talents to convince NBA teams.

Cause who would know LeBron James was good at basketball otherwise?

Fuck yeah. My value (as a top ten recruit) is hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars and you'll give me free food? How generous. Bullshit.

Soccer in Europe somehow seems to do fine without sending kids to university to party for a few years.

&gt;That's worth quite a bit of money.

A negligible amount relative to what a first round draft pick is paid. 

Professional leagues should be paying for their player development, not offshoring that cost to universities.

"I don't have much time to go too much in detail. Ok, well if you're having a hard time getting passed small talk, [this could be useful for you](http://www.girlschase.com/content/getting-past-small-talk#). Some things women love to talk about: traveling, reasons to interact and meet new people, ambitions are all examples. Don't also just go into saying, for instance, where was the best place you traveled to. Go into detail about why, and how it made you feel. Ask her what she likes to do in trips, how that makes her feel, why. If she went on a Europe trip, what are places she'd recommend you and how her experiences were, what did she love to do. Giving them the impression that you want to know why she likes makes them feel like you actually want to get to know them.

If it's not getting passed the small talk but adding the flirting and innuendos. To make a conversation more sexy. It takes practice a bit. As you can't go directly into the subject for most girls. Often, at least in my own experience, you have to steer the conversation where you want it. Say something that could be interpreted as sexual, but isn't. And call her out, playfully, on having a dirty mind and now knowing what she has thinking about. It takes practice. The other day, I was talking to a girl that was doing zumba and pilates regularly. And I steered the conversation into how she probably felt more fit and confident. Then how she probably developed sexy moves for dancing.

"&gt; Like Iraq has defintely had less than 5 Mil (maybe a little less than one Mil). 

I'm not quite sure what you mean here (I think you accidentally a word). But if you're referring to the War in Iraq, it is not even close. For one, your numbers are [off](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) -- most estimates say about 100,000 dead, some say 500,000 or at the very most one million, but definitely not five million.

Secondly, even forgetting the numbers, the [definition of genocide](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/genocide) is the deliberate and systematic killing of members of a certain racial, religious, or ethnic group. There is some grey area there, but the War in Iraq is without doubt *not* a genocide. There were many reasons America went to war there-- to prevent the spread of WMDs, to preempt an attack from Hussein, to spread democracy, or oil, depending on who you believe (I think it was preemptive, but that's another story for another day). But killing a certain ethnic group was **undoubtedly** not on the list of goals, not even a little bit.

Unless, perhaps, you are talking about the [Al-Anfal Campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Anfal_Campaign) under Saddam Hussein in the 1980s. The campaign targeted 4,000 Kurdish villages for the explicit purpose of killing Kurdish civilians because of their ethnicity. (Iraqi Jews, Assyrians, and other ethnic minorities were also targeted to a lesser extent). Between 50,000 and 100,000 civilians were murdered, including over 90% of all citizens of the villages targeted. That was undoubtedly a genocide, and the Hague [ruled as much](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4555000.stm). 

So, in regards to that anti-Kurdish campaign, you absolutely could compare the two. The Holocaust had many more casualties, was far more systematic, and went on for a far longer period of time-- so they are not equally large, but definitely both genocides and worthy of remembering-- and speaking of one tragedy will never diminish another tragedy (I say this as the grandchild of Holocaust survivors).

Historian [Prof. Jared Diamond Agrees](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond_rich/rich_p8.html):

&gt; Twenty years ago, a few idiots in control of the world's most populous nation were able to shut down the educational system for one billion people at the time of the Great Cultural Revolution, whereas it's impossible for a few idiots to shut down the educational system of all of Europe.

 Having a world government telling us what to do sounds terrible.

"The emperor's personal assistant recorded him saying the following when he heard about Hiroshima: ""*Under these circumstances, we must bow to the inevitable. No matter what happens to my safety, we must put an end to this war as speedily as possible so that this tragedy will not be repeated.*"" Granted, it is this very utterance that Hasegawa and Richard Frank are skeptical of, however they're competing against Sadao Asad's conclusion that Kido was being truthful. 

My problem with Hasegawa is on page 117 of his book. When Togo met with the emperor on August 8 (after British and American broadcasts confirmed that it was an atomic bomb that destroyed the city, which was subsequently confirmed by Japan's leading atomic scientist and which effectively silenced the Army's denial that it was nuclear devastation that was implied in the Potsdam declaration), Hasegawa has him urging the emperor to end the war quickly on condition that the imperial system should be retained. He then says that the following is the statement by which Hirohito *concurred* with the suggestion:

""*Now that such a new weapon has appeared, it has become less and less possible to continue the war. We must not miss a chance to terminate the war by bargaining for more favorable conditions now. Besides, however much we consult about the terms we desire, we shall not be able to come to an agreement. So my wish is to make such arrangements as will end the war as soon as possible*""

That quote directly contradicts the notion that Hirohito concurred with holding out for the condition that he retain his throne. He said they shouldn't try to prolong the war by trying to bargain for conditions because the new weapons were being employed. Unless, of course, my reading comprehension fails me after a day of labor. To further illustrate the point that the Emperor was primarily moved by the bombings comes from the reconstruction of his speech on the topic contained in ""Japan's Decision to Surrender"" and ""Imperial Tragedy: Japan in World War II"":

*I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer. Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and relieve the nation from the terrible stress with which it is burdened.*

*I was told by those advocating a continuation of hostilities that by June, new divisions would be placed in fortified positions in Kujukurihama so that they would be ready for the invader when he sought to land. It is now August and the fortifications have not been completed. Even the equipment for the divisions which are to fight is insufficient and reportedly will not be adequate until after the middle of September. Furthermore, the promised increase in the production of aircraft has not progressed in accordance with expectations.*

*There are those who say that the key to national survival lies in a decisive battle in the homeland. The experience of the past, however, shows that there has always been a discrepancy between plans and performance. I do not believe that the discrepancy in the case of Kujukurihama can be rectified. Since this is the shape of things, how can we repel the invaders?*


Regarding the Russian situation, Togo himself later said that they didn't have much faith in the negotiations since they couldn't even figure out what conditions they were going to demand as a condition of surrender. Also, page 128 of Hasegawa's book gives a quote from Masakazu Kawabe. Note that he cut out a lot of the material which supports the concluding paragraph's statement that Kawabe couldn't say for certain which shock was more decisive in ending the hostilities. I would like to go find the full quote sometime when I don't have social obligations to go tend to, but on the face value that omission (the ... part) sheds incredible doubt on the final conclusion Hasegawa takes that it was the Soviet entry rather than the atomic bombs. It was the Emperor's choice, not the Army's, and the Emperor would have been appraised of Japan's research into atomic weapons since he was a scholar. Besides, it's simply bad form to cut testimony which doesn't agree with your thesis, especially when it places undue weight on Manchuria when the holdout strategy was centered on the home islands which the Russians simply didn't have the navy to invade: 

*When the atomic bomb was dropped, I felt: ""This is terrible."" Immediately thereafter, it was reported Soviet Russia entered the war. This made me feel: ""This has really become a difficult situation.""*

*Russia's participation in the war had long since been expected, but this does not mean that we had been well prepared for it. It was with a nervous heart filled with fear that we expected Russia to enter the war. Although it was a reaction of a man who was faced with the actual occurrence of the inevitable, mine was, to speak more exact, a feeling that ""what has been most feared has finally come into reality."" I felt as though I had been given a thorough beating in rapid succession, and my thoughts were, ""So not only has there been an atomic bombing, but this has come, too.""* 

*I believe that I was more strongly impressed with the atomic bomb than other people. However, even then,... because I had a considerable amount of knowledge on the subject of atomic bombs, I had an idea that even the Americans could not produce so many of them. Moreover, since Tokyo was not directly affected by the bombing, the full force of the shock was not felt. On top of it, we had become accustomed to bombings due to frequent raids by B-29s.*

*Actually, the majority in the army did not realize at first that what had been dropped was an atomic bomb, and they were not generally familiar with the terrible nature of the atomic bomb. It was only in a gradual manner that the horrible wreckage which had been made of Hiroshima became known, instead of in a manner of a shocking effect.*

*In comparison, the Soviet entry into the war was a great shock when it actually came. Reports reaching Tokyo described Russian forces as ""invading in swarms."" It gave us all the more severe shock and alarm because we had been in constant fear of it with a vivid imagination that ""the vast Red Army forces in Europe were now being turned against us."" In other words, since the atomic bomb and the Russian declaration of war were shocks in quick succession, I cannot give a definite answer as to which of the two factors was decisive in ending hostilities*",t5_2ssp3,False,1333243901,0,0,1428632328,,True,[deleted],,,t3_rmc3g,9,t1_c47075g,AskHistorians,0,9,c4750fw,False,t1_c4750fw,

"I know I'm late to the party, but I'll try to add a few things that haven't been mentioned.

Misconception 1: The Papacy believed magic to be a pagan practice which could only be condemned. 

Some forms of magic were based around a very *clerical* subculture, available only to those with a Latin education from learned books. The roots of this type of magic were not pagan in origin, and were not seen as irrational. Learned magic derived from classical scholarship and a Christian theology. Demons were considered always present, and could be harnessed for good or bad means.

Misconception 2: The medieval church ruthlessly stamped out superstitious practices and burned witches in the thousands.

This is just plain wrong. The Spanish Inquisition didn't even start until 1480, and inquisitions in the rest of Europe until the mid-sixteenth century. The church was a hugely complex and heterogeneous organisation, with a huge divide in opinion over what constituted orthodox practice. There were clergy who saw certain types of superstitious behaviour (such as pagan enchantmants) to be of little concern; as long as the Christian's heart was in the right place, and they were preforming these actions in the name of Christ, they would be forgiven.

Misconception 3: Writing was seen as a prized skill and only carried out by the elites of society.

Writing was in fact seen as an artisanal skill, something which the intellectual author would not stoop to perform himself. He would, rather, dictate his work to a scribe. Also, being 'literate' in the Middle Ages did not carry the same meaning as it does today. One was considered literate only if one could read Latin, rather than the vernacular. Many merchants, for example, would have been able to read and write in the vernacular, but would still have been regarded as being illiterate (*illiteratus*).

I highly recommend the BBC's [Inside the Medieval Mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpJSPL7eWRU), which is a brilliant series that explores how medieval men and women understood the world around them.

"The article does give examples of bribes one may pay if one is a patient in a Romanian hospital:
&gt;Patients in Romania – a member of the European Union – routinely discuss the ""stock market"" rate for bribes. Surgeons can get hundreds of euros and upward for an operation, while anaesthetists get roughly a third of that, depending upon what a patient can afford. Nurses receive a few euros from patients each time they administer medications or put in drips. Getting a certificate stamped to have an operation abroad can easily cost hundreds, if not thousands of euros if you ask the wrong doctor.

Of course the state insurance is not paying the bribes; according to this article individuals must pay the bribes if they want treatment.  If the insurance were paying for the bribes, it would a formal payment, not an ""informal"" one.

&gt;Is flying to another country really cheaper than paying bribes?

This was especially true in Italy where we had our nicest 1st class train ride and the most horrid 2nd class train ride. 

For some train trips you will need reservations in addition to having your Eurail pass. This will cost anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars if it's an overnight train. That being said, most of the trains we took didn't require reservations. It will say in your Eurail pass documentation whether or not you need reservations for a given train.

&gt;How are the bribes different from paying for medical services like we do in the U.S.?

All medical services provided by public clinics are free and there are very few private clinics.

&gt;Are the doctors' and other medical staff's wages unreasonably low?

Yes. Medical staff literally cannot live on their wages. They need money to buy books and even medical utensils for many clinics, because the clinics don't have money.

&gt;If so, why not just demand a pay raise or raise their prices?

They constantly demand a pay raise, but about a third of our GDP is spent on healthcare. The government can't afford to give them more money. It's not that they don't get enough money, but there's a lot of corruption and so many personal interests that there is little money left to pay the staff.

&gt;Does the state insurance cover bribes?

Obviously not. Now that I see this and your previous question, I realize that you think we have to pay doctors. We don't do that. We just walk in the office and walk out. We don't give them any money. They get paid directly by the government and they don't set their own prices.

&gt;How much are these bribes, anyway?

It depends **a lot**. From a few dozen bucks for a small operation with local anesthetic to a few thousand for a major common surgery.

&gt;Is flying to another country really cheaper than paying bribes?

I would like to add one thing: while some doctors will simply refuse to touch you even if you're on their operating table unless you pay them thousands of dollars, others won't accept a penny even if you literally put it in their pocket. Most anesthetists will also refuse to do their job unless you pay them hundreds of dollars, sometimes they request up to a thousand.

"I'm not sure what you're arguing here. This article sums up a general reason why the USA has been unusually heavy on the gasoline side. [Popular Mechanics Artcle](http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/alternative-fuel/diesel/4330313)

There wasn't a complaint or comparison made to how diesel is worse than gasoline and you would be hard pressed to find someone to stand behind gasoline as a better option.

I'm also concerned about comprehension when you think anything I said is based around Italian cars when all I said was I ended my trip there. 

My point is fairly straight forward. Europe is generally progressive towards fuel. They have a higher than normal use of trains and public transportation due to high fuel costs. Diesel is a natural choice if you own a vehicle there. 

The article I linked points to one of the great examples why diesel isn't widely used in the USA. Compare our fuel prices with Europe for five decades and it's crystal clear. 

It would be nice to have more options for a daily diesel driver here in the states. I actually had a jetta tdi that I bought new in 2001 but then kids happened so it had to go. My options for vehicles that hold a family of seven don't exist here.

"A Macedonian/Greek origin of light haired/eyed people in the Near East and Central Asia is an incorrect though, oddly, a widely held belief. 

While it's true that there are groups in Central Asia that claim descent from Alexander the Great, it's not conclusive nor should it be used as evidence that those individuals are in fact of Greek/Macedonian origin. 

The fact is, there has been constant migration of peoples into and through Central Asia so to attribute a phenotype to a specific group of people is a bit of a stretch.

Here's a [pic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Haplogrupo_G_%28ADN-Y%29.PNG) of the distribution of one genetic identifier from Europe into Central Asia.

As you can see in the pic, it is most frequently in present day Georgia, not Greece. After Georgia, it occurs most frequent through Iran and into Central Asian and even less frequently in the area of Greece. If the individuals who claim Greek descent in Central Asia were correct, the reverse would be true, higher frequency in Greece than in Central Asia.

Ok, so I am starting again. I noticed my W key was sticky since I spilled some juice on my keyboard a few days ago. Now I have one of these [keyboards](http://cdn-web.steelseries.com/wp-content/uploads/SHIFT_Front_Action_Shot-FLAT.jpg). So I just took the keypart off and washed it in water, which helped, but I didn't want to put the wet key part on top of the rest of the keyboard, so I tried typing on the nubs. As you can see it didn't work that well. At first I tried to type properly, and ended up deleting every letter 5 times before hitting the right one, so I just closed my eyes, and start typing. Didn't work either. Anyway, lets get back on track.

I am going to start explaining the basics, since I got no clue how the NFL works. So in football, the two most popular forms of competition is league and cups. In the league you get 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw (if both teams ends at equal amount of goals or points at full time) and 0 for a loss. Then you tally the points up and whoever has the most points when the league ends (normally after each team has played two games against each other, one away and one home) wins the league. If two or more teams have the same amount of points, its decided on goal diference, which is the amount of goals you score, minus the amounts of goals you concede. Some leagues like the MLS goes to playoffs, but most of the big leagues just decide on points. 

In a cup you its the last man standing who wins. Some cups are knockout from the start, some have playoffs in groups and then procede to knockouts. Some have a knockout stage where each team play each other twice on their respective home grounds and then play the finale on a neutral arena.

Now, in Europe we got this thing called the Uefa Champions League,. The top teams of each country qualify for the next seasons Champions League (CL) and then the teams that didn't qualify for the CL or got knocked out play in the Europa League (EL). In England the 4 best teams qualify for the CL and the 5th and the winner of the league cup qualify for the EL. Its important to note that the CL and EL are not a part of the season, but depending on how you place in the league you qualify for the next seasons CL and EL. The winner of the CL gets a huge wad of cash. ",t5_2qmg3,True,1333256987,0,0,1428633308,,True,El-Wrongo,,,t3_rn2gu,4,t1_c475pqz,nfl,0,4,c4773md,False,t1_c4773md,

"Cables have been put under the oceans by boats for a long time.  People use them to communicate between different continents.  First, they were underwater telegraph cables; a telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic Ocean in 1858.  Telegraph operators used morse code to pass telegraph messages between North America and Europe, and sometimes these messages included information on how to transfer money between bank accounts.  This is why these transfers are called ""cable"" or ""wire transfers.""

Today, fiber optic cable is used to pass massive amounts of information.  It can carry simple messages, but also can pass information fast enough to carry telephone calls, video, and other data.  The cables are made of glass fiber that light travels through.  The fiber guides the light so that it travels down the cable rather than spreading out.  There can be several pieces of fiber in each cable, because each piece is only a little thicker than a person's hair.  Also, each piece can be used to carry multiple streams of information by using different colors of light at the same time.  Before, when an individual wire was used for each phone call, communications under the sea were very expensive because it costs a lot to run a cable under the ocean.  Because today's cables can carry so much information at once, the cost to send a little information is not nearly as high and it can be very inexpensive or even free to call people on a different continent.

These fiber optic cables are used to connect together networks on different continents and form the international internet.  This allows people from all over the world to participate and communicate and share words like this message.  It is very exciting to so easily see so many things from different people in different parts of the world, and it is possible because of the massive capacity of fiber optic cables.",t5_2sokd,False,1333257955,0,0,1428633391,,True,ic33,,,t3_rng6b,4,t3_rng6b,explainlikeimfive,0,4,c4779nv,False,t1_c4779nv,

"So, in German collegiate society during the 19th century there were these fencing clubs. Basically young men would engage in sword fighting with each other, this was partly a way for young men to blow off steam while showing their prowess with a sword (which is a weapon closely associated with the upper classes of Europe) and also get some PT as well. Well, because chicks dig scars and battle injuries make you look like a bad ass they would take a lot of pride in scars they would receive from their participation in these fencing clubs. When a fighter would get a facial wound, they would be less than efficient with their first aid, this would ensure a good scar, sometimes they would add horse hair or other foreign material to ensure a good scar. Sometimes they would actually get hurt in the face on purpose, this wearing of a facial scar acquired during fencing stayed around the German college going military minded youth until well into the 20th century. If you pay attention to the movie Valkyrie there is a German officer depicted with a pronounced facial scar, they don't mention where he got it, but historians know.

"This answer is mostly going to be confined to England and doesn't cover everything, not even close.

First, keep in mind that being a minority population with a different religion is almost always going to be shitty, especially in, say, England in the 1300s where there's no modern concept of civil rights like freedom of religion. This is enough on its own to lead to massacres and other bad things, but there's more. Jews being a tiny minority in almost all of Europe also meant that it was harder to counter rumors. Imagine you're a peasant in 14th century England and someone tells you some bullshit blood libel rumor. Odds are nobody would be able to correct them because Edward I, the villain in Braveheart, kicked the Jews out of England in 1290 (this is going to come up later). It wasn't just England, lots countries kicked local Jews out if they didn't convert: [France, Spain, Austria, some German principalities, Russia (this was kind of a special case where Jews had very restrictive limits on where they could live within the empire), Portugal and more.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Expulsion_judios-en.svg) It's a lot easier for people to believe the worst about any group if they're not there to defend themselves. When Shakespeare wrote The Merchant of Venice, it was not possible for a guy in the audience to think ""My Jewish neighbor Bob is nothing like this jerk Shylock.""

Second, the Catholic Church forbade usury (mostly). There are a lot of misconceptions about this but it all boils down to the Church saying that if you take interest you don't get communion and therefore you don't get into heaven. After 1179 you could be excommunicated for usury. Since Jews aren't Catholics this wasn't a factor and a lot of professions were closed to Jews so many were forced into banking, then seen as a marginal, 'dirty' profession. This resulted in even more popular resentment because nobody likes the rich banker.

Third, rulers had huge incentives to fuck the Jews over. Edward I need money pretty much constantly to pay for wars. When Edward I issued the Edict of Expulsion, it specified that the refuges could only leave England with the property that they can carry. Who gets the rest, all the land, buildings, anything that can't be packed up quickly? Edward I. On top of that, he was also having problems getting parliament to approve tax hikes, and offering to expel the Jews helped Edward convince parliament to raise taxes. This pattern where the ruler kicked all the Jews out and took their stuff happened repeatedly, and it was often popular with the people, the pope, and nobles.

So in the end you have a minority population with a different religion, members of the group often are relegated to a job that is literally blasphemy, and when rulers persecute them they can get a ton of money and a boost in popularity. 

Fake edit; I wanted to put this awesome quote in somewhere but it didn't really fit.

&gt;Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia. But the plot must also come from the inside: Jews are usually the best target because they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside ... The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies ... However, the followers of Ur-Fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.

However…

The causes are certainly not clear. There have been a few studies that have attempted to find biological explanations but they are not totally compelling.

**Is it related to hormones and brain development in-utero?**

Conceivably. Although this study itself seems to lack robustness and is based on ""digit ratios"" (which I would have thought would be a confounding factor to something you do with your hands). http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886905000528

**Are the differences due to handwriting pressure (i.e. strength/grip)?**

A correlation with handwriting untidiness but not necessarily other gender differences. This study is from 1959 but is still more compelling than the hormone study. http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20154148

Annoyingly, I could not find a study which analyzed whether boys and girls simply had different social pressures to make their handwriting look certain ways. I would like to see this because I think it's a relevant potential cause to investigate. There are lots of studies on whether handwriting, including perceived gender in handwriting, influences examiners (it does) but much less on the causes of the gender differences.

As a follow up though… the field of graphology (attempting to determine traits of personality from handwriting) is scientifically regarded as worthless:

"You don't have to started out with a bias to have one now. It's easy to get a biased image of islam in the media and popular opinion today, even if you don't mean to.

What if I told you I know some really nice muslims? Would that personal anecdote mean you changed your views? No? Well, in that case we're on the same page.

Opinion polls and studies about attitude and prevalence of extremist views, now that's something that can actually tell us something. And I have seen several such studies. One study is a demographic study about the muslim immigrants where I live, Sweden. It turns out a significant part of them are secular. Who'da thunk when people just hold up the high number of muslims in our country? Also, if you look at acts of terrorism in the EU, it turns out that muslim terrorists are very rare. Most terrorism comes from separatists, the right and the left.

The situation in Saudi Arabia is horrible, but not very relevant here. The number of islamist extremists are low and they're on the fringes of society. Many of EU countries have xenophobic parties in their parliaments. Denmark has a prominent one, which probably why EDL picked them. They're also in the EU, dictating immigration politics and influencing other politicians to pander to them.

"The dolab line up for week 1 has some big names on it compared to week 2.  So that right there gives week 1 an advantage (Amon Tobin + Double Click performing in the dolab as ""Two Fingers"" and Machinedrum) So basicly week 1 gets 2x the Amon Tobin, and a big up n' comer Machinedrum. 

Week 2 has 4/20 and lands on the ""official"" Record Store Day date. (although i'm sure they'll still be selling plenty of records to week 1 people)  

I also think week 2 will have a slight advantage of having all the ""kinks"" worked out.  If a band thats just getting back together (Like At The Drive-In) has technical problems the first week, you can probably bet they'll be ironed out by week 2 and you'll have a stronger performance. 

Also if bands have any problems with travel (like the infamous 2010 Iclandic Volcano fiasco that grounded all planes in europe and prevented a bunch of bands getting to coachella) you can probably bet theres a bigger chance of an artist missing Week 1.... they'll already be in town for week 2 though, no matter what. 

Futhermore if the facebook stats on the offical coachella ""which weekend are you going too"" facebook Poll are any indication, there might be quite a bit more tickets for weekend 2 that are currently Scalped/not registered, indidcating a slightly smaller crowd for week 2 (yea yea, i know its sold out, but theres literally HALF the amount of people saying they're going to week 2 than week 1..... has to mean something?)

Full disclosure:  I'm going week 2. 

  I think it will probably be in people's interest to avoid r/coachella and music news websites the week before week 2, to avoid spoilage, if they are going to only week 2.   Just like you'd do for a new episode of a TV show you cant watch right away, avoid its subreddit at all costs or else. 


You have to remember too though that coachella is different for everyone.   Even 2 separate people that go to the same weekend are going to have an entirely different experience from eachother given all the stages/conflicts.

"I'm inclined to agree with IEM on this, there is a great disparity between Korean and western players borne in part by the differences in tournament structure. 

Western events have to occur   either online or over a short span of time because of the sheer landmass of the European and american continents and as a consequence of this; its a very small investment for Koreans to take part in western events and squelch the fostering of western talent. Compare this to Korea where literally every Korean starcraft player is a 3 hour trip away from any Korean starcraft event, which gives koreans the option of a comfortable long term tournament structure like the GSL.

Sure there is something to be said about allowing koreans to come so that western players can 'play the best'; but i feel that the low returns we get from that could be easily offset by a concerted effort to specifically foster and reward western talent. we need the handicap and playing 2-3 games with a Korean in an IEM is not enough to erase the need for that handicap.

The specifically Argentine claim dates back to the late 1810s. In the eighteenth century,  French had colonised one part of the Falklands and the British another. The Spanish acquired the French site in 1767 and attacked the British colony in 1770, a matter that was settled with a peace treaty and the return of the British. The Spanish left entirely in 1806. 

At this time, the nascent Buenos Aires was the centre of Spanish rule for the whole of South America. The other prior Vice Regency, Peru, had been disgraced and had lost its rights;  consequently all goods had to be traded through Buenos Aires, a matter of great resentment. This, of course, made it a centre for marine activity. 

This was the era of the Napoleonic wars in Europe. Britain was fighting France and its ally, Spain. The colonies of Spain were therefore fair game, and Buenos Aires and Montevideo had been harried continuously by British ships, some HM Navy, other frank pirates. Also in 1806, therefore, Buenos Aires was captured by the British in a punitive invasion, and then released to the forces of the Vice Regency. It was defended from a second assault in 1807, an attack which took Uruguay. 

To achieve this defensive capability, it had proven necessary to arm the population. This led to the downfall of one Viceroy and the establishment of a second as a local choice, a figure utterly dependent on the local military. In 1810, as Spain was evidently going to lose the European war, this authority demanded the submission of the rest of the Vice Regency to it as an independent power. This was resisted, and hostilities commenced amongst the more-or-less former Spanish dependencies. However, due to the influence of Bolivar in the North and the general spirit of revolution, it was these hold-outs that fell to the forces of independence from Spain. Argentina formed from the remnants. All of this took a decade or more to settle down. So, a background of considerable chaos. 

The Irish Admiral William Brown fought for Buenos Aires against Uruguay during these conflicts. He is an example of the near universal intimate foreign engagement in a local war. In general, it was customary in those days to employ independent ships' captains as privateers; that is, as vessels licensed to attack a specified enemy. They did this for their own gain, selling the captured ship and its cargo. The Provincias Unidas de la Plata gave such letters of marque to an American captain named [Jewett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jewett). 

Portugal had transferred its court to Brazil, siding with the British in the war against Napoleon and the puppet Spanish court. Brazil was nevertheless an ally of the Vice Regency, and specifically excluded from the letters of marque given to Jewett. Nevertheless, he attacked at least one Brazilian/ Portuguese ship, a fact which which made him a pirate. Pursued by the Brazilians, he fled South in a state of mutiny, to wreck or strand himself on the Falkland. As noted, these were already inhabited by a group of British settlers, who gave him shelter and coped with his mutinous crew. Jewett responded with a letter to the local administration, proclaiming the islands for the United Provinces - that is, for Argentina. Nobody paid him much attention. 

He then seized the first ship into port - coincidentally American - and sailed back to the US. He wrote a long, self-promoting letter to the Buenos Aires explaining his situation, but making no remarks about the Falklands. In the US, he gave an interview to the Salem Gazette in which he did mention the claim that he had made. This report in turn found its way back to Buenos Aires, and thence into folk legend. In 1832, Argentina attempted to form a penal colony on the islands, but this mutinied after four days and killed its commander. The British immediately requested their departure, with which they complied. A formal British colony was established in 1840, complete with governor and a naval station. A major enagement was fought from there against Germany in World War I.

"In my view of things, - and I could be wrong - the GOP stopped giving a fuck about the nation a long time ago, in real terms.

Because the powers that be in the party were able to play a certain set of keys and get vast numbers of people at the polls , was great to start. But eventually the number of people keyed up became so shrill that it was a problem.

One of the major take-aways I had from the 2004 election, was how disenfranchised the Evangelical community became. 

Literally overnight the christian morals President - everything the Evangelicals had hoped for - was on the TV trying to equivocate on how torturing people was good or necessary, and that was followed pretty rapidly by a pedophile (Mark Foley) trying to pass himself off as a ""family values"" candidate.

We saw compassionate conservatism die hard in New Orleans, and anyone in the south around that time got a full on free-market exersize in just how high the price of gasoline could go. I've paid 7 dollars for gasoline - and did so mostly because I needed to drive somewhere and of course the novelty of paying nearly 140 dollars to fill my tank!

So it wasn't some giant ideological shift, on my part, but rather that I now have a choice.

After 12 long years of war, and more than a few family members who have served and are no longer ""quite themselves"" having spent so long overseas. My choice is blood simple. 

Every single GOP candidate has promised military action if not full scale war against Iran. 

The problem is, they haven't really done anything that would warrant a full scale war. They don't like us, (I can't say as I blame them either), they want to build nuclear power plants (I don't care), and they have alot of oil (good for them). But why is it our repsonsibility to send OUR sons and daughters into harms way, when the Turks, Indians, Chinese, Europeans are all the actual Iranian customers. It's not our business. 

So I'm not voting for Mr. Obama because I like this or that domestic program, I AM voting for Obama because he seems less enthusiastic about starting another war that doesn't have a good justification.

Until and unless our national leaders get serious about leading, and helping the citizenry or shrinking the size of governance to protect our nation from a debt crisis, we're in trouble.

"I wrote this four years ago and it is a bit dated now but it does illustrate how American Exceptionalism has been twisted by the right for its own needs for a very long time:

Uncorking the American Genie:
American Exceptionalism and Anti-Americanism
During the climax of the film, Team America: World Police, Gary Johnston, the film’s protagonist, delivers an outrageously vulgar yet undeniably hilarious speech about the rights and responsibility America and its foreign policy has in defending and enforcing freedom throughout the world
We're d---s! We're reckless, arrogant, stupid d---s. And the Film Actors Guild are p-----s. And Kim Jong Il is an a-----e. P-----s don't like d---s, because p-----s get f----d by d---s. But d---s also f--k a------s: a------s that just want to s--t on everything. P-----s may think they can deal with a-----s their way. But the only thing that can f--k an a-----e is a d--k, with some balls. The problem with d---s is: they f--k too much or f--k when it isn't appropriate - and it takes a p---y to show them that. But sometimes, p-----s can be so full of s--t that they become a------s themselves... because p-----s are an inch and half away from a------s. I don't know much about this crazy, crazy world, but I do know this: If you don't let us f--k this a-----e, we're going to have our d---s and p-----s all covered in s--t!(Parker).
Trey Parker’s and Matt Stone’s film equally lampoons anti-Americanism and American Exceptionalism without pointing at either as a legitimate philosophy. Rather, Team America: World Police acts as an easy to swallow primer for understanding the fallacies of both.
Anti-Americanism and American Exceptionalism are not new concepts. The venerable social thinker Alexis de Tocqueville formed the definition for “American Exceptionalism” in his 1835 book Democracy in America. However, since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11th, 2001, both terms have gained new importance in the glossary of American foreign policy. Both terms are used as epithets and as badges of honor and are invoked for causes of action and reaction in America and abroad. These rally cries of American Exceptionalism and anti-Americanism have reduced to meaningless sound bites squawking over cable news programs and semi-literate fringe blogs, words without meaning.
Fairly judging these two concepts must include understanding America itself; for America’s unique history manifested the notion of American Exceptionalism. American Exceptionalism cultivated anti-Americanism throughout the world, particularly Europe. Three major events in American history illustrate how American Exceptionalism sprouted in the consciousness of its citizen’s: the end of World War II leading to the Cold War and ultimately the September 11th terror attacks and its aftermath. These three events in American history created, in Europe, reactions of anti-Americanism in return.
Alexis de Tocqueville wrote Democracy in America in 1835 during the midst of political upheaval in his own country of France. He saw in the fledgling nation of the United States of America a gleam of hope for future political tranquility in his own country and Europe as a whole. He writes in his introduction:

There is one country in the world where the great social revolution that I am speaking of seems to have nearly reached its natural limits. It has been effected with ease and simplicity; say rather this country is reaping the fruits of the democratic revolution which we are under going, without having had the revolution itself.
The emigrants who colonized the shores of America in the beginning of the seventeenth century somehow separated the democratic principle from all the principles that it had to contend with in the old communities of Europe and transplanted it alone to the New World. It had there been able to spread in perfect freedom and peaceably to determine the character of the laws by influencing the manners of the country (de Tocqueville 14).

De Tocqueville essentially defined what is now traditionally known as American Exceptionalism, America’s unique place in the world, a nation of immigrants building a new society based on laws and ideas never seen before in modern times, a nation above all nations due to its new ideals, a paragon to monarchal Old World Europe. Robert Kagan, noted political scientist, reflects de Tocqueville’s sentiment referring to the birth of America as “the great hope for Enlightened Europe” (Kagan 9).
Up until the twentieth century, America and its exceptionalism remained parochial in its isolation, a sort of Avalon across the Atlantic Ocean. Squabbling European empires retained its might on the seas and in its other colonies throughout the world. The American nation remained content in its experiment in democracy, forsaking the spiraling conflicts from its emancipated continental parents. In truth America could not, until the twentieth century, compete with Europe’s strength and power. A gap was forming between America and Europe, but so long as America was weak, this alienation was viewed on both sides of the Atlantic as benign (Kagan 10). Anti-Americanism did not begin to sprout until the end of World War II and the implementation of the Marshall Plan and the inception of the Cold War.
The balance of power in the world shifted after the end of World War II. Europe no longer had the stomach for total war. The governments of Western Europe, dreading Soviet aggression, relied heavily on American protection and patronage for the next fifty years (Kagan 18). Germany smarted from its complete military defeat and faced an uncertain future as ground zero for the Cold War. Germany watched, helpless, as it went from king to pawn on the chess board of international politics and commerce (Stephan 18).
Europe had uncorked the bottle and let loose the American genie. More or less contained for two centuries in the bottle of the New World, America, despite its specially endowed place in world history, stayed a non-power. However, as Europe weakened after World War II, America gained in military might and prominence politically. The once benign gap between Europe and America began showing signs of malignancy that would become open anti-Americanism decades later after September 11th, 2001.
Robert Kagan wrote, “Strong powers naturally view the world differently than weaker powers” (27). Europe, having endured two devastating world wars and having watched most if not all its colonial holdings in Africa and Asia slip away, turned towards a more peaceable and co-operative mindset (Kagan 17). The failures of the League of Nations after World War II led to a more hopeful multilateral union of nations under the United Nations; ironically, the United States and its ideals of democracy and freedom for all mankind had a great part in the formation of both international bodies. Western Europe, as well as America, separately formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in response to the Soviet bloc’s Warsaw Pact. Europe was enthusiastic for America to take the reigns of power of the Western world leading and protecting 
European interests. John Lewis Gaddis, a professor of Military and Naval History at Yale University, quoted unnamed British military officers saying, “The United States would soon be ‘plucking the torch of world leadership from our chilling hands’” (Kagan qt. Gaddis 17).

"It's a sexy theory, but not very likely. Alexander's invasions, like most conquests, would have had very little demographic impact. The numbers would simply be too small, and any distinctive traits they added to the population would probably have been absorbed very quickly. Also keep in mind that ""blond hair blue eyes"" phenotype isn't a very common look in Greece either, so it's a little hard to imagine Greeks being the source of these traits.

It's more likely that these traits are well within the spectrum of human variation within the region. It's not like the ""European type"" -whatever that is, I guess exemplified by fair hair, eyes, and skin - ends at the Bosporus. Genetic variation on a macro level is pretty continuous, so its not surprising that you would find people with fairer traits in the middle east, any more than it is surprising to find darker hair/eyes/skin in Europe. There was actually a group in China that had ""European features"" and considered themselves descendents of some Greek mercenaries or something. But genetic testing revealed them to be most related to other Han Chinese around them, so there ""stand out"" traits were probably due to usual variation combined with endogamy and relative isolation over a long period of time.

Even language groups are a questionable source for tracing ancestry: language transfer is much more common than gene transfer. Geographic proximity often trumps linguistic affiliation in terms of group relatedness.

"pt 2:


Once power hungry, blood thirsty, colonizing Europe had been neutered by two devastating wars in half a century, it was ready for its “exceptional” offspring from across the Atlantic to come into its own. Unfortunately, Europe was unprepared for how deep America’s exceptionalism, as defined by de Tocqueville, ran at America’s core. The American genie had thrice granted wishes to Europe: interventions in both world wars and then protection during the Cold War. Legend says once a genie has granted three wishes it is free from its bonds and may wield its power as it sees fit. America, now a superpower, wielded its power and might as it saw fit.
Ambassador John McDonald noted that most people outside the United States view Americans as arrogant, that Americans present themselves as superior to any other people in the world, and this arrogance is our second nature (9). This is an easy assumption he makes; Americans are bombarded with this propaganda from all sources in the media. Images from movies like Armageddon show slow motion American flags flapping in the breeze while swelling almost patriotic strings play (Bay); Armageddon reinforces Americans’ belief that America is the only country in the world able to save the world with their ingenuity and work ethic. Arrogantly, these kinds of American films are exported throughout the world. Not surprisingly Armageddon earned over $350,000,000 internationally (Armageddon). America exports its belief in its exceptionalism and its arrogance. At the same time, the United States remains insulated from outside cultural influences. Americans chafe with xenophobic hysteria at any foreign cultural seepage. People from around the globe see this as another example of America’s “superiority complex” (McDonald 10).
The American rise in power, its dominance in commerce and culture, its growing sense of exceptionalism and arrogance since the end of World War II through the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War has created a rift between Europe and the United States that has manifested into a sometimes subtle and sometimes fervent anti-American stance in Europe.
American leadership throughout the Cold War felt a burden and responsibility in protecting Europe from Soviet aggression; this created, between the two, a sense of tension (Kagan 18). Europe no longer had the ability to wage offensive wars and was relegated to holding their defenses until the Americans could arrive and save them yet again (Kagan 18). European military capacity atrophied during the Cold War; the result from this was the formation of the policy of American unilateralism. European governments were initially happy to fall under the protection of the American military (Kagan 19). This changed with the end of the Cold War.
The European Union slowly developed from a loose affiliation of European states to a sort of power in its own right at the end of the Cold War. The EU proceeded to create its own military force with the hope of no longer needing to rely on American forces (Kissinger 53). Despite success with actions during the Serbian crisis, the EU military forces faced a more serious challenge in Kosovo in 1999. They also faced a chilling reality; they were unable to meet the challenge alone. American forces were needed as well (Kagan 46). In a sense, asking Americans for help meant asking America to take over the mess. The United States, after the Cold War, became more entrenched in its unilateral approach to issues around the world (Kagan 45).
American unilateral approach to foreign crises stems from an evolved definition of “American Exceptionalism.” No longer was “exceptionalism” simply defined by America’s unique place in the world and history; it was a rallying cry from conservative thinkers to maintain the United States jealously guarded sovereignty. American leaders express a sentiment that no bodies, such as the United Nations nor the World Court (Stephan 23), nor international 
treaties such as the Kyoto Accords hold higher sway than the Constitution or American interests (Wooing the World par.10) The crisis in Kosovo shows this unilateralism in practice; Robert Kagan gives examples of how the American military during the Kosovo crisis turned a NATO multilateral exercise into a demonstrable American unilateral effort, “The United States flew the majority of the missions, almost all of the precision-guided munitions dropped in Serbia and Kosovo were made in America, and the unmatched superiority of American technical intelligence-gathering capabilities meant that 99% of the proposed targets came from American intelligence sources” (Kagan 46). Relegating European military personnel to the sidelines not only wounded their pride, it reinforced American arrogance and sense of infallibility and invulnerability (Kagan 46). General Wesley Clark, showing his dissatisfaction with nominal multilateralism, said, “We never want to do this again” (Kagan 49).
America, it seemed, outgrew even the mere term “superpower.” The United States, the genie uncorked, now wielded power and might never seen before. She stood alone in the world, a “hectoring hegemon a hyperpower, or as France’s former foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, coined America, hyperpuissance (Kagan 43). Europe’s criticism of America may have remained an amusing footnote in history if not for 9/11.

The word ‘Slav’ or ‘Slowianin’ comes from the Slavic term for word; ‘Slowo’.  ‘Slowo’ means ‘word’ (słowo in Polish letters but pronounced swovo). The Slavs identified themselves as those who could understand their word or language.   Slavic could be interpreted as “someone who understands”.  The Slavs called themselves ‘Slovjeni’ or ‘Slaveni’ do to the fact that their people ‘understood’ one another.

However, for example German was and is called “niemiecki” That is those who do not understand the language, coming from the word, Nijemcima’ meaning speechless. This is similar to the Romans and Latin. People who could not understand Latin were called barbarians by the Romans because they made sounds that sounded like “bar ba” to a Latin-speaking ear.

"If anything read this:

 Anatolians do not significantly differ from other Mediterranean populations, indicating that while the Asian Turks carried out an invasion with cultural significance (language and religion), the genetic significance is only weakly detectable.[21] Recent genetic research has suggested the local Anatolian origins of the Turkic Asian peoples might have been slight.[22] These findings are consistent with a model in which the Turkic languages, originating in the Altai-Sayan region of Central Asia and northwestern Mongolia, were imposed on the indigenous peoples with relatively little genetic admixture, possible example of elite cultural dominance-driven linguistic replacement.[23] These observations also may be explained by Anatolia having the lowest migrant/resident ratio at the time of Turkic migrations. Analysis suggested that, genetically, Anatolians are more closely related also with Balkan populations than to the Central Asian populations.[24][25] Analogical results have been received in neighbouring Caucasus region by testing Armenian and Turkic speaking Azerbaijani populations, therefore representing language replacements, possibly via elite dominance involving primarily male migrants.[26] In conclusion, today the major DNA components in Anatolian population are shared with European and neighboring Near Eastern populations and contrast with only a minor share of haplogroups related to Central Asian, South Asian and African affinity, which supports the language replacement hypothesis in the region.[27]",t5_2qh0u,False,1333294539,0,0,1428635005,,True,DoctorSteve,,,t3_rnuub,2,t1_c47amre,pics,0,2,c47ao22,False,t1_c47ao22,

"""The logical path forward is clear. We need to adapt to the realities of the 21st century, incorporating the world’s best ideas into our already-successful foundation.""

This is where this article gets lazy. There is no clear path forward for America or anyone else in the 21st century. Hopefully the author has noticed that Europe isn't all sunshine now either. It isn't a matter of just borrowing some of their ideas to fix our problems.

America exceptionalism is bad not only because it makes going forward harder, but also because it heavily distorts the past. America's ""solid foundation"" only exists when you wipe away all of the inconvenient (and therefore unimportant) facts of our history. Imperialism, political repression, and control of the government by the highest class have all existed throughout the course of American history. If the author believes that our history has, in fact, a solid foundation, they are just as gripped by American exceptionalism as anybody else. If we are to make real progress in this century, we must reject that propagandized view of history that the most liberal to the most conservative elements of our mainstream political culture perpetuate.",t5_2cneq,False,1333298213,0,0,1428635255,,True,ifleninwasawizard,,,t3_rnyah,4,t3_rnyah,politics,0,4,c47b6c0,False,t1_c47b6c0,

"First off, I completely disagree that money doesn't influence life. It is the embodiment of greed, because simply possessing it gives you anything you desire. It's only natural to devote a large portion of your life in chasing it, when available.

Also, I hardly consider today's ""Native Americans"" to be the same thing. They've gotten as caught up in the rat race as anyone else. I meant their society before Europeans took over, as it had no money. They took only what they needed, used all of it, and worked towards their tribe in whatever way best suited them. This is closer to the way these ideas would be practiced, with the exception of the nomadic wandering.

Cities need to have almost all of its staples imported from elsewhere. This promotes growing in bulk, wasting energy transporting it, packaging it, and then disposing of anything not bought. In my circumstances, you can grow how much you need to provide, on site, and freshly. There won't need to be co-dependence from various places.

You won't need thousands of people working in the field. 1 or 2 is perfect for each city, while they can communicate with their colleagues through the internet.

&gt; infrared reflectography images of the Prado replica were compared with those obtained in 2004 from the original of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. This process enables conservators to peer beneath the surface of the paint, to see underdrawing and changes which evolved in the composition.

&gt;The underdrawing of the Madrid replica was similar to that of the Mona Lisa before it was finished. This suggests that the original and the copy were begun at the same time and painted next to each other, as the work evolved.

http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Earliest-copy-of-Mona-Lisa-found-in-Prado/25514

It's also worth noticing that the original Mona Lisa also seems to have several layers of varnish (parts of a more colourful blue sky can be seen in the upper left border and in the water), but apparently it's too risky to remove it (edit: or, according to the wikipedia, it may have been damaged)

"I have been a Liverpool fan since I was 7 years old, I am 38 years old now...I moved to the States a while back, so the internet or TV is the only way I get to see them now.  I did not even bother to get up and watch the game today, and for me, this is the first time in a very long time I have not made the effort to watch them play.

I knew they would lose, the last time I watched Liverpool play such dire football was under Graham Souness, and we all know what happened to him...his reputation was destroyed, and his success as a player at the club was forgotten.  I do not want this to happen to Kenny, cups are nice but 8th in the premier league is just not good enough.

I can handle losing to Newcastle, they are playing well, got a good team spirit and bought players that fit in with the clubs current crop of players, they are over-performing, but this is what every club should strive for.  We bought bought players that are young and will grow, but Liverpool cannot wait for potential, and I said this at the start of the season.

I never lose hope that Liverpool will turn things around, and be better then this.  At this point the season is just a write off, we won a cup...we got into europe.  Time to tinker with the tactics, drop those who need to be dropped, play kids if you have to, do something to instill confidence in the team, stop playing people in the hope they have a good game, only to drop them the next.

Henderson needs a spell in the reserves, so does Carroll, Gerrard is just too broken and getting older by the day.  We need another striker to go with Suarez, play Kuyt upfront, instead of on the right where he is slow and fleeting in his greatness.

But I am willing to give him one more summer of rebuilding, if it was not for the cup runs I would say time to go.

First off, I think you would be suprised by the difficulty of European schools. I'm not sure how things work in the US and what you'll be following in Germany, but I believe germany has different levels of high schools where, in the US, everybody follows the same difficulty of high school in the US? Correct me if I'm wrong.


Also, in elementary, I got cake from my school on my birthday. It was very good cake.


As for cultural differences, I think that in Germany, you will be able to speak English to the younger generation, but don't expect older people (40+ possibly) to speak English very well.


Also, I believe Metal and Rock (stuff like that) is more mainstream in Germany than it is in the US. Think of bands like Linkin Park, System of a Down etc. So expect goth-ish kids. Personally I think their idea of fashion is terrible (that's just me though xD).


Last but not least, keep in mind that the Netherlands has a better national Soccer team and don't call them nazi's or make WWII/jew jokes, they might find it offensive coming from a foreigner. **ESPECIALLY FOR THE ELDERLY THIS IS A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT!**. Oh and don't expect American Football/Baseball. Football (ok, ok... Soccer...) and Basketball are the most popular sports.

**Edit**: Also, the minimum age for alcohol is 16, the minimum age for driving is 17+ to get your drivers license and 18+ to drive solo I think? Not sure. Also, everybody owns a BMW, Audi or Mercedes in Germany.

**Edit Edit**: Where will you go? There are large cultural differences in both language and norms between the north (which is more industrial) and the south. I personally find the girls in the southern Germany to insanely pretty (no offense, north).

**Edit Edit Edit**: Places you should visit are: Paris, Disneyland Paris (Make it a long weekend, go to one of the hotels. They are very nice and provide transportation), Amsterdam, Berlin (Checkpoint Charlie, Reichstag, Brandenburger Tor, the Ritter Sports chocolate store, Holocaust-Mahnmal/Denkmal). The currency is international , which makes it easy to travel abroad! Also visit the [Nürnburgring](http://www.nuerburgring.de/) if you are 18+ and get a rental car. Make sure you are well insured though.

Briefly for the English topflight: Every team plays every other team twice, once at home and once away.

A win is 3 points, a draw 1. Team with the most points at the end of the year wins the league. There are not playoffs like the NFL, HOWEVER there is something called the FA Cup. 

Every team in the top 11 leagues in England participates in the tournament (although the higher level you are the more byes you get). It's a great trophy to win and super exciting (because it's single elimination... think March Madness), although it's considered below winning the league.

[Stalin's Jews: We mustn't forget that some of greatest murderers of modern times were Jewish (Ynet)](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3342999,00.html)

&gt;And us, the Jews? An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name ""Genrikh Yagoda,"" the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU's deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin's collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system. After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the ""bloodthirsty dwarf.""...

&gt;In 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin. They too, of course, were gradually eliminated in the next purges. In a fascinating lecture at a Tel Aviv University convention this week, Dr. Halfin described the waves of soviet terror as a ""carnival of mass murder,"" ""fantasy of purges"", and ""essianism of evil."" Turns out that Jews too, when they become captivated by messianic ideology, can become great murderers, among the greatest known by modern history...

&gt;Yuri Slezkine's book The Jewish Century, which appeared last year to rapturous reviews, is an intellectual tour de force, alternately muddled and brilliant, courageous and apologetic. Slezkine's greatest accomplishment is to set the historical record straight on the importance of Jews in the Bolshevik Revolution and its aftermath.   He summarizes previously available data and extends our understanding of the Jewish role in revolutionary movements before 1917 and of Soviet society thereafter. His book provides a fascinating chronicle of the Jewish rise to elite status in all areas of Soviet society—culture, the universities, professional occupations, the media, and government. Indeed, the book is also probably the best, most up-to-date account of Jewish economic and cultural pre-eminence in Europe (and America) that we have...

"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rus_(name)

&gt; **Originally, the name Rus (Русь, Rus’) referred to the people,[1] the region, and the medieval states (9th to 12th centuries) of the Rus' Khaganate and Kievan Rus' polities. The territories of the latter are today distributed among Belarus, Ukraine, and a part of the European section of Russia.**
One of the earliest written sources mentioning the people called Rus (as Rhos) dates back to year 839 AD in a Royal Frankish chronicle Annales Bertiniani; the Frankish authorities identified them as a Germanic tribe called Swedes. According to the Kievan Rus' Primary Chronicle, compiled in about 1113 AD, the Rus were a group of Varangians, Norsemen who had relocated somewhere from the Baltic region (literally ""from beyond the sea""), first to Northeastern Europe, then to the south where they created the medieval Kievan state.[2]

&gt;The modern name of Russia (Rossiya), which came into use in the 17th century, is derived from the Greek Ρωσσία (nowadays spelled Ρωσία) which in turn derives from Ρως, an early Greek name for the people of Rus'.[3] ""Rus'"" as a state had no proper name; by its inhabitants it was called ""rusĭska zemlya"".(русьска(я) земля) (with rusĭska alternatively spelled russka, rus'ka, and most often ruska), which might be translated as ""Land of the Rus"". The word ""rusĭska"" is an adjective: the morpheme -ĭsk- is used to form adjectives in Slavic; -a is a grammatical ending for feminine adjectives (namely, zemlya, ""land"", is grammatically feminine in Slavic). In similar fashion, Poland is called Polska by its inhabitants, that is, Pol-sk-a, originally being the adjective Polish (land).

&gt; **To distinguish the medieval ""Rus"" state from other states that derived from it, modern historiography calls it ""Kievan Rus'.""**",t5_2qqjc,False,1333307607,0,0,1435724786,,True,Ref101010,,,t3_rnsf1,3,t1_c47a5gd,todayilearned,0,3,c47clkl,False,t1_c47clkl,

Some suggest more funding for NASA could lead to finding more about global warming. I don't discount this, but we already know a lot about it. We know what it is, we know why it happens, and yes, we even know how to stop it.

"Flamebait or not, atheists who pretend to ""know god does not exist"" instead of ""think god doesn't exist"" are hypocrites.  r/Atheism is the biggest anti-christian/religion circlejerk I've seen on any message board/user content websites. They constantly argue the fallacy of ""faith"" yet the vast majority of active Atheists on that board rely on ""faith"" in the belief of absence of something that is completely unknown and unproven.

Also, if that isn't god, what is god.  There has never been a decent answer to that question as the answer is also unknowable, just as if one exists.  My logic does not define god with self-awareness, energy or really anything....a creator is a creator, no matter the actuality of the answer.  Being thankful for existing, and giving thanks in prayer/meditation (something many Deists do) is not something that is done to make god feel better, it's to make me feel better.

Would you argue American Atheists are happier people than those with belief in god?  I would like to see something that backs that up.

The idea of a tomb is that you dispose your dead in it and hope you never come back to them. That's why people always dug deep fucking holes, put their dead in them and them covered them up with the remaining (approximately) tons of dirt. 

Even today, in cemeteries which have shelf systems (idk if they're used in the USA too, but I've seen them a lot in Europe), they make it goddamn difficult for somebody to open the tomb up, and even then the body is *still* in a coffin, so it has double isolation from the outside.

"Cue Chicken Little ... the sky is falling, OMG the government is spying on EVERYONE, Orwell was right, 1984 blah blah !!!

Okay, sarcastic reactionary outburst over, let's just consider realistically what this would mean.

http://www.circleid.com/posts/2011118_the_impressive_growth_in_global_internet_stats_2011/

&gt; Europeans enjoy on average almost 90,000 bit/s of bandwidth per user

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-access---households-and-individuals/2011/stb-internet-access-2011.html#tab-Household-Internet-Access

&gt; In 2011, 19 million households in Great Britain had an Internet connection

Assuming the UK is representative of Europe as a whole with respect to bandwidth enjoyed, and using the fact there are estimated 19 million households in UK, that means the UK is consuming 199 gigabytes of data EVERY SECOND, or a typical hard disk every 3 seconds.

Or 20 hard disks an minute, or 1200 an hour, or 28880 a day, or 10,512,000 a year.

And of course, the whole ""real time"" thing is just a misnomer used by the government and media to scare the proles, it would in fact necessitate an army of probably another 19 million people working 24 hours just to monitor all this data and understand what was a ""threat"" and what wasn't. Any way you look at it, it HAS to be stored before it can be viewed, because it simply cannot be done in ""real time"".

The logistics of 'allowing the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to go through “on demand” every text message &amp; email sent, websites accessed &amp; phone calls made “in real time""' is just impossible to visualize.

Hell, the UK sends 275 million texts a day ! How many people would it take just to read 3000 texts a second ?

This makes no consideration whatsoever to the fact many transactions are already encrypted, especially those likely to be terrorist communications or kiddy-porn, or whatever reason-du-jour the goverment is using ""for your safety"".

Because the Afghan and Iraqi wars went so well.

Look, this is the sort of arrogance people have a problem with. You can have as many weapons as you want, but you still need motivation and manpower. 

The EU has a larger GDP than the US, yes it may have a larger population, but the US is twice the size and has far more natural resources.

In terms of education it is well known that the US only has the best universities due to the huge number of academics who come from the rest of the world's universities purely for the funding at US research centres. I believe I read a paper a few years ago discussing how slightly over 50% of US research is actually conducted by foreign nationals in the US. Then there is the fact that american universities have astronomically large funding, and for the cost, provide a substandard improvement on standards compared to other institutions.

And again, you compare the US and UK on Nobel Prize winners. Need I remind you the population disparity between these two nations? UK: 70million. US: 300 million.

Now, you talk about innovation, I don't need to argue with you, because for the size of europe and its lack of military actions in order to force its own markets leaders on other nations, unlike the united states over the past 50 years. 

The US spends rediculous amounts on military, which is all well and good, but causes the nation to actually be weaker through arrogance, and lower standard of living. You may argue this, but most of europe has some form of socialised healthcare and other services. 

And most importantly of all, in terms of being an economic superpower, London is the financial capital of the world. More US dollars traded here than in New York, And more Euros than the rest of europe combined. Almost 40% of all global currency transactions take place in London.
In fact, there are more american banks in london than there are in new york too.

London Heathrow is the busiest airport by international travel in the world.

There is more I could say, but it will just be pointless. Just now this, europe in general could if it wanted dominate the world militarily. But it will not,  because it has learned that regardless of how powerful you are, you can always fall as you will always be the minority when going against the whole world.

Edit: In addition, Europe is pretty much on its way to becoming the world leaders in Physics. Whoever is best in physics rules the world.

"This is a popular meme: California, or Oregon, or the United States has more forest now than in (pick a year; 1776 is popular); there are more buffalo or elk or pronghorn today than in (whenever); etc. 

There are two typical ways to make claims like these. One is to pick an actual fact, but apply it out of context: There actually are ten thousand times more bison today then there were in 1900... at which time there were something like 2,000 left, following the slaughter of the 19th century. Similar things can be said for other animal and plant populations that have, in the last hundred years, been given a reprieve from outright extermination.

The second way is to change a few definitions. There might actually be more ""forested areas,"" meaning more places with trees, in California today than there were ""when Europeans first arrived"" (1500 or thereabouts, I suppose) though I sincerely doubt it. The key is the word ""old growth."" Have you been to the Pacific Northwest? There are trees *everywhere,* and a person ignorant on the topic might believe there were forests everywhere-- and that ignorant person might, regurgitating this idea on the internet, just throw the word ""old growth"" in because it sounds good. In fact most of the forests (90% or more) are not ""forests"" as such, but privately-owned tree plantations, clearcut on a rotating basis. If you can't see the difference, picture a native prairie and someone's well-manicured front lawn: One is a home to a wide range of species, which develops according to the laws of succession and natural selection; the other is a privately-owned monoculture, with species chosen according to a completely arbitrary beauty standard. 

In tree plantations (which in the Northwest at least are typically monocultures of Douglas Fir, as opposed to a mix of oak and Douglas fir and true fir cedar and hemlock, a more diverse and therefore stable arrangement) trees tend to be planted extremely close together, which is actually bad for the ""forest"" as a whole but which leads to claims that ""There are more trees today than there were in 1776!!1!""

"1. ""Propaganda of disgusting monstrous art"" it is when someone is trying to impose and force into life anything heavily contrary to the common sense of acceptable things. No doubts, someone can create scandalous ""art"" but that would only show that it is not the kind of art that most of people normally enjoy. Showing off the worst side of human nature isn't usually accepted by sane audience.

2. They don't ban anything that fits ethics and moral values of this certain country.  

3. People define what is normal and what's not according to the mankind common experience. Billions of human beings for ages believe that demons are real but invisible creatures and would you dare to claim that all of them were/are fools? Even the best minds of the mankind (philosophers, scientists, historians, etc) admitted the presence of demons and their feelable intervention into human lives. If you haven't yet come across with them doesn't mean they do not exist. The desired goal and the greatest trick of demons is to convince a person that they don't exist.

4. &gt; I have a good and thorough knowledge of Orthodox history and traditions

That is what I really doubt. The style of stating your thoughts clearly proves that your knowledge is superficial. ""Knowing"" doesn't mean ""understanding""... ""I do not understand how Russian Orthodox church determines what is acceptable, and what is unacceptable to be displayed in a public place"" - your words. 

&gt; probably better than yours

You simply **cannot** know my level of knowledge, my education and my experience. ""Probably"" isn't ""certainly"". 

Orthodox Christianity is endless subject to learn and comprehend, because God is a Mystery. Knowledge of God, in fact, is a faith itself and it is what gives a true knowledge, finally making it possible to uncover a Mystery.

I don't think that unlimited tolerance is actually something good or valuable. I also don't agree that intolerance has anything in common with pure hatred either. 
My strong opinion is that brainless tolerance is able to ruin not just someone's personality, but even nations and states, transforming unique cultures into the crowd of idiots and perverts, also creating a huge mess, that we can watch now in Europe and USA, and, unfortunately, in Russia lately. 

So, regarding religious context, Orthodox Christianity is one of some, if not main, tool to prevent this abnormal exaggerated tolerance. As I said in my other post, unlimited tolerance is simply the absence of basic rules and principles. And that finally leads to moral, and quite often to physical, degradation - when a person becomes unable to determine the evil and to avoid it. This is why, my friend, you fail to disappoint me by incriminating to me the lack of tolerance.

"&gt;Dude, as explained earlier, production down = income down = disinflation.

As explained earlier, you are describing ordinary downturns. Spending is dropping relative to output capacity. Production *down* is production *idled* = income down = disinflation. The problem is *idled* capacity. Being able to produce more but finding that capacity unemployed due to recession.

When the government spends into that situation it's stimulative. That idled capacity gets brought back into production and the economy recovers.

When capacity is *lost* it means output *capacity* is dropping relative to spending. What happens when spending exceeds output capacity? There's no more production to bring into play so the spending just bids up prices and is inflationary. The steeper the drop in output *capacity* the sharper the spike in inflation.

The more a government spends into this situation, the more inflationary it is. Yet, if the lost capacity is steep enough, there's no way to just fiscally ""manage"" it away either. It's a *real resources* problem. You can't produce enough and don't have enough FX to purchase what you need.

&gt;Which is why hyperinflation was the problem all across devastated Europe after WWII. Correct?

After WWII across Europe what you generally saw was debt forgiveness and foreign aid. Rebuilding what was lost provided a great deal of room for growth without onerous foreign debt service.

"If I am totally honest with you, and it hurts to say this, we are a struggling team right now. There is no way we should be where we are given the size and support the club has.

Basically promotion is pretty simple, if you are top of the league at the end of the season you win the league and go up a division. Broadly speaking, the top 2 from each division go up automatically. Places 3-7 will then play a playoff to see who gets the remaining spot to go up. And the bottom 3 teams in the league go down to the league below. 

The english football system is absolutely huge with literally thousands of teams going all the way from professionals earning millions to amateur players who play for nothing. Here is a more detailed explanation of it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_league_pyramid

It is conceivable that a team from the very bottom of that pyramid could get successive promotions and play in the Premier League, the top division in England. 

To get into european competition, you must come in the top 4 of the Premier League. With this you qualify for the [Champions League](UEFA Champions League) a tournament for the best teams in Europe and arguably the world. The final of this competition is akin to the Superbowl. Fair to say Luton are a long way from this but you never know, one day!

I guess you would describe Luton as a reasonably sized Town by English proportions. According to wiki 209,900 people live here but in the wider urban area id say that goes up to about 250,000.

"Hi there, I actually just returned from studying abroad in Norway last semester!
To address your points about the dark and cold: I'm a Canadian, so I was used to it. I didn't have any problems adjusting to that since we have a really similar climate at home. Some of the other Europeans I was studying with kind of whined about it haha, but they got over it eventually. It's really not that big of a deal.

Yes, living in Norway is expensive, that's a given. But if you decide to live in student housing, it's really fair priced. The heating is included in the cost of the rent (at least where I lived) and when I compared the price to a similar student apartment back in Canada..I found the difference wasn't THAT much more.
Make sure you always do your groceries at the KIWI stores, they are the cheapest - and buy the ""First Price"" brand name food. Even though it's cheap, it really grows on you, I kind of miss it now ;)
If you want to work, go for it because Norway pays well. Personally, I didn't because I usually work while I study in Canada and I wanted a vacation from it. A friend of mine was doing babysitting and got over 120 kroners per hour...

Norway is really awesome. I found everyone there to be very polite, helpful and friendly when approached. Never had any problems getting around anywhere because everyone speaks English quite well, and all the public transport is efficient. All in all Oslo was a really beautiful city. The Norwegians really have their act together. It's clean, and not overpacked and cramped like some other major European cities are.
 
Where are you going to study? I studied at the U of Oslo and lived in the Kringsja studentby - most Norwegians kind of giggled at that when I told them because it's kind of like the ""ghetto"", but hey, nicest ghetto I've ever seen ;) Plus you get to meet a lot of other internationals.

"From my experiences, I do feel like overt expressions of patriotism are pretty passe for Europeans, more so than Americans at least. Since it's safely argued that nationalism was the leading cause of both WWI and II, my assumption has always been that this is attitude is a reaction to that. Would you concur?

Having said that, I do feel like patriotism is still pretty strong with Europeans, especially if you decide to count continentalism, which has syphoned off a good chunk of it. While it's not so overt, and certainly not at the levels of many Asian countries (and probably the US), I don't think it's at a negligible level. 

I'm just saying this for what it's worth; it's not a direct contradiction to your original point. I just wouldn't have said the levels are ""far more"" than that in the US (though I'd be interested if some kind of data can accurately give us an idea here). I've just had enough in-depth conversations with Europeans to realize that thinking your country/continent has the best best culture and is what the world revolves around is not something reserved for Americans only amongst Western nations. That, along with so many Europeans who can't come to the the realization that East Asian nations have languages and cultures as diverse as their own, and the lack of effort to do so shows an attitude that can be interpreted as dismissive  (also a common mistake for Americans).

"Pardon me for interrupting the circlejerk, but I have a few things to say. 

1) When an American calls their country ""exceptional,"" it hardly ever means that they think they have a divine mandate to conquer the world.  It means that the principles on which the country was founded are unique, and America has something special to offer to the world by proclaiming individual rights and liberties in a world where such liberties are not always recognized.  It would be absurd for a nation of immigrants to believe that their DNA makes them superior to the people of other countries, and I think some of you are conflating American Exceptionalism with old school European nationalism.

2)""But the ancient Romans and the British thought they were exceptional too, and their empires no longer exist!"" 

 Yes, and they WERE exceptional.  Both made outstanding contributions to western civilization that the United States can hopefully continue.  If the United States is eventually surpassed by some other power that adheres to the preservation of liberal values, they will also be exceptional in their own time, and I hope civilized people will support them in their efforts instead of scoffing at them.  

3) ""American exceptionalism clings to the past.  We need a future-oriented ideology based on change!"" 

 And how do you suppose we make beneficial changes and plan for the future without an understanding of our historical trajectory?  How do you promote certain values without understanding how those values have been conceived in the past?  

When Lincoln advocated for the adoption of the 13th amendment (the first time in decades the constitution had been amended), he urged Americans to look back to the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.  When the American founders created their enlightenment republic, they had a long tradition of republicanism and liberal enlightenment thought dating back to antiquity to draw upon.  When the architects of the modern European community began the project that eventually became the EU, they looked back both to the United States and to the writings of internationalist thinkers like Kant and Woodrow Wilson.

"It's not the best we have. The US justice system is a joke from top to bottom. 

Race: Racism plays a disgustingly large role in the US justice system. Blacks make up about 12% of drug users nationwide and are 50% of drug possession arrests. Blacks are incarcerated at 9x the rate as whites for the same nonviolent drug offenses. More than a quarter of black men spend time in prison, compared to 4% of whites. 

Incarceration Rates: The US has, by far, the largest incarceration rates in the world. We send more people to prison than places rife with human rights abuses like North Korea and China, and notoriously punitive states like Russia. We imprison 4x the people per capita as most of Europe. Almost 4% of Americans are in jail, prison, or on probation at any given time.

Recidivism: Our punitive model doesn't work. 68.5 percent of parolees in the US are rearrested within 3 years. At the Bastoy prison in Norway, the overwhelming emphasis is on rehabilitation, and it has a 16% recidivism rate. Norway as a whole's rate is 20%. Scandinavia's is around 30%. And since Scandinavia doesn't have a drug war, almost all people sent to prison are sent for violent crime. 

Indentured servitude: Nearly all prisons have work programs for inmates. In US federal prisons, it is compulsory to work unless you get a medical waver. In state prisons, where it's not mandatory, they ""encourage"" people to participate by severely restricting things like free time and outside access to those that don't, making it nearly compulsory. Wages start at around $0.12/hr, and go up to the ""generous"" rate of $0.40/hr. Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, has a minimum wage of $0.30/hr.

"[Libya one year later: a forgotten memory](http://www.voltairenet.org/Libya-one-year-later-a-forgotten)

by Manlio Dinucci

It’s one year after the war in Libya and no one dares to make an assessment of its aftermath. The colonial powers declared they were supporting a democratic revolution against a tyrant. In fact, they have once more divided the country and restored the Senussi Dynasty to power in the eastern region of Cyrenaica. The Jamahiriya of Gadhafi’s time, a strange hybrid of Proudhonian anarchy and autocracy, has given way to a liberal chaos where torture and murder have become the norm while the multinationals are on a permanent binge.

One of the effects of weapons of mass distraction is to erase recent events and facts from memory, making them nearly untraceable. Thus, the day March 19, which marked the start of the land and sea bombardment campaign against Libya supposedly “to protect civilians,” passed without notice.

Over seven months, U.S. and NATO air forces carried out 30,000 missions of which 10,000 were offensive air strikes, using more than 40,000 bombs and missiles. Additionally, Special Forces were infiltrated into Libya, among them thousands of easily concealed Qatari commandos. They also financed and armed tribal groups hostile to the Tripoli government and supported Islamic groups what only months earlier were watchlisted as terrorists. The operation in its entirety was directed by Washington, according to the U.S. Ambassador to NATO, first under the rubric of Africom and then of NATO, but always under direct U.S. command.

The Libyan state was thus demolished and Gadhafi himself assassinated, while the whole undertaking was being exalted as an “inspiring revolution,” as Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta described it, that the United States are proud to have played a role in ""by creating a unique alliance against tyranny and for freedom."" The results are now clear to see.

The central state is fragmenting. Cyrenaica, where two-thirds of Libyan oil is located, declared itself a semi-autonomous region with, at its head, Ahmed al-Zubair al Senussi. The choice has symbolic significance. He is the great grandson of King Idris, placed on the throne by Great Britain and the United States. In return, through the 1950’s and 60’s, he granted them military bases and oilfields, concessions that ended when the king was deposed in 1969 and ones which his great grandson will not hesitate to restore.

Fezzan, a region that also has significant oilfields, also wants to be independent. All that remains to Tripolitania are the oilfields bordering the coasts of the capital, Tripoli. The big petroleum companies, to whom Gadhafi’s Libya conceded only narrow profit margins, are now obtaining optimal conditions for themselves by playing regional and local chiefs off against each other.

Abdel Jalil, the leader of the Transitional National Council speaks of “conspiracy” and threatens to “use force” but he is no champion of Libyan independence, convinced as he is that the period of Italian colonialism was “an era of development.” In the meantime, the U.N. Security Council is extending its “support mission in Libya” and congratulating itself on “positive developments” that “are improving the possibilities for a democratic, peaceful and prosperous future”.

The Council could not, however, avoid expressing its “preoccupation” with the “ongoing illegal detention, torture and extrajudicial killings.” These are the work of the armed militias that are part and parcel of the “divide and conquer” strategy of the new empire. The armed militias are being employed in further wars in other countries, witness the fact that in Tripoli there is currently a training camp for “Syrian rebels.”

In Libya the first victims were the immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa who were persecuted and compelled to flee. In Niger along, some 200,000-250,000 have returned home, deprived of a source of income that sustained millions of people. Many of them, driven to despair, have lost their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The shipwrecked, like the five just buried in Lampedusa, are also the victims of the war that started one year ago, a war that since has gone down the memory hole.

"The Rangers Football Club are a scottish team, and as such don't get much publicity in ""mainstream"" Euro football.  They're currently placed second in the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and as a fellow American (I'm assuming you're an American) it's cool to know that two players from our Men's National Team (i.e. World Cup Team) play for the Rangers.  Carlos Boccanegra and Maurice Edu.  

If you want an easily follow-able team, I wouldn't exactly recommend them, cause it's harder to follow the news in the SPL, but it's easy enough to watch with the internet and all.

I'd highly recommend ESPN [Soccernet](http://soccernet.espn.go.com/?cc=5901) if you're truly interested in following European Soccer from the States.  

Also, there's a really good soccer culture developing in the US right now with the MLS.  Attendance records are being broken almost every game and it's really on the upswing.

"Ok.  There's a lot of different ways to go.  

If you're looking for an MLS (american) team, I'd currently recommend the New York Red Bulls, L.A Galaxy, Houston Dynamo, or Colorado Rapids.  The league is in its infancy, but DEFINITELY on the upswing from what I've seen of attendance records this year.  The Red Bulls and Galaxy are two of the richest teams in the league and as such, can afford more expensive players like Landon Donovan, David Beckham, and Thierry Henry, but they're good.

If you don't mind always watching your games with the commentary in fast spanish, you can't beat Barcelona as a team that: doesn't buy championships, has an awesome rivalry (against Real Madrid), has some of the best displays of skill in the game (have two of the top 3 players in the world: Lionel Messi and Xavi), and has homegrown players.  They're not really a team to have many down years, though.  They're pretty much consistently dominant in both their country's league and the European Champs league.

If you'd like to follow an English-Language team from Europe, there's lots of good choices.  Manchester City, Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, and Liverpool are some of the best teams in the League right now.  The english have lots of rivalries and lots of good players in general.  The two traditionally dominant teams are Liverpool and Manchester United.  Manchester United has literally dominated most of the last 20 years along with Chelsea, and Arsenal speckled throughout.  

My favorite EPL teams are Manchester CITY, Tottenham, and Liverpool mostly because of specific players and less meaningful things

"&gt; Our higher education is great, though if you go to most of those universities, you will notice high populations of international students

If we were talking about universities from other countries, the presence of international students would be used as a positive not a negative. With that said, only **4%** of students in US institutions of higher learning are international:

http://www.nacubo.org/Research/Research_News/Number_of_International_Students_in_US_Up_5_Percent.html

The idea that are universities are only doing well because of foreigners is bullshit. 

&gt; and you will find that American high schools are trailing considerably

That's about the PISA test, which only compares the performance of 15 year old students, and is HEAVILY affected by the demographics of the students. Black and latino students do so poorly that it brings down the national scores even though white and Asian students in the US do pretty much the best in the world. It's not our highschools that are failing, it's the students failing. Call me a racist but it's true. White and Asian students in the exact same education system as blacks and latinos, do very well. Therefore it's not logical to claim that the education system is as fault.

But here's the kicker. Although certain minorities in the US do poorly, they actually do better in the US than they do in any other country:

http://www.vdare.com/articles/pisa-and-bad-students-american-schools-add-value-but-demography-is-still-destiny

http://www.vdare.com/articles/pisa-scores-show-demography-is-destiny-in-education-too-but-washington-doesnt-want-you-to-k

If any other country had the same proportion of minorities, they'd do worse than the US. So although there is a racial gap in education performance in the US (like other developed countries, who have fewer minorities resulting in a statistical advantage) the US education system still brings up **each specific demographic to a higher standard than they'd have in other countries**.

"&gt;So the Draft happens every year and there are [How many?] rounds, where teams get their pick of unsigned talent from College Teams [and other places?]. Other than trading between other franchises this is the only way to bring new talent to your team [?]. In Europe for example, if there is a 16 year old playing for a school team you can swoop in and offer him money to sign for you, this is not possible in NFL [?].

Players must be 3 years removed from High School to be eligible for the NFL Draft.  Generally these athletes play for a college team during that 3 year period.  A few players occasionally come from other lower-level leagues like the Canadian Football League (CFL) or other Arena Football leagues (though these leagues are unaffiliated with the NFL).  The worst teams from the previous year get the best picks, and the best teams get the later picks.  There are a total of 7 rounds, but the first round gets the vast majority of media attention, with the 2nd and 3rd getting a much smaller amount.

Teams are able to sign Free Agents as an alternative method of gaining new talent.  There are different free agency statuses, but as far as new talent goes the term is ""Undrafted Free Agent"".  These are players who entered their name into the Draft but were not selected.  Teams can meet with these players and assess their talents if they'd like, and offer them a contract if they think the player would be beneficial on their team.

Also, regarding your stadium picture, that is awesome.  Do games ever get scheduled simultaneously?

"&gt; Your an idiot

LOL. Do I need to point out why this is so funny?

&gt; The Germans lost WWII when they lost the battle of Britain.

I'm sick of hearing this bullshit. The Battle of Britain was an air war, defensive in nature. Even though the British did win it, Germany still controlled Europe. Brits and Canadians had already failed to launch a D-day style liberation without the US. It was called the Dieppe Raid, one of the biggest fuck ups in the war. 

&gt; If the Germans had taken England down there would have been NOTHING the US could have done. What're you going to do, sail an invasion force over the Atlantic? How would you resupply? How would you move casualties?

HELLO, ever heard of the US Navy and Marines? The US had a massive expeditionary capability in WWII, still does. It would have obviously been more difficult, but the US could have launched amphibious missions into Nazi-controlled Europe if the Battle of Britain was lost, that's what we did in the Pacific with Japanese-held territory. What probably would have happened is that the US would have liberated the UK first, probably using Iceland as the launching off point, I'd imagine. 

&gt; The battle of Britain was the single most important battle of the entire war, anywhere.

No it is not. It is the most exaggerated battle of the entire war by Brits and their subjects as away to soften the blow of their dependence on America's intervention. 

Seriously. If you actually think the Battle of Britain was the most important battle you're completely oblivious. This occurred long before all of the grueling work closing in on Germany after liberating the territories they controlled in western and eastern Europe. The Battle of Britain was defensive.

Lastly I think android 4 (ICS) is the best android version yet. it is fast, intuitive and gorgeous so it doesn't need any of the manufacturer customizations which do nothing but bloat/slow down the phone.
My only annoyance about the galaxy nexus is the speaker which is very low in volume. otherwise it is an excellent device and the 720p screen is just beautiful.

While not as large as LoL's the DotA community is fairly large still.  Particularly in Europe and Asia where it is still heavily played.  China alone is estimated to have between 2-7 million+ regular DotA players alone.  World wide the number is anywhere 4-11 million regular players.  This is for a mod that is 9 years old, so that is pretty good. 

&gt; If it gets the level of popularity that League has, I bet things would be a lot more stable/predictable.

Umm, it will never get more stable/predictable since the game is much older then LoL.  The way the game is designed and balanced allows for more flexibility then in LoL.  Not saying this is good or bad, just fact.

&gt; Getting caught out of position and using your flash in League is more comparable to dying in DotA

Not even close.

&gt; But the mistake matters just as much in each game.

Not really. Dying in LoL is just a lose of farm, while in DotA you lose gold as well as farm.  Positioning is much important in DotA then it is in LoL due to ranges, strength of ability, and length of stuns.  Inversely screwing up an ability is a huge deal early due to CD's and mana cost.

We don't share the same view on firearms for example. So separate US/UK Regulations are necessary.

It's mostly self regulated. You know what you put into the game, you can rate it yourself with a checklist. A company could label their game as child safe. But if its actually something like GTA, they would face severe fines, and every child safe organization known to exist would destroy their reputation and put them out of business. So, companies are usually honest about this. 

It's only the more mature content that needs review. Or if it's borderline to being mature. The developers could create a presentation of the extreme and/or questionable materials through other media. It's not always necessary to have a content reviewer play the game. 

The reviewer gives their judgement of what the applicable rating is. The developer has to take it or edit the content. The reviewer can offer suggestions to the developer. But they cannot force the game to be changed.

&gt; A British man and woman jailed in Dubai for kissing in public have lost their appeal against their conviction.
&gt;
&gt; Ayman Najafi, 24, and Charlotte Adams, 25, were sentenced to a month in prison with subsequent deportation and fined about £200 for drinking alcohol.

...

&gt; The case is the latest in a series of incidents over recent years in which foreigners have broken Dubai's strict decency laws. 
&gt;
&gt; In March, an Indian couple in their 40s were sentenced to three months in jail in Dubai after sending each other sexually explicit text messages. 
&gt;
&gt; In 2008, two Britons accused of having sex on a beach in Dubai were sentenced to three months in jail, though the sentences were later suspended.

&gt; A much-read European website ran the report claiming that 30 gays were arrested at a private ‘after party’ at 5am on March 9.
&gt;
&gt; Lieutenant General Dhahi Khalfan told Emirates 24|7 that this was not true.
&gt;
&gt; “Homosexuals and homosexuality exists in all countries of the world, but is prohibited in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as behavior contrary to norms, customs, traditions and religion as well,” said Lt. Gen Khalfan.

http://www.dubai-livethedream.com/dos-and-donts.html

&gt; Homosexuality
&gt;
&gt; Gay and lesbian travelers should be particularly careful, as homosexuality is a criminal offense with possible deportation, and should also avoid any public displays of affection or cross dressing.
&gt;
&gt; Photography
&gt;
&gt; When taking a photograph in Dubai, please bear in mind local people wearing national dress may take exception if photographed without their permission. Please avoid taking pictures especially of women wearing national dress.
&gt;
&gt; Nudity
&gt;
Topless sunbathing is not permitted on the beaches.
&gt;
&gt; Women
&gt;
&gt; Women should dress sensibly and avoid wearing revealing outfits when in busy areas. This is especially true when traveling to districts like Karama, Deira and Bur-Dubai where the streets are packed with men, especially on evenings and weekends. While swimsuits and bikini's are a common sight on Dubai beaches, avoid sunbathing topless or wearing micro bikinis - even in the private beach of a hotel. Note: Women are not allowed to wear swimwear on public beaches in Sharjah. 
&gt;
&gt; Sex
&gt;
Public display of affection are frowned upon and public sexual acts can lead to jail time followed by deportation.
&gt;
&gt; Clothing
&gt;
&gt; It is not appropriate for men to walk along the street bare-chested. It is very advisable that females avoid wearing very short skirts or revealing tops as you may attract unwanted attention.

"Again, I think the lense through which you view the story makes you blind for other interpretations that are more rewarding if you ask me.

just look at it this way for a second:
historically ""slavery"" was not common in medieval europe and was deemed sinful (after all, we were all made in gods image and no one could own another being created in the image etc. etc. etc.)

but slavery was still very much practiced in eastern cultures (ancient or medieval), after which mereen is modelled. now, not only does she impose her own standards of right and wrong on those cultures (it does **not** matter that she is white in that regard!), clearly it causes a lot of problems she did not anticipate and cannot understand and is even hurt by (people rather living as slaves that going hungry for example; citing  bertolt brecht ""first food, than morals/ehtics"" from afar).

so that in itself is not at all ""white lady teaching morality"" and her plans are not thwarte by the tricky nature of the natives.
rather, the ""good masters"" are interest driven. they live good from the slaves, and they like it to stay that way. there are slaves that rejoyce in being freed. and there are apolitical people that have arranged themselves with the systems and choose a relatively good slave position over being free and going hungry.

and dont forget the realisation that another pov has about westeros culture: that the smallfolk are not slaves, but really, whats the difference apart from the name given to the societal system? this is a lot deeper that you give it credit for I think.",t5_2r2o9,False,1333349291,0,0,1428638946,,True,Sidebard,Baseborn Wolf,Stark,t3_rnxz3,1,t1_c47i2bt,asoiaf,0,1,c47iu7x,False,t1_c47iu7x,

"Let me shed some light on this subject because there seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about this. I am a Korean-American male in my late 20s. Before I go into this, let me list both my own dating experiences and those of my cousins.

* **Myself, late 20s** - I've dated various white, Hispanic, and Asian girls. I am currently dating a Korean-American and foresee myself only dating Asian-American women in the future. 

* **Female Cousin, mid 20s**: Has dated Korean-Americans. Exclusively dates Chinese-Americans now, and most of her friends are Chinese-American.

* **Female Cousin, early 20s**: Only dates Koreans and Korean-Americans.

* **Male Cousin, early 40s**: Dated all kinds of girls. His last serious ex, an English woman, proposed to him with a car. He turned her down and has been married to a Korean-American woman for the past ten years.

* **Male Cousin, mid 30s**: Dated and lived with a Jordanian woman for ten years. They had a civil marriage and got divorced shortly after. Now he's dating a Korean-American woman in her late 20s.

* **Female Cousin, early 40s**: Married a Jewish man. They have three kids.

* **Male Cousin, early 30s**: Married a Jewish woman. It's been two years.

I also have an aunt who married a white man, had a daughter with him, and got divorced. They had very, very bad marital problems. She got remarried to a Korean man with three kids of his own.

As you can see, we've had a great deal of interracial dating experience. Some of us have even married out of our race, so the claim that we're stodgy and culturally closed is clearly bullshit, and I think it's safe to say that most Asian-American families are like us. The peculiar thing about this is that although the rate of interracial marriage for Asian-Americans is declining, the rate of interracial *dating* is going up extremely fast, particularly for Asian-American males. Why is this?

In the beginning, everyone dates for fun. I just got involved with whoever I thought was pretty, interesting, or cool. As expected, I had a naive view of relationships and I thought that all that was required to make a relationship viable was chemistry and love. There was no set picture in my mind for who my wife would be and there still isn't, but now there are definitely certain requirements. For most Asian-Americans, no matter how Americanized they believe themselves to be, there is a sobering moment when we learn through serious interracial relationships that our parents imparted much more of their culture to us than we had led ourselves to believe.

The unrelenting, unconditional love my parents have for me is inexplicable. A lot of Asian-Americans come to realize this later in life -- that these domineering, overbearing, insufferable parents that beat you for (in your eyes) miniscule infractions, who have never apologized or said ""I love you"", are not perfect, but they bled themselves dry to ensure that you are the happiest you could possibly be. You are not expected to be independent. You are expected to be *part of the family*. They gave up their personal dreams and desires so that we could have a better life. This is why many Asian-Americans, even into their 30s, still live at home until marriage. This is also why placing the elderly in nursing homes is a huge taboo in the Asian-American community. There is an enormous importance placed on self sacrifice and duty. Beyond college, Western parents aren't expected to help their kids and kids aren't expected to help their parents. That expectation of individuality doesn't exist in Asian culture. In Asian culture, family help each other no matter what and you always give back. 

It's very hard to find a non-Asian that understands these concepts. Also, growing up discriminated, I realized more and more as I dated outside my race that other girls simply *didn't get me*. They couldn't empathize with my racially specific struggles and insecurities. Feeling discriminated against, not just because of your abilities or your clothes or your features but solely based on your race, is something that can't be put into words. You just get it or you don't.

Finally, in discovering how much I actually love my parents, I honestly care what they think of my wife. Their input matters. This was completely laughable and unthinkable to me in my late teens and early 20s. They don't want a Korean or Asian girl simply because of race, but because communication is really important to them. It all comes back to family unity. They want to be able to speak with their daughter-in-law in their own native language, and if they can't have that, then they at least want that daughter-in-law to be from a culture that is similar to ours and shares the same values and protocols. I really, really didn't think I would be so concerned about my parents' approval, but I am, and that doesn't compute for most non-Asians. The idea that true happiness should be what makes you and only you happy is extremely Western. I used to buy into that. Now, after becoming older and discovering myself, I realize I don't. I'm not going to marry exactly who my parents tell me, to but their opinions definitely factor into my decision.

I've discussed interracial relationships extensively with my cousins, and in doing so I've discovered what makes interracial relationships work and what makes them fail. All relationships are Venn diagrams. There are some things that you need to intersect, some things you don't care about, and some things you can't abide. For example, smoking. Smoking is a deal breaker to some people. Some people will only consider marriage with someone that wants children. It's all defining what you need and what you're willing to give up. For my two cousins who are in happy interracial marriages, they've had to give up racial and cultural empathy. It's a decision they both had to make when considering their current spouses for marriage. Their spouses, both of whom are white, have to deal with the constant feeling of being left our during family gatherings. What are they going to do, demand that all our relatives speak in English? That's the price it takes, on both sides, to make an interracial marriage work, but it's significantly harder on the Asian-American than it is for the non-Asian spouse, because at the end of the day we're living in the United States, not Asia.

I heartily advocate interracial marriage, but I also recognize that for me and most other Asian-Americans, we can't give up racial empathy and cultural experience. They're just too important to us. Theoretically, I could end up marrying outside of my race, but that woman would have to be exceptional for me to be willing to sacrifice racial empathy and culture. This is a very common sentiment for my demographic. I'd say about half of my Asian-American friends have had serious interracial relationships, but even among that group the vast majority ultimately marry within their race.

However, I'd rather marry a non-Asian American than any woman from Asia. Someone who's 100% Asian is less relatable to me than someone who's from a so-called ""white-washed"" American culture. I use white-washed in quotes because I don't believe there's such a thing as ""pure"" American culture. But Asian-American, for me, is the perfect sweet spot. It's also interesting to note that intermarriage among Asian-American cultures is rapidly rising. It's not just Korean-Americans marrying other Korean-Americans. It's Chinese guys marrying Filipino girls, Indian girls marrying Korean guys, Vietnamese guys marrying Japanese girls, etc. The specific culture doesn't matter so much as having the same Asian-American experience and umbrella culture emphasizing community and filial duty.

Eventually, it will reach a point where there are no Korean-Americans or Japanese-Americans anymore. It'll be just be yellow, like how Europeans became white and all Africans became black.

My black friends have a saying. Brothers will date and have fun with all kinds of girls, but at the end of the day, no girl comes close to a dime sister.

Revelation Space has no FTL (which means that it looses immediately), but a Lighthugger could probably destroy a Reaper, and the Inhibitors are certainly more powerful than the Reapers.

Halo has been discussed here, better than I know it.

Honestly, Mass Effect technology and scale is much smaller and less powerful than their counterparts in other franchises.

"Three points: One, I wasn't against the fact that there were few black people so much as few outside of London and the port cities. Two, very little research has been done and can be done about this. Very few people are interested in researching the descendants of the Roman conquerors of the British Isles, and the Middle Ages are not known for their fantastic record keeping. Three, not all people of colour are black. I specified in both of my posts ""non-whites"", not blacks. Between Islamic people, Asian traders, biracial people, and Mediterraneans, there are a lot of non-whites to consider other than just the Africans.

The Silk Road is essential to considering racial diversity in medieval times. England is unique, in its isolation by sea, but Europe as a whole was prosperous and diverse (and for every fantasy story based on medieval England, there is one based on Italy, France, Germany, and even the Norse, who yes, also had a few non-whites in the mix), and a lot of those people moved around England.

And again, there is enough evidence to suggest that there *were* people of colour outside of the big cities. Particularly the people of Moorish descent. There is evidence that Moors had positions of power from time to time all around medieval Europe, including some evidence in papal documents. Also, fiction thought it is (then again, we are in /r/fantasy), it's worth noting that one of the Knights of the Round Table was a Moor.",t5_2qknd,False,1333351477,0,0,1428639107,,True,Ophiucha,,,t3_rnxxy,0,t1_c47ira0,Fantasy,0,0,c47j1zp,False,t1_c47j1zp,

None of them have said they outright reject certain parts of Islamic teaching, but the way they conduct themselves in American society is a sign of liberalization. All anecdotal, but there's your answer.

Nobody said Dubai is perfect. Just more liberal. Plenty of modern western activities run counter to strict, textual interpretations of the Bible, and yet most Christians in Europe tolerate other people who do it and maybe half of those in the USA do as well.

"Don't ever say a positive word about Tottenham.

Chelsea are pretty high up on the hated list, just below Man U.

Arsenal are a fantastic team, great passing game, beautiful football.
However, they always seem to come up JUST short.

They are the perfect team to support if you want your emotions pushed and pulled all over the place.

As far as players go, [Robin Van Persie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Persie). Dutch master, apprentice to Dennis Bergkamp (No longer playing, but a [legend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Bergkamp)) and currently Arsenals Captain and best player.

**As far as up and coming players to get excited about, there are three:** 

[Jack Wilshere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Wilshere). A battling, small but strong midfielder. He is incredibly skillfull however, and has a fantastic eye for a pass and great close control. Will be future England star. Is a Gooner through and through, joined the ranks when he was 9 and has worked his way into the first team. He is a first team player for Arsenal, but he has been injured all season.

[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Oxlade-Chamberlain). Signed this season for a massive ~12M from Southhampton. He has come from Southamptions fantastic youth project, and is the son of former England player Mark Chamberlain.
A very speedy player, with great ball control. He is young, and exciting, always trying to beat a player. He is currently on the verge of the first team. One to watch.

The last one is a bit of a mouthful! [Wojciech Szczęsny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Szcz%C4%99sny). Polish goalkeeper. Just like Wilshere, came up through the youth ranks. One of the most promising young keepers in the world, and already first team goalkeeper for Arsenal and Poland.

**A few more guys to keep you eye out for:**

[Theo Walcott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Walcott). Fast exciting winger/striker.

[Thomas Vermaelen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Vermaelen) Vice Captain. Heart of the defence.

[Alex Song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Song) Defensive Midfielder and Journeyman hairdresser.

**Finally, upcoming games.** 

The season is almost over, and its a close race between Chelsea, Tottemham and Arsenal for 3rd and 4th places.
These final positions will determine who gets into the champions league (european cup) next year.

[Here](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html) is the current league table.

[Here](http://www.arsenal.com/fixtures/fixtures-reports) are the fixture list and a list of results.

Man City, currently 2nd in the league, are the next game. Its at the Emerites (Arsenals stadium) and should be a cracker!

Good luck getting to terms with it all. Its a fantastic sport and league.

(Also a sore topic of conversation as they did so by beating us 2-1 in the final)

The Champions League is considered the highest tier of competitive football, as it encompasses the top 4 teams from every league in Europe. As a Gooner, you can enjoy the prestige of having qualified for the Champs league for 15+ years running.

"1.  The club are called ""The Gunners"", but the people who support them are referred to as ""Gooners""

2. No idea. Most games are streamed illegally online, but I don't know of a particular site that always delivers!

3. Arsenal participate in 3 competitions each season: The Premier League - the top tier of English football (called the EPL ((English Premier League)) by most people outside of England), The FA Cup - a prestigious nationwide cup competition featuring every single professional and semi-professional club in the country, and the League Cup, which isn't regarded very highly, and only features the 92 teams who make up the English league. 

In addition the most successful teams from the previous league season are entered in the following year's European competitions.  Of these, the Champions League (a club tournament featuring the best 32 teams throughout the continent) is regarded as the strongest competition and winning it is regarded as the pinnacle of club football throughout the whole of Europe.  Arsenal have qualified for the Champions League in each of the last 15 years, but as yet have never won the tournament outright (coming closest in 2006 when they lost 2-1 in the final to Barcelona)

Basically, all the money in English football is in the league and the Champions League. A team who qualifies for the Champions League will make 10x the amount that a team who wins the league cup and FA Cups.  In recent years Arsenal haven't been especially successful in terms of winning trophies, but they always qualify for the Champions League, and are extremely well run financially - unlike virtually all of their peers. 

4. World Cup is based on countries, rather than clubs.  Typically Arsenal would have approx 10 players from various nations all competing at the World Cup, but each playing for the countries of their birth. 

Many people (like me) are referred to as ""club before country"". This means we don't give a shit what happens to our national team (England) so long as all the players from all the diffetent nations who represent Arsenal are happy, healthy and performing well.   This attitude is normally a result of the sheer hatrid felt towards players of opposition clubs who represent England and general dissatisfaction with the quality of football produced.

Feminism explains these problems as the result of a society that places impossibly high expectations upon both men and women to conform to gender roles e.g. men can't be seen to have emotions, and women can't be get angry without facing judgement by others.

"&gt; why do you want to see him elected?

I am not an American, so I have an interest in US foreign-policy becoming more sensible and decoupled from business interests, and therefore see it reasonable that US troops are moved home. The United States should stop trying to dominate the less-developed part of the world through costly military occupation. The presence should rather be through diplomacy and trade, and by showing an example to the world, of how great a nation the United States could be.

Any lesser developed nation could use that as an example and grow to freedom and prosperity, even if it takes a hundred years.

I fear that a war with Iran will absolutely lead to nothing good for *anyone*, other than further putting money in the hands of the already rich, and that will simply worsen the financial situation, possibly escalate the Wall Street occupation to civil war within the United States.

Over very long-term, the next century, continuing the current foreign-policy will only create even more problems for the United States, more enemies and more wars. Whether Paul proposes the exact correct solution to this, only time would tell, but it is at least a different direction, and relegates problem-solving to those that actually understand the problems.

We are also beginning to see lawmakers in the United States working on laws, that allow them to act on civilians all over the world. This is deeply concerning. Whether Ron Paul can remedy that, I don't know, because the other fundamental problem is the deep corruption of Congress.

I often wonder, how the votes would look like, if the whole world were to vote for the United States president, as it seems to me that most of those who are negative towards Ron Paul, do not use the foreign-policy as an argument, but views on 4 things: states rights, abortion, evolution or racism, things that are really best handled within the society itself rather than imposed by the government:

1. I believe that much of this is a problem of logistics, which seems to be his approach. Federal law often clashes with state law, and some federal agencies are rampant with corruption and inefficiencies. For example the FDA are only able to cover 10% of the required inspections of restaurants and food factories, even after a budgetary increase in 2009 by Obama. The FDA has also been involved in corruption since the late 80s regarding drugs that were not pulled from market, even after costing thousands of deaths. Yet, people focus mostly on his idea that moving a problem to the states will move the problem out of his sight, not whether it's actually useful to solve problems more locally. also having 2 sets of conflict and loss, cannot possibly be less expensive than a single state law.

2. I cannot justify a good response to this, but I would urge more investigation into why abortions happen in the first place. This is a question, that I don't see asked anywhere, just that abortions happen and whether they should be legal or not. Do also some research in which demographics get most of the fewest abortions, what level of education they have, or whether they live under domestic problems and the cause of abortion. I think he should use that as an argument to reduce the amount of abortions, perhaps through better sex education.

3. I've already stated my opinion, that I do not think Paul's lack of evolutionary beliefs would affect current research in the area in the United States. It would be offensive to his own ideas of personal freedom.

4. Racism cannot be solved, simply by imposing government rules, no matter how many civil rights acts you impose. This is a cultural problem, that in a healthy, self balancing society, should not be there in the first place.

&gt; That might be true if the President didn't have a hand in Supreme Court Justice picks.

OK, I don't have enough information to comment on this.

&gt; A bullshit question which totally cannot be answered without actually electing the guy first.

OK, it was not correctly formulated. I ask, because I'm curious about the mechanics for what the President is able to and allowed to do with regards to his personal and religious beliefs.

&gt; Given a hypothetical scenario wherein Paul is given a chance to decide whether or not to: continue, add or subtract funding to any sort of science-related research, which he clearly does NOT understand, I'd rather he wasn't at the top of the chain making such decisions.

I didn't read anywhere, that he's plain science illiterate and simply wanted to stop scientific research, and certainly in contrast to the other candidates, he's probably the most science literate and understands how important science is for the progress of society. Most presidents in the United States have not been truly science literate.

What differs is the idea of government-funded research versus privately funded research, and one can argue here that huge projects like the Apollo program, the Manhattan project, the Superconducting Super Collider program (which was canceled by a Democrat president and now exists in Europe under the form of the Large Hadron Collider) or the Hoover dam would not be possible under private funding. Maybe such programs are not really needed today, and instead the country should focus on allowing more cost-effective, privately funded efforts to flourish.

Also programs like these were successfully funded, not directly because they were ""cool"", but to remedy an unrelated problem, such as job growth or the Cold War. As soon as that different problem was solved, or went away on its own, there was no longer any need for the program.

We don't live in such times anymore. The closest is the unifying term ""terrorism"", which gets heavily funded, despite being a highly fragmented problem, which does not lend itself to being solved in that way.

Paul commends the growth of private companies like SpaceX, and their ability to greatly outrun government-funded programs, when it comes to going to the Moon or Mars. They are not bogged down by government policies to place individual research laboratories and factories in separate states with the purpose of remedying an unrelated problem.

It shows how private research can be cost-efficient, quick, effective, are direct and result oriented. If agencies like NASA, should continue to have funding, it should be for robotic planetary research and working on interstellar space programs, and NASA is primarily funded because of good public relations.

So, you would not get an Apollo program under Paul, but he will certainly not try to stop privately funded programs from happening, or attempt to heavily regulate them.

"You know, of all the smartass things I was thinking of at the time, I think I might actually have some legit answers.

-The first answer, and most obvious one, is that it's another example of a politician running their mouth.  Politicians are notorious for saying stuff like this, and I doubt Denmark's government is immune to stupid rhetoric.

-Another factor is to consider the wind companies that are lobbying the politician.  Lets face it, wind has been doing well, and the companies will no doubt be buying off ""ahem"" lobbying politicians in a effort to further corporate interests.

-A third thing to consider is that most people... MOST people, have no idea how much potential energy there is out there by type.  In fact, unless it's football (American or otherwise), tv watching, or face stuffing, most people really don't know jack shit about anything, period, let alone power generation.  When asked which is better, 100 wind turbines, a nuclear power plant, or 400 acres of solar panels, your average citizen would probably multiply the height of each turbine by the area of the solar farm and come up with that as the best solution because it would ultimately weigh less than the nuclear power plant.  Lets face it, the average person out there is pretty dumb... realize that half of them out there are dumber than that.(George Carlin)

-Another thing to consider is that Denmark might be able to pull it off.  They might have relatively low power consumption due in part to a smaller population than say the United States with higher sustained winds.  I'm no expert on the country, just thought I'd throw that out there.  Not every place is the same.  Denmark is surrounded by water and if I remember correctly they have a bunch of off-shore turbines.  In fact, [I just went to wiki and it says they're already producing 19% of their power from wind... so...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark)  Just remember that what is possible in one area isn't for everywhere.  Also you have to ask yourself if you want your country covered in spinning rotors.  Personally, I think it's an eyesore, but maybe the Danes love it.

Remember, this is a small European country we're talking about here.  [Power usage is different.](http://youtu.be/52bna-tn_dY)

"I can tell you, SM64 looked amazing for 1997. The look was clean and sharp, the world detailed, the animations extremely fluent. There were no visible pixels, like the SNES (2D) and the PS1 (no texture filtering). Also, the PS1 had the disadvantage of a lower resolution: In Europe, the PS1 had a resolution of just 512 x 384, while the N64 was able to fill all of the 768 x 576 pixels available, at least with most titles, like e. g.

"You don't seem to understand, why minimum wages are needed (in the US).

There is an anomaly in the relationship between wages and work offered. Normally, the more you raise the price for something, the more of it will be offered. With wages though, if the price falls below a certain value, more work will be offered. Why? Well, no matter how shitty it is, you have to make enough to pay for food and housing. So if you kake less per hour, you put in longer hours.

Now, minimum wages are there to make sure that wages offered will not go down below the breaking point where lower wages create a stronger supply of workforce.

In Europe, we have social security for this. In Germany for example, a single adult will get around EUR 360 per month. On top of that, social security pays for the rent for a reasonable, normal apartment. Oh, and of course, you have health insurance. That covers all basic needs and fulfills the same function as minimum wages, wich is to keep employers from atrificially lowering wages until offered work goes up again.

"There was once an old peasant farmer who lived in the Caucasus region of Eastern Europe with his young son. Together, they just managed to eke out a living by subsistence farming. They owned a small piece of land at the base of the mountain range and one horse, which pulled the plow through the terse earth, guided by the old farmers strong young son. It was a hard life but they were alive and healthy.

Then one-day tragedy struck, some how the gate to the horse’s field came open and their only horse escaped. Without the horse, it was impossible plough and farm the land. Both their meagre income and ability to feed themselves had gone with the horse. The horse represented a massive investment for the farmer and the son, which they could never hope to recoup without the ability to farm.

The neighbours in the area heard about the old farmers misfortunes and were very keen to come round and commiserate with the old man. “Oooh isn’t that just awful, what terrible luck for you both. How on earth will you survive now without your horse?”

“Good, bad, who knows?” replied the old farmer.

A few days later the horse returned to the farm. It had been wandering lost in the mountains and during it’s adventures, it had joined a heard of wild mountain horses. When the horse entered it’s field to be fed, the heard of wild horses followed. The farmer’s son noticed the horses in the field and ran out to close the gate. He managed to capture over thirty wild mountain horses. The farmer and his son had just gone from imminent collapse and starvation to being rich beyond belief in one moment.

The neighbours were back round again to mutter jealously about the old farmers unbelievably good fortune and the amazing turnaround in events.

“Good, bad, who knows?” replied the old farmer.

In an attempt to capitalise on their stroke of good luck, the old farmer asked his son to break and tame some of the wild horses so that they could be used on the farm or sold for a profit. Whilst his son was trying to tame one of the horses he was thrown from the beasts back. He landed badly and seriously broke his leg.

This was surely a disaster for the old man and his son. Too old and feeble to plough their field with a horse, who would work the farm now the son was injured? Starvation and ruin were hanging over the farm once more. Again the old mans neighbours were slightly over keen to come round and commiserate with the pair. “Oh my, what a terrible thing” they all cried. “Who will plough your fields and how will you eat this winter?” they all asked. “What terrible luck!”

“Good, bad, who knows?” replied the old farmer.

Several weeks later, war broke out between the old farmers country and a neighbouring principality. The army desperate for new recruits travelled through the mountains pressing any able bodied, eligible young men they could find into military service to help in the fight. When they came through the valley where the old man and his son lived, they took all the young sons of the old man neighbours. The old farmers son was no use to the soldiers with a broken leg so they didn’t take him.

"As a somewhat recent American fan myself (~2 years now), here are a few other tidbits as I understand them, and a few things stated in slightly different ways:

Standings are called the table.
Schedule is referred to as fixtures.

As others have pointed out, we play in the Premier League, which is the highest league of English soccer. There are twenty teams in the Prem and you play each team twice - home and away - for a total of 38 games. Three points for a win, one point for a draw. Here is where we differ from American sports. At the end of the year, the bottom three teams in points get demoted out of the league, which is called ""relegation."" There is another league below the Premiership, called the Championship, and the top three teams from that league get ""promoted"" into the Prem. In fact, there is an entire hierarchy of English leagues that you can read about [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system) It's basically as if the bottom MLB teams went to AAA, the top AAA teams come up, and then the same thing between AAA and AA, and AA and A.

When we finish playing the other 19 teams home and away, the season is over. There is no post season like the NBA, NFL, etc. However, if we finish in the top four we qualify for next year's [Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) (which is a tournament, not a league) where we play against the teams that finished in the top few spots in their own domestic leagues around Europe: Germany, Italy, Spain, etc. This tournament is played during next year's Premier League season. In fact, it's one of three tournaments we play in. The other two are the [FA cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup) and the [Carling Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup), which are both English tournaments. The FA cup is any team playing in any of the English leagues, and the Carling Cup is just the top four English leagues (Prem, Championship, League One, League Two). We play in all four of these competitions (Prem, Champions League, FA Cup, and Carling Cup) simultaneously.

The season can be kind of a mess as a result. You can have a league game on the weekend, an FA cup game midweek, another league game the next weekend, followed by a Carling Cup game midweek, then another league game weekend, a mid week Champions league game, and then everyone takes a ""break"" while the players go back to their home countries and play for their national teams. In this idealized situation that would be one month, with the players playing in five different competitions.

"&gt;What I've found interesting about France is while most European countries (Spain, Italy, Britain) have governments focused on austerity apparently such conversations in France simply aren't feasible. Almost as if an entire country would rather blame problems on globalisation, ironically while profiting from it, and promoting protectionism rather than accepting uncomfortable truths.

From my point of view this is a good thing, austerity at a time when the economy needs to recover is a bad idea. Also France's deficit is smaller than ours and Spain's, and their economy is considered stronger than Italy's so it seems they are in a better position to decide to have less austerity.

&gt;Anyway the 75% tax was put forward by François Hollande, a centralist within the PS, as a way of nullifying any potential problems from Jean-Luc Mélenchon who was affecting his momentum while also placating some of the lefter parts of his party. Seems a bit daft from where I'm standing but I don't know enough about French politics to judge. Sarkozy is doing similar things with his anti-immigration waffle due to Marine Le Pen.

75% does seem a bit high, but some economists argue that this is around the optimal rate for the top rate of tax. It would only apply to people earning over €1,000,000 which I doubt is very many so I agree it is more of a symbolic thing rather than a tax that will bring in much money. I don't know much about French politics either but from what I have seen I am a bit envious, they seem to have a much wider choice than us. Using the tax example although Labour have opposed the reduction of the top rate of tax they haven't said they would reintroduce it if they won the next election, so voters have no choice but to accept this tax cut as unpopular as is it. Also it seems that the coalition have now taken the view that our privacy can be invaded in the name of preventing terrorism so here to voters have no choice to vote for a party that actually believes in civil liberties.

&gt;I have no idea whether such a policy would actually happen if François Hollande was elected, some daft things with French labour laws have happened in the past due to political posturing, but I can say with a degree of confidence it would be a bad thing for France. Even ignoring the possible direct economic impacts it would still cause havoc on the perception of how France is approaching its problems. Which could easily lead to further downgrades by ratings agencies especially when things like bringing the retirement age back down are likely.

I would like to see it happen. I disagree with the idea that it would be bad for France. I would like to see it proved in practice so that we can stop basing our idea of where the top rate of tax should be set based on flimsy estimates and case studies from decades ago.",t5_2qhcv,False,1333369158,0,0,1428639700,,True,chrisjd,Proportional Representation &amp; Basic Income,,t3_rpcqb,0,t1_c47k5g0,ukpolitics,0,0,c47kbhv,False,t1_c47kbhv,

"Whoa sorry didn't realize this was so long, no one will probably read it but if anyone does, enjoy!

I agree that 1-3 are important issues, but I am not convinced that 4 is an issue at all.  

First, the biggest cause of the deficit is the recession combined with the growing trade deficit that has been the consequence of the Summers/Rubin strong dollar policy amidst a somewhat institutionalized state support of off-shoring production.  In other words, the recession caused the deficit, not the other way around.

Second, while SS may need adjustment, it is not a serious problem any time soon.  Moreover, SS contributes not one penny to the deficit.  In fact, I believe it is the largest single owner of Treasuries.  Some 1/5th of the debt is owned by the SS fund.  If anything, the surplus that it had for so long during sustained periods of relatively egalitarian growth have enabled deficits that are essentially interest free.

Third, while Medicare is a serious problem, it is a serious problem because of the soaring health costs, not because of something inherent in the program.  To increase the benefits age is only delaying another withdrawal of benefits down the line sometime as health costs continue to soar.  With the mandate under serious scrutiny - and itself being a creation of conservative thinktanks - perhaps this is a serious reason to really consider single payer as a cost control mechanism.

Fourth, it's important to remember that every single old industrial society is having deficit/debt problems and the reason is not based on morality or who works harder or who is a lazy socialist.  After the war, elites from all of the rich countries were concerned that without war spending, their economies would relapse back into chaos since, after all, nothing had actually changed.  As you note, things like ARPANet served as the fundamental engine of innovation in the US economy and it was largely done through defense spending.  Balancing the budget without fixing revenue problems or changing policies that facilitate growing trade deficits (for example, the 'free trade' agreements with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea all predicted a net export of jobs, increasing the trade deficit further) would almost certainly be an economic disaster and the European states more committed to austerity than the US are now realizing that.  

That may be a systemic problem that requires thinking outside of conventional solutions.  Conventional thinking places sovereign finance in a comparable position with household finance, but it's not.  The state fundamentally creates the currency that is supported by the productive economy.  The problem that people foresee with sovereign debt is largely artificial.  That is, investors are concerned that specific states will not be able to pay back what they borrow, and this is exacerbated (for example, in the case of Italy) by market determined bond rates that are more or less unrelated to the health of their own productive capital (in a system like the Eurozone).  The problem is not that deficits create inflation - in fact in Japan, deficits have been perhaps the best weapon for the last decade or more staving off strong deflationary pressures.  The problem is that deficits funded by private borrowers by debt traded on an international market creates a class of investors who can and do act as a 'virtual senate' against national policies.  Thus, when the deficit is really of no concern (interest rates low, economy in the trash), it becomes a central political issue because those bond investors have both that monetary pressure on US politics, but also can buy off politicians much more easily.

One possible solution to consider might be a sort of public option for sovereign finance and credit.  It would be better to make credit more widely available and for deficits to be self-funded than it is to rely on private lenders who are highly subsidized and do not perform their social function as policy-makers determine it.  Moreover, it would render the only issue with deficits inflation and under the current circumstances that is almost unimaginable.

I think this is an important issue because I think the deficit is perhaps the most widely misconstrued and manufactured political issue to date.  It is not a cause of any recession, and if anything, even greater deficits could be the most reliable way to create conditions of relatively egalitarian growth again, particularly in conjunction with other national policies that curb the unfettered movement of capital, protect the rights of workers to organize, and allow the dollar to reflect a more appropriate value (e.g., reduce the value of the dollar to facilitate more domestic production, more unionized middle-class jobs, and create a wider base of consumption, etc.).",t5_2cneq,False,1333369606,0,0,1428639721,,True,hypnobean,,,t3_roxjj,21,t1_c47i2be,politics,0,21,c47kczp,False,t1_c47kczp,

Around the age of 15 I completely forgot about the whole god thing and focused on friends, human relations and nature. Since it's impossible to actually leave the Church formally where i am from, i just ignored it, and lived my life. Around a year ago i realized that I am, and have been for a while, an atheist. The meaning of this lies for me not in the concept of god, which has always been irrelevant, but in the concept of death: I was raised to live forever, you see. After I realised it's not the case, i went through the most terrible period of my life, with anxiety and panic attacts (i do acknowledge it was so strong due to a hormonal treatment). I gained some knowlegde, but i lost some portion of happiness and peace. I would do anything do be able to get it back. 

I wouldn't be religious, You see. Around the age of 12 i decided that since i can't know there is god, i will just live my live. I was agnostic then, i guess, and not questioning was easy. So maybe at times the prize you pay for realizing the truth is a bit too high. 

I am not a friend of religions. in fact, i Strongly, strongly hate the catholic church: it is because i was under its influence in the first place that i had to go through the hard time . Also, it frustrates me not to be able to leave and to be treated as obviously religious by my family. I live in a different country now, and atheism is a standard, and i feel at home. But still, in the talks to my mother, i have to pretend i am going to teach my friends here how to have a proper, christian easter. It specially exasperates me how she insists i look for a ""real""church, after i took her once to a protestant church here. The idea of not being religious is so uncomprehensible to her, it makes no sence to discuss it, not that i haven't tried. 

wow, i'm not sharing it with too many people...;) 
but concluding, what i wanted to say is: at times it makes life better not to question. Makes people happier. And i believe in the sort of happiness that does not hurt others.

"Interesting point about gender stereotyping - the female role as helpless princess.  I wonder if part of the problem is that many fantasy authors base their worlds, in part, on the pre-industrial European Middle Ages (knights etc) or Empires of antiquity (Rome, Macedonia), where there was politically and socially a very strong male dominance (despite the occasional dominant female figure like Elizabeth I), and where war was still a game of nations won head to head by troops with success determined by physical strength, and therefore very much a male game.

It is true, however, that writers creating worlds could in fact be more creative in developing a history and culture that took a civilisation in a different direction and needed alternative attributes to be successful, that could in turn create very different power plays.

"British English would then be an umbrella term? i.e. Sure I speak English in a form that comes from Britain, but I do not speak 'British English'. 

What I'd consider RP would be 'British English', what else would you consider 'British English'? Scottish-English is a way of speaking English from Britain, but it's not 'British English' etc. So who speaks 'British English'? People in the BBC. 

And the idea that in America they speak an older ""lost"" version of English is absurd. The first thing Americans did when they got hold of the language was butcher it to hell, and not to mention that most of the immigrants from Europe to America aren't even English, they're German etc. They would have brought their own styles to how America speaks English. Sure there will be isolated places in North America where they speak olde English or whatever, but modern America doesn't come close to this, and it seems absurd to say so. 

Truth is there isn't any modern state that can claim to speak like that older form of English did, or of being true to those roots (which were pretty untrue to begin with anyway). Look at the history of the English language, the idea that some people could speak it more pure is just, again, absurd. The English language is not French, we let it go and the very essence of speaking the English language is not owning it, letting it change and be different from place to place.

"I agree that it is very easy to give reasons for events after the fact that are often at least somewhat arbitrary.  Whether such an approach is a valid form of self-examination or merely a superficial attempt to explain away a problem depends a great deal on how it is presented (the issue described by your rosh yeshiva is an example of this).

However, I believe the situation in Europe in the century before the Holocaust was fundamentally different. This period saw what can only be described as the most massive ideological shift in Jewish history, both in numbers and in degree. Large scale movements arose (Reform, Haskala, Zionism, socialism, etc.) that sought to change the basic meaning of Jewish identity. The majority of Jews in Western Europe had openly abandoned any pretense of traditional observance, and this process was well under way in Eastern Europe as well. Traditional observance was embattled everywhere, even in so-called traditional strongholds. The reality that things had fundamentally changed was recognized at the time, by both its opponents and its supporters. Opponents to the change differed on how to deal with it (roughly speaking, to make various concessions to the new spirit or to entrench and isolate those few communities that were still loyal to Torah), but they all recognized that the basic nature of Jewish life had changed. Until the 19th century, a non-observant Jew was a renegade, by the end of the 19th century it was the opposite.

If this process had continued uninterrupted, it is likely that things would have gotten far worse. Indeed, even after the Holocaust, for the first few decades the assumption was that Orthodoxy was still a dying way of life, an assumption that was often shared, implicitly, by many Orthodox Jews and even leaders. However, the Holocaust, together with the establishment of the State of Israel, was a ""game-changer"", and the second half of the 20th century saw a resurgence of Orthodoxy, often in its most traditionalist forms, that took almost everyone by surprise. (Many old-school thinkers and writers are still trying to stretch their heads around this, as it undermines many of their basic ideas about the world.)

Given the unprecedented nature of what was happening, i.e. the open rejection of the Torah by the majority of European Jewry, the lack of any of the Scriptural predicted consequences for such a violation of our covenant with God would have been perceived, correctly, as a strong argument against the truth of the Torah. Anti-traditionalists would have pointed to this as proof against the traditionalists, and traditional believers would have been forced into increasingly implausible arguments to explain why the Torah's predictions were not coming true. The Holocaust effectively answered the question. From that point on, no one could plausibly claim that the abandonment of the Torah by European Jewry had achieved for them the good life that traditional Judaism had never been able to provide. Even a complete non-believer had to acknowledge that, in the end, the European experiment with assimilation had blown up in their faces.

While anti-religious writers will often use the horrors of the Holocaust to argue, *les din v'les dayan*, ""there is no judgement and no judge"", on the broad historical scale the Holocaust proves exactly the opposite. European Jewry had turned away from God, so God ""turned His Face from them.""

"You can google the titles:-) I've listed them in order of most useful to most entertaining.
If you a violin major, you absolutely must buy the first two books and completely internalize them!  They will possibly change your life.

""Ricci on Glissando: The Shortcut to Violin Technique,"" Ruggiero Ricci.  Comes with a DVD featuring Ricci. It explores the glissando technique that paganini himself may have used.  It is a technique base that relies much on listening and reaching, versus the ""trombone-style,"" clean shifting that most orchestral players use today.  I've found this book to be an invaluable insight to playing in high positions, playing double stops, and playing with real legato.  

""Galamian, Principles of Violin Playing and Teaching"" - available in paperback at Sharmusic.com for $30.  Galamian was one of the major pedagogical figures in the 20th century.  Most importantly, he thoroughly describes the multitude of bowstrokes, from detache, to portato and spiccato.  There's also a great Galamian book called ""Miraculous Teacher: Ivan Galamian &amp; the Meadowmount Experience,"" about his summer camp.

""Bach's solo violin works: a performer's guide,"" by Jaap Schroder - available on Amazon.  Schroder writes about every individual Bach movement in some detail, with suggestions for a more informed performance.  It sounds intimidating, but it's really a great reference if you're working on some solo bach.  Schroder has also recorded all of the solo Bach for violin.

""A treatise on the fundamental principles of violin playing,"" by Leopold Mozart - free on Google Books.  This is Mozart's dad on violin playing.  However, the advice here is less applicable to playing W.A Mozart than it is to early music.

""Violin Playing as I teach It,"" Leopold Auer.  Free on Google Books.  Tchaikovsky first intended to have Auer premier his violin concerto. Auer refused!  Leopold Auer goes down in history as one of the greatest performers and pedagogues.  

""Indivisible by Four : A String Quartet in Pursuit Of Harmony,"" Arnold Steinhardt.  The Guarneri Quartet, founded in 1964, was one of the most successful professional String Quartets. This is a window into the workings of the group from it's first violinist, Arnold Steinhardt.

""My Memories,"" Ovide Musin's autobiography, free on Google Books.  Ovide Musin is a scarcely known Belgian violinist that travelled the world on steamships around the turn of the 20th century.  A stand partner to Eugene Ysaye as a teen, Musin performed everywhere from China, Mexico, Hawaii, Texarkansas(!), and all of Europe.  This volume (with some old photographs) details his adventures.
If you like the style of ""My Memories,"" try the biography of Ole Bull by Mortimer Smith.

Bonus:
I've had the book ""The Talent Code: Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How."" by Daniel Coyle VERY strongly recommended by another violinist/teacher/symphony musician, but have not read it yet.

"It's based on the idea that concentrated power *anywhere* is a bad idea. The libertarian fantasy is that somehow, power can be diluted enough to a point where it does the most good while doing the least bad. The problem is, that's not how power has ever worked. It's actually a self-contradictory proposition, because to prevent power from concentrating, there needs to be an already concentrated power to stop it from happening.

If you accept that power cannot be evenly diluted and stay that way, the choice between having that power possessed by a government that is answerable to the people and a corporatocracy that is answerable to no one but it's stake-holders is pretty obvious. Opponents of socialism like to point to nations that had governments that were not accountable to the people as failures of socialism, but ignore the stable, relative freedom of people in the western european socialist democracies and how their societies consistently outperform us in health care and education.

They do 2-3 of these a year, the blade is phenomenal, the fittings are much higher quality than the price point would normally allow and the turn around time from order to shipping is only ~3 months (something almost unheard of in custom swords).  The base price for the Katana is $330, but there are a handful of customizations you can make for a premium, most of the options are free though.  I put mine together for about $380.  Shipping is free in the US and Canada.  Here is a [LINK](http://sbg-sword-store.sword-buyers-guide.com/custom-katana.html) to the page that deals with the katana.  

I've been collecting swords since I was a teenager and I took a handful of blacksmithing classes after college, this is a wonderful hobby to get involved in, it can be extremely expensive [Albion](http://www.albion-swords.com/) and [Bugei](http://www.bugei.com/).

[Museum Replicas Ltd.](http://www.museumreplicas.com/) is a great place to get fully functional historic reproductions at a fair price, generally between $150 and $400.  If you want something slightly ""better"" I'd suggest [The Valiant Armoury Custom Sword Shop](http://custom-sword-shoppe.com/).  You can choose the sword you want and pick the colors for the handle, scabbard and belt that comes with it.

Also, [Kult of Athena](http://kultofathena.com/) is a great place to compare pricing.  They are usually cheaper than other on-line retailers and they do a fantastic job of quality control and customer service.  

You've got a lot to think about.  Don't rush into a sword purchase, and do your research.  If you do choose to ""use"" your sword, don't be an idiot.  I've seen people get seriously hurt and even lose body parts as a result of what I call ""Sword Fever"".  Youtube is full of clips of this kind of stuff.

"In South Afric we have an advertising complaints board where any member of the public, or an organisation can lodge a formal complaint against any false advertising.  Companies can, and often are forced to withdraw anything deemed false or misleading.

I would like to see a more robust approach - in some cases withdrawing an advert doesn't correct the public belief about the lie. I would want the company to be forced to run adverts in all the same time slots, positions in papers and for the same value that explains why the advert was wrong and what the correct information would be.  The new advert must conform to standards set out by the board.

A harmful example in my water poor country would be: 

Certain companies ran massive campaigns that dishwashers use less water and marketed it in a manner that claimed that if you cared about the environment you should purchase a machine.  

In essence they were correct as they quoted a study that supported their finding.  The problem was that the inforrmation was completely incorrect for the South African context. (Basically it used a European study - Norway I think - where people wash dishes under a constantly running tap which meant they used more water.  In SA the normal manner of washing dishes is to use a single basin for washing and actually uses less water than a machine)

"1. Soccer is played year round, but perhaps not in the way you're thinking.  Typical league schedules go from the fall to the spring with most weeks having a game.  For example, the English Premier League (EPL), where Arsenal play, have been going on their current season since early August.  They have about 7 weeks of play left until the end of the season.  The League will be on hiatus in between the middle of May and the season opening in August again.  During that time, however, all the players (of any worth) will be going back to their home countries to play for their national teams. International games during the summer are a little less frequent if you're following just one team, but there's a fair amount of play regardless.

2. Here's where the World Cup fits in.  The world cup is played every four years between international teams (i.e. USA, England, Germany, Spain) and since the Gunners are a club team, they are not eligible to play in the world cup as a team, though many of their players play for their own national teams as a part of the World Cup.

3. There are championship leagues for clubs, though, and the UEFA Champions League is currently underway.  In the Camps league, Clubs play against clubs from other countries in Europe.  Arsenal *were* doing really well, they were at the top of their table during the group stage, but then lost to a fairly good Italian team (AC Milan) by a one goal overall margin in March.

4. A game ends in a tie during regular season play or a friendly (exhibition) match.  During the regular season, teams are awarded points based on the outcome of their match, 3pts for a win, 1 for a tie, and 0 for a loss which eventually determine who the league winner is. During playoffs, games are unable to end in ties, and there are several methods of tie breaking.  The first method is aggregate scoring.  Most playoff series are only two matches (one at each team's home field) and are decided by total amount of goals scored over the two games.  If the teams are still tied, it will then be broken by determining which team has more away goals in the series. If the teams are still tied, the game will have two halves of 15 minutes added to the end of the game, and a penalty shootout following if there is still no winner.

5. You are correct.  A Red Card means a team is down a player for the rest of the match.  It isn't always a death sentence, some teams are simply better and able to overcome the player deficit while others have substantial troubles getting by.  It also depends what player is sent off.  If a key player is sent off early in the game, it could throw off a team's strategies completely, but if it is a less used player who is in a less important roll, the team may get by just fine without him.  It is also important noting that the Referee in soccer is much more powerful than in other sports.  A Soccer Ref is allowed to call or not call penalties as he sees fit, and can send pretty much anybody off the pitch for whatever reason he deems necessary.  I watched a game earlier this year where a coach and two benched players were sent off for talking back to the ref.

"Much of this article isn't quite true (or hasn't quite understood the procedure).

When something goes through European Parliament, it still has to be ratified in each of the individual Countries legal systems before it becomes law.  They can choose how they want to do this and many do it in different ways.  Sometimes they'll just copy it word for word, sometimes they'll convert it into different wordings, take bits out, etc.  Each individual country will then look at their own laws to see how any penalties can be applied given similar crimes.  Policing it is then a completely new matter (eg I can get away with driving at 75 mph on the motorway).

ACTA is also not at all similar to SOPA or PIPA.  It is designed to look at something completely different, mostly concerning real life copyright indiscretions, with a small note about digital (you have to scroll through 15 pages of real life copyright before getting to the digital bit).

It also doesn't seem to go very far in its reach when it does come to digital.  Indeed virtually everything in it is covered by the DEA in the UK, so it is already the law.  All this does is set out limitations of what should be counted, what shouldn't be.  Personally I think that you can argue all day long about whether online copyright should be a law or not (and to be honest I don't care any more).

"To be honest, I always thought a Hotspur was an American thing.

Tottenham are a great team to cheer on and, despite their form since Christmas, this has been one of their best seasons in years and they really did have a realistic chance of winning the league, but they really bottled it in the games against Manchester City.

They have one of the league's most exciting players (Gareth Bale from Wales) who has an unreal level of skill, but attracts a lot of ire for some reason. Rafael van der Vaart and Aaron Lennon are attackers worth paying attention to as well. Also, they have the most effective striker in the premier league (combination of goals and assists) in Emmanuel Adebayor, although he is currently on loan from Manchester City until the end of the season.

They are a financially sound club (finances play a much bigger part in soccer than in NFL) and frequently throw money at players who always increase in value, like their current playmaker Luka Modric. They have a strong Jewish connection, which is why you'll always see terms like ""Yid Army"" thrown about.

Their manager, Harry Redknapp, is very canny, wily, popular with the press, and recently proved to be not a huge tax fraud. Chances are he will leave the club in the summer to manage England, though this is not a guarantee.

They are a hugely exciting team to watch. Never boring, I'll give them that. Also, their goalkeeper is American one of the most respected in Europe - Brad Friedel.

Their main rivals are Arsenal and Chelsea. They have gone many years without a major success, apart from the league cup (one of two domestic cup competitions in England) in 2008. Their previous trophy was the league cup in 1999. They have won the league twice, in 1951 and 1961.

-Cpu cooler for oc, i5-2500k entire purpose and big + is to overclock. After market cpu cooler is almost necessary for lower temperatures and higher oc. Asrock Extreme 3 gen 3 mobo, supports cf possibly best feature you want to have for future upgrades. The mobo might cost a lot in EU so look for this: http://yoyotech.co.uk/item-detail.php?products_id=4374688 the main difference is that this asus mobo does not support PCI 3.0 which ivy bridge will. Don't have to worry about this. Also gpu, get 7850 from newer gen, can be oc higher runs cooler and all sort of stuff. It's performance relatively the same if not slightly better from 6950. If you can get 6950 for a LOT cheaper price then go for it but I think 7850 is not that expensive at least not here in UK where I live. PSU. OCZ is good and all that, but you may want to look for 650W psu for cf in future. Look for something from Corsair, OCZ, Seasonic. Try to find Corsair 650W TX psu.

"Here's the way I understand it. If you have experience with european languages, this will make some sense.


First, this isn't a unique usage of ""be"" and ""do"" (I'm assuming these are the problem words). 

""Be"" is an antiquated for of subjunctive in English, almost never utilized in SAE but quite common in AAVE. So, if you know anything about subjunctive in euro languages, it's typically used in sentences of doubt, emotion, subjectivity, etc.  (Note: subjunctive doesn't happen often in English.) Thus, ""be"" is licensed by the doubt in ""they don't think."" It does really have any special meaning beyond that. ""Be"" just reflects their doubt. The reason ""like it is"" is used w/o subjunctive is because ""it"" is generally accepted to be true more or less unconditionally.

Finally, ""do."" This really isn't as confusing as it may seem, it's a common occurence in all dialects of English. The problem is that it doesn't agree with ""it"" in the way it does in SAE. Think of ""He doesn't think it hurts, but it does."" It's essentially the same, it's used to reiterate the verb.

My translation: they don't think it is how it really is, but indeed it is.

"I can agree with you on that, my whole point was this...

There are very few published minority fantasy authors, because there are so few of them.

I agree that their should be more and I agree that medieval England fantasy tropes are limiting when it comes to racial diversity. but....

I would say with a lot of recent fantasy novels, there is a trend that gets away from the typical fantasy heroic quest and cliches. It is however, not fair to group GRRM for lack of racial diversity, the series, while different, still has a base in medieval culture due to his love of knights and chivalry as a child. Also...

If you read some of his other works, such as wild cards, you will see that it is very diverse although it is technically more sci-fi/comic.

So I do agree that more diversity is in order, but not when an author sticks to some of the staples of fantasy. For a more fantastic world in fantasy diversity would be easier. So how diverse a fantasy world might be depends on how far it strays for historical fiction because xenophobia was common in early Europe. I'm not saying it's right, that's just the way things where. 

Anyways, I might have been a little harsh with my earlier comments, just wanted to say my biggest issue with what you said was mostly about the number of minority fantasy fans/nerds being the reason why there are so few of them.

With the referral to the court, the supporters of ACTA were just trying to buy time, hoping that the court deemed ACTA legal. This would be beside the point, because not all arguments against ACTA are of a legal nature, one could argue that the most of them are political arguments. So the Commission and the ACTA supporters could use a court ruling in their favor to make it seem like there was nothing to fear from ACTA.

"&gt;many people do not like to deviate from the medieval European idea of what fantasy is.

Completely agree with you here. I would however like to point out that GRRM's novels actually set a new precedence for fantasy fiction. He has completely broken away from the Tolkienish formula of the hero quest and good vs evil naivety. At the same time however, he made his world very similar to medieval Europe.

I'm very different from many Fantasy readers in the fact that I hated Lord of the Rings. I read it, but it was a tough read for me. I also hate how more diverse works that contributed more early on are marginalized by Tolkien and his popularity. Examples would be Howard and Lovecraft who both (they where close friends) had works released before Tolkien that launched modern Fantasy, although Tolkien gets credit where he isn't due. Tolkien gets all the credit although his novels have very base characters and an extremely naive concept of humanity and the belief in pure good vs pure evil and the good guys always win kind of thing. Drives me fuck'n nuts.

"1) Premier League rules dictate that a loaned player cannot play against his parent club i.e. Adebayor cannot play against Manchester City (thank goodness).  The player continues to get paid but the clubs involved in the loan agree on who pays what portion of the wages.

Players get loaned out because they aren't a part of the team's immediate plans (often because they are young and need experience, or in the case Adebayor, because they're a troublemaker and the parent club can't find anyone to buy him outright).  The system is good for players because it means they get to play.

2) You're more or less right about Abramovich.  Chelsea were pretty decent before he came along, but his money turned them into real contenders.

3) the whole ""Yid Army"" thing is pretty weird, but it's mostly okay when Spurs fans use it.  It's like when black people use the n-word, after all their years of hearing it used as abuse, you can't begrudge them appropriating it as their own.

4) You're joining the Spurs (I know you don't like that word, but it's pretty common I'm afraid) ranks at an interesting time.  UEFA (the body that governs European football) are introducing their Financial Fair Play rules - a set of rules that limit club spending to their revenue or else they face possible fines or may even be banned from the lucrative Champions League.  It's hard to say what this will do to the landscape of the league, but Spurs are looking like they will snatch a spot in the Champions League just in time - the Champions League provides a HUGE financial boost.

They need a bigger stadium to increase their matchday revenue, but the Champions League will certainly help in that regard.  If things continue to go well, it's not unrealistic to think that Spurs may be around 5 years from their next league title (that may sound like a lot but it really isn't).

Spurs have had some bad luck over the years but they're a big club.  FYI Tottenham (your phoneticisation seemed pretty good, I'd pronounce it ""Tott-n'm"") and my team, Man City, have something of a good-natured rivalry - we've both been in the shadow of more successful neighbours and have played some bloody exciting games against each other.  I haven't been to a game in a few years so it's hard to judge if the rivalry is still as good-natured as it was, but I would imagine so, if only for [this moment.](http://i.minus.com/imCran5K5c3Ar.gif)

&gt;That's not true at all.  They'll take the same risks as before

How can a company that has less capital, less marketshare, and are involved in less industries have the same dollar investment amounts? They can't. 

&gt;Sure, no one company can take a trillion dollars in risk themselves, but that same risk value will exist in the market, it'll just be among lots of smaller companies instead.

Exactly. That means that there are not TBTF. No one company can destroy the world's economy. Every investment company has products that have high risk and products that have low risk. If the risk is spread out only companies that have made the riskiest of investments without the necessary capital to cover potential losses would fail.

"&gt; Right, just like congress can pass a law and then pass a law repealing the first law.

Right. So now there's a law. Obama's BS charade w/ waivers and such notwithstanding. So now it's time to call this bullshit for what it is, refuse to vote for shitheads like Obama or democrats who support him, and work on getting a new crew in the Congress that will repeal this bad law.

&gt; you can't blame him for Congress's shitty rule, he was against it from the start. 

There is in fact [a different take on this.](http://www.salon.com/2011/12/15/obama_to_sign_indefinite_detention_bill_into_law/) But even if, for argument's sake, we accept your view of this - let's be clear why we're in this mess. We need indefinite detention powers like the NDAA because we face threats in the form of terrorism. We face threats in the form of Islamic terrorism because American imperialism creates such threats as blowback. Barack Obama has never, during his political campaigns or in his time in office, admitted to this. In fact his rhetoric has served to validate and legitimate American government action and presence overseas, and therefore stuff like the War on Terror that is necessary to deal with the blowback that flows from it.

In short, Obama is part of the problem where root causes are concerned. You cannot get rid of BS like the NDAA or USA PATRIOT Act or Department of GROPEland Security and Guantanamo or Bagram or the Military Commissions Act or any of this shit unless you deal with the root cause. And on root cause Barack Obama has been going ""nothing wrong here! Keep doing more of it!""

&gt; It applies to non-afghans held at Bagram as well. Under Maqaleh, et al., v. Gates, et al. 

Non-Afghans captured outside of Afghanistan. So if you're captured in Afghanistan, no habeas corpus for you regardless of whether you're an Afghan or a non-Afghan.

And if you're say, an Iraqi captured in Iraq, again Boumediene doesn't apply, and we can hold you in Iraq without habeas corpus.

&gt; Nope, it's taking them at their word. 

But you're not taking them at their word. AQ has said that they oppose the US for a number of US gov't policies. Which implies, end those and we will no longer have a quarrel with them.

&gt; There's not much evidence that the war was fought to make Bush Co.'s rich friends richer. 

See Cheney's Energy Task force. And Bush was an oil man, remember. And Iraq and Afghanistan obviously have a lot to do with oil.

&gt; The U.S. spent hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives to get gas slightly more conveniently. 

No. The US ruling elites spent hundreds of billions of *other people's* dollars (that is what *socialize the costs* means: the ruling elites aren't spending their own wealth, rather that of the middle class and peasants) and thousands of *other people's* lives to sit on and control *other countries' energy supplies*. 

Even the oil currently being pumped out of the Middle East doesn't primarily go to the US. Most of it goes to Europe and Asia (China, Japan, etc.). So control over this oil isn't to make gas cheaper here in the US. It's to maintain current power relations, keep this economic system that benefits the folks currently at the top going for a bit longer.

In short: US control over oil = continued US hegemony. Continued US hegemony = continued global neoliberal economic order, which primarily benefits US/Western banking elites.

&gt; That's not what Al Qaeda says. 

It's known that Bin Laden and other senior AQ officials fled Afghanistan through Tora Bora. AQ claims to be an influential force in many different countries, but it's in their interests to claim to be so. Even Petraeus has at some point admitted there's no AQ left in Afghanistan. 

&gt; if your central thesis contains the word, ""sheeple""

You act like idiot sheeple, I call you idiot sheeple.

&gt; idiots like you distract from the real problems with your tin-foil hat nonsense. 

Nonsense. Idiots like you believe the propaganda that government feeds the sheeple. Which means you remain oblivious to the real problems.

&gt; You should ask yourself why you're constantly wrong about my position,

Because you do not articulate your positions, and your posts are designed to give the wrong impression about your positions.

&gt; despite the fact that I spend loads of time articulating it to you.

You don't. In fact, you criticize and oppose folks who criticize and oppose all these wars and all the wrongs that flow from them.

&gt; No, just evidence, that I can readily cite

The problem is in the interpretation of evidence. Human beings are unfortunately selective in the data points they pick. And they pick them according to pre-formed narratives and biases.

&gt; You're right, there are far fewer of them rounded up in the war on terror. 

They're qualitatively different. They're not uniformed soldiers, rather people you can't readily tell apart from civilians. 

That is the point here - what do you have in place that lets you tell civilians apart from terrorists? How can you decide if someone is an AQ terrorist or not unless you give them access to a lawyer, trial, the whole nine yards?

Now quit being disingenuous. You've already said you're a lawyer, you don't need to keep reminding me of it.

&gt; And most of them are released within a week. 

Simple logic: if we round up 1 million innocent people, then release 900,000 of them within a week, that's okay to you?

&gt; Right, detainees you cannot name,

That dratted ObamaCo with their government secrecy.

&gt; That's what you get for making war on the U.S.

No. ObamaCo *saying* they made war on the US. ObamaCo shouldn't be able to just say that. Let them prove it.

&gt; Or be a non-afghan, captured abroad, being held in Bagram. 

Like I said, ""evidence"" doesn't mean much if the ""intelligence"" interpreting it has been messed up/biased/fucked up. Let's examine what it is you've said here. Non-Afghan, captured somewhere outside of Afghanistan, held in Afghanistan. How significant is this? How easy would it be for the gov't to work around this ruling?

Well, what if they only hold people captured in Afghanistan in Afghanistan, and people captured in Iraq in Iraq, and people captured in say, Libya we rendition to the Egyptians?

"I have to agree with you. There's only so much innovation you can put into the nondescript white rectangles we call mattresses. When you boil the industry down, it's all just springs and foam. The cost of those raw materials (springs and foam, and wood for boxsprings) continues to rise, so you see the continual rise in prices of mattresses. The industry tries to innovate to justify the prices, but there really is nothing that can be done to stop it. I'm no economics buff, so I won't get into it...

I don't think this is ridiculous at all. I've put some thought into the ""Build Your Own Mattress"" concept. The zipper idea is great! I hadn't thought of a good way to close the mattress short of providing a needle, thread, and instructions...

Most springs come from China except for the odd manufacturer producing their own Bonnel or pocket coils. Currently, the fabric is made in the States and the foam is produced in Canada, the States, and some of it is imported from Europe. I don't think China's foam/fabric manufacturing matches American fire retardancy standards. Not currently. But that isn't hard to fix.

Your idea might not be that far fetched. The problem with boxing coils/springs is that, although lighter and manageable, they are still bulky as all hell. You can't roll/fold a spring unless you hinge it or eliminate the border rod. If you eliminate the border rod, you add necessary high density foams into the fabric/padding box, which are bulky.

I suppose you could hinge the springs so they fold down into like a 2x3x5 box... but that would drive cost back up.

"&gt;I'm getting 200ms ping and having that registered as ""good"" (ie. in the green in terms of latency) by the game, with random 500ms lagspikes. It's entirely possible that the EU beta's servers are set up in the US, but I get at least 160ms from US servers in every other game, and god only knows. This leads to a shit tonne of artificial difficulty and near death experiences.

This is only a beta problem, since there are only a couple servers up for the beta, and all of them are in the US. Right now, Blizzard is stress-testing the servers, so the beta probably will be laggy.

&gt;The CoD-esque levelling mechanics are laughable, as are the ways abilities work. Every level, you get a new ability or a new upgrade for one of your abilities, and you will ALWAYS have every ability at max level. You have no choice in what order you get them. The only thing that distinguises you from other players is gear.

Well, gear is very important in Diablo games, so I don't see how that's a problem. However, your build will also distinguish you from other players. When you hit max level, you will be rewarded through Nephalem Valor (increased Magic Find) for sticking to one build and one build only. 

And I don't see why having all of the abilities to choose form is a problem. In Diablo 2, there were many skills that I never touched more than once because they weren't part of a specific build, so I could never play around with them. Now, you can play around with all of the skills, choose which ones you like best (not the strongest ones), and go play.

&gt;Switching out abilities gives you a 10 second (or thereabouts, not sure on the exact figure) cooldown on that ability, which means switching out abilities or having more than six active abilities is unfeasible, which can lead to situations where you get attacked and don't have the right ability for the situation.

First you complain about having nothing to distinguish yourself from other players, now you want every player to have every skill available all the time?

The whole fun of Diablo 3 will be to find builds that work for anything you might encounter and be fun at the same time. If there wasn't a 15 second timer between skill changes, then everyone would play with the skill UI open and switch between skills every second.

&gt;All this just feeds into having the easiest general loadout and spamming the attack until everything is dead, regardless of the situation. You approach everything in the same way, deal with it in the same way and the like. You won't vary from other player's experiences either, as they're ALSO doing it in the same way.

Tell me, how much of the whole game have you played? That's right, the first third of the first Act on NORMAL. Obviously any strategy will work in basically the tutorial of the game. However, when you get to Nightmare and Hell, I'd like to see you take on monsters with only Arcane Orb or something else that you can ""simply spam"". You won't survive. 

&gt;Don't get me started on how horribly the classes are in general. They're not archetypal, they're not very balanced (heavy armoured barbarian / monk more easily kills stuff than the flimsy wizard?) and they're just not very fun. Witch Doctor is a bad necromancer clone, Demon Hunter is like a crappy D2 assassin, Wizard is just a poor man's sorceress, Monk is actually alright in terms of overall design and Barbarian is just a straight rip from D2 and therefore the best class in the game.

First, by archetypal, you want a rogue, a warrior, and a wizard, and nothing more? They're giving you more variety than a regular dungeon crawler. And Blizzard made these classes because they're different enough from D2 classes that if they wanted to bring back another class from D2, like the Necromancer, there would be enough variability between the two. I also disagree with your comparisons to D2. Right now, you just have nostalgia driving those comments.

Second, Diablo 3 isn't supposed to be balanced. You can argue that the monk is the strongest, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to play a Wizard at the highest difficulty. The goal is that players can choose a character and a build, and have fun with them. This isn't WoW, where you have to worry about min-maxing.

&gt;The healing potion / healing orb issue just shows how schizophrenic the design team is. On the one hand, you have healing potions which allow you to decide when you need healing and use them when you need them. On the other hand, you have healing orbs which drop randomly off mobs and heal you when you walk over them. Of course, due to this, healing orbs are utterly useless, or at least could be better replaced by healing potion drops, and is a fine example of ""lol wut are we meant to be doing again???"".

Did you ever use a healing potion in D3? As a way to address the abuse of potions from D2, all healing potions are on a cooldown timer so they're more of a last-ditch effort to survive. Healing orbs will be the primary way of regaining health because they're not on a timer. Plus, they'll add more strategy to boss fights because sometimes you'll have to switch from killing the boss to killing his minions so that you can get a healing orb from them when you're low on health.

&gt;Graphically, the game is horrible. It reminds me of Icewind Dale 2 in terms of looks. You could say it has a certain style to it, if you thought style could mean ""looks like it's from early 21st century"". Low polygon models, ugly arse textures and a general bad colour scheme just makes the game seem faded and already aged. Compare it with, say, Diablo or Diablo 2 in modern resolutions and they don't look nearly as aged as this game.

I don't know if you had the game set to super low or what, but Diablo 3 looks awesome. If you're looking for photo-realism, go play CoD. D3 definitely has a dark, gloomy style to it that adds to the gameplay of the game. And if you're comparing it to Diablo 2, please go play D2 again.

"There's an interesting book called Taming the Gods which examines religion in the U.S., Europe, and Asia and argues that Europe is more secular *because* of the state religions. Sounds crazy, but here's the jist:


1. A religious group would rule the country.

2. The country fucked up in some way, or people were discontent.

3. People blamed the ruling religion, and a ""regime change"" of sorts came about.

4. The religious authorities eventually realized they couldn't be fucking around in politics or the people would get pissed at them like they would politicians.

This doesn't really do justice to the book, which was pretty good. I read it a few years ago.

"Ahhh, a civil law country.  Yeah, it's easier in common law countries (UK, US, Canada, et al.), but harder in civil law countries.  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_change#Belgium) says:

&gt; **Belgium**

&gt; In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: Arrêté royal, Dutch: Koninklijk besluit) for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:

&gt; *    A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society.

&gt; *    A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren (""born naked""), Clooten (""sods of earth"" in Middle Dutch, but ""testicles"" in modern Dutch), ...

&gt; *    (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity[37]

"Everything I researched, also brought me more questions. :)

Most ancient cultures were matrilineal, which means that they traced descent through the mother. This does not mean they were matriarchal - ruled by a mother. A number of matrilineal cultures that continue to this day, or those that were written about in the more recent times were/are egalitarian/equalitarian ruled, generally by wise elders of both genders. Since the Indo-European conquests and the revisionist histories, we do not have written accounts by ancient cultures that have been deciphered yet. Many of the non-Indo languages are so isolated and few texts are available that linguists have difficulty establishing a base for decryption, like the ancient Sumerian, Linear A, Vinca, Harappan, Proto-Elamite for examples. This limits what we could learn about their culture structure if they even bothered to record it.

Yet there are clues from archaeology, like the neolithic Cucteni culture (5000-2700 BCE). There are a number of villages where the artwork reveals much about the culture. In one village, [these figurines](http://slowpainting.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/31470963.jpg) were found. These happen to be all female, yet in neighboring villages, there are groupings of figurines where some of the larger ones are also male. Those are not often shown because it flies in the face of the ""goddess"" movement, but I have them in my archaeology books. I dont believe these are goddesses. I believe they are symbolic of the elders with the smaller sizes showing the younger ones that are up and coming in leadership. They wear distinctive markings on them, no two alike, very much like clan tartans would be. These figurines have been found in groups, not just one here and another there. The groupings are what make me think of the tribal rulers.

The patriarchal move began in a certain area (around the Sea of Azov). Since these guys did not have a written language (they adopted the scripts of those they conquered) we have not been able to discern how in the hell this got started, just that it did and where and about when it began and about when the waves occurred in which directions. This is why I would very much love a time machine. We also know certain characteristics of these patriarchs that have continued to this day. And we can see the ""dark age"" that occurs in each area of culture that gets hit by them, as they take over and kill some of the population which included the producers, the artisans, etc. 

This is another reason why Wong's article is incorrect stating men being the authors of civilization. Sure a civilization has occurred, but not many realize how much civilization has been lost through their wars and conquests. We can see the loss of major civilizations that were matrilineal by the patriarchal Indo-Europeans on a large scale.

I am in search of that event that caused this shift with the patriarchs. I keep getting closer and closer, defining them more and more, in hopes of explaining to others how we can stop this bullshit.

"Newcastle sound like the team for you. Last time they won any trophy was 1969, winning an English competition was even longer than that. Here is a recent history of the Toon Army.

Mid/late 1990s Newcastle had a great team, that were exciting to watch, came very close to winning, and ultimately finish second in the league to Manchester United twice. A few changes of coach followed, that changed the team around, and didn't work out so well, although we got to 2 FA Cup Finals in those years, and lost both to the league champions. 

Eventually Newcastle appointed a brilliant man, and local hero as coach, [who sadly died a few years ago, he really is inspiring should look him up if you decide to follow Soccer] Sir Bobby Robson, who took the team from the bottom of the league to a mid table finish in his first year, and then grew, finishing in the top 4 and qualifying for the biggest tournament in Europe twice and narrowly missing out a 3rd time. For some unknown reason the club owner decided 5th place was a failure, and after a poor start to the next season he fired the coach Appointing a man who had done a goodjob managing a ""lower"" club

Things didnt go to plan with the club unable to challenge for honours and he was replaced with a guy who had been the youth team coordinator at the club at the time until the end of the season,and he did a good job, and was appointed full time, but only lasted 1 year. I believe. 

There was yet another change to a highly rated Manager at the time in, who had done a great job with Bolton Wanderers on a tiny budget. Shortly after this appointment the ownership of the club changed, to a billionaire who wanted a new toy. He [nor the fans really] didn't like the style of play under this manager, very defense minded, and a team that 4 years earlier was playing in the best competition in Europe, was now struggling in the league, battling against relegation. The new owner reappointed the man who had established the club in the Premier League in the 90s and had success, he changed the style of play, and we stayed up that year. 

The next season started okay, until promises to the coach weren't kept, a player was signed without the coach having a say in it, and he was told to check youtube to see him in action. The coach resigned. The fans protested because this new owner had fucked over a club legend. 

The owner put the club up for sale, for 6 months with no buyer, and appointed a man who had been out of football for health reasons for years. The team struggled on. The head coach had a heart attack and had to be replaced [we had 4 coaches in this 1 year] The team were relegated from the Premier League that year finishing in 18th place. Despite having the 3rd or 4th highest player salary in the league, and lots of ""big name"" players, who just didn't perform, players who always had controversy around them were brought in, and team morale was terrible, some loyal players who had been there for 10 years or more left including the star Goalkeeper. 

The club had to make a lot of changes, players who didn't want to play outside of the top division left, players with big salaries were let go, and it felt like the whole country was delighted in seeing Newcastle suffer, it was widely predicted that the team would struggle in the second tier.

A guy who had been a coach at the club for a few years was made manager after a fantastic start to the season, the club kept on winning in the second tier, the team had a winning spirit, and players were playing for the club and each other. They just kept on winning. Playing nice football, leading the division the whole way almost, and getting promoted back to the premiership as winners. Where again they were expected to struggle by critics.

Last season the club didn't struggle, they were safely in mid table, clear of relegation, the team had some amazing results behind them, were playing good football, and as a fan I was proud, then out of nowhere the coach that stuck with the team and had great rapport with fans,  was fired, which again led to people being pissed at the owner. Things kept going well on the pitch tho, safe, mid table position, then in January our star player was sold after repeated promises he wouldn't be from the coach, in fairness it was a silly value for the player, way more than he was worth, and the club couldn't refuse. The season end was much the same, some good results, some bad, a team in transition as it were. after the season ended some of the ""better"" players from the past 2 years moved on to new clubs, and were being very critical about how the club was being run to the press and on twitter.

This year has been sensational, we were expected to struggle, but the players brought in have been superb, and for very little money too, so the club is getting its finances right! The team spirit is still fantastic for everyone to see, we have played amazingly at times, had more amazing results,[and a few bad ones too] all the media, and critics were saying that we couldn't keep our form up, we couldn't stay at the top of the league, waiting for a bad result to criticize and laugh at us. The club are currently in 6th position with the same points as 5th place, and have a real underdogs chance of finishing in the top 4 and qualifying for the European Champions League again, which wasn't even a dream of mine as a fan at the start of the season. I can once again say I am proud of the club, and looking forward to seeing where we go from here.

* 3rd Highest match attendances, even when outside the EPL
* Underdogs who most people haven't given a chance.

I don't accept that premise. Trees are less harmful than alcohol, certainly, but while the intoxication caused by different drugs is hard to quantify, I'd say the amount of intoxication is at least comparable, and definitely much, much greater than cigs and caffiene.

And the legal limit for driving is generally much lower than that. It's 0.02 in many European countries (actual enforcement varies), and 0.04 in most US states (for DWUI). Furthermore, IANAL, but the law in most states has the DWUI limit as a hard line, but you can be arrested at any level of intoxication of any substance if the officer reasonably suspects that the level of intoxication has affected your driving. So if you take a massive bong rip of tobacco while driving and go into nicotine dissociation, you could get arrested for DWUI of nicotine. Not that that has ever happened or ever would, but it does demonstrate a theoretical legal limit for cigs and any other psychoactive substance.

That being said, driving at [4] or below is probably fine. I wouldn't feel comfortable driving above a [2]. Driving above [6] is just stupid no matter who you are; once I get into that range I can't even walk that well. I don't think it's nearly as much of an issue as drunk driving, but vehicles are a hugely dangerous and deadly part of our society even before you take drugs into account.

Er, yes there is -- land constraint reasons, as you said yourself. At some point of population density, it becomes a better financial proposition to build vertically than horizontally. (While bragging rights are also involved, no one -- outside of Dubai -- will build skyscrapers if they're *not economical*.)

That's what happens in North America, and what happens in Asia. 

My bet for reasons of why Europe bucks the trend? One, a much better transit system than anywhere in North America means better population distribution. Asia has fantastic transit too, but it also *still* has a much higher population density in the centre of large cities than Europe. 

Two, cities in Europe also have a much greater incentive (and cultural drive) to focus on preserving heritage buildings. Paris famously has an incredibly protected historical district.

"That heljestrand is fantastic, and some amazing history (from SRP): 


**Carl Victor Heljestrand**

C.V. Heljestrand was born on January 30th 1816 in Eskilstuna, Sweden. His father, Alderman Olof Heljestrand, who had learned until now the unknown art of affix etching and gold plating of steel works. In 1810 the production started of finer steelworks. Already at the age of twelve, his son Carl Victor Heljestrand, began to work in his father's workshop. Which, after Olof's death in 1837, was taken over by the older brother, Nils Fredrik. The younger brother Carl Victor worked there until 1843.


In 1842, Professor N.G. Säfström of The Royal Board of Commerce, brought a proposal to the Whitesmithery-industrial development to send some workers abroad to gain practical knowledge of this industry. Due to this purpose, C.V. Heljestrand was offered to travel to England, but he lacked knowledge in several prerequisites, including the English language. he received grants for some months to acquire these skills at the Technological Institute in Stockholm. In the fall of 1843, he left for England where he, after many difficulties, obtained employment at Parker's &amp; Lindby's knife factory in Sheffield.


Through his appealing personality, C.V.Heljestrand soon won the confidence amongst the English workmen. It also helped him to acquire the knowledge faster as it was the purpose of the trip. At the end of 1845, he left England and traveled across Belgium and Germany. He made sure to visit some of Europe's most renowned knife factories on his way back to Sweden. He returned to Eskilstuna later the same year.


After his return from England and encountering several barrier, he managed to rent a room of about eight feet wide and sixteen feet long in an existing grinding house. In this room, he procured a workshop after the English model with several grinding and polishing stands. Here in this narrow area, he taught and trained several workers in the art of making scissors and table forks. He continued to do so until the fall 1849. At this time, one of the town's grind houses became available for lease, and C.V.Heljestrand signed a lease contract for 25 years (it was unlikely to sign a lease for that long at the time).


He started to develop a chest disease, which would ultimately send this hard working, gifted man to a premature grave. He probably caught this debilitating disease during the three-year resident of the crowded, unhealthy premises.


But yet, he was not only working in his own factory. Several times, he shared his experience and insights with other Swedish workmen who wanted his help to establish the business relations with the rest of the world's and the big players in the steel industry. For this purpose, he made three more trips to foreign countries: the first time (1851) with the ironmaster C.A. Rettig to England and Belgium, the second time (1854) to England at the expense of the mill owner C.J. Olsson Riddarhyttan, and finally in 1856, again to England with The chamberlain Stockenström. Through all these trips, the desired results was achieved, which was largely by Heljestrands earnings.


C.V. Heljestrand could now rest in peace and quiet. He would have the greatest hope of success and continue the primary occupation: whitesmithery and the production of the best razors that Sweden has ever seen. He also had the pleasure of seeing his brands receive the best ratings, both within and outside Sweden. But, his bodily forces are coming to an end, and even though his soul to the end took full vigor, a debilitating tuberculosis laid him in the grave on the 29th July 1861 when he was only 45 of age.


Shortly after C.V. Heljestrand's death, this was written in the ""Post and Domestic Newspapers"":


""The deceased has been known for great knowledge and zealous activity in forging and manufacturing in general and particularly in the finer steel works, which was made by himself. Within his community, he seemed more than anyone else, at the same time and with the same zeal for the manufacture for proper promotion and public affairs. Even after he was taken to his sick bed, he wouldn't leave. He often shared his thoughts and advice on matters relating to the public with the sound discretion and clearly perceptive ability, which was his own. He is loved and missed by the community he belonged, and the loss is so much bigger, as long as it surely will be irreplaceable.

The South was rich in agriculture and the wealthy southerners used slave labor instead of machinery... mostly of African decent, and the rest mainly indentured Europeans. This created a major economical rift between the North and South.

Also, there was a heavy influence from a worldwide anti-slavery movement that had been going on since the late 18th century. We were getting a lot of pressure from England especially.
