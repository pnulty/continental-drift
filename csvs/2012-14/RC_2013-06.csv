Maybe, but not in great numbers.

There was not much economic incentive for slavery in Europe. It was mainly a mercantile/manufacturing culture at the time. The US was mainly a harvesting society. Manufacture takes place in factories, which needed cities with people doing small jobs. Harvesting takes place in the countryside with people doing big jobs. Instead of sitting, people were toiling in the fields or in mines.

It made much more economic sense to hire poor white people in the city for a factory job and to buy black slaves for a field job.

El_Sock,"&gt; I don't recall reading it, but do they go appear in a certain order?

Endbrigers never appear twice in a row, but otherwise there's no particular order. The last attack was Leviathan, so the next one's going to feature either Simurgh or Behemoth.

&gt; I read that they were expecting another attack soon and that there were more likely target areas.

The Endbringers attack roughly every 3 months, and the last attack was two and a half months ago in-story, so the next one will be here pretty soon. Defiant and Dragon worked out a program that can vaguely predict the location beforehand, but so far all we know is that the next attack will be in Europe.

&gt; So I assume they must hit areas they haven't hit before, or not in some time?

oliksandr,"The U.S. was settled by people frequently at war with each other. The settlers were constantly at war with indigenous tribes. The U.S. was born in war, and in its short lifespan has been almost constantly at war. We are *less* warlike than most of Europe was for a *longer period of time than we have existed*. When your whole existence has been tempered in the flames of war, its really hard to see yourself any other way.

It isn't even like we've been terribly imperialistic. After WWII we relinquished control of several nations and signed treaties recognizing their sovereignty, and signed defense treaties with them that had our military working with theirs to ensure their sovereignty against the forces that threatened them before.

Our really issue hasn't been the size of our military, but how we use it, and the voice of our government threatening to use it. If used differently, the U.S. military could be a force of much greater good, but even then, the strong-arm policies and tactics required would be frowned upon by much of the rest of the world.

Much of Africa could benefit from having U.S. forces come in and draw lines in the sand against dictators and letting new borders and nations form, but the money and manpower to make that happen has to come from somewhere...

[deleted],"I know what RP is, I just don't agree that it's a regional accent. You now appear to be agreeing that it's used around the country by the upper and upper middle class, though apparently you think there's a necessary causal link between going to public school and having the accent. I disagree. For example, take the Duke of Argyll (link posted above). When he was 4 years old, before he'd gone to any kind of school, do you think he had a regional Scottish accent? Or do you think it's more likely he spoke like his parents? Bear in mind that we're having this conversation in a thread in which OP has provided us with a really good example of how early in life accents are formed. I would say parents are the primary influence in accent formation. And that's why it's a class thing, in the traditional (hereditary) sense.

And in the South, people only speak naturally like that if their parents did, and they're middle class. It's exactly the same thing. You don't hear a lot of RP in London on council estates.

trai_dep,"&gt;The discovery of rogue genetically modified wheat in a farmer's field in Oregon shook global confidence in the safety of America's food supply on Friday.

&gt;Billions in food exports were potentially at stake following the disclosure by the US Department of Agriculture of the existence of the GM wheat plants.

&gt;The GM variant, developed by the agricultural giant Monsanto, has never been approved for human consumption.

&gt;The discovery in Oregon, about a decade after field trials ended in that state, raised concerns among the main buyers of America's wheat abroad, as well as an increasingly active GM movement at home.

&gt;The European Union advised member states on Friday to test some wheat shipments from the US. The EU imports more than 1.1m tonnes of wheat a year.

&gt;Asia was also shutting its doors to American wheat imports. South Korea, which last year imported half of its wheat from the US, cancelled imports, following Japan's lead. Thailand puts its ports on alert. China and the Philippines said they were closely watching the USDA's investigations into the GM escape.

ManBearScientist,"Human history.  This is one of those history channel crazy talks, but I'm going to try and make it sound logical.  

First, let's look at human kind from an outsider's perspective.  We can assume several different scenarios:

* No intelligent life exists.  Humankind exists as a singular entity and is the only life form that has developed consciousness, if life exists in any form elsewhere.  This is unlikely, but a scenario that must be considered.

* Intelligent life exists, but the physical constraints of the universe prevent contact or knowledge of other intelligent lifeforms.  Without FTL travel or communication, we essentially live as separate from the universe as if we were completely alone.  Well, with one exception.  This is one likely scenario.  

* Intelligent life exists, and has knowledge of humanity, but does not interfere with our development.  In this scenario, Earth is somewhat of a wildlife preserve, allowed to develop without the influence of a higher order civilization.  The essential assumption of this scenario is that any civilization with FTL travel would be able to hide all evidences of their existence and still monitor humanity without interfering.

* Intelligent lifeforms exist, and have made contact with humanity.  Basically, we have been interfered with, and some events in human history were altered to some end by alien lifeforms.  


Now that we've looked at the various scenarios for intelligent life to exist, let's look at our history and try to see how we developed.  

Human history starts with prehuman history.  The basics of prehuman history are the development of Earth and the solar system, the bombardment of Earth by comets to seed the Earth with water, the creation of the moon by a large impact with a Mars-sized planetoid, and the development of life. 

 Life, of course, has its own unique history, including all the extinctions, major biology diversions, and the evolutionary adaptations that led to humans.  

Then you have the Neolithic age, where humanity first developed into toolmakers.  They spontaneously began to evolve in a new, faster way, by continuously upgrading their external surroundings instead of their biological identity.  The earliest religions, songs, and language itself all began at the same time. 

Then you have the development of civilizations.  New civilizations continuously developed and grew, while old civilizations died out.  

Now is the tradition point to say that the Mayans couldn't have built their precisely engineered buildings without alien help or that the Egyptians built the pyramids because their alien gods demanded them to.  Instead, I'd like to talk about a few select events in history.  Those events include:

* The death of Ogedai Khan, stopping the Mongols from invading Europe and likely wiping out the fledgling ideas of capitalism and banking that had started to develop in Austria
* The Haitian revolt, which diverted French resources and helped both defeat Napoleon and create a continuous United States.
* The expulsion of Christians from Japan.  If Christians (specifically Catholics) had been allowed to stay, it is possible that a Catholic Shogun would risen to power.  Imagine the Seven Year War, but with Japan aligned with Spain and France against the British.  This could have created an entirely different world, and perhaps even allowed a one world imperial government with the combined resources of both Eastern Asia and Europe.
* The failed assassination of FDR.  An assassin missed by inches and killed the mayor of Chicago.  FDR's running mate would have been much more conservative.  
* The destruction of the greatest American civilizations by small forces of European conquerors.  Without disease or the adulation of the Spanish as gods, these empires would probably have wiped the small forces out, and taken a huge military step forward with the Spanish weapons.  America as we know it would not exist, as the European settlers would have faced empires instead of isolated tribes.  
* The decision by the US to avoid using nuclear weapons in the Korean War.  At the time, the US had a virtual monopoly on nuclear weapons, and their usage in Korea would give the US a stronghold in Asian.  That monopoly could have caused a growth of US imperialism backed by the ultimate threat of a nuclear attack, and caused either a nuclear war or a one world government. 

What do all these things have in common?  They were decisions made by a small number of people that either aided the development of culture or postponed world government.  In all of human history, each attempt to control the world has failed.  Several of these events could have easily resulted in huge power shifts that completely changed human history.

Now, back to our earlier scenarios about alien life to see how they relate.  In scenario 1, we are just the outcome of incredible chance that allowed people to both develop technology and continue as separate, competing entities until such point that we had a reasonably high level of technology and social ideals.  This is possible, but not likely.

Under scenario #2, the same thing happened.   However, one crucial possibility must be observed:  The ""seeding"" of life.  Even an ultra advanced civilization with no FTL could directly influence the spread of intelligent life by sending ""spores"" of highly resistant microorganisms with DNA specifically created to evolve into intelligent life under ideal circumstances.  We cannot directly find evidence for this, however.  

Scenario #3 is different.  In this scenario, aliens choose not to interfere with humanity in order to allow us to grow into our final state organically, or in order to study us.  However, if aliens have a similar mindset as humans, I think complete non-intervention is unlikely.  If they care about our continued existence, they would likely interfere just enough to avoid allowing us to kill each off or develop into a cultural dead-end (a world-wide oppressive government that prevents new technology or ideas from developing).  

Alternatively, scenario #4 states that intervention by alien life was entirely intended.  We were altered at every stage of development to become what we are today and what we will be tomorrow.  Our evolution was planned, our technology given, and our culture controlled.  

Of these scenarios, #1 is the least likely and also the least provable.  By Drake's theorem, we can state that a single intelligent species is highly unlikely (also, intelligent life of one extent or another does not seem to be uncommon on even our own planet; see other primates, some species of parrot, dolphins, and even octupi).  

Then we have either #2 or #3/4.  #2 is similar to #1 in that aliens can not directly influence us, but is much more likely simply because intelligent life is more likely than not.  

#3 and #4 are two halves of the same coin.  If we assume that FTL is possible (and current physics says it might be), and that it is feasible, then sufficiently advanced species *must* have the capability of traveling FTL.  If it exists, it has been used.  

Then we have to argue whether or not would, or would not interfere with human kind.  It appears to me that they would, on some level at least, decide to intervene.  Whether that means colonization and terraforming with microbial organisms, small adjustments to prevent complete eradication of life or stalled development, or complete world-building followed by biological control and direct alteration of human civilizations.  

Given what we know of intelligent life, advanced civilizations would likely try and propagate life and especially intelligent life whenever possible.  Seeding allows even non-FTL civilizations to influence other planets, and our development itself makes intelligent life more likely than not.  #2 increases the odds that we exist at all by spreading the seeds of life everywhere, #3 explains why every major event in human history went ""correctly"" to ensure the modern world, and #4 explains everything.  Each step of our own development is unlikely to occur without the aid of intelligent life at some point or another, so we must believe that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists and explains our existence and level of development.

Crafting gets really old extremely fast, especially when I have to craft several other things to make what I want.

GT needs to stop wasting my fucking time. 1.5k seconds in an industrial centrifuge is outright stupid (Glowstone recipe, if I recall). I know you can use overclockers for a 50% speed increase... At, IIRC, a 4x EU cost. Terrible design choice, IMO.

Infact, I once had an array of Hybrid Solar Panels powering a Mass Fabricator, generating UU matter every few seconds. With GT, My EU stores were finally draining. A good thing, IMO, as it challenged me to make a better energy source. 

Of course, GT also has some pretty nice things. Like making recipes like Mixed Metal alloys cheaper, and letting us get more wires from our wires. It's a nice gesture for sure, but the general bad design from most of the mod turns me off.

In a 1994 PR memo recommending strategy to help Phillip Morris organize a worldwide effort to fight tobacco regulations, Henry Miller was referred to as “a key supporter.” http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/pqa35e00/pdf 
 
In 2012, Miller wrote, “nicotine … is not particularly bad for you in the amounts delivered by cigarettes or smokeless products.” http://www.hoover.org/publications/defining-ideas/article/111606
 
Miller has repeatedly argued for the re-introduction of DDT, a toxic pesticide banned in the United States since 1972, which has been linked to pre-term birth and fertility impairment in women.   http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/re-booting-ddt,http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/09/05/rachel-carsons-deadly-fantasies/2/
 
 In 2011, after the Japanese tsunami and radiation leaks at the Fukushima nuclear power plants, Miller argued that “those … who were exposed to low levels of radiation could have actually benefitted from it.” http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2011/12/21/can-tiny-amounts-of-poison-actually-be-good-for-you/
 
Miller sits on the “scientific advisory board” of the George C. Marshall Institute, which is famous for its oil and gas industry funded denials of climate change.

Miller has argued that the FDA should outsource more of its functions to private industries, and has publicly attacked the FDA for its efforts to ensure proper vetting and testing of new drugs:

&gt;AgBioWorld 2011

AgBioWorld presents itself as a mainstream science campaign 'that has emerged from academic roots and values' and which carefully eschews corporate support. Yet according to the annual report (2000) of the Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), the centre piece of AgBioWorld's campaign - Prakash's declaration supporting the use of GM crops in the developing world - was part of CEI's much wider campaign against 'death by regulation'. The same anti-regulatory CEI campaign has been directed against U.S. government efforts to discourage smoking because, according to the CEI, 'there are things more valuable than health' .

Recently Prakash has been more open about the fact that Greg Conko, Director of Food Safety Policy at CEI, is a 'co-founder' of AgBioWorld. Conko appears to have a high level of involvement in AgBioWorld. He was at the U.S. government's press conference as an invited guest when it announced its WTO action against the EU. Prakash was the principal orator. He co-authored a Prakash op-ed article supporting the WTO action that appeared in the European Wall Street Journal the same day. On AgBioWorld press releases Conko at the CEI is often a media contact.

CEI has a multi-million dollar budget that comes from corporate sponsors, including Monsanto, Philip Morris and Dow Chemicals, and the Center for Media and Democracy describes it as 'a well funded corporate front'. All of which makes Conko's role in the birth of AgBioWorld somewhat at odds with claims of 'academic roots and values'.

Although Prakash claims to have no connections with PR firms or biotech companies, his connections with Monsanto and its PR people have turned out to be much more direct than even the Murphy/Smetacek mails might suggest. An error message received while we were searching the messages in Prakash's AgBioView archive indicated that the AgBioView database was held at the time on Monsanto's PR company's main apollo server. A technical audit which we commissioned of the AgBioWorld.org website also indicated it showed the technical hallmarks of having been designed by Bivings Group.

The Monsanto fake persona, 'Andura Smetacek', felt able to act in AgBioWorld's name. An online petition, calling for the jailing of the French GM crop protester Jose Bove, stated it had been created by Those who oppose terrorists and support science - this statement was directly linked to agbioworld.org. The writer of the peition was identified as Smetacek. There is no indication that Prakash was not party to this collaboration with a 'corporate phantom'. He was one of the petition's earliest signatories (no. 18 of nearly 300), writing 'Good job! Let Jailbird Jose serve his time and help the humanity!'

Interestingly, Jay Byrne, while Monsanto's chief Internet strategist, told a PR publication that he offered advice and information to the AgBioWorld campaign to help the company make its case. There is evidence suggestive of Byrne's involvement in an aggressive Internet strategy that included use of AgBioWorld for corporate PR purposes.

Authoritarians from both ends, either want to drug you with GMO or want to ban it completely. The EU is of the latter kind.

[deleted],"here's how it would go down

the platform is third person but you can also choose bird's eye view, this is if you choose the mama bear campaign and produced cubs, this game would be all out serious; tend your fur before it gets ticks, hunt fishes, protect your zone and you can even kill and hunt human trespassers. This game will not have any choices for difficulty because ""extreme"" will be the only difficulty. It's also an open world game online. When you sign in, you will expect dozens to multiple factions and alliances of bears in which gamers tend to, you can even check out the Korean server and expect to network with Panda bears and red bears. There will be a DLC pack in where there is a new Arctic campaign where you play a lone Polar bear protecting it's last ice berg from global warming, scientists and jumbo ships. Choose your life carefully, kill a bunch of humans and you will get targeted, befriend with humans and you may risk Zoo enclosure or neglect from your own bear pact. The main campaign will extend after your first bear dies and you can use that bear's lineage (if you had cubs) to continue a ""bear dynasty"", in which you help inhabit and populate your area, it could be Canada, U.S, Asia or even Europe. The controls would be all rounded-- for example, L3 is to dry up your fur (after a long river hunt) and L1 to lunge. At the end, people will realize that the bears you play are actually REAL bears, the company behind this; Valve, planned and harvested all the bears in Earth to have a ""game chip"" permanently implanted into their brains (it's organic so it passes on to cubs and later generations of bears) the game will only get to a hundred percent completion if all the people around the world are successful in taking back the Earth from humans. When everyone is all locked up and the world is left into a post apocalyptic forest, only then, half life 3 is released (note: it is the extra level of the game, blacked out, that no one seems to unlock!)

JJFO,"There were plenty of Sephardi Jews under Nazi rule. French Jews were primarily Sephardi, as were Dutch Jews and Greek Jews. Half of the Jews who were killed were Polish, and most of the rest were from north-eastern Europe, and there were way more Ashkenazim in general, so you are correct in thinking that it was mostly Ashkenazim who suffered, but Sephardi Jews suffered plenty as well, being descended from a Sephardi holocaust survivor is nothing out of the ordinary. 

It seems like you think Sephardi Jews are the brown ones, while the Ashkenazim are the white ones, which is a common thought I've found. In reality the Ashkenazim are the ones descended from the German community (who speak Yiddish, very similar to German), the Sephardim are the ones descended from the Spanish and Portuguese community (who speak Ladino, very similar to Spanish), and the Mizrahi are the ones descended from Eastern communities (its kind of an et. al. group, Mizrahi just means Eastern, they speak various languages, including Bukhari, which is very similar to Persian). So basically the Ashkenazim are the white ones, the Sephardim are the tan ones, the Mizrahi are the brown ones (well, some of them are from the Caucasus and are white), and Betas are the black ones (from Ethiopia) in case you are interested. There are also yellow Jews, but the community is very small and largely disconnected from international Jewry.

So the Mizrahi and the Betas did not suffer from the holocaust much as they were not in the area invaded by the Germans, but the Sephardim are European and suffered plenty. ",0,t3_1ffrl8,11,conspiratard,,,ca9u8za,1370048011,1370048763,,1430967046,False,True,t5_2r2dd,t1_ca9u8za,t1_ca9tr18,0,0,11,

If you pull out of Europe long term you make no money, you are making profit in Europe now and continue to do so for the foreseeable future, why would shareholders want to give up profit? Shareholders don't care about making the world a worse place, they care about profit.

[70%](http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/mutual-fund-ownership?symbol=GOOG) is free floating on the stock markets, so that's people who are investing for profit, not for politics, good luck convincing them that a 50% loss on their share price is good for them.

murty_the_bearded,"Sounds like a great trip, that would get you a good view of what the western portion of the country has to offer in terms of geographic regions and some cool cities. Just so you know, the Colorado Rapids play in a suburb of Denver and the San Jose Earthquakes play not too far outside of San Fran (don't quote me on this but I THINK you can even take a commuter train from San Fran to somewhere near the stadium). Their home games aren't quite as crazy as a Timbers match, but if you wanted to see some of the other clubs and facilities while in the country it might be worth it, especially if they're playing a good opponent.

Stadium expansion plans are a complex issue due to the location. It's one of the few MLS staiums that is truly in cities true downtown. Off the top of my head Seattle is the only other true downtown stadium I can think of, the rest play in stadiums in the neighboring communities. 

The stadium is literally built down into the land it's on. I believe the pitch is somewhere around 25 feet below the level if the street surrounding it. There is a subterranean river benath the pitch as well. These two aspects are some of the reasons we have to use turf instead of real grass, combined with the prolonged periods of clouds and rain, the pitch would be a mudbowl most of the year. The surrounding streets also make it hard to expand outwardly without permanently closing them. 

The funny building you mentioned in the back is the Multnomah Athletic Club (aka MAC), basically a really fancy gym and social club for the weatliest Portlanders. There is some kind of standing agreement that the stadium is not allowed to block the view from the MAC, as they have their own private balconies with seats for MAC members. Also there is a small alleyway/street that runs between the MAC and the stadium, this is the fire/emergency vehicle access route to the stadium. An ambulance sits there all game in the unfortunate event that soeone needs to be wisked away to a hospital.

I think at this point they have a few options for building some more bleachers by the MAC club end if they were willing to move the scoreboard. Other than that a full rebuilding of the property would be required to add much. It would be cool to see them take off the lid and add a second tier of seats all the way around the existing seats, but that would take a monumental effort. 

The stadium has quite the history behind it too including a noteable Elvis concert in the 1950s and a championship game between the Seattle Sounders and the New York Comsos in 1977 that Pelé played at. More info here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeld-Wen_Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeld-Wen_Field)

And, back to the trip, in all seriousness, make a new pst in here if you make this trip next year, and/or message me. We'll be sure to help you get a ticket to come stand with the Timbers Army and show you a good time around town.

Lastly, I don't pay much attention to European leagues because I have no context or personal attachment to most of the clubs. Now I have a club in Ireland to root for, GO CORK CITY FC!!!

markth_wi,"**TL/DR**; Earth's governments will ""unify"" if and when it makes economic sense to do so - and that will not likely happen until economically competitive and prosperous [off-world colonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZNzz4SaTYk) make it an economic imperative.

Earth will not necessarily unify in the way of an 'intentional' unification. Consider what would have happened if - say Ghengis Khan had successfully conquered Eurasia. The diversity of cultures would have still been as they are, for those cities and populations that still existed, and woe to the cities and cultures that resisted. 

So technically Ireland and England (perhaps) might have survived a land-based conquest, but what of Rome, or Constantinople, or Paris, certainly there would have been resistance and we know what that means. We know that those cities and their cultures would have been systematically destroyed, leaving a Khanate - probably lead by Jochi the (perhaps) illegitimate son of the Khan.

But the history of our planet would not have occurred in the way we are accustomed to thinking of it. For practical purposes , there would have been a unified Eurasia. But as the saying goes - so long as men die, no empire will last forever. 

In the present tense, however, such a conquest would be frighteningly destructive, but slowly we are becoming one economic system, and we now have the technology to render it such that wisely used an empire once formed could persist with a much higher degree of efficiency than was dreamed possible even 20-30 years ago.

In this respect, given the advent of technology at every corner of ""modern"" civilizations, you effectively HAVE one civilization, there is the technologically ""modern"" world, and everyone else. 

Most would say this is ""the west"" but that concept existed during the cold war and while there certainly is a difference in standard of living and economics at present in the ""anglicized"" west, make no mistake the Chinese, Indonesians, Indians would all very much like to achieve a similar standard of amenity. 

The United States currently finds itself in the uncomfortable position of coming to terms with the fact that it's society has been split. You have an upper-class that is educated, literate, ""liberated"" if not in fact liberally minded, in most social respects, and able to participate in and benefit from this technological economic unity.

While of course there is the political facade of victimization that conservative elements trumpet, there is, of course there is that disturbingly large (and growing) number of the US citizenry that very clearly not just ""does not feel enfranchised or connected"" but which systematically is suppressed. That upwardly aspiring folks can no longer ignore that their lot has been thrown in with the ""unwashed masses"" is about as close as political animus gets to actual grievance. 

But look at China, 1.7 BILLION people, and the numbers will break down similarly to those in the US, most likely along the lines of Pareto or the old 80/20 rule. 

Roughly 200-300 million Chinese will successfully attain a Chinese variant of America's Baseball and Apple Pie, a mddle class future awaits these fortunate people. There are of course the OTHER 1.2 BILLION Chinese citizens, who will NOT benefit from this arrangement and at least 200-300 nameless millions of whom are likely to suffer pretty horrifically in the name of those at the top. 

In this respect Governance of these two national powers, is likely to start to converge rather than diverge. The US becoming and increasingly totalitarian democracy/corporate-oligarchy and the Chinese a totalitarian/centrally controlled oligarchy. Europe and the Middle East, I fear are headed for a reconning, of Biblical proportions.

Economically things are already ""in motion"" as they say.

In the US, illegal or not, rampant immigration has kept the birthrate and other factors of the US in a sustainable - if oftentimes diminished standard of living, the major friction point merely being language, culturally as Roman Catholic religious viewpoints predominate in Latin America and are VERY compatible with existing Roman Catholic and Protestant religious traditions which dominate US culture presently, other tasty inputs are food and stylistic changes but the integration of US and Latin American cultures into an American economic/cultural superbloc are already well under way.

Japan and Europe however, are pretty profoundly screwed. Being about 5-10 years older than America demographically, the establishment ""boomer"" generation in Germany/France and Japan all have started to retire and move out of the workforce. This leaves immigration to fill the gap, however, unlike the US and Europe and Japan suffer from major racial tension with the prospective populations that could potentially fill the roles of workforce. 

Both African and Muslim populations would be capable of filling these roles, however culturally there is very little commonality as most immigrants would likely have either Islamic or Evangelical Christian or other belief systems which are both decidedly non-Protestant and non-Catholic traditions. Meaning ultimately that this cultural change is and will be a friction point for decades to come. Secondly, the religious cultural traditions aside, many of these input cultures value things very differently in terms of what individual families consider important, so is a large family important or a smaller family where everyone goes to school. 

This is a cultural question that the Islamic and African societies have decided very differently from the more technologically advanced societies of the west. So again a huge point of friction exists on these straight up - family values.

Japan, China and Asia are generally again different and while I cannot speak from deep experience or knowledge, it seems to my mind that there has never really been a generational ""settling of accounts"" between Chinese, Japanese and other national leaders. So various Japanese leaders were perfectly content to fan the flames of rather racist views towards Chinese. Similarly the Chinese state is increasingly - less deferential - to other major powers in the region, and it seems it would be foolish in the extreme to suggest that Chinese culture/military and economics will not come to dominate this Asian bloc, most likely South Korea and Japan will aim to position themselves and their citizens in that hallowed upper 20-30% of Asian society.

As for Africa and India - I do not claim to have a great deal of insight here and would be remiss if I tried to speculate beyond the idea that economically and culturally without a major change in their cultures, poverty will dominate both mega-cultures - certainly there will be shining cities, and ambitious businesses that set upon the world stage, but given the rampant privations 3 BILLION people will not benefit, and that is not a statement that should carry anything other that sorrow because it is very unlikely that an EU bloc , and Americas bloc or Asian bloc will view the areas involved as anything other than neocolonialist ""battlespace"".

That's my take on how our planet will come to exist in the next 40-60 years, give or take a nuclear war or two. 

I think what will really bring home the notion of planetary ""unification"" as such is the same thing that brought about regional unifications in the past, economics.

So for the next - say 200-300 years I don't really see much serious benefit from anything more unified than a strengthened United Nations, that major powers take seriously.

But that's always been the rub - major powers do not always necessarily see a prospective ""strong"" United Nations in their best interests. 

So that's the real problem the UN does have a very valid reason for existing - in providing regional peace-keeping - in the absence of a strategic military bloc like NATO, in providing governmental assistance to areas where governance has broken down, and providing regional support for relocation of populations and materiel in the event of natural disaster, but if you are the leader of some troublesome nation - the UN - and particularly a strong UN is not necessarily welcome - as it can rightly be seen as a potential threat to the sovereignty of nations where leaders are not running things in the interests of their people.

For me, I suspect that upon the settling of other other major planets of our star-system will be a MAJOR turning point for governance as well as our species. Prospectively, let's imagine that in the first few years a coalition of nations decides to found a group of 3 colonies on Mars, each setup near some natural resource , let's say an equatorial colony for energy production, a polar colony at either pole for handling ice-processing and a series of other colonies focused around local energy, mining and infrastructure and construction. 

Eventually areas or zones will be set aside for terraform activities , such as [Hellas Planitia](http://www.google.com/mars/#lat=-44.402846&amp;lon=-317.628904&amp;q=Hellas%20Planitia), which is perfect for a crash-zone to crash small ice-asteroids into. 

Now let's say for many years the colonies on Mars don't do too well, populations are down immigration is stagnant and the terraforming efforts might not be entirely going to plan.

Then an economic boom, the first mining facilities start to become profitable, new mines are opened up , the first efforts at agriculture are starting to pan out and orbital asteroid processing and beanstalk construction has starting to really pay off, a few decades later, Mars is prosperous, trillions of dollars are being created leading hundreds of thousands of colonists to be prolific in all areas of their culture, the birth of the billionth Martian occurs just a few years ahead of the birth of the second, and then the third. 

That's when I suspect Earth becomes a more unified political entity - when interests off-world dictate that Earths' local governments are forced to concede their sovereign interests to promote their economic interests.

jurble,"&gt;I was going to say that individuals from different races can be more genetically-similar to each other than to members of their own race, but that information has been re-examined and is very likely untrue. 

You're fundamentally misunderstanding the ""more variety within a race than between races"" adage.  You can easily segregate people into populations, population geneticists do it all the time, and make cool trees and such.  You can build a map of Europe using genome component similarities because geographic distance correlates with genetic divergence pretty well - and, of course, where it doesn't, it means something interesting is going on (recent migration, or long isolation e.g. Sardinia, or Albania ((apparently O-o))).  

Rather, the more variety between races than within races refers to the fact that most alleles for most loci in the human genome are not present in significantly different percentages among the various human populations.  It's something like 20% of alleles are significantly different between populations, whereas 80% of alleles are held at the same rate by all populations.

Thus, within a given populations two individuals can be very different because the bulk of the alleles in their genes are not in any way more likely to be similar than someone in some other population.  However, a large portion of his genome is definitely going to be similar, and you can easily try to guess his population of origin (and moreover, these common alleles will be common amongst the entirety of his population.)  

The odds of having a 20% same-allele match with someone in his own population is very high, but while the other 80% of alleles vary, the odds of them all rolling the same way with an individual in a distant population is very low, ya know?  Because the alleles that are significantly different in his population are likely to be found in him, (and thus are conserved in long-chunks called haplotypes in his population), but those other alleles are dice-rolls (or better yet, linked dice-rolls, because they often roll... together in a certain manner), and the odds of them ever rolling even as a 20% match in another population are slim-to-none.",0,t3_1ferq5,2,askscience,,,ca9uoi3,1370049489,1370050105,,1430966893,False,True,t5_2qm4e,t1_ca9uoi3,t1_ca9ojzf,0,0,2,

Noltonn,"&gt;-How much would 2-3 months of shitting around in europe cost? How much if we wanted to be more touristy and do things that cost money? Should I use debit or credit? How much cash should I have on me?

I'd advice debit, but ask your bank about the charges they make when taking cash out abroad. You shouldn't carry more money than you can afford to lose at any given time, though, so never take out too much, because 5 minutes later you drop your wallet (this totally didn't happen to me with 200 Euros). I'd go for having maybe 50-100 Euros in your pocket on any given time. 

How much money it costs really depends on what level of comfort you want to maintain. If you want to do hotels, hostels, couchsurfing, HelpX or WWOOF, camping... Also if you'll be eating out a lot, drinking a lot, smoking a lot. Try to figure out with these things what your daily budget would be for overnighting and food and such. Then add to that traveling costs. And some extra.

&gt;-What official documents should I take?

I take my health insurance card, a passport or other form of official ID, and I have scans of everything on my computer just in case I lose something, so I can call someone to access it and send it over.

&gt;-Im assuming train is the best way to get around. I heard of a rail pass? Any thoughts on renting cars/bikes or taking cabs? Maybe buy a bike when we get there?

Using a Eurrail or Interrail card is basically the cheapest option. Check the website for exact prices. If you want to be sure it's cheaper than car, look at gas prices around Europe and calculate your route and see what you'd be down with that. 

If you have the money, use bikes and cabs to travel through cities if you want. Be careful with cabs though, and make deals before you get in. I wouldn't take cabs outside of cities to travel to further places, it's usually easier and cheaper to grab a train. 

&gt;-How do I not look/sound too American?

The bush era is over, we really don't care much about your nationality anymore. If you notice you're getting a lot of flack for it though, get a Canada patch and say you're Canadian, if you insist. But really, we don't see Americans as either good or bad right now.

&gt;-What should I take with me (clothes, toiletries, trinkets)?

There's packing lists all over, but one advice I do have: Don't bring anything you can't afford to lose. That awesome necklace you got from your girlfriend 5 years ago that you can't afford to lose? Leave it at home. Same goes for watches and things like that. 

&gt;-Is bringing a tent a good idea? We would definitely like to do some camping in the rural areas but are there any non-hotel room options in cities? What should I know about hostels?

Maybe. They tend to bulk up your luggage though, so you need to find a way to carry it and be somewhat comfortable with it. Most places have campsites, but do assume you will be out of the city at that point. I mentioned WWOOF, HelpX and Couchsurfing before, have a look at those for alternatives to hotels and hostels, especially couchsurfing.

Hostels are basically a mix between college dorms and hotels. You sleep in a big room with 3-20 people in them, there's clothes all over the place but you don't spend any time there except for sleeping. They usually have a lounge place, and I'd look for those with a bar. They're very easy to socialize in and meet new people to travel with if you want. They're not as expensive as hotels, you'll be down about 20-30 Euros a night in high season in Western Europe, if you look right.

&gt;-What are some fun/cheap things to do to pass the time? Any other advice would be super helpful

Bring something to read. In the end, you'll have quite a bit of downtime while doing the actual traveling. You'll be spending quite a bit of time on trains, boats, planes, cars, whatever you use. You need something to kill the time. Maybe a kindle would be a good idea. Some hostels have a book exchange service, usually listed in their features online, so just bring one and switch it around. Instruments tend to be too bulky, and work on people's nerves, and you get sick of playing Angry Birds on your phone for 8 hours straight. Honestly, that's my biggest advice: Bring a book.",0,t3_1fengi,1,travel,,,ca9vgt8,1370052241,False,,1430966474,False,True,t5_2qh41,t1_ca9vgt8,t3_1fengi,0,0,1,

You are correct that modern economies rely on global trade. Can you think of another period in time that mimicked such a high reliance on global trade? That would be the late 1800's and early 1900's.

mr_snowman,"Nope, both times I was in a cross walk at times when I did have the right of way. The first happened at Sparkman and Lakeshore (Lakeside? Whatever that road is at UAH between the lakes) and a guy was turning left onto Sparkman (heading North) and didn't bother to look, even though he was stopped at a light. I was knocked down but not really hurt as he had been stopped at the light. He didn't stop, by the way, just yelled at me out of his window.

The other time was at the crosswalk on Holmes also near UAH. Again, I was in a crosswalk and the driver was in the farthest lane from where I started -- plenty of time to see me. To be honest, I almost feel like that was done on purpose. I became a defensive walker (let us pause and reflect on how ridiculous that sounds) in Huntsville after that first one and I pay attention. 

As a non-driver, I've walked my way around plenty of places around the US and Europe and I've never had this kind of issue.

And walking isn't as impossible as a lot of people think. Absolutely the city wasn't designed for it, and I know better than anyone how many times side walks will start up for a block only to disappear. But, I've lived here nearly three years and I'm doing okay. I lived on the UAH campus for a while, then on Sparkman, and now I'm near Bob Wallace and Triana.

One thing that the game does poorly, especially in the 876 start, is model political relations.  Feudal Europe's model just doesn't work for norse Scandinavia, and the early Church is much the same.

Rome was not recognized as ""#1 BMOC"" universally pre-schism the way it's viewed today, so the modeling itself would be forced to change.  All of this is elaborated by far smarter people than me at far greater lengths in more appropriate settings... but suffice to say that the modeling of religion in CK2 doesn't cover it.

You almost need ""Moral Authority"" for the religious group, then ""Individual Authority"" for each secular authority within the religious group, with the former adversely affecting the latter, and when the latter is high enough allowing for schism-like events, which produce heresies that can eventually develop into full blown schism.

[deleted],"I'm not LeeSharpe, but also a libertarian and can give my views.

&gt;I would assume you're against government action in order to bring consumption/production to the social optimum

I am. But also for reasons of social justice. I think private provisioning of public goods actually would better service disadvantaged communities. I think corporatism is exploitive and unjust and government heavily corruptible.

&gt;Government funded education

I'm for universal education, but not government funded education. Stopping education funding tomorrow would be a disaster for reasons we probably both would agree upon. The question is how to arrive at a situation where there is privately provided education, that better serves whatever country is moving this direction than the current system. There are several reasons to think private provisioning of education would turn out better. Removal of the one-size-fits all system would have vast benefits. There are increasing reasons to think that mainstream approach to education fails large numbers of children. One would still expect standards bodies to develop to accredit certain teaching styles (such as Montessori). Regulation is still needed but can be privately provided by ratings groups and audit agencies. For funding, I imagine we would need to first safely migrate to some form of voucher system. Overtime we could augement and replace state funding with private efforts, such as endowments, tuition for wealthy students, scholarships and local community funding. In my home town, the local school was originally funded by the town's business leaders hiring a teacher from the east coast and commissioning the building of the school. This was sustained the collection of a certain percentage of gross receipts from each member of the chamber of commerce. Any non-participating business was shunned and not generally patronized by the community. So in effect, funded by sales tax, but done so in a voluntary way. So I prefere a 'free' institutional framework for universal education, but would prefer (and accept) a state system (trending toward vouchers) to some Hobbesian situation where only the rich were educated. Also see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6m5pIqw2p4 

&gt; """" """" healthcare

I have the same general stance as with education. There needs to be a system to provide quality care for everyone. I think a freer system would actually do a better job, but again you need the right institutions. Take a look and the Swiss and Singapore systems: http://m.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-myth-of-the-free-market-american-health-care-system/254210/ The key is minimal government interference. Yes there is an individual mandate in these systems, but I'm willing to accept that. I haven't read a viable alternative proposal without one, but I would prefer it if such a thing was identified (and provided reasonable expectations of continued coverage for the entire populace). Also, much of the current health care system would be better off with fewer restriction in providing the service (but continued consumer protections). Take a look at most of europe, their apothecaries/pharmacies are able to proscribe for example. In the US you are starting to see a movement toward empowering nurse practitioners rather than always providing a doctor. We can move toward 1) everyone having catastrophic coverage with state/private subsidy 2) having a true market for purchasing services 3) adjusting the licensing system to allow more access to care and innovating in the market

&gt; """" """" Infrastructure (roads, bridges, tunnels etc.)

It depends what type of infrastructure, your examples are all somewhat ""roads."" Roads have plenty of incentives to be built and would be. Figuring out a transition path for each community would probably be different and difficult. Paying tolls could get much easier with electronic systems. For example, I could envision a system similar valet parking where by going driving to a retailer, they would pay for your toll (validation). And you have a certain number of general miles as part of your AAA membership, similar to mobile minutes. Presumably different companies would establish interoperable 'roaming' fees for billing purposes. Many roads would still be operated for the public benefit by non-profit groups. I could imagine areas with non-toll 'public' system provided by non-profits -somewhat like what the nature conservancy does with open-space. Home owners associations could pay for their common roads (which actually happens now). In practice there is als also the problem that the current roads are actually owned by the public now. So again, a transition could be painful. Perhaps more painful than the benefits of the outcome. However, I think the biggest challenge to libertarians on this front though is eminent domain. See here for a (probably inadequate) answer: http://www.libertarianism.com/content/short_answers?id=libertarianism&amp;post_id=222 

&gt; Police forces (and by extension, the criminal legal system)

I'm for keeping the current system basically as-is. There are many improvements that can (and should) be made, but they aren't necessarily specific to libertarianism. I'm not an anarcho-capitalist.

[deleted],"Earl of Dublin is fun. So many ways you can take Ireland. And then one you are King of Ireland, you've got lots of options. Do you try to consolidate your kingdom while waiting for a crusade so you can go take Jerusalem and start expanding in the middle east? Do you try to invade England or Scotland or Wales? Do you try to marry within the British Isles to get your dynasty on the thrones without necessarily worrying immediately about controlling them directly yourself?

Or do you try your hand at the rest of western europe? France has probably mostly broken up by now (at least it has by about 1150 in most of the games I've played outside France), and some of those northern duchies of Francia look just delicious. 

What about Scandinavia? Usually by now you've married your sons and daughters to some scandinavian kings, so you can probably press some claims up there if you're lucky.

There are just so many options it's not even funny. And that's from playing as a fairly isolated Earl. When I first played Ua Cheinnslaig I considered it a pretty linear experience, but since then I've realised just how many options there are in this game.

Hrodrik,"Well, reading the [wikipedia page on the genetic history of Turks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_the_Turkish_people), we get this:

&gt;According to Cinnioglu et al. (2004), the major components of Y-DNA haplogroups present in Turkey (E3b, G, J, I, L, N, K2, and R1; 94.1%) are shared with European and neighboring Near Eastern populations. Minor share of haplogroups also include those related to Central Asian (C, Q and O; 3.4%), Indian (H, R2; 1.5%) and African (A, E3*, E3a; 1%) affinity.[5]

So 94% of the genetic background seems to be European/Near Eastern.

Edit: Y-DNA is the DNA from the Y chromossomes of men, which is relatively unchanged compared to other chromossomes since there is little recombination during meiosis. So we can say that 94% of the population has European/Near Eastern male ancestors, even though there could have been many ""foreign"" mothers. Since invasions are usually conducted by men, it is unlikely that the genetic influence of Central Asians on the overall genome is strong though, unless the original Turks had brought a whole lot of women to marry all the Anatolians.

My dad's side is Mexican but my mother's side of the family is predominately Spanish. We know there's also Mexican and some sort of Native American somewhere in there too and considering the history of the Spanish, there's probably a whole slew of other races that we don't know about... It may seem like I have it easy because people lump Spanish and Mexican under Hispanic and call it a day, but technically speaking [they are not](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hispanic). And growing up I had to battle both the Spanish and Mexican sides because they pretty much hate each other.

Nowadays there's a little more acceptance/tolerance for combining European blood with Latin American blood, so I don't have the same problem as an adult.

These arrests have been made during and after demonstrations held in London and in towns and cities nationwide—many resulting from intelligence operations carried out by specialised units dedicated to counter-insurgency operations. |

A_Friendly_Hobbit,"When I was 19 I met this 28 year old European girl (I'm American) while volunteering at an Elephant conservation in Thailand for a week. We seemed to hit it off instantly and for the whole week we were inseparable. However, there was one problem. 

Even though we seemed to connect on every level, nothing could happen between us because she had a long term boyfriend back home. She was eventually meeting him in Vietnam shortly after we finished our work at the conservation. However, that did not discourage us to try and spend as much time together as possible before she met up with him. 

After our volunteer work was done we traveled to the islands in southern Thailand and spent a week there. There was much sexual tension between us but somehow we kept it contained. That is until our last night together. 

After a beautiful sunset and a nice dinner we returned to our room. After talking for awhile we completely opened up and confessed our feelings for one another. In the heat of the moment we surrendered to our lust and had a night neither of us will ever forget. The following morning was even more mind blowing. Saying goodbye to her that afternoon was one of the most difficult things I have ever done. 

I wish I could say this story has a happy ending but it really doesn't. She told her boyfriend about us and it nearly destroyed their 6 year relationship. In order to make things right she messaged me saying that we must cut contact and end our relationship. I was heartbroken. We were only together for two weeks but that was enough time for me to fall for her.

maybemonad,"Okay, I admit my first comment was dismissive and curt (though lol @ the downvotes, so many angry neckbeards), so I'll try to respond in good faith, even though this is waayy off topic from original post.

1. Re essentialism. You ascribe certain things to ""Asians"" and you talk about HK and (in your reponse) SK, all while the blogger is Singaporean. Obviously, ""Asian"" culture is not monolithic, and yet people on the internets (i.e., westerners, therefore eurocentric perspective) always talk about Asia (and the global south in general) as if all the countries and cultures are interchangeable. They don't do this with Western European countries. This is pretty insulting for obvious reasons, but also hearkens back to the super annoying stereotype (I'm sure as an Asian American you must be aware of) that you can't tell those ""conformist"" Asians apart.

2. You say that Westerners are accepting, tolerant, love people as they are. This reads as ""progressive"" to me. (And I submit that these traits are definitely not unique to---or even particularly prevalent in---the West). Maybe you didn't mean to imply that Asians are the opposite, so I guess I was mostly pushing back against the dominant, orientalist discourse on the interwebs regarding ""Asian"" culture as repressive, regressive, and conformist, in contrast to the modern, progressive, Enlightened, and individualist ""West."" Whether or not the writer intends it, their statements are read as value judgments (almost always, condemnation) of different, insurmountably ""foreign,"" inferior cultures---not neutral descriptions of mere cultural differences. I can list a number of examples of how white westerners talk (smugly, patting themselves on the back about how ~progressive~ the West is) about the far east as if these countries are *uniquely* evil or strange: how weird/gross Japan is with various weird shit/sexual fetishes, articles discussing SK's superficiality and plastic surgery popularity because Asians hate themselves and want to look white, ANYTHING about China, how inhumane Asian cram schools are, etc. [btw, I'm not saying these aren't problems; I'm just skeptical of the context in which these problems are discussed---the purpose is not in order to better the situation or even to help out those ""poor people"" a la white man's burden, but to circlejerk about how much better ""we"" are and how fucking weird ""they"" are]

3. Re cultural differences/values. You mentioned asian2x (not v familiar, but I have been there...didn't find it esp interesting, but I think most of those posters grew up in the states?) and body image. I don't know anything about Korea, so I'm not qualified to criticize (though I am very skeptical of the claim that they value physical beauty over what's inside, etc.). The only thing I can do is offer my own anecdote to as a counterpoint: in my experiences in mainland China, seems like it's a common practice to comment on another person's body. I think it's not meant in malice or judgment, it's meant as a neutral comment, rarely to shame someone, and doesn't carry the same baggage that it does in the US, where it's taboo, e.g., to call someone fat because fat is supposed to be shameful and it's value judgment on them as a person. Understandably, when someone who grew up in the US goes back to China and faces this kind of scrutiny, it can be very off-putting. And I don't think anyone should feel obligated to do emotional labor when they feel hurt/angry by such remarks, even if they're aware that the speaker meant no harm. But, I do think it's rather spurious, and in fact dangerous, to draw conclusions like, all Asians are judgmental and obsessed w/ physical appearance, or---to take a step further---the US is *definitively* a better place for *all women* compared to Asia because ""Asia"" has this really rigid beauty standard and pressure to conform.",0,t3_1fewyd,-31,SkincareAddiction,,,ca9wxs2,1370057497,False,,1430965534,False,True,t5_2tbbg,t1_ca9wxs2,t1_ca9uezf,0,0,-31,

aswyth,"As a linguist, I can tell you that the origins of Hungarian are sketchy in some ways, definite in others.  Hungarians are frequently taught ""history re-written every time some new assholes take power,"" as sekter wrote, and so tend to be somewhat confused about the language's origins.  But what's known is this: the roots of the Hungarian language are somewhere around the Ural mountains, where the two languages most closely related to Hungarian - Khanty and Mansi still exist.  You can see *some* resemblance in some vocabulary between Hungarian and those languages, but the Magyars were an on-the-move people and have picked up loanwords from many, many sources.  Hungarian is a Uralic language, and on the Ugric branch of that langiage family.  It's pretty widely understood that the Finnic languages are related from far back in time - although these language all share many characteristics, there is no mutual intelligibility between them.  

Really good sources of Hungarian writing go back only about 800 years, and for a long time Hungarian was considered sort of a low-class language - Latin was a long time the official language of the government and church, and only slightly more than a century ago, German was spoken much more in Budapest than Hungarian - so, sadly, a lot of research on the language wasn't done back then, and study of the language has often been poorly done since that time - often dubiously done more to establish certain elements of ""history"" than to get at the raw truth.  Hungarian's origins probably will never be understood as well as that of English or French or Latin.

Hungarian split with most of related languages much longer ago than many of the languages in the Indo-European language family did, so the links between them are not generally obvious to the layman, which is one reason why the language's origins are less clear than in other languages.",0,t3_1fc35m,8,hungary,,,ca9xj5n,1370059647,False,,1430965253,False,True,t5_2qzzt,t1_ca9xj5n,t3_1fc35m,0,0,8,

&gt; Womanizing Brit Charlie Cartwright is about to conduct Worldwind Tour #225, a nine country, eighteen day bus trip from London to Rome. He uses these tours in large part to catch up with his vast stable of casual girlfriends located in each of the visited cities. Within the group of disparate Americans on this tour, most who have never been to Europe, and the reason for them taking this trip are: parents who want to get their hormone driven teen-aged daughter away from her boyfriend despite the fact that the father doesn't want to leave the familiarity of home; a not-so woman's man who wants to prove to his friends that he had a beautiful woman in every country; an ethnic non-Italian speaking Italian who wants to catch up with the relatives he's never met; a WWII veteran who wants to re-experience the best times he's ever had; and a man who solely wants ""free"" souvenirs. But the one Charlie is most interested in is pretty Samantha Perkins, a self-confessed straight-laced woman who wants to experience life in a faraway land while she contemplates the marriage proposal of her boyfriend, George. As the group gets into one adventure and misadventure after another - including one person catching the wrong bus, the Italian having family connections he wished he hadn't while missing the one he wished he had, and the daughter sneaking off with a young American on a protest tour - Charlie does his best to woo Sam, who, despite her inexperience, seems to know Charlie's ploy. But Sam has to figure out where Charlie and or George will fit into her future if at all, and Charlie has to decide if he will ever grow up.

Translation, localization, obtaining licencing in said countries, servers for online (for the WiiU or for MH4 for the 3DS, which is confirmed to have online for the 3DS), advertising, etc.

In Japan, it's easy as sin to market a game that almost forces local coop and has a crazy difficulty curve, where in NA (and EU, to an extent) local multiplayer is difficult for most and the difficulty curve is far too steep for most (this second point is probably mitigated by the advent of games such as Dark Souls in NA/EU). North American gamers, as seen by the industry, want online and easy or very grindy games, and MH doesn't offer that.

mmb2ba,"Well, okay.  I worded that poorly.  I said ""made a lot of money"" when I should have said ""provided large amounts of war materiel.""

I can't say whether the US actually profited from the transactions, but the US **did** provide both the UK **and Russia** with vast amounts of materiel and munitions via the [Lend Lease program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease).  Most of that was at discount, but not free.  The US lent the UK over 1 billion (in 40s money). The sum wasn't paid off until 2006.

In addition, a large portion of the UK's war effort in the first world war was [financed by the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_Kingdom_during_World_War_I#cite_note-97).

As far as sacrificing hundreds of thousands citizens...well that's true, but Allied European losses run into the tens of millions.  Russia lost more that twice as many men at Stalingrad alone as the US did the entire war--including the Pacific. 


&gt; the US and Russia have been geopolitical rivals for the past hundred years or so.

This is...not quite correct, for a couple of reasons.  First, the US wasn't a major geopolitical power until post WWII.  In 1913 the US was a regional power and was pretty strict about the Monroe Doctrine, but it had nothing like the sophisticated Armies of Germany or France, nor the UKs navy. Oh, and it also had a large isolationist movement that actively sought to detatch the US from world affairs.  As such, I really doubt that the Tsars paid much attention to America, except as a neutral moderator in the peace treaty ending the disastrous Russo-Japanese war.

The US was hostile to the USSR after the soviet revolution...but then again [so was everybody else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War).  The US, UK, and France actually sent troops to Russia to assist the anti-Bolshevik White Army in the Russian Civil War.

Ah, the old problem of [the White Buddhist](http://www.vice.com/read/the-problem-with-white-converts-to-islam).

If you *really* think that Buddhism is seriously 100% grounded in reality and empiricism, then you really need to go visit India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Tibet, Thailand, China, South Korea, and/or Japan (or at least a trip to the Wikipedia page that describes Buddhism as it is practiced in those countries).

Searocksandtrees,"I've just been slogging through a book on the history of Arctic exploration which devotes a hefty chapter to [Pytheas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas)' voyages. The author, Arctic explorer &amp; oceanographer [Fridtjof Nansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fridtjof_Nansen), summarizes Pytheas thus: ""Little as we know of Pytheas himself, he yet appears to us as one of the most capable and undaunted explorers the world has seen. ... No other single traveler known to history has made such far-reaching and important discoveries."" But you're right that *back in the day*, his reports of the Arctic seemed too outrageous to be believed, yet even so, he wasn't dismissed outright as a lunatic: his works were still quoted by the succeeding chroniclers, even as they doubted him.

Here is the ""jellyfish"" story, as told ~300 years later by Greek geographer [Strabo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo):

&gt; “He [i.e. Pytheas] had also undertaken investigations concerning Thule and those regions, in which there was no longer any distinction of land or sea or air, but a mixture of the three like sea-lung, in which he says that land and sea and everything floats, and this [i.e., the mixture] binds all together, and can neither be traversed on foot nor by boat. The substance resembling lung he has seen himself, as he says; the rest he relates according to what he has heard. This is Pytheas’s tale, and he adds that when he returned here, he visited the whole ocean coast of Europe from Gadeira to Tanais.”

Strabo doubts him (which we can't detect here), but not enough to want to omit this description of the ocean near Thule from his *Geographica*. As for the whole ""jellyfish"" thing, we see that Strabo (who took the story from Polybius, who may have taken it from Pytheas' own writings) uses the term ""lung"" or ""sea-lung"". It seems that the interpretation ""jellyfish"" was later speculation. Nansen gives this passage a thorough analysis, which I won't quote in entirety, but here's part:

&gt; As to the meaning of this word there have been many and very different guesses. Some have thought that a common jelly-fish may have been called a sea-lung in the Mediterranean countries at that time, in analogy to its German designation, “Meerlunge.” It may also be thought that Pytheas merely wished to describe a spongy, soft mass, like an ordinary lung. In both cases the description may mean a gelatinous or pulpy mass, and what Pytheas himself saw may have been the ice sludge in the sea which is formed over a great extent along the edge of the drift ice, when this has been ground to a pulp by the action of waves. The expression “can neither be traversed on foot nor by boat” is exactly applicable to this ice-sludge. If we add to this the thick fog, which is often found near drift ice, then the description that the air is also involved in the mixture, and that land and sea and everything is merged in it, will appear very graphic.

Edit: for the OP, here's what Nansen says about Pytheas' navigational abilities: 

&gt; We know that Pytheas was an eminent astronomer. He was the first in history to introduce astronomical measurements for ascertaining the geographical situation of a place; and this by itself is enough to give him a prominent position among the geographers of all times. By means of a great gnomon he determined, with surprising accuracy, the latitude of his own city, Massalia [now Marseilles, France], which formed the starting-point of his journey, and in relation to which he laid down the latitude of more northerly places. Pytheas also made other astronomical measurements which show him to have been a remarkably good observer. He found that the pole of the heavens did not coincide, as the earlier astronomer Eudoxus had supposed, with any star; but that it made an almost regular rectangle with three stars lying near it.

Nansen quotes Geminus of Rhodes' (1st c BC) *Astronomy*:

&gt; To these regions [i.e., to the north] the Massalian Pytheas seems also to have come. He says at least in his treatise “On the Ocean”: “the Barbarians showed us the place where the sun goes to rest. For it was the case that in these parts the nights were very short, in some places two, in others three hours long, so that the sun rose again a short time after it had set.”",0,t3_1fewj9,4,AskHistorians,,Moderator | Quality Contributor,ca9xxm9,1370061202,1370067726,qualitycontributor,1430965063,False,True,t5_2ssp3,t1_ca9xxm9,t1_ca9nw99,0,0,4,

skpkzk2,"totalitarianism is not the same thing as imperialism. While Russia has always attempted to influence it's neighbors, especially on the baltic coast and near the bosphorous straits for strategic reasons, what we nowadays refer to as the eastern bloc or warsaw pact sphere of influence was a rather unique phenomena. In world war two, the soviet union lost 30 million people fighting the german invasion. To put that in perspective, the US, in its entire military history, has lost a grand total of about 1.3 million soldiers. To prevent such a horrific event from ever happening to it again, the soviet union decided to create a series of buffer states between it and western europe, rendering a blitzkrieg type ground invasion all but impossible. To ensure that these buffer states would not simply ally with the west, the soviet union went to great lengths to install communist governments in these states. This move is what the US took offense to, and so it began shoring up democracies in the west of europe, inadvertently creating the image of the enemy the soviet union was trying to guard against. There is no doubt that the soviet union tried to spread its zone of control, but so did the US. The soviet union wasn't trying to conquer the world any more than we were.  

Jumping to the present, the generation that fought in WW2 is dying off, and the generation that experienced it has lost power to the post war generation, just as with the US. There is no longer a threat, real or perceived, of a major ground war in europe, and russia has no reason to desire buffer states. Russia does fear the rise of the EU as a unified power, and they are opposed to measures which could nullify their modern nuclear deterrents, such as a missile shield in eastern europe. To that end, they are combating increased western influence in former eastern block states, but they are not trying to reestablish a soviet empire by a long shot. 

With regards to Georgia, South Ossetia is indeed heavily russian, many russian citizens live there, and they have been seeking independence for a long time. Russia could easily have just conquered Georgia, but instead, after it had clearly won the war, it merely recognized the independence of the region. The war looks less like a sign of renewed imperialism but rather an internal show of strength by the russian government.

Speaking of the government, while it is true that Russia's democracy is quickly becoming some kind of dictatorship, that is what the russian people want. Where in america we respect leaders who uphold liberty and the constitution, in russia, strong leaders who can make unilateral decisions but takes input from the people and advisors are held up as the ideal. To this day, leaders like stalin, peter the great, and ivan the terrible are still consistently voted to be among the best russian leaders of all time by russians. Putin's displays of vitality and his establishment of a de facto totalitarian regime are seen in a positive light by most Russians.

White slaves were once very popular in the Ottoman Empire and other middle eastern kingdoms and caliphates. The strong will always subjugate the weak, and that's a brutal, stupid fact of life. Luckily we've become more civil and are moving away from that mentality. 

&gt;In the past? Are you living in a fucking bubble? There was a law just signed in a couple of years called the Lily Ledbetter Act. Go read up on that. That's not 'ancient history' that was less than 5 years ago.
&gt;Then go look at the statistics on the proportion of blacks that go to jail versus whites for the same crimes. 

Are you seriously comparing a debatable discrepancy in pay to thousands of years of suffering? That act was passed to help ""close the gap"" between women and men's pay, so if anything it helped women overcome a ""fact"" that is now being hotly debated among economists. The idea that ""women are only paid 77 cents on the dollar"" for the same amount of work is a buzz argument that people like to use to argue that women aren't compensated fairly for their time. News flash, that information comes from *one* study and does not take into account experience, skill, occupation, education or hours worked. In other words, it's a horrible study with too many uncontrolled variables to be taken seriously. Yet it's the emergency button for every failing gender-inequality argument. 

&gt;This is such complete and utter bullshit that you cannot be serious. Just as susceptible? Are you high?

It's this exact mindset that puts people like *you* in a bubble and makes you believe that white men are incapable of being offended or taken advantage of. No one is invincible to racism, sexism or prejudice of any kind. Do you realize that while applying for scholarships, white males (of *any* socioeconomic status) are far less likely to receive assistance than white women or people of any other race? In what world is it fair to me where I am eligible for 4 out of 14 general scholarships offered by my school? Female only scholarships abound, as do race scholarships for latinos, black and native american students. Not ONE single scholarship is offered solely to white students or male students. There is something really wrong with that. 

&gt;Everyone loses their mind because white people by a wide margin are still the ones who hold all the power; financially, politically, educationally, and more. To call someone a nigger from that position is to emphasize that disparity.

Here's another instance wherein you are entirely wrong. White Americans are not on top, and black Americans aren't on the bottom, financially speaking. Actually, asian Americans earn the most per capita of any race in the United States, and hispanic Americans earn the least of any racial group. So kindly direct all of your pent up anger and frustration at the next asian you see, because statistically speaking, they are the wealthiest and most educated racial group in America. And here's the best part; THEY ARE A MINORITY. 

I think all people of all races and genders are completely capable of being just as smart or successful as any other person. We are all people, and we need to respect our differences and move on rather than dwell on them and act like we have to pay each other back for the screwed up shit our ancestors did. I'm tired of people cashing in the suffering of their forefathers for cheaper tuition, lower taxes and affirmative action. Race and gender relations in the U.S. make me sick and increase the chance that I'm going to just move to Europe and forget all of this. BTW I'm not some idealistic piece of crap who thinks Europe is a utopia. I've lived there and I know what I'm talking about. 

P.S.- just look at how massively negative the karma count on each of your comments is. Do you *really* think you are even remotely correct about anything? Get off your soapbox and read a book.

They have been relatively good at not replacing Islamists with secular juntas, but they have been allowing the AKP to rule lately.

Bilgistic,"&gt; Why the shift? History is one explanation. Today’s young people grew up in a period of relatively low unemployment, after the removal of the contributory elements of the welfare system and long after the collectivist afterglow of the second world war had faded.

&gt; But their attitudes also reflect the hardships they face today. The economic slowdown and government cuts have hit them harder than most. The coalition has trimmed the support paid to those who stay in school between the ages of 16 and 18, raised university tuition fees and axed a temporary employment scheme for those aged 18 to 24. Although overall joblessness is lower than in most European countries, youth unemployment has increased by half since 2008: an advertisement of eight vacancies at a Nottingham coffee shop recently drew 1,700 applications.

So this falls more on the current climate than ideological beliefs.

The young are less likely to care about the welfare state because the cuts have disproportionately hit the youth more than they have, say, the elderly. In that regard, it makes sense to not be very proud of it, since it seems to be catering more to different age groups. Young people feel screwed over, and that obviously leads to feeling like this, which makes sense.

It should also be noted that support for increasing spending on welfare benefits [dropped across the board](http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/2013/05/articles/body/20130601_BRC710.png) across all generations, so it has more to do with the political climate than it does with any one generation being more libertarian than the others.",0,t3_1ffshs,8,ukpolitics,,DAE Enoch?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gladly. I should really start with a brief commentary on the Turkish military's political role. It sounds appalling to Europeans and Americans without proper explanation.

So Turkey is founded as a *secular* democracy. We're constantly under religious influences because of our geopolitical location, and the military's ""unofficial"" role as the guardian of these secular principles is frankly the only reason why we haven't descended into Sharia law like most of the Middle Eastern Islamic nations. Due to some archaic law that nobody wants to repeal, politicians in Turkey have legal immunity. This used to be necessary to ensure that politicians are never persecuted for their ideologies, but since then it has devolved into a shelter to hide in for crooks, criminals and Islamists. So whenever there's a government that oversteps its bounds and either infringes upon these secular principles or abuses the legal protection bestowed upon them, the military stages a coup, kicks the government out, holds elections and put in place a new, democratically-elected civilian secularist government before retreating back into its corner. This has happened three times in the past (plus a quasi-coup in the 90s), one of which ended with abuse of power for a while on the part of the military. It's far from ideal (as is many other things pertaining to the Turkish brand of democracy) but in the current state of things, the threat of this has become a necessary evil. Just wanted to detail it because it's relevant to the rise of AKP over the years.

Anyways, year 2002, these AKP idiots come out of nowhere. They're all proteges of past Islamic governments that the military has ousted. They manage to win the elections with a ridiculous parliamentary super-majority out of only 34% of the vote, simply because the remainder was so fragmented and opposition parties were stagnant. Testament to how broken the system is. Either way, they come to power and for their first term, their only real sin is that they basically sold off a ton of national assets for outrageously low prices (obvious corruption). There was some outrage but people are apathetic just as they are in the US and more often than not don't care.

Fast forward to year 2007, opposition parties get together on secularist principles for the sake of defeating AKP. At first, it's a pretty close race (2-3%). Then YSK's (supreme election board) servers crash. Power outages in key districts in Istanbul and Ankara, followed by ballot boxes getting ""lost"". YSK then finds a conflict of data on their servers in recovery and deletes an entire chunk of the votes to resolve it. What was a close race before suddenly turns into an AKP win with 51% of the vote. How? The voter participation allegedly rose by an unprecedented 20% since 2002 and AKP got just about all of it. Any sane person should at the very least be skeptical about this stuff.

They grow bolder. Out of nowhere, they conjure up this investigation into a clandestine ultra-nationalist secularist organization that allegedly has been plotting a coup against the government. They call it Ergenekon, and then proceed to imprison quite a number of high ranked, decorated veteran military officers with accusations of conspiracy against the government. Journalists start speaking out and publishing contradictory evidence, and then they get thrown in jail alongside the officers with the exact same accusations. AKP appoints sympathizing judges and police chiefs to head the investigation (read: witch hunt). Evidence gets regularly mishandled. Instead of making copies on the spot for both the defendants and persecutors, police confiscates entire computers and then mysteriously comes out with incriminating documents that simply cannot be verified. Courts accept what is obviously questionable/shady evidence. No real convictions are made, but military officers and journalists are kept imprisoned nonetheless. Stripped of its top tier officers, the military is naturally now in disarray. AKP appoints sympathetic replacements. Mission accomplished. The one thing that protected Turkey from Islamist governments in the past has now been rendered ineffective.

Of course, media organizations across the country see this whole mess unfolding in front of their eyes. They want no part of it. When the government can throw basically anybody they want in jail without accountability, without anybody standing up to them, what're you going to do? Turkish media becomes timid, stops criticizing the government and stops giving air-time to the political opposition. In the meantime, AKP continues to infiltrate literally every branch of the public institution. Anyone with any amount of power in any extension of the government is replaced with AKP sympathizers. They have people through every level of this country, all the way from the current heads of the military to the police chiefs ordering and maintaining the disproportionately brutal police response to the latest peaceful protesters.

People have had enough. Even some of the former supporters are starting to question their party. It's hard not to when police ruthlessly attacks and wounds hundreds of peaceful protesters, the government pretends like nothing has happened, and then proceeds to aggressively censor the media to the point where multi-city, widespread dissent and protest doesn't even make it to the front page of the biggest national newspapers.

The optimistic part of me wants to believe that this is really it. That people will finally do what the military should have done years ago: topple this government and elect a new one. And then there's the cynical side of me who knows just how deep AKP's roots go in this country and thinks that nothing will change, that these idiots will somehow endure, keep the military docile, keep rigging elections and basically have Erdogan become the next Assad in about a decade.

We'll see how it goes I guess. I've been living in the US since I was 16. Finished high school here, then finished college and am now working on my PhD. I've been visiting Ankara on a pretty regular basis as I still have a large family there, but it's not *home* anymore so I'm watching these latest events unfold as much as an outsider as any of you guys. I have a two-week trip planned to Turkey later in the Summer so if this stuff doesn't blow over in the next few weeks, I'll have a better understanding of what the hell is really going on when I fly back there at the end of July. Been disappointed too many times in the past to hold my breath for change at this point...

Edit: Spelling stuff.

Edit 2: Clarifications on the election details. Also, some people seem to be under the impression that I'm a supporter of military coups. Don't be ridiculous. It's a shitty solution to a shitty problem, but ultimately it *is* a last line of defense that had to be called upon twice in the past. Any Turk would much rather have a mature, stable democracy with civilian checks and balances but we're far from there, and this is what we're stuck with in the interim as it sure as hell better than letting the country rot in the hands of people who would like nothing more than to dismantle its founding principles.

JayTrayClay,"There's a lot of stupid shit in this thread, so I'll at least add my two cents in.

I'm black in China. No one fucks with me. It's literally never been a problem, and Chinese people don't give a shit. I've certainly heard some dumb shit. But I hear much more shit from Chinese people about being American than being black. They just don't give a fuck.

I also have a cat. I can't speak to getting her in or out the country, but I'd just be careful if she were an outdoor cat. I'd definitely get a tag, but I'm sure a lot of people won't care. 

Drinking and drugs are a big part of the ex-pat scene, but I mean, yeah, it's like college. And just like college there's other shit to do, as well as people being aware that...right...some people don't drink. Chinese people might give you some shit, but honestly, if they're dicks, then they're dicks, so fuck em anyways. I have a good number of friends here who don't drink at all, and it's not a big deal. I don't know about other places, but I know at least there's AA here in Beijing.

I think that also dovetails into the Muslim thing. People might ask some ignorant questions, but again, there are Chinese Muslims. Chinese people will know what's up. I'd definitely learn how to say I don't eat pork when you go out, and be prepared for waiters to be idiots and still get it wrong. So be vigilant about that. People you're with aren't going to freak out tho.

The air is wack. Jogging isn't an option at all. Join a good gym. I don't know about Shenzhen prices, but in Beijing you can find places for like 2-3K for the year. 

Being flirty is fine. But there are for sure Chinese people who don't want to see foreigners with their women. So just be smart about when and where you turn it on. If you're in a shitty club, with a bunch of frustrated Chinese dudes who've only seen vaginas in japanese pornos their friends showed them on their shitty phones, yeah, lot of built up frustration there. Don't go spinning their chicks on the dance floor. Also, and this might apply more to me than you, as I'm just straight up black, but in general, Chinese girls don't fuck with me at all. And the one's that do, are...bizarre. I'd say like, Chinese girls into black guys are like goths in high school. They're a wholly weird outsider crew.

TorontoToronto,"First, prostitution is legal in Canada.  Certain activities (communication for, living off the avails, bawdy house) are in the criminal code, but there is much activity before The Supreme Court of Canada challenging this.  Most court cases challenging aspects of the law win.  Federal and provincial governments are agonizing to appeal or not.

There's a lot of money in this city, therefore the demand and supply of prostitution is high.  Toronto is in a condo building boom, more condo projects building and planned than all of North America combined.  Various sources report at least one brothel in every condo and hotel.  Some are run by ethnics for ethnics advertised in ethnic newspapers, i.e. the Chinese advertise ""Girls fresh off the boat"" and the Russians advertise Moldovan or EE girls (east European).  Supposedly Toronto police focus on illegal immigration, forced, or underage girls.

There are about 8 - 10 escort agencies in Toronto that maintain a very credible reputation: a discrete, safe and healthy experience both for the client and the woman.  A few have existed for 10+ years, they're doing something right.  Some have the same women working for many years.  They care about the women they hire, their business reputation, their client list, their fluffy towels, and whether the wine is cold.  They pay their taxes because, again, what they do is legal.

There is also a large and healthy independent escort market, many are graduates from the agency system like our intrepid IAMAer.  These are simply young entrepreneurial women that understand the sex industry.  Some have been doing it for many years, they're doing something right.

I am distressed that many of torontobeaver's answers see such downvoting.  She's telling you exactly how it is, meanwhile it's you / your boss / father / uncle / brother / doctor / lawyer / etc. handing her an envelope.  It seems some are holding onto a higher ideal of moral rectitude to her boyfriend or perform up to your moral ideal for her boyfriend.  This will always happen.  Why should she tell her boyfriend?  That's her decision.  Does her boyfriend tell her every time he and the buddies go drinking, or to a strip club.  Meanwhile, she has to pay tuition, rent, transit pass, while the provincial government allows universities to raise tuition 18% annually, weakens the landlord-tennant protection act, and the TTC raises rates every 3 months.

On the sexual health aspect.  Consider that our intrepid PSE'er is in regular contact with other women like her and business owner's with an obvious interest in revenue longevity.  That's a lot of sexual health knowledge in constant communication.  Also, Toronto has at least 3 that I know of free, anonymous, drop in sexual health clinics that conduct hundred's of tests daily.

Everyone is an individual and some can cope perfectly adequately with moral and health situations.  Considering the legal, health, professional, daily support infrastructure, large, varied and wealthy market, please understand that for an 18 year old woman in sex work, it doesn't get better than the Toronto market.

Okkio,"I'm not actually from the UK, however that statement did refer largely to the attitudes of English speakers in Europe. If you want other examples, I've sat with Swedes and Romanians and heard them talk about how the Gypsies deserved the holocaust and that they should be run into the ground because they've refused to integrate with 'European' values.

I've heard French people talk about how French-Algerians should get out of France. Irish people who don't want Nigerians in their country because 'they're all drug dealers', and Polish people who refuse to serve people of other nationalities in their shops, only Poles are welcome.

We, and I am European, are far too happy to look at the States and call them racist, and to chastise Israel for their treatment of the Palestinians, while ignoring a growing sense of race and religious hatred in Europe. Think about the riots in Paris largely made up of second generation immigrants, or on the outskirts of Stockholm, people are being marginalized and ignored.

We're not all racist, but that doesn't mean we don't have a problem with race and religious hatred in Europe.

Trevallion,"I think the frustration stems from the fact that Gregtech is, at its core, an interesting mod with a lot of awesome ideas and it adds much needed depth to IC2. Even some of the balance changes are necessary for what he adds. For example, a lot of people complain about the mass fabricator/matter fab change, but I think his decision to move back the ""make anything"" machine is necessary to add EU generators that make more than a few dozen EU. It'd be silly to create something like the fusion generator if it could fully power several dozen mass fabricators. That change exposes a flaw with IC2's core design: it's hard to justify adding expensive machines and powerful generators if they aren't much easier to make than the ""make anything"" machine, or if (for generators) they make it possible to power loads of them. On the other hand, many of his balance changes go beyond what is necessary to expand IC2. There's no good reason to require a compressor for simple vanilla recipes aside from just being a pain in the butt. There's no reason to ""nerf"" the scaffold recipe when you could instead ""nerf"" its silly ability to generate more EU than the materials you put into it. Basically, he makes a lot of good changes and additions that make people like his mod, but he also creates a lot of unnecessary hassle that make people dislike it.

* Mechanical keyboards have never been so cheap and accessible. After what - 2 decades - Brown and Green switch are making a comeback, in a mass produced CM line of products (which are basically cheaper Filco's).  
* Indie games are doing better than ever. An indie dev can now actually count on his work to pay back - Off, Minecraft, FTL.
* Technology has finally caught up to making VR game accessible - Oculus Rift (which is like 99% due to your oh so hated Angry Birds market, or to be specific - every person carrying a high resolution screen and increasingly accurate miniature gyroscope in their pocket), better voice recognition.
* I'd say Star Sims are making a comeback with Star Citizen, but they've never left - X^3
* Grand Tourismo is now actively pushing away old and tried fans (not a fan personally, but I have acquaintances and family who were fucking die hard about the franchise). But if you have perspective on it - the driving model in that game is so absurdly good, there simply _isn't much room_ to improve it much further.
* In just last decade, European game development companies _exploded_ bringing titles like The Witcher STALKER, Arma II, Mount and Blade, Divine Divinity (on top of blockbusters like BF, Crysis, 2 GTA's) - I'm mentioning this as a good thing in context of being dependant in single country, Japan, to develop 90% of games.
* Being a competitive video game player is now a career where the best earn 6 figure salaries - on top of their winnings. With HoTS, games in Starcraft 2 are now getting as intense and hard as those in Brood War days. MOBA has exploded to it's own type of game - having DOTA2 and LoL rake in hundreds of thousands viewers.
* Note from me as a TableTop fan: _this_ hobby is also doing great. While DnD proper caters to gamers with less hands on their hands, Paizo - arguably best 3rd party publisher for DnD 3.X has created Pathfinder, which is a great improvement on 3.X. There's a bunch of software like Djinni Battle RPG Program, software for video conferences using minimaps, tablets being used as interactive battlemap, 3D printers for Minis etc etc - that make even the **old school** gamers, pen and paper people - thrive.

Sure, Angry Birds are raking in wads of money. No food off of my table. The opposite in fact - those casuals are indirectly paying for my Rift, for my Kindle, for my RPG maps, and sustainable e-book market.

Yes, and it was not gassing people before the invasion either. That was not the reason for invasion. And Iraqis were doing better than they are doing now. That regime is not in power, and people are doing worse. Thanks America.

It didn't work there because of widespread corruption of the government. Its not just printing money, it has to stand for something. You need spending in downturns, once economy recovers, spending can be cut back. Top pay higher taxes, but no where near historical averages. Recent report came out about tax expenditures [CBO report shows **50%** of government tax expenditures go to top 20% of earners ](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/30/1212640/-Surprise-CBO-report-shows-50-of-government-tax-expenditures-go-to-top-20-of-earners) and [share of the wealth of the top 0.1%](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/05/28/opinion/052813krugman1/052813krugman1-blog480.jpg) And spending in bad times does not lead to poor growth, see 1933-1980s. There was a lot of spending in the 30s and 40s and America grew for decades. However, cutting during down-times leads to poor growth, see Japan and Europe. If you want to close the gap, you can raise taxes on the top to help balance the budget. And spend more on public works and welfare, to spur growth from the bottom, because the top is not going to increase growth with more wealth. See the 00s. There was a surplus in the 90s, and would have continued well into the 00s, but Bush came in and decided the government was getting too much money, and here we are today. Cutting government hurts primarily the bottom 90. Taxing the top more and making society more equal as a result, benefits everyone.

The possibility really scares me, but I'm not yet willing to take the past two elections as proof of this. They've been handled much in the same way AKP-backed police handled the Ergenekon ""evidence"" - incredibly sloppy, intentionally opaque, and left people with more questions than answers.

If anything, the youth has become more and more European with each generation, hence the unprecedented persistence of these latest protests. 

My opinion is that AKP is frankly the most organized Islamist party we've ever seen. The religious populace was always there. They were just never leveraged to this extent. These nutjobs did what the previous two Islamist parties couldn't do - pacified the military, silenced the media and rallied the base all at the same time.

International media hardly covers any of this. Europe just generally has no interest in Turkey - and the disinterest has become mutual after getting snubbed out of the EU for completely bullshit and made up reasons while EU brought corruption-ridden Greece happily into the fold. US, on the other hand, is conveniently overlooking all sorts of indiscretions on the Turkish government's part because it's in their best interest to not upset us. We share too many important borders with the Middle East and allow US to use the crucial Incirlik base for operations in the region. They can't stand to incite any sort of political posturing.

I mostly hang around /r/worldnews has a lurker but when something hits this close to home, I think it's important to chime in and reveal often unknown details about the circumstances. AKP has the parliament under control, the military pacified and the media scared shitless so they can quite literally afford to just keep tear gassing and pressure soaking the masses for as long as the protests keep up. They're shameless about how much power they've consolidated at this point. The government won't step down without substantial international pressure, and the more international media outlets make a big fuss about this, the faster it's going to happen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: A lot of comments about the EU stuff. I feel the need to clarify.

I don't mean to say that I think Turkey deserved to join EU back then. We weren't a mature democracy then, and we aren't one now. Before we ever get to the multitude of cultural, religious and other political reasons, that alone is plenty enough for me. So no, I haven't forgotten about the Armenian genocide issues. I haven't forgotten about Cyprus land conflict. I haven't forgotten about the lack of freedom of speech, press, or religion. There are a lot of valid reasons why EU didn't want Turkey and everybody knows it.

But more specifically, what I meant by ""getting snubbed"" was the period prior to Cyprus joining the EU in 2004. During this period, the EU put up one economic benchmark after another, each more challenging than the last, and gave a pretty solid run-around to Turkey. Once Cyprus joined, the talks really started breaking down with the land-conflict now in the way. But that prior treatment left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths in Turkey. It ties into the greater narrative in the sense that it's one of the reasons for Turkey's subsequent drift away from the West.

When former Soviet countries were allowed in, you saw a huge rush of people coming over to Austria, Germany and other countries. Then you saw explosions in criminality. You've seen the same thing among the Turkish communities. It's absolutely mind-boggling.

There is certainly an argument to be made that these minority groups were never given a proper chance to create a life and support themselves and were forced into poverty and criminality, but I only buy that argument to a point. If you cross the border into a country where you don't speak the language and are at a severe disadvantage, you have to be prepared for certain things. 

I'm an immigrant to Europe myself and while I come from a more privileged background, it most certainly has not been easy and I've had to make my own way, too. I have a great deal of understanding for trying to improve your economic situation and totally support moving abroad to do it if that's your only opportunity, but that doesn't excuse crime. 

Furthermore, while the former Soviet countries' citizens have, by and large, done a much more fantastic job of integrating into European society, the Turkish communities operate almost like the Roma - wanting to cash in on all of the benefits of social democracy, but not willing to contribute either. At least that's the mindset that has taken hold in Europe. I don't know how much is actually the truth, but when I walk around European cities and look around, it's easy to believe the argument. 

I'm not necessarily saying 100% that is the way things are, but I'm also not denying it either. Merely presenting a viewpoint. If Turkey were to become a member of the EU, then I think we would see even more widespread mass immigration from the poorer parts of the country to the rest of Europe. There are still vast swaths of the country that don't even have running water, despite the fact that the EU has also pumped billions of euros into the country to try and fix that problem. 

Now with the latest political developments in the country, I think Turkey can kiss any chance of joining the EU goodbye. It isn't happening now for sure. 

EDIT:

See the table [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union#Negotiation_progress) that lists aspects of Turkey that need to be brought in line with the rest of Europe before it can be admitted to the EU.

&gt;I said higher in this chain that you can't be exploited if you're willing to do the work, people don't trade labor for wages if it doesn't benefit both. 

2\. That is clearly false. You can't choose not to work. 

&gt;So you are effectively preventing people from being exploited by preventing them from working.

3\. No, I don't prevent anyone from working. Minimum wages don't cause unemployment. This reasoning has been repeatedly shown false by empirical observations. It relies on a false assumption that employers always pay the workers as much as they can afford, rather than how much they have to.

Minimum wages are often so low that they have no practical effect, yet unemployment remains. Countries with high minimum wages don't suffer unusually high unemployment.

raminus,"Yeah, I'm half turkish. It's not as bad as people here would claim; it's more Hungary than Belarus. The ruling party are religious conservatives (think Republicans in the states) who have the support of the more traditional population based in the Anatolian heartland, but they face fierce opposition from the mediterranean coastal populations who are more European-minded and secular, following the past example of Ataturk's secularism.

Given islamophobia, you'd think the conservatives would be more anti-democratic, but it's actually the secularists whom have a worse track record with democracy, due to [the secular army's predisposition to coup d'etats in the name of protecting the secular republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Military_coups_in_Turkey). The current government has actually been remarkably successful economically, since the early 2000s when they gained power, curbing inflation, raising living standards, attracting investment, getting closer to Europe (well, a few years ago anyway) and avoiding the recession, which explains a lot of their support with the poorer inlands. They've also made gains on the war with the kurdish PKK and granted cultural concessions, though I'm not up to date on that myself. 

By no means does any of this excuse Erdogan's autocratic tendencies though; his government has been particularly awful in regards to press freedom, locking up student protestors, pressing for constitutional reform with little cooperation with the opposition, cronyism within the police and the judiciary, dismantling vestiges of opposition within the army and the media (many call this a good thing, to avoid the other extreme from meddling in the democratic process) and just an overall dismissive ""big boss"" attitude. International tensions are also on the rise with him, from anti-multiculturalists in Germany and Europe (prevalent ITT it seems), to Israel (with whom he single-handedly destroyed an historic NATO-based alliance basically), to Assad's Syria (with tensions on the border, and Assad threatening to help the PKK). Most newer, conservative Arab-spring leaders seem to love him and conservative Turkey though, seeing it as a model to balance Islamic piety with due democracy.

It's all a bit of a clusterfuck. Just know that it's not black and white, and he's not just a pantomime villain. I strongly dislike him myself (full disclosure; I'd be part of the coastal secular crowd), but firmly acknowledge that Turkish democracy has been troubled for a long time before any religious people got into power.

[deleted],"What China is doing now is exactly how Japan became industrialized nation. 

Hordes of Japanese engineers and businessmen traveled around Europe and US with cameras visiting factories. They asked lots of detailed questions. Naively most westerners thought that they were just very meticulous customers, so they showed them around. Orders did not happen. Japanese just replicated everything and started manufacturing their own copied products that were very low quality but extremely cheap. We were still laughing for low quality Japanese cars in 80's and calling them rice cups. We never noticed that their quality was steadily improving. Then suddenly they were better. 

China is behind in technology, so it's makes sense for them to learn from US, Russia and others as much as they can. Looking them down because you think copying is somehow low is not smart. This is the fastest way for them to bridge the cap. Their space program is good example of what is going to happen.

I believe the Swiss know this more than any of its neighbors, thus conscription, because let's face it, Europe is a mess of many tightly held beliefs, languages and cultures that all of them will gladly die for. 

I do not wish to see such blatant sexism occurring here but unfortunately humans are simply incapable at this stage to justify it to not be this way.

guacbandit,"Why aren't any of you commenting on how the AKP government is actually not in control of law enforcement? If people look through some of these Turkish posters' old posting history and do Google searches, the AKP government was controversial for trying to curb the power of the police and military. So if we have your old posts telling us the police are enemies of the government, why should we trust the words of hysterical posters calling for a revolution who say the police are now suddenly listening to the government that was previously going after them?

Also there is never, *never* an excuse for a military coup of a democratically elected government. Things like this keep Turkey a third world country and I feel sorry for all the redditors sympathizing with these kinds of fascist sentiments. Maybe they should get military coups in their own countries and get a dose of their own medicine. 

I repeat: military takeover of a democracy: *never* good.

You said in another post:

&gt; getting snubbed out of the EU for completely bullshit

This indicates your bias. Overthrowing a democratic government will never get Turkey into the EU. The current government brought Turkey the closest to EU membership it has ever been because of its democratic mandate. If you are rooting for military coups and the like, you do not belong in the EU and you will never get into the EU. If the military takes over Turkey again I hope NATO kicks out Turkey too. It makes no sense to have a third world country in the world's most powerful and stable military alliance.

Another thing redditors are ignoring: Ask these Turkish people about the Armenians. The secularist (the real word is nationalist) Turks are the ones who committed the genocide. I am talking about the Young Turks of World War 1. They are the ones engaging in historical revisionism just as much as the democratic government is. Ask them if they admit the Armenian genocide and look through their posting history to see their previous denials. That is their true colors showing.

I hope the protesters bring change and get elections called, but if this results in a military coup, it is all over for Turkey. Democracy was a stabilizing force and the only true path away from Islamism. The rural voters might win the first few elections but they will slowly recede. Constantly overthrowing the elected governments will only rouse them more and ensure they keep winning elections and they will eventually control the military too and then you are responsible for returning Turkey to its imperial days.",0,t3_1ffnjg,-2,worldnews,,,caa0x50,1370077566,1370078058,,1430963585,False,True,t5_2qh13,t1_caa0x50,t1_ca9yeb2,0,0,-2,

Phaeroth,"Paragraphs are your friend, first of all. :P

Secondly: HEMA practitioner here.

&gt;Sadly no, the design is based on what your opponent is wearing. A slash by a sword is powerful, but it will only cut if the opponent is wearing light armor. Chain mail prevented cuts from swords well, but a well powered thrust? your toast.

While the general principle of this statement is correct, it overly simplifies the sword-and-armor dynamic drastically. Plate or brigandine armor are the two developments, at least in Europe, that rendered slashing somewhat less effective than before. However, this armor was more often worn on the battlefield, where a knight was more likely to encounter footsoldiers who would just bumrush him and strip him out of his armor. Footsoldiers, by rule of thumb, pretty much didn't use swords. Moot point.

As for chain armor, the best example of the dynamic between swords and armor here is shown in the Nova episode of the Ulfberht sword. Take the rest of the episode however you will, but the live demonstration of the gladius versus the Ulfberht against chain armor is a poignant example of how not just any sword used to stab can penetrate armor.

&gt;Chops and slashes were the prime factors for armors designers, many hemets[1] were meant to deflect and render your highly risky move useless, and over head chop on most well made helmets would give the recipient a head-ache and maybe a fractured skull if the blow was strong enough, but for small arms and most swords chops would be useless.

There's a reason overhead swings do not appear in almost all of the training manuals from the Medieval time period. The combat style adapted to the armor. However, swings to the head still provided the advantage of a brief second of stun, which for a trained swordsman is a staggeringly huge period of time to strike an opening.

&gt;Now comes the practical fighting, swings whether it be a chop or a slash take much longer to recover than simple stabs.

There is so much wrong with this, I don't even know where to start. In longsword, most swings pass through various positions that have a multitude of defensive options that can be used in an incredibly short amount of time, equal to or sometimes less than the time required to lunge and recover from a stab. An overhand swing from the shoulder not only is in itself a function defense, but can be turned into a different yet very effective defense mid-swing if necessary. Not only that, if followed through, the sword can either be wheeled back for an additional swing over the other shoulder or can be snapped up almost effortlessly from its transitional position (Roughly at the hip opposite the starting shoulder, tip pointing towards the ground-ish) into a variety of guards or attacks.

&gt;Stabbing saved space for close quarter fights like sieges

True. There's a reason the most common weapon on an open battlefield was the spear.

&gt;Stabs were more fatal than chops or slashes. A deep wound is far worse that a long shallow cut

Allowing the assumption that a slash penetrates the armor or is being executed against an unarmored opponent, (And I'm using the longsword as the example here, being the multi-purpose battlefield weapon of the time) even a DULL longsword is liable to cut quite deep. If you've heard of the reason why a dull hatchet is more dangerous than a sharp one, it's because it's more likely to bounce and can STILL sink halfway into a leg or arm. Metal is rather ruthless like that.

&gt; When you stab you display your defense outright!

When you stab you put a sword in the opponent's face. They're not just going to walk into it, they're going to move it (or themselves) out of the way, ideally. The issue with stabs is you have to lunge for it to be effective, and while lunging your body is in perhaps one of the most structurally weak positions you can be in. The longer it takes for you to recover, the greater the chance of you being dead three seconds later.

&gt;during a chop the sword is at a bad angle and place, leaving you vulnerable to a counter attack or a foreign attack

Combat of this nature is all about counter attacks. The battle ends when one of the two parties makes a mistake. After you parry, you attack. After your attack, you ensure that you can parry your opponent's weapon, and so on. If you know the rules of engagement, these sorts of duels are actually extremely predictable in where the weapons will go. (Especially with fencing. There's a reason the blind can fence, and sometimes even better than people who can see.)

&gt; with a stab your defense is right in front of you.

And most decidedly not to your right or left, which is where your opponent will attack next. There is always a counter.

&gt;swords were often difficult to swing with because of the lack of leverage (and space!) and lacked power during the wind-up or early stages of a swing

With a sword upright in front of my left shoulder I can deliver a swing down to Boar's Tooth (that hip position) faster than most people can react, and all I need is ceiling clearance. Oh, and this is after having only done this for a year. About the time the opponent realizes I'm swinging, my sword will be about ten inches away from hitting them and still accelerating.

Now, to be fair, a lunge will be closer at this point, but most of the acceleration that drives the weapon into the opponent is caused by the movement of your body, which is painfully slow by comparison. ideally your sword is already there, otherwise, you failed, and are going to die. When comparing the two, you get about the same amount of time to react, on average.

&gt;. Area! a chop/slash meant your force, the blades given area was the ""lethal area"" this means there is a ton of area to be blocked, the damage per centimeter was less

This point has little to do with blocking, there is just as much sword to block in either a swing or a stab.

HOWEVER! A stab will, on average, have a higher impulse magnitude than a swing, simply because the force is being applied over a much smaller area. Think of the impact as ""pressure"" and it'll make perfect sense. Hence, why a stab is better at piercing heavy armor. HMMMM.

&gt;Stabs focus all of your force on one singular point, that was thin and small making it tough to block. The method for avoiding stabs was to evade it

The size of the sword does not miraculously change when you stab, the only thing that changes is where the sword is to the perspective of the opponent. There is still a massive length of metal that their weapon can EASILY use to deflect one way or another. Evasion is an option, yes, but it is far from the only one, and is still almost guaranteed to have an appropriate counter attack assuming we're talking about competent swordsmen here.

&gt;, how to avoid a slash/chop? block. counter. you're dead.

Parry, counter, parry, counter, parry, counter, Rinse and repeat until someone fucks up.

One of the fighters in the HEMA guild I'm in LOOOOVES his lunges, and yet he doesn't win even REMOTELY close to every time we spar. It's especially obvious he's lost when his sword goes out of the middle and his opponent steps up to grappling distance. Oh, and all he'd have to do is just hit one of us pretty much anywhere to win that particular sparring duel. Stabs aren't the be-all end-all.

This is also the kind of simulation you could do on D3up.

I would however skip CD on the ring and go for one with avg dmg, str, 8% IAS, 4,5% CC ring.

More expensive upgrades is getting CC on your **Lacunis** and **Mempo**.

[deleted],"I like Romeu, he really seems to be able to stay calm under pressure and he maintains possession well. But if Mata, Oscar, Hazard, and KDB are your offensive players in a 4-2-2-2 then you will really need to have strength in the center of midfield to contend in the premier league and to challenge the physicality of the germans. I don't think Romeu and Gundogan will do the job when Luiz needs a rest. I think signing a player like Yann M'Villa from Ruben Kazan could be that player.

So if you want to play a 4-2-2-2, I agree that the team is solid defensively. If Luiz moves to midfield, that leaves the team with Ivan., Terry, and Cahill. Four cb's would be great, but with Luiz this should work. I don't think the team needs to spend money on a LB right now. I think Bertrand deserves a chance to be the player to start to take over for cole as he gets older. at rb theres alzi and ivan, a little short here. Im not sure who is on the market for RB's so I cant say if it is the time to buy a RB. As far as strikers go, if we end up sending Schurrle for KDB and cash, then I would go with a team looking like this
             -Cech_
Alzi  -  Terry   -   Cahill/Ivan  -   Alzi
          Luiz  -  M'villa
Mata/Moses  -          Hazard/Oscar
       Ba/Torres  Schurrle/Lukaku

I agree that Torres cant cut it as a first choice striker, but he netted over twenty this season, scoring a lot in Europe league play. I think he can come in as a third choice behind Ba and Schurrle and hopefully create a partnership with Lukaku that will let the team works through torres while Lukaku gets his feet under him.",0,t3_1fenfm,1,chelseafc,,,caa16h4,1370079791,False,,1430963464,False,True,t5_2rsl6,t1_caa16h4,t1_ca9rxpj,0,0,1,
raminus,"*I posted something similiar on /r/europe a couple hours ago. The other post is probably better and more in depth than mine, but it also seems a little heated. I figure a second perspective can't hurt, so here you go:*

Yeah, I'm half turkish. It's not as bad as people here would claim; it's more Hungary than Belarus. The ruling party are religious conservatives (think Republicans in the states) who have the support of the more traditional population based in the Anatolian heartland, but they face fierce opposition from the mediterranean coastal populations who are more European-minded and secular, following the past example of Ataturk's secularism.

Given islamophobia, you'd think the conservatives would be more anti-democratic, but it's actually the secularists whom have a worse track record with democracy, due to the secular army's predisposition to coup d'etats in the name of protecting the secular republic. The current government has actually been remarkably successful economically, since the early 2000s when they gained power, curbing inflation, raising living standards, attracting investment, getting closer to Europe (well, a few years ago anyway) and avoiding the recession, which explains a lot of their support with the poorer inlands. They've also made gains on the war with the kurdish PKK and granted cultural concessions, though I'm not up to date on that myself.

By no means does any of this excuse Erdogan's autocratic tendencies though; his government has been particularly awful in regards to press freedom, locking up student protestors, pressing for constitutional reform with little cooperation with the opposition, cronyism within the police and the judiciary, dismantling vestiges of opposition within the army and the media (many call this a good thing, to avoid the other extreme from meddling in the democratic process) and just an overall dismissive ""big boss"" attitude. International tensions are also on the rise with him, from anti-multiculturalists in Germany and Europe (prevalent ITT it seems), to Israel (with whom he single-handedly destroyed an historic NATO-based alliance basically), to Assad's Syria (with tensions on the border, and Assad threatening to help the PKK). Most newer, conservative Arab-spring leaders seem to love him and conservative Turkey though, seeing it as a model to balance Islamic piety with due democracy.

It's all a bit of a clusterfuck. Just know that it's not black and white, and he's not just a pantomime villain. I strongly dislike him myself (full disclosure; I'd be part of the coastal secular crowd), but firmly acknowledge that Turkish democracy has been troubled for a long time before any religious people got into power.

[deleted],"Well, like most answers, it depends on your social class and time period. I should also note that up until around the High Middle Ages sex work was usually not ""full time"", so to speak. It was simply one way of many to survive for women who had poor prospects for a variety of reasons. 

That being said, prostitutes have always been affordable; consider the fact that soldiers, pilgrims, dockworkers, etc. all had access to brothels/prostitutes. Of course, nobody said anything about their quality!

In Europe, the concept of the independent, ""high class"" prostitute (escort, courtesan, etc) really developed in Renaissance Italy. The expanding wealth of the middle and upper classes, as well as a growing emphasis on being ""cultured"" and educated, led to the development of the *cortigiana onesta*. These women were often extremely well-educated and from good families (Tullia d’Aragona was the daughter of a cardinal). Veronica Franco was rumored to have charged 5 crowns (6-8 months of a worker's salary) for just a kiss and 50 for sex. For a pop culture parallel, think of Inara from *Firefly*.

FlyingTinOpener,"&gt;That an islamist party has won the last two elections is rather telling, regardless of whether the secular elite/upper middle class (which I assume someone studying in the US since age 16 belongs to) would fit right in.

You're assuming that the electoral wins were actually legitimate without seeing the whole picture.

In 2002, AKP won a parliamentary super-majority with 34% of the national vote, in part because the electoral system is fucked up, and in part because the remaining vote was highly fragmented between a large number of parties. They had 5 years as the sole governing entity, on the back of 1/3rd of the population. Not exactly what you'd call a fair representation of the *people*, right?

In 2007, YSK's (supreme electoral board) servers went down in the middle of the count, followed by power outages in key Istanbul and Ankara districts. Several ballot boxes were reported ""lost"". After the recovery, YSK discovered conflicting information in their servers and proceeded to arbitrarily delete a chunk of the votes to resolve it. Several opposition parties (rightfully) requested a recount and YSK denied all requests. Not exactly what you'd call a transparent, democratic election, right?

There is no ""secular elite"" in Turkey. Secularists aren't a minority. There's about 1/3rd of the country (if the election results are any indication, though I would doubt their validity) that are AKP supporters either because they're strongly religious or out of sheer spite for the other parties. The remaining portion of the country actually feels kinda strongly about secularism. It's one of the very few things that the traditional left and right parties agree on, and it's the basis on which they've come together in the past few years in joint opposition to AKP in the parliament.

I don't fault you that this isn't the picture you get from the outside looking in, but it is what it is. People read that Turkey is 90% Muslim and automatically label the country as religious and conservative. ""Muslim"" isn't some binary label that immediately takes you from being an atheist to being a devout practitioner. 76% of Americans are Christians but there are plenty among them who don't practice, and live their lives in accordance with social principles that may not always be in line with Christian teachings. The situation is no different in Turkey. There are large chunks of the population, the youth especially, who identify as Muslim because they've been born into it and believe in the general framework, but don't practice and live their lives pretty much in accordance with Western societal norms. There are many shades there. It's pretty diverse. For some reason, Westerners just cannot fathom that Islam can ever exist in that form. Well it can and Turkey is proof of it.

I don't mean to claim that Turkey deserved to be part of the EU back then, because I don't believe it did. We've always struggled with freedom of the press even before AKP and Erdogan, which is a cornerstone of any successful and stable democracy. We'll never get it right until we get *that* right.

wingmananytime,"I'm not assuming the election are legitimate, but AKP *is* the largest party, even without any election fraud. It's hardly controversy to point out that large parts of the turkish population are religious.

&gt;Interpreting the poll, TESEV Board of Directors Chairman Can Paker posited that Turks divide into two sociopolitical parts: one-third of them are secular, and two-thirds are religious. Of secular Turks, about 10 percent are ultrasecularists, very nationalistic, anti-Europe, and increasingly anti–United States. The other 20 percent are demo- cratic and deeply concerned that Turkish secularism could be lost— that there could be a gradual erosion of secular rights and that over time Turkey could be “Iranized.” Of the religious Turks, some 10 percent are in favor of a state based on shari’a (Islamic law); 50 to 60 percent are conservative, but they also want to be modern, and they have middle- class aspirations.

http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2008/RAND_MG726.pdf

I also have to point out that it's rather contradictory to claim there's no secular elite, while you at the same time make the point that secularism in Turkey has historically been protected by the military. Secular generals do not form a secular elite?

Membership in the European union entails a lot of things. One of the basic tenets is the freedom of movement of people. Most Europeans don't feel the same cultural affinity to Turkey as they do to (other?) European countries. That large parts of the population remain religious and conservative, muslim at that, is and will remain the main reason why most Europeans are not in favour of Turkey joining the EU. Scepticism of religion in general and Islam in particular runs deep.

I'm well aware that large parts of the Turkish population are secular. The poll above says a third. But even if just a third of the population of Turkey are religious (which isn't the case), it would triple the number of religious muslims in the EU overnight. Speak all of you will of secular institutions, economic reforms etc; as long as these demographic realities remain, I don't see Turkey joining the EU. Most European leaders will probably not formulate their argument against Turkish membership along these lines, preferring less controversial arguments (corruption, freedom of the press, human rights abuses), but this I'm convinced this is why the EU remained hazy about membership even after Turkey implemented the reform the EU demanded. This is why the EU does not invite Turkey on a path that will result in membership. Polls support this, and some leaders are even making the cultural and religious argument explicit.

&gt;The main dividing line appears to be religion. Cultural and religious differences are perhaps the most sensitive of all the arguments raised against Turkish accession to the bloc, with several conservative European leaders, most notably France's President Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, making the case for the EU as a 'Christian club'.

http://www.euractiv.com/priorities/turkey-eu-public-thinks-linksdossier-188457

&gt;Despite the reality of the need for good neighborly relations, the current economic and financial crisis within the Eurozone and a continued healthy level of public skepticism, indifference or ambivalence toward EU enlargement to Turkey on the part of many Europeans, fueled by cultural and religious differences, continue to cloud European attitudes about Turkey, not as an important neighbor to Europe, economic partner, or regional foreign policy influence, but simply as a fullscale member of the Union. Despite these problems some EU member states, but particularly the EU Commission, continue to publically express a desire to see Turkey’s accession move forward. 

http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22517.pdf

It's also worth noting that countries with large number of immigrants from Turkey, such as Germany, remain highly sceptical. I realise this is an unfair comparison as Turkish immigrants have remained more traditionalist than many secular turks remaining in Turkey, but it certainly doesn't help the case for a Turkish EU membership.

domdest,"I would recommend reading up on some other pagan practices too. Wicca as a practice is relatively young, but attempts to pull some of its practices from ancient religions (mainly European). There are other traditions that attempt to faithfully revive the spiritual practices of other ancient religions.

For example, Asatru is a practice of Norse religion (and particularly fun for me, Asatru know how to throw a hell of a party). Kemetic tradition is a revival of ancient Egyptian beliefs. Hellenic paganism studies Greco-Roman practices.

Many forms of modern paganism are a combination of ancient history and folklore, mythology revived as belief, and earth worship and appreciation. Pagans practice becoming more in touch with the natural world and the inner spirit. It can be very primal stuff, but has been adapted by many to follow the more progressive ideals of today.

I would also recommend looking into some mainstream contemporary students of pagan belief, if you are the intellectual sort. Karl Jung based much of his studies about the subconscious on the Kaballah, and on Tarot, which he believed was a means of communicating with the subconscious. Aleister Crowley, Gerald Gardner, and Alex Sanders are all religious leaders (Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca are two traditions of Wiccan religion) from the last hundred years who based their religions on ancient traditions.

There is a lot of information on different pagan beliefs, and you shouldn't let anyone lock you into thinking that there's only one way a certain thing can be.

I believe lane taxation and junglers free farming became common because of the tops and junglers that are currently fotm. Eve, Nasus, Zac and even Nautilus scale pretty well with gold or farm. Zac and Nautilus are CC tanks, but a bit of farm can let Zac build some damage or a Spirit Visage before the utilty items. Nautilus with farm can get tankier, increasing the duration of his shield by a lot.

If your toplaner is Malphite, Rumble, Elise (they need 2 or 3 cheap core items to be useful) there is no reason he shouldn't be the one helping the roam (as they will be levels ahead of you and have most damage built), while you catch up in levels and farm.

There are some advantages in your levels being 12-12-14-13-10 (lcs order), instead of 14-10-14-13-10, specially if your jungler will initiate for you, as the tankiness he gains with levels is really important (and this way he outsmites the other jungler! Objective control OP). 

I pretty much agree with B and A. But actually, in a competitive level, side lane farm in mid and late game is a great part of a team strategy. Eu teams let the mid get most and the jungler get some. CLG turns on double's pve mode, etc. That's why some players get over 300 cs consistently.

When I say ""decide how it should be fixed"", I am referring to the range of options including renewable energy, nuclear power, charging for carbon emissions, recycling, charging for carrier bags, providing grants for electric car companies, burying carbon in the ground etc etc. Which of the various options we choose should be decided by politicians, not scientists. While the politicians can choose to ask scientists which option/combination would have the most effect, ultimately it is a moral decision, not a scientific one.

The UK Uni/British Govt do give out scholarships to international students, but they tend not to give them to US students. Here is where I have a problem with automatically assuming American students are more well off: My flat mate is a girl from South Africa of Indian descent. I don't remember what her parents do, but I do know they have a higher income than my family, even when compared directly to USD. Her family supports her entirely (has never had a job, flies her home every break, etc.). When comparing our pre-University qualifications and extra-curricular work, it would appear that mine were much higher. However, she has been awarded one of the University's international scholarships, paying 100% of her tuition. This is a single, anecdotal example and I am not suggesting she doesn't deserve a scholarship. However there does seem to be a reluctance to give money to US students at the same level as non-US/European students. 

Any bursaries that would normally be given to my colleagues are only available to British citizens or citizens or the commonwealth (Canada for example). I have been unsuccessful in finding any scholarships which are available to me or are directed towards students pursuing my degree.

As far as financial aid goes, my father is a well off US doctor with whom I had a falling out after High School. According to FAFSA, I am still his dependent and thus qualify for only the minimum in student loans.

delaneyyy,"I'm currently in Istanbul. I was at the protests last night and will be going back shortly.

They seem to have blocked facebook and twitter (can't confirm this, but everything else seems to be working while those websites are not loading). Not sure if they'll be blocking more.

Last night I and my friends were teargassed; we saw puddles of blood &amp; water in the streets; med students were called for and stood by with bottles of a homemade solution for washing teargas out of the eyes of protesters (which was GREAT).

Other interesting things: some stores have taken the passwords off their wifi to let protesters use it as traditional media is lacking or censored here right now. We stepped into a bar for a drink and it was acting as a makeshift med station, treating the injured. Later we were trapped in a bar for a while as they closed the metal gates when the protests/teargas came too close.

I've also seen more gender equality than ever before (Istanbul's not terrible with it, but not great). I saw a girl spreading out her scarf to fill it with paving stones as other young men and women pried them up from the street, to be thrown at police.

Lots more, but I need to get moving. Would like to post some pictures if there's interest.

EDIT: Lots of people have home-made (I think) gas masks: http://imgur.com/bdfOtLr

The banner you see at the end of that video was in shreds last night, with people climbing up the metal structure to see better.

There were thousands and thousands of people there last night. I couldn't guess how many but I was amazed. Thousands more walked across the Bosphorous bridge (connecting Europe and Asia) this morning as they shut down public transit.

""Abroad"" is not some kind of a homogeneous landmass that has the same requirements.

Northern Europe for example is one of the hardest places to emigrate to (together with US, I might add).

They should be the basics that we provide to one another in our society. Because that is the humane thing to do. Why is it wrong to think of other people? Would you really be that weak and ashamed if you needed some help through no fault of your own? What's wrong with a little bit of basic, elementary altruism?

It is all bullshit and completely unworkable.  Everyone?  So everyone on the planet?  There are 7 billion people right now.  In 40 years, there will be 10 billion.  You know how wealth is distributed now?  More than half is in the hands of 15% of the world's population.  Those people?  Americans, Canadians, Australians, and Europeans.  85% of the world is sharing less than half of the world's wealth.  How is that fair?

What ignorant people--no offense--fail to understand is that the world is not fair.  Nor can it be without them giving up a fuckload of shit.  The total world household net worth is $200 trillion.  That is less than $30k per person.  Even if adjusted to PPP, the west would have to dump a lot of its wealth into the rest of the world (mostly Asia and Africa).  What is in your retirement account right now?  Why do you deserve more than others?

libertarianism is the only system that can actually improve the lives of others.  Why?  Because it is largely stateless.  To me, nationality does not matter.

wambrita,"Sizing in comexim is straight up EU sizing. I think I got a pretty good grasp on how to do it.

Don't use their measuring guide for their band size, it's still the add cm standard and it will throw the fit off. Instead, get a 60 band, which is the equivalent to a 28 band. However for the bust part, use their guide, I would advise to measure in cm, but of course it's easy to convert inches to cm, I'm going out on a limb and assuming you'll want to use your leaning measurement, which is 101.6 cm. Looking at their sizing chart, you've unfortunately sized out of their bras in a 60 band; here's their [measuring chart](http://www.comexim.pl/content/6-sprawdz-rozmiar)... of course, if you prefer to use your other measurements you'll be able to fit into their range.

I have a Comexim bra coming to me from a gal from bratabase. I've been wearing cleo bras and they were great at first, but then 6 weeks after wearing them it's now horrible agony, especially since the gores are too wide and have actually started spreading the space between my breasts, I'm getting tissue migration from the gores being too wide and it HURTS SO BAD. Plus, the wires are a good 1/2 or so too wide; it's hard to say because the cups don't project enough, and they are squishing my breasts against my chest, which causes the tissue to distribute wider than what it really is like. I've been pregnant and breastfed all 3 of my kids for extended periods, so my breasts are somewhat pliable; although they have for sure firmed up since i started my ABTF journey 7 months ago, it's slowly starting to basically undo itself from wearing gores that are too wide/cups that are too shallow.

Basically the space between my breasts was as wide as my index finger, now it's slightly wider than my thumb.

[deleted],"Horrible things indeed, with still such potential for destruction, but I would put forth they have saved lives. Let me put this forward. A world with no nuclear weapons and how things play out from about 1945 on. 
PACIFIC THEATRE:
Allied forces are forces weakened after bloody island hopping campaigns across the pacific are forced to regroup and rearm prior to the invasion of the Japanese Mainland. Forces from the European theatre take months to redeploy after the defeat of the Germans. This gives Japan an opportunity to dig in for the long haul. A month long bombing campaign leaves 100,000's dead.  Allies invade via the sea and are met with suicidal resistance. Allied casualties numbers close to 1,000,000, while the Japanese suffer much more than that. The empire is reduced to a smoldering cinder that is reliant on economic aid for decades, and a populace is left with memories of western forces attacking and occupying their homes, possibly producing a radicalized faction similar to what we see in tennis east today. 

EUROPE:
The tensions between the Soviets and the US are high and the blockade of Berlin begins. without the specter of nuclear retaliation, the Soviets escalate an take West Berlin, forcing the US to engage in a war with the Soviets.  We lose, because we only have Spain and France and England while the soviets are able to move the Polish forces and mobilize the Checz's. This allows communist expansionism to run across Europe and into North Aftica and the Middle East. Without access to Arab Oil, the US economy begins to stagnate in the 60's and 70's. Korea and  Vietnam don't happen because western forces don't have the taste for getting into another losing war. Comminism occupies most of the Eastern Hemisphere. 

ISRAEL: 
Tensions between Egypt and Israel run hot but instead of the Israelis turning back the Egyptians, the Egyptian forces, heavily relying on Soviet Backing accomplish their goals and Israel is forced to give up a good portion of their territory. They develop no nuclear deterrent and are unable to maintain the security of their borders and are eventually over run by the Egyptians and the Syrians.

Yeah, nuclear weapons suck, but as a deterrent they have done an admirable job. ",0,t3_1fg36w,0,AskReddit,,,caa3cde,1370096034,False,,1430962444,False,True,t5_2qh1i,t1_caa3cde,t1_ca9xdyo,0,0,0,

Vaeldr,"No. And I'll tell you why. I really feel for people in Turkey and how their rights are being violated. 

First of all. Not we, nor Americans or anyone else should assume the role of international moral/military police. Turkey is not currently in the EU union so we as a union have no responsibility whatsoever towards the Turks and their government. We cannot be the judges of anything. Last time Europe and America(NATO) tried to bring human rights and all we screwed up an entire region(former Yugoslavian countries). They, much like the Turks, are perfectly capable of handling their own problems.

Yes Europe should condemn ant inhumane actions taken by the government.

If it came down to any kind of civil war I personally do not think Europe has anything to do with it. I have no desire to send our armies and soldiers to die for a cause that isn't ours.

&gt;Surely we can't let this go by.

cwenham,"&gt; Are you trying to use such extreme subjectivism to argue that your vision of the government is the best?

According to my position, what you just said is the most ironic thing possible to say.

&gt; I was pointing out the foundational issues of your position

Obviously not. Even if you didn't read the link, I still directly mentioned my support for unemployment benefits in my first post in this thread.

&gt; Researchers ask people, ""Taking all things together, would you say you are very happy, rather happy, not very happy or not at all happy?"" They record their answers and aggregate them across the board. So the people decide if they're happy or not.

 This is how the ""New Coke"" disaster happened: every taste-tester was telling Coke that its new formula tasted better.

 Same thing happened with coffee. People said they wanted 'a dark, rich, hearty roast' because it sounded good, but only a quarter of the people who said that actually buy that kind of coffee. The other 75% take it weak and milky.

 It is a thoroughly established fact of psychology that people will not tell you how they actually feel or what they actually want. Instead, they say what they think you want to hear. Here is proof:

http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/21/science/la-sci-sn-how-to-change-a-persons-ethical-beliefs-in-five-minutes-20120921

 People will also entrench themselves in a particular opinion simply by making a choice, regardless of how they came to that choice:

http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/our-preferences-change-to-reflect-the-choices-we-make-even-three-years-later.html

 So saying that people are happy ""across the board"" is not good enough. It's not about what they say, for the above two studies shows that people would rather be consistent with an earlier statement than be honest. It needs to be measured by what people ultimately _do_.

 Becoming complacent from the result of surveys has been the prelude to some of history's finest cock-ups.

&gt; This paper shows correlation between equality and happiness

 That's better, but it's still only saying that people don't like inequality and the recipients of equality-motivated welfare seem to like it. No shit. Stop the press. Next you'll be citing a paper showing that Londoners got a bit melancholy after the Luftwaffe destroyed their homes.

 Libertarianism is about equality-of-opportunity, not equality-of-outcome.

&gt; Newborn babies don't like or can eat chocolate, as I'm sure you know,

 It's from Moxy Fruvous, ""King of Spain"". As in ""Once I was the King of Spain, now I eat humble pie."" Its lyrics are essentially just a retelling of ""The Prince and the Pauper"", and boasting of improbable feats of governance. EG:

    I can't wait, I'm lowering interest rates, my people say:
    ""King, how are you such a genius?
    There's a roof overhead and food on our plates!""
    It's laisez-faire, I don't even give a care
    Let's make Friday part of the weekend
    And give every new baby a chocolate eclair
    Once I was the King of Spain (now I eat humble pie)

 The point of libertarianism is not that equality-of-outcome is undesirable, but that trying to force equality-of-outcome is even worse and unsustainable to boot, because it means taking wealth from the people who earn it and giving it to the people who can't, and it assumes a prowess with governance that is as rare and fleeting as the King of Spain.

 That's why I view welfare as a practical measure to eliminate conditions that turn normal people into criminals, and to invest in a workforce, but _not_ for the sake of manifesting equality directly. The idea is not to enact economic equality for all citizens, but to recognize a problem that affects all of us and enable the misfortunate to achieve as much as their own talents allow.
 
&gt; Most people also understand that when you're invoking bad long-term side effects that you claim will manifest themselves, the burden of proof is on you.

 France now has an 11% unemployment rate, but they and the Nordic countries are experiencing mass immigration, mostly middle-easteners, attracted by welfare benefits that are paid by a shrinking percentage of the population. Britain's NHS has been having chronic funding problems for decades, and services have been compromised as a result, mainly because of mismanagement and poor metrics for evaluating doctors and nurses enacted in vain attempts to stem the financial bleeding.

 France's welfare system has also managed to give itself a ""bulge in the pipe"":

http://www.thelocal.fr/20130328/with-states-help-crisis-hit-french-keep-making-babies

 And it's running out of money:

http://www.thelocal.fr/20130312/france-battling-in-vain-to-hit-eu-deficit-target

 Essentially, they put themselves into a deficit making food cheap and abundant for the poor, who promptly rewarded them with even more mouthes to feed. This is not very clever.

 Every new baby gets... uh... _formula_, and historians pinpoint this as the moment when it all started to go downhill.

 Because I'm not really in favor of letting babies starve, I think welfare should stop just shy of making adults so comfortable that they conceive more often. France's welfare benefits are very nice, _too_ nice.

 Norway seems like it's doing okay, but it also has vast North Sea oil reserves. Hopefully they can continue their welfare system after those wells dry up.",0,t3_1fdcie,1,changemyview,,78∆,caa4gd3,1370102282,1370103286,points ,1430961920,False,True,t5_2w2s8,t1_caa4gd3,t1_caa19b2,0,0,1,

Como já tinha dito antes sou Comunista e revejo-me bastante no PCP e até no BE. No entanto não estou a 100% alinhado com ambos os partidos, discordo de muita coisa.


Não acho que faça sentido o PCP mudar. Ao contrário da retórica dos médias e dos comentadores aqui no reddit, que regularmente confundem Stalinismo/Maoismo com Comunismo, o PCP nem é um partido muito extremista. 


De facto tudo o que o PCP faz é defender melhores condições para os trabalhares, melhor segurança social, educação ect. Isto é o papel de um Partido Socialista ou mesmo Social Democrata.


Vivemos no momento uma viragem muito grande à direita onde qualquer voz que divirja é logo radicalizada como Comunista, um discurso muito comum onde qualquer forma de expressão de descontentamento é automaticamente rotulada com ""extrema-esquerda-radical"", e daí o apelidamento do PCP e mesmo BE como ""lunatic-fringe-radicais-comunas"".


(Basta consultar a história do pós-25 de Abril para ver que o PCP teve muitas vezes hipóteses de tentar posições de extrema-esquerda e nunca o fez, mesmo contra a opinião de muitos dos seus 'ilustres' militantes, como por exemplo Saramago que via pegar em armas como uma hipótese.)


Para finalizar, até porque isto é conversa que cai em saco-roto, o PCP e o BE são os partidos mais próximos das soluções que acredito viáveis. 


Se ambos mudarem de forma a que deixem de merecer o meu voto passo a votar em branco. Tal como eu digo isto grande parto do eleitorado destes partidos diz o mesmo e esses dois partidos rapidamente desapareceriam.

sunthas,"&gt; You say that minimum wage is the cause. Why were people being exploited before minimum wages existed?

I didn't say that minimum wage caused exploitation, I said it caused higher unemployment and made it harder for poor to climb the ladder. As I said if you are okay with this higher unemployment because of minimum wage maybe you can use that as justification, but I think its wrong to limit people in that way. 

&gt; That is clearly false. You can't choose not to work.

People can always choose not to work, you compare your options and choose what you want to do, as wages rise more of each family will be willing to give up their time to work, as wages fall less time is given up to work. The question of how to survive in a materialistic society if you choose to live alone and not work is a tough one to answer. 

&gt; No, I don't prevent anyone from working. Minimum wages don't cause unemployment. This reasoning has been repeatedly shown false by empirical observations.

this isn't a false assumption at the bottom rung, it might not have much of an impact but if Joe's only worth $3/hr because he has no skills or experience and minimum wage is $7.25/hr then he will not get hired. If his work is worth $9/hr then he gets hired regardless of minimum wage, but perhaps minimum wage means he gets $7.25/hr instead of the market rate of $6/hr. The difference however isn't exploitation its trade. 

&gt;  It relies on a false assumption that employers always pay the workers as much as they can afford, rather than how much they have to.

I don't know why anyone would assume that employers pay the workers more than they have to in order to get the worker to take the job. If Joe will work for $6/hr and the employer values that work at more than $6/hr then Joe gets the job. If 10 other people will do it for $5/hr then perhaps Joe doesn't get the job, the employer would rather pay $5/hr of course.

&gt; Minimum wages are often so low that they have no practical effect, yet unemployment remains. Countries with high minimum wages don't suffer unusually high unemployment. Spain, which has very low minimum wages suffers the highest unemployment in Europe.

You are correct, I was collecting unemployment for several years during this recession and minimum wages laws had no impact on me, you are correct that they likely often have no practical effect. Due to my skills, experience, and ego, I was unwilling to work for wages anywhere near unemployment. 

I'm not trying to solve unemployment by eliminating minimum wage I'm trying to reduce poverty. ",0,t3_1fdcie,1,changemyview,,1∆,caa4i7b,1370102476,False,points ,1430961895,False,True,t5_2w2s8,t1_caa4i7b,t1_caa0jbw,0,0,1,

amaefm,"I feel like a lot of people here must have been quite young on 9/11, or are just different than me.  To many of us Osama was the representation of a decade of our country going in the wrong direction.  He was the head of a dragon that changed America for the worse.  

9/11 was one of the most successful military attacks in history.  It crippled the most powerful nation on Earth and ended an era of what felt like relative peace.  Yes we had some actions in eastern Europe in the 90's but after the first gulf war we had peace, I grew up in that time and graduated in 2001.  I watched our country change and become more and more extreme.  I think some of us foolishly thought with the death of Bin Laden and Obama as president we might be able to back off and go back to the way we had been.  Iraq was ending, Afghanistan looked like it might too and we didn't know so much about what was going on with the Drones yet, at least I didn't.  

Bin Laden was the guy who did that, he did that to us.  A lot of people just redirected their anger to every brown person we were blowing up in Iraq and Afghanistan but those people were completely unrelated to 9/11 as soon as the Taliban government was removed.  I think that was wrong and I don't agree with the way people acted like this was some sort of present day crusade like religious war.  One man's insurgent is another mans freedom fighter but Bin Laden?  Nope that was pretty cut and dry that he's a fucker, he kills innocents as his intended target.  He warped our nation and twisted the American mythos.  America tortures now.  We have been in a state of emergency since 9/11.  

I foolishly thought maybe with the death of Bin Laden some of that might change.  I wouldn't say I was elated, I didn't party in the street or anywhere for that matter.  I may have raised a beer for the guys who got him.  What I did feel was shock and relief. It was a holy shit moment, one that I remember as I remember 9/11. There was almost a sense of closure.  10 years of going in the wrong direction. At least we got the guy who did that to us.  

I wasn't happy that a man lost his life, I wasn't celebrating death, but I think it's okay to feel good when a guy like Bin Laden died.  I can guarantee there were some soldiers partying when they found out Hitler was dead.  Not to say Bin Laden is equal to Hitler, just making a point.  I can imagine a lot of reasons it might seem weird to party or feel good when Bin Laden died, but I hope maybe you can see why some people felt the way they did.  

Also, there were probably a bunch of ignorant ass motherfucker right-wing douchebags out there partying too.  I'm just saying not all of us who were glad when we heard the news Bin Laden was dead were xenophobic racist crusaders.

Quarktasche,"And who do you think they bailed out with that money? [This IMF report](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr10366.pdf) says that german financial institutions had 113 billion euro invested in the Irish banking sector, as well as british banks with 107 billion euro and US banks with 47 billion euro.

Now, for example the Anglo Irish Bank received 30 billion euro from the bailout, and had to pay all creditors, among them [32 financial institutions](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/staatsgeheimnis-bankenrettung-profiteure-von-irlands-bankenrettung/7826408.html) from Germany and France alone.

That's the reason there was such immense political pressure on Ireland to take the money and not let their banks default. All of those investments would have been written off, triggering even bigger losses in the european financial sector. However, that bailout came at a huge price, as I already said in my first post, drastic cuts to public spending and increases in tax rates for ""normal, working-class"" people. Ireland basically gave up their ability to form their own fiscal policy in exchange for a bailout package which certainly didn't bail out the irish people, but the european banking sector.

Ireland, who makes up 0.9% of the population of europe, paid 42% of the total cost of the european banking crises up until 2011. [But don't take my word for it, here's a nice rundown of the numbers.](http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/banking-crisis-bill-ireland-755464-Jan2013/)

CameraEye,"&gt;With consensus people get all the facts, hear from all the parties affected, come to an agreement with the least harm.

Let's look at what happened after WWI. Much to the dismay of the United States, the French and British people wanted Germany to pay harsh reparations that went well beyond the damage caused by Germany during the war. In practice, it doesn't matter what the minority wants. The French and the British knew that they have lost sons/brothers/neighbors/etc during the war, and that they needed to be recompensed for that. German aggression allowed for a trite conflict in the Balkans (which would have had a localized war between Austria and Russia over Serbian sovereignty if Germany had not given austria a ""blank check"" for military aid) to shed millions of lives and ruin several economies. The French and British people knew that the harsh reparations would weaken Germany and make them dependent on the allied powers, which was considered a good thing so that another war in Europe would not happen. At the time, it seemed like a great argument that it's in **Germany's own good** to be indebted to the allies in order to curb Germany's foolhearted aggression.  However, it was impossible to tell at that time period that this would only fuel the rising facist movements. 

You might be able to say that my historical example doesn't represent a true and idealistic democracy. True, but it shows how democracies end up working in practice. Let's look at these events from their perspective, not our modern perspective where we already know what will happen.  After WWI, we heard the woes of Germany, France, the UK, US, and several smaller nations. You think that the harsh reparations will prevent another war, not fuel warmongering fascist movements. **At the time, the actions of the allied powers post WWI seemed like the only logical course of actions.** People scoffed at Woodrow Wilson for refusing to shoot Germany while they were down so that they couldn't rise up again (which they ended up rising again anyways, but you aren't a clairvoyant that can see the future). Assuming that we discard our knowledge of Europe post 1920, I have fulfilled your requirements of hearing ""from all the parties affected,""  and coming ""to an agreement with the least harm."" And after facing the damage of the war, you would be crazy to call Germany as one of the ""respectful/ed outliers."" This is why systems of institutionalized coercion (including democracy) does not work. 

&gt;Of course it doesn't work with manipulated paranoid mis/uneducated people.

When you give these same people an outlet for legitimized coercion, bad things are going to happen. Anarcho-communist thought stems from this idea of a truly culturally homogeneous society, which won't ever happen due to human nature's tenancy to form into cliques. 
&gt;And that's only one other type of democracy.

All types of Democracy revolve around the thought that people deserve equal say in their government, either through direct or representative means. When the hivemind gangs up against the minority, you have the Tyranny of the Majority. 

&gt;The important thing is to use a method where everyone feels heard and respected.

So in other words, something similar to the Non-Agression Principle, which is the exact opposite of Marxist thought or the actual definition of democracy? 


&gt;The problem with the people who say that, they can't keep their big fat noses from trampling someone else's rights. 

Thankfully the person saying this isn't a Republican (or Democrat, for that matter) Corporatist who wants a heavy handed and interventionist government that'll enable this behavior.

However I do second the idea of making the time of next podcast and info more visible to people who are not using twitter or facebook, since every even slight chance in schedule can be devastating to people who are working or have to sleep (depending on timezone) ;)

I like the hosts, all three of them have something meaningful to say and bring in an interesting perspective (even Dodger, when she decides to speak up).

The guests, this is the problem. Bringing the familiar guests seems like a good idea at the first glance, but I don't think it's the right direction. It doesn't give enough visibility to all the people from TGS Network and that's what I like. Of course encouraging guests to be more vocal before the show would be a good idea (I believe TradeChat wasn't liked because of constant derails, not because of the talking per se, to give one example...)",0,t3_1fgteh,2,Cynicalbrit,,,caa58gl,1370105163,False,,1430961578,False,True,t5_2tqbt,t1_caa58gl,t3_1fgteh,0,0,2,

KingDaveRa,"My current setup is something I'm fairly happy with. So, here's what I've got:

* TV: Panasonic Viera [TX-L32G10B](http://www.trustedreviews.com/Panasonic-Viera-TX-L32G10B---32in-Freesat-LCD-TV_TV_review). 32-inch TV, with Freesat HD, Freeview, and a few bits of internet functionality. 1080p resolution, and a really nice picture
* DVR: VirginMedia [TiVo](http://store.virginmedia.com/discover/tv/tivo.html). 500Gb model. Best PVR I've ever had (better than Sky+HD)
* AV Receiver: Denon [AVR1910](http://www.denon.co.uk/uk/product/pages/Product-Detail.aspx?CatId=hometheatre&amp;SubId=avreceivers&amp;ProductId=AVR1910). It got some really [good reviews](http://www.whathifi.com/Review/Denon-AVR-1910/) when released, and with good reason. It's been a VERY good piece of kit to me, provides excellent sound, and the HDMI switching works well.
* Bluray: Panasonic [BDT-110](http://www.panasonic.co.uk/html/en_GB/Products/DMP-BDT110/Specification/7047861/index.html). This too got some [excellent reviews](http://www.whathifi.com/review/panasonic-dmp-bdt110). It has been a little fickle with some disks, but on the whole, works very well.
* Pioneer [DV-696AV](http://www.pioneer.eu/eur/products/archive/DV-696AV-S/page.html) DVD player. Region free. Don't use it often, and it's pretty old now, but it upscales quite nicely to 1080i. 
* HTPC: Custom built, AMD-based A50M [Gigabyte GA-E350N-USB3](http://uk.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3681#ov) motherboard, 4GB RAM, and an [Asus nVidia Geforce GT220](http://www.asus.com/Graphics_Cards/ENGT220DI1GD2LP/) PCI-E graphics card. The case is an old ATX case I managed to pick up. There's a 250Gb (I think!) Hitachi Deathstar in it to boot. It runs on a slightly custom build of OpenElec, which gives me Spotify integration too.
* Speakers: [Q Acoustics](http://www.qacoustics.co.uk/q-acoustics-2000i-series-5.1-cinema-pack.htm#2010i). They are, 2010 rear pair, 2020 front pair, 2070 sub, and 2000c centre. The front pair are bi-amped. Cable was some 322-strand stuff I picked up from eBay. It seems pretty good, and has provided me with excellent audio quality.
* Projector screen: Panoview, 80 Inch 16:9. Pretty basic, but it does the job.
* Projector: [Panasonic PT-AX200E](http://www.panasonic.co.uk/html/en_GB/Products/LCD+Projector/Home+Cinema+LCD/PT-AX200E/PT-AX200E/Overview/588787/index.html). Again, [yet more great reviews](http://www.whathifi.com/Review/Panasonic-PT-AX200E/). Getting a bit old now, and only capable of 1080i at most; it's on the end of a 15 metre HDMI lead. If I put 1080p down it it will randomly blank the screen, so it'll take it and looks fine, just a bit of noise creeps into the cable (no surprise). Hey, the cable was from eBay, and wasn't that pricey, so I ain't complaining! It'll run 720p perfectly well.
* Sundries: A no-name 2x4 HDMI switch which splits the output of the amp to the TV and projector, plus another 1x4 switch which has the XBox, PS3 and DVD player on it (ran out of inputs!)",0,t3_1fgx9t,1,hometheater,,,caa5gcm,1370105922,False,,1430961454,False,True,t5_2rof6,t1_caa5gcm,t3_1fgx9t,0,0,1,

Stingerc,"Tristemente una de las figuras trágicas de la historia Mexicana.  Fue traído a México por conservadores que derrocaron a Benito Juárez.  El no quería el trono, pero eventualmente lo acepto cuando lo convencieron que la gente de México clamaba por el.  

Al llegar a México se enamoró de nuestro país.  Desgraciadamente resulto de que Maximiliano era progresista y liberal lo que causo gran conflicto con los conservadores.   Hasta trato de restituir a Juárez, pero este lo rechazo.  Maximiliano no entendía por que por que el seguía convencido de que su pueblo lo quería y lo habían llamado para servir como su emperador.  

Este amor por México fue la razón por que no abandono el país cuando se tornó la marea y los conservadores y sus aliados Franceses se retiraron.  El creía que podía a llegar a un acuerdo con Juárez para formar un gobierno.  El solo quería seguir siendo emperador para ser el protector del pueblo.  Juárez nunca acepto por que lo veía como un símbolo de la usurpación Francesa.  

Al ver que no había manera de convencer a Juárez, mando a su esposa Carlotta a Europa para buscar aliados.  Su Hermano, Franz Jozef, el emperador de imperio Austro Húngaro se negó ya que el nunca estuvo de acuerdo que Maximiliano fuera a México.  el siempre estuvo seguro de que todo esto era una farsa y que Maximiliano era solo un títere de los Franceses y los conservadores Mexicanos que se aprovechaban del idealismo y buena fe de su hermano.   Carlotta después trató de convencer a su hermano, Leopoldo II de Bélgica, pero antes de que pudieran ayudar Maximiliano fue traicionado, capturado y ejecutado.  

Al oír la noticia Carlotta enloqueció y Franz Jozef lo lamento mucho, por que pensaba que su hermano regresaría un hombre vencido, no un cadáver.  Tristemente la muerte de Maximiliano tuvo ramificaciones importantes para la historia Europea.  Con su muerte el imperio Austro Húngaro perdió el segundo en línea para heredar el trono.  Algunos años después el único hijo de Franz Jozef se suicidó cuando su padre le negó permiso de casarse con la mujer que amaba.  Esto dejo al sobrino de Franz Jozef, Franz Ferdinad, como único heredero al trono.   Franz Ferdinad fue asesinado por el anarquista Croato Gavrilo Princip en Sarajevo, evento que deja al impero Austro Húngaro sin heredero y que detona el principio de la Primera Guerra Mundial.

swanky_pants,"I got a road bike for this reason. I travel to work every day, then on wknd do couple of hours ride. Not sure where you are in the world, but if your somewhere without a lot of pot holes (unlike England), then a roadbike would be good. Thinner tyres mean less traction = speed. If you are going to be carrying things on your back, you may want to consider getting one that has the right fittings for a rack mount (to attach bags to your bike) and usually I at least carry a couple of spare inner tubes for flats and a couple of tools, which you can attach to your bile via small saddle bags etc.

You may want to check out the bicycle touring sub (on my phone now and the sub name escapes me) if you are thinking of touring. R/bicycle has lots of resources on the right hand side about bike types etc.

Search Sheldon Brown for bike maintenance and YouTube. You can learn most of the things you will need to know this way. 

For 400 euro, you could get an entry level road bike (thin tyres, drop ""curled"" handle bars).

sultanofsanaa,"I'm going to answer this in summary. 

1. Where to start? Debt, government corruption stemming from corporate power, unhealthy foods full of preservatives and transfats and other gross things, a failing prison system, but I think the biggest issue of all is that too many Americans simply don't care. So long as they have a roof over their heads and water running, it's fine. Few care to change things unless it directly correlates to them. And there are so many armchair activists. But moreover, more of them will fight for gay marriage than against American imperialism. I hate the weird idea that America's the greatest country in the world. 

2. We put too much faith in what grades kids make. We determine their worth by test grades without realizing that not every kid learns the same. It seems that a lot of it is them cramming knowledge in our heads to get through the year, but I can't say that (considering all the years of schooling I've undergone) I've learned as much as one should. I know so many idiots with good grades. They just study really hard and have great work ethic. But they don't actually know a lot. Many of them lack common sense. Then I know kids that are absolute genius but don't do well on tests or are smart enough to see what subjects pertain to them. I think that teaching all four core subjects is a waste. At an early age, they should take what the kid is good at and put them there. If my grades were based off of English, Social Studies, and Math classes, I'd have an amazing GPA, but you throw science in there and I've got a 3.4. Obviously, I won't go into a science field, so why am I taking the class when all it does is make it more difficult for me to get into a good college? My English teacher once said, ""Not once have I used the pythagorean theorem. Likewise, I wouldn't decide not to hire a great physicist because he wasn't great at Economics."" Moreover, it feels as though colleges are more businesses than places of education. And student loans are killing so many people. 

3. So many things are frowned upon. Doing something different. But not a little different. Americans like that. I mean *way* different. Gap years, deciding not to go to college, aspiring to become a famous musician, deciding to spend life backpacking around Europe. It feels like everyone wants you to work a 9-5 while your wife stays home to raise your two kids. Then there are those edgy folk who break the norm in little ways.

BeondTheGrave,"Here is the best answer you can ever get, as to the superiority of the musket over the bow (and why everybody abandoned the bow). 

Think about the operation of a Musket, you put some powder under the Frizzen, you put the rest in the barrel with the ball. Ram it home, point in the general direction of the enemy (who cares about aiming, you wont hit it anyway) and squeeze when told to. It gets even easier, because the martial drills are so regimented that you just listen and the officer will tell you what to do. I could get you to 2-3 RPM with maybe an hour of practice.

This means that you can literally take anybody, shipwrights, potters, farmers, merchants, kings, knights, anybody, give them a musket and they can deliver a powerful, usually lethal, attack. For Napoleon, the *Levee en Masse* enabled him to recruit armies whose size hadnt been seen in Europe in hundreds of years. Without an easy to fire, simple to train, weapon, the manpower the Napoleon needed would have been difficult, if impossible, to acquire. Even the pre-Napoleonic, professional armies of long duration service was filled not by elite (expensive) soldiers, but by the dregs of society. By men who had nothing better to look forward to than spending 20 or more years serving for King and Country. 

Lets not look at the Archer, who uses a more complicated skill. Archers use far more technique, physical strength, and physical endurance to work their weapons. While Im certainly no expert archer, Ive fired enough arrows to know that it takes some practice and strength training to fire an arrow. But to do so with any serious range or accuracy, it would take a singular dedication to the skill. In medieval times archery was a lifetime pursuit, event the basic peasant hunter had to practice and hone their art. And those men were not even up to a military levels of prowess. 

In order to field archers of any sort of quality, in terms of both accuracy and RoF, you need to allow them to train and practice even in times of peace. This is not a force that can be just spontaneously created, people who dont use this skill are not effective at it. A shipwright does not have the skill required to also be an excellent archer. 

So on the one hand we have a weapon which is quite potent in massed fire, but also can be fired by literally anyone. A Peasant was just as good at killing a king as any well trained, professional, soldier. On the other hand, the bow was a weapon which required great skill and practice to use it effectively. This limited the potential manpower pool to only those who were professionals, or who used this skill in everyday life. Otherwise, the common peasant would have to be trained to even reach a basic proficiency with the weapon.

But that being said, I would much rather have the EU games and I wish they could make the two a bit more similar. If NA gets more indies games then put more on EU and the same with EU's AAA games.

MindTheGAAP,"What I'm about to write is entirely my POV and therefore take as much or as little as you please. I moved to the US from England at 18 as I felt like it held the opportunity to have a *much* better life here than back in the UK. So far, at 25, I'm very satisfied with my decision and believe that, at least in the first 7 years, I was correct.

In England, we do offer subsidized education to those with citizenship within the EU. **However**, those students from America that choose to come over get charged an arm and a leg to help pay for the subsidies they provide to others. As an American, it is likely that you would pay 4-6x what I would for the same degree. In addition to this, the cost of living in England is exorbitant in comparison with the US (most areas). 

While I understand your view of paying for universal healthcare and not for military funds, you need to realize it isn't a 1-for-1 decision you're making. Sales Tax (VAT) in England is 20% on all products you buy. That's much higher than what you would be paying anywhere in America. What I'm trying to get at is that you would be paying much more tax in order to provide yourself with the safety net you seem to be looking for. Same goes for the vacation time there. My parents get significantly more time off than me but they have much more limited say in certain aspects of their lives due to the government restrictions and/or tax burden. 

Some people in England are quite happy about this but it gives the individual far more freedom to make their own path in life/ decisions. Additionally, the cost of living there is higher and so your remaining disposable income will go nowhere near as far. Example - McDonalds value meal - America (Dallas, TX) $6 vs. England - $12 (outside of London). Fuel (Dallas, TX) $3.50/gal vs. England - $11/gal. This would increase your cost as a student (often overlooked when comparing solely tuition between two places).

Again, I'm only comparing my own personal experiences in each country. I tried to hit on some of the points that maybe some of the other responses (such as u/Wolfpackguy) hadn't hit specifically. He's exactly right about a lack of opportunity and high unemployment rates as the large government model seems to be unraveling (see Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy). Many have also said that emigrating (legally) to the UK is harder than coming to the US and I can vouch for the complexity of making it Stateside.

durki2005,"Shakey_J_Fox is correct.  I am active duty Air Force, was stationed in Germany for 7 years, PCSd 6 months ago to UK, and I am a Motorcycle Safety rep in UK.  You should have your motorcycle endorsement on your drivers license before you get there, that makes it easier. When you are stationed in europe your MSF card is valid for three years from the date of issue.  If you have that along with your stateside, when you get your USAREUR license (which is basically $10) you will be able to add your motorcycle credentials to your USAREUR.  

If you haven't taken your MSF course, the MSF course is offered at Spangdahlem for sure, and likely Ramstein, which is like 10 minutes from landstuhl.   If you don't have your M endorsement on your stateside drivers license, you might be able to use this course and work with your stateside DMV to get your license sent to you.   If you work for the Air Force, I can give you the most accurate information. 

The Air Force requires you to use an ECE 22.05 approved helmet, while I believe the Army doesn't care if you use DOT or ECE 22.05.  All of the Icon helmets sold on base have the ""universal"" certification.  If you don't want one of those helmets I believe you may be able to contact the manufacturer of your helmet to find out if it is in compliance with ECE 22.05.  

Don't worry about any of the German licensing, it is very expensive and redundant to your current training/experience.  Have you talked to your sponser yet, ask them to get you in contact with a person who rides motorcycles.  You can also contact me if you wish to know about the regulations.

UrbanVermin,"I'm not confident enough to call my self an expert on Romania, but I'd argue that not all of the USSR allies behaved similarly enough in Europe. Each Eastern Bloc country had it's own personality and way of handling things, the main string of similarity is that the USSR would of course influence the politics and could pressure other socialist countries to act in the interest of preventing ""the development of some socialist country towards capitalism"" (This is from the Brezhnev Doctrine, which II only know a little bit about). This, to my knowledge wan't rigidly binding, as Romania didn't participate in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 68'. This in turn greatly helped Ceaușescu when in power, it gave intellectuals hope that Romania could have a reformed socialism. Unfortunately this happened only in that it produced a more totalitarian Romania.

trolls_brigade is right in the similarities of Romania and North Korea, the leader of Romania, Ceaușescu was good friends with Kim Il-Sung. It was in fact after a visit to North Korea in 71' that led to his ""July theses"" where he began to establish this ludicrous cult of personality. However, one side note I'd like to say, from what I've read on North Korea, the situation since the famine in the 1990's, and extremely poor medical care made North Korea much more horrendous, and With Kim Jung-ll's 09' revaluation of currency, things have gotten much worse then Pre-89 Romania, and that's saying quite a lot.

But comparing this to the rest of the Warsaw pact doesn't seem right to me, aside from maybe Zhivkov's Bulgaria. I'm not trying to appear apologetic to other nations who were caught in the stranglehold of neo-Stalinists, but somewhere like Poland, Czechoslovakia or East Germany don't quite fit to me. Partially because the other countries never tried to do this in such a North Korean, ""Dear Leader"", ""my wife was a scientist guys, trust me"" sort of way. And because the Securitate of Romania (one of the largest in the Warsaw Pact), was possibly the most brutal of all the Eastern Bloc.

Also, it's no longer totally accurate to say that the ECHR and the EU are separate since the Lisbon Treaty. Art 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union says that the EU accedes to the ECHR and 6(3) says that human rights, as found in the ECHR, now constitute general principles of EU law.

WobbleWagon,"If they were asked any of those questions they'd knock it out of the park.

ECHR?  Yes, the UK should be able to deport people who actively campaign to have British people killed/terrorised.  Anything positive in the ECHR could always be put into a second UK Bill of Rights.  Refugees?  We certainly have some commitment but the UK is in the NorthWestern corner of Europe.  They're a refugee when they first appear in a European country where they're not at risk.  Most have to travel through a lot of countries before remembering to claim refugee status.

&gt;*Or, real questions about their want to dissolve the Ministry of Defence and completely reform it and add to our military strength when most people really don't like our interventionist policies.*

The Ministry of Defence is ridiculously heavy on civil servants, and runs costly procurement.  The civil service needs to be gutted - and UKIP was and is opposed to interventionist policies.  It was against occupation of Iraq, Afghanistan, intervention in Mali or Libya.  It is against intervention in Syria.  If most people don't like interventionist policies you should love them.

Consecutive governments have been pro-intervention but sent troops out without the proper equipment.  UKIP's policy is the reverse.  Make sure they do have the right equipment by taking spending back to early 90s levels, but to not get involved in interventionism that doesn't concern the UK.

&gt;*Also, an attempt by Farage to seriously defend his parties disagreement that climate change exists[1] would be nothing other than cringe worthy.*

UKIP advocates putting it, the strategies eployed, the energy policy, the effects to change, to an independent Royal Commission.  To put the Green strategy in the dock.  If Green subsidies are not achieving results, if they are making energy more expensive, if they're not changing the environment - then you can have all the windfarms you want.  The government just won't be subsidising them.

Ask UKIP about the environment and it won't be long before they're talking about cheaper energy bills and lowering emissions by using nuclear.   If you go to page 15 of the pdf you linked you'll see they have some very clear simple points that will be a simple sell.  Lower fuel bills and real austerity savings without cutting into people's pockets are compelling.

Ask them that question and they'll point out that lobbyists and politicians have set a green agenda but science has been addressed as to whether the 'solution' really is one or not, or whether the UK can actually make any real changes.  That they'll take this assumption and political agenda and put it under scientific trial through a Royal Commission.

&gt;*An opportunity to actually question UKIP on their policies would be excellent, because most people don't know how stupid they are.*

If that was the case then don't you think David Cameron would have done it by now?

The Mexican-American war I would say both parties involved share a fairly equal portion of blame.

The Mexicans actually started the war after breaking the Treaties of Velasco by attacking a group of American soldiers.

The Spanish American war was a dumb war, but once again one where both parties can take equal blame.

Retardditard,"Minority? Don't we all wish! It's closer to 46% that believe in creationism, around 51% evolution.

American science education is fucking terrible and lots of Americans are tools, for instance: [this ~~discriminated against~~ douche bag dentist.](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/40258_Stephen_Colbert_Interviews_Texas_School_Board_Creationist_Don_McLeroy)

I wouldn't call our pop culture secular. That seems like a real bastardization of the term.

Plus there is the political particularism, which helps establish corrosive pluralisms. It abhors the common good for superficial tolerance with simultaneous *deeply held* intolerance and unrelenting acceptance that opinions are on the same level with facts, as long as they're 'my god told me so opinions'.

68% of U.S. adults are ""unaffiliated theists"", probably the worst kind of theist - OH, There's ample evidence! - total fucking hypocrites that think they are entitled to personal truths, regardless of the inherent scientific truth or lack there of and regardless of any 'Good Book', apparently. While just 16.4% claim no faith according to the study entitled *The Global Religious Landscape* issued by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.

More Examples:

1. [Teach the controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy)
2. [levels of support for evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution)
3. Creationists have claimed that they represent the interests of true Christians, and evolution is only associated with atheism. (same link as #2)
4. Atheism is a more damning pejorative term in America than nigger or other racial slurs, as over 50% of Americans are racists -- nearly 80% of republicans but still 32% of democrats -- too damn high! **Way too damn high!** In a poll about different types of people running for president, potential atheist support just recently managed to get over 50%(54%) ""yes"" responses, still lower than most others categories, regardless religion(except Muslim) of race, gender, or sexual preference(averaging around 90%). -various and numerous reputable websites
5. Among those who know someone on welfare, 69 percent think America’s bigger problem is that too many people on welfare should not be receiving it. Among those who know someone on welfare who could be working instead, the number who believes that to be true jumps to 86 percent. -- Teachings of Jesus my ass. This is not a **Christ**ian nation.

And even if most of us agree on things like Universal Health Care, it's not going to happen. Not in the land of hypocrites.

Dude, no one discriminates against Christians, unless they're the President or, you know, not white. Then they claim, ""he's a sand nigger from Kenya and his Hawaii birth certificate is fake, and that someone needs to shoot that nigger before he destroys America -optional but likely- cuz Fox news told me so!"" Seriously... it seems like I hear this shit daily -- FROM 'CHRISTIANS'! It's fucking disgusting, often seem irreconcilably reprehensible, and makes me embarrassed to be associated as a 'fellow American' to such anathemas.

&gt;A culture is largely defined by the entertainment it produces for its citizens

Yea, especially the ones that no longer exist. Here I was worrying about how we invade sovereign nations based on blatant lies and falsehoods, murdering countless innocent people, razing their homes and villages, torturing their citizens, and raping their women and children along with everything a Christian would and should fight AGAINST -- not FOR.

Glad to know you're really only concerned about who the fuck won American Idol, how many homosexuals are on Glee, and how big Lady Gaga's wang is -- I don't give a fuck about such things.

[This **ain't** The Onion.](http://www.intoleranceagainstchristians.eu/)

I'll let Austin Cline conclude this rant:

&gt;Clearly, majority Christians are getting a lot of mileage out their claims of discrimination. So it’s time to ask some blunt questions. Are majority Christians being discriminated against? No. Are they being treated unfairly? No. Is anyone trying to take their rights away from them? No. But are majority Christians the targets of a reform movement that seeks to take privileges away from them? Emphatically, yes. Many of those privileges are illicit, and their removal will help to bring about a more just and equitable society.

abd897,"In the 2011 general elections the AKP resoundingly beat it's main rival the CHP 49.83% to 25.98%. No amount of vote rigging could cause a gap in the vote count by 25%. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_general_election,_2011#Results 

I think the main thing people are forgetting to grasp is that although Turkey is a secular, western oriented state, a huge segment of it's population that is fairly conservative which the AKP strategically tries to appeal to.

The CHP does well in the large urban coastal areas of Turkey that are typically more cosmopolitan and Europe leaning (Thrace, Izmir, Aegean coastal cities like Antalya and Bodrum).
However the AK Party strategically goes after the populous Anatolian heartland that has often felt neglected and marginalized from CHP governments that kept economic growth and the trappings of powers in the costal urban centres and Istanbul. 

The AKP tried a dual approach of catering to the heartlands conservative sensibilities while bringing about economic growth to the major cities in Anatolia which caused a huge transformation to the point that the cities are called the Anatolian tigers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_Tigers_). This two pronged approach pretty much brought about their fervent loyalty to the AKP.

debman3,"&gt; The problem is this isn't an intelligent debate.

GMOs is something relatively new that still isn't allowed in many countries. I don't see how this isn't an intelligent debate. Actually talking here has made me learn a lot about the topic.

&gt;  Basic biology says they aren't dangerous.

I'm not versed in Biology but I know that some change in the human gene has drastic effects that are still not understood most of the time. That's why, from a scientific point of view, we shouldn't just allow it without testing it intensively (as it's done in Europe). We're eating the thing every day god damn it!

All in all I do think people tend to be over emotional about it and don't really think about the benefits when talking about the potential danger. I'm not religious, I know homeopathy doesn't work, but I'm still worried about GMOs. Mostly because where I live (France) it has a very bad image.

It doesn't mean that it is in fact dangerous. It just means that I'm worried, by peer pressure, and I believe there's nothing wrong with that. I'd rather spend time reading through comments here of people who rationalize that fear and explain to me how GMO is not a danger than people insulting me (or my country in some comments).",0,t3_1fguep,-1,news,,,caa87xh,1370115465,False,,1430960070,False,True,t5_2qh3l,t1_caa87xh,t1_caa8025,0,0,-1,
Goofius,"&gt;You're assuming the Nords invaded and claimed the land, much like the Europeans and America. 

What if I told you... Europe and America have nothing to do with it.

&gt;As far as land claims go, the Nords really do have the oldest claim to Skyrim - This was (supposedly) where Shor first put the Nords, before taking them to Atmora for safekeeping. 

&gt;It was during this interim that the Falmer claimed Skyrim, actually.

&gt;The Chimer/Dunmer in Morrowind are the same way - They have a legitimate claim to the land, because that is where that race was *made*. 

What if I told you... Where someone was born/made entitles them to nothing. Assuming the bit about Shor prior to Atmora is true. I said as much in my first comment.

Sorry I like the Morpheus meme.

&gt;You can't place Modern RL values on a fictional land, because the history behind them are different. Was it pretty hypocritical for the Europeans to colonize America, proclaiming the ""inalienable Rights of Man"" and massacre the Indians? absolutely. But you're presuming that the Nords were the colonizers, not the colonized.

As I said, I assign no special privilege or consideration to any party based on their status as coloniser or colonised.

Not sure where you're going with the bit about ""modern RL values."" Are you saying we can't think critically if we live in Tamriel? 

&gt;Now, certainly this doesn't excuse atrocities, such as the brutal slavery the Dunmer put the Argonians in, or the backlash of the Hist invasion of Morrowind, but ""Skyrim is for the Nords!"" is not racist in the way you assume.

""&lt;Land X&gt; is for the &lt;race Y&gt;!"" is totally racist. Now if it were ""&lt;Land X&gt; is for the &lt;inhabitants of land X&gt;!"" then that might be a different story (although still questionably xenophobic.)

At any rate, I was using ""Skyrim is for the Nords!"" as a summary and caricature of the stormcloaks; not a standalone indictment. If you want to see their racist attitudes, go talk to various NPCs, listen to their conversations, and read their histories. Also try playing a few different species and see how things change.

rising_moon,"I'm sure an Irish climber could tell you more than me, but I did a couple of weeks of climbing in Ireland last summer. If you're looking to do some sport, Ireland is not the place to do it (as other people have said about Scotland and England). It is almost all trad, but if you don't want to do trad, there are plenty of opportunities to set a top rope (of course, no bolted anchors so you will still have to use trad gear and/or slings for the anchors). I had never done trad before I went, but I went with a friend who had done a little bit. We were very slow on the wall and took up way too much gear, but it was a good learning experience for both of us.

If you're dead set on climbing in Ireland, our favorite places to climb were Hollywood in County Wicklow (though the wall there has a ""no climbing"" sign posted, so do this at your own risk), but the best as Ailladie in County Clare. Ailladie has a very broad range of routes from HS (5.6) to a couple of E7's (5.13a). You can easily set a top rope on almost any route if you are not as sure about trad. Ailladie is a little more popular than other places I climbed in Ireland, so expect to bump into other climbers there. I can't say enough good things about the incredible hospitality of the Irish climbers we ran into. It's also fucking beautiful and only about an hour and a half drive from Galway which makes retreating from the rain much easier.

Here's [a great route wiki for Ireland](http://wiki.climbing.ie/index.php/Irish_Climbing_Route_Database).

[deleted],"Thiago is in a somewhat similar predicament as Cesc back in the day. He could be a starter at pretty much any European side except Barcelona, because Barça has so many midfield options. And at Barça he'll always be paid as a youth academy product, while a big move to a big team would probably carry a star signing's salary.

Thiago is also the son of Mazinho, who knows a bit about how things work, and is probably not endowed with a strong sense of Catalonian patriotism or somesuch because his real roots are elsewhere.

And he sees his fellow Masía men exciting from the backdoor every year. How long before we definitely transfer Cuenca? Will JdS follow GdS's footsteps? Bojan was the top scorer in La Masía history. The list goes on.

Seeing that people like Gerard, Piqué and Cesc left for greener pastures only to return with big paychecks, while very few of those who hang in there waiting for a chance actually make it... It mustn't be an easy decision for Thiago.

lehrmy,"I'd only like to see two things adopted to the NA/EU LCS from OGN: 2-game point systems for group stages and bo5 last game blind picks.  The OGN group stages are too short for LCS regions because they lack strong amateur scenes.  The long ""group stages"" of LCS are necessary to keep ""lower tier"" teams improving so they can have a shot at becoming one of the stronger teams. 

The 2-game point system rewards teams with strong mechanics who can play well consistently.  I'd rather it be a bo3 for the players, but it would take too much time for a fan to watch more than 1 bo3 in a day (I realize some fans have the time for this, but not everybody has that luxury).

inthenameofmine,"Good summary. 

Something which many people might find interesting, many people don't know the historical connection to Albania.

Ataturk was born and educated in Thessaloniki which was at the time still mostly inhabited by Arvanitas and classical Albanians. His father is believed to have been Albanian. Albanians were among the most secular people in Europe at the time due to the Kanun (an ancient, probably with pagan roots) collection of laws which were very un-religious. In the Kanun, man with his Besa is above any god. One should also not forget that a considerable number of the ""new turks"" movement just before the rise of Ataturk were in fact Albanians. The Albanian [genius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Frash%C3%ABri) [brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdyl_Frash%C3%ABri) [Frasheri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naim_Frash%C3%ABri) where part of this. Sami Frasheri pushed for and created himself the Latin based alphabet which was ultimately used by Ataturk. It is believed that they had close connections. Considering that all of the Frasheri brothers were practically atheist, a strong influence is plausible.

It is hypothesized that the rulers and intellectuals of the Albanian enlightenment (just at that time) highly influenced his thinking. In most regions where Albanian rulers presided within the Ottoman Empire strict secular rule was enforced. Examples are the [Egyptian aristocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Pasha) which was at the time composed almost exclusively of Albanians (and later most of the aristocracy turned into the semi-secular Egyptian military), and maybe most interestingly [Lebanon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashko_Vasa), where the relative peace between the main religions was kept up and reinforced by the Albanian ruler Pashko Vasa. Pashko Vasa is very well known for his deist views.",0,t3_1ffo2c,1,worldnews,,,caa8y9s,1370118022,False,,1430959726,False,True,t5_2qh13,t1_caa8y9s,t1_ca9vud2,0,0,1,

OK, try again: The US midwest or southern Ontario is quite conservative, has some car industry and other manufacturing. A large middle class, etc. Sounds like Germany, but does it feel like Germany? Not at all.

If I was to try to write a strategy for the tories to win the next election it'd be this.

* Stay quiet on Europe. The issue will be just as popular as soon as it rears it's head again. Don't put pressure on Labour to allow a referendum. Do however get Milliband to say a few times that he won't have one so they are painted into a corner.

* Form a pact with UKIP. Tory seats get no UKIP candidates. A few very marginal seats get no UKIP candidate. The other marginal labour/LibDem seats get no Tory candidate. This should return every sitting Tory MP plus a few and return enough UKIP to form a coalition.

* Replace Cameron as leader. But not now, when it happens it'll provide a bounce. Do it 6 months before the next election. Can't do it now or the coalition would collapse anyway.

Kerrt,"You must study the connection of the HSBC (heroin smuggling bloody criminals) to the heroin and drugs trade. Their connection goes all the way back to The Honourable East India Company of the Opium Wars in China. Study the powerful House of Keswick connection to the HSBC. Hong Kong is the heroin trade capital of the World. The West is flooded with heroin from the Golden Triangle (reason why the CIA started the Vietnamese war) and Golden Crescent (part of the Middle East crusade).

Most of the opium enters first into Europe via Sicily commanded by the powerful House of Bourbon headed by Jesuit-trained King Juan Carlos of Spain. France plays a massive role in the opium processing and this ties in with the powerful House of Savoy a ruler of the World Society who thieve natural resources. The CIA/DVD use by proxy the Japanese Yakuza in California to flood the West Coast with heroin whilst they use the corrupted Chinese Te-Wu division of the Er-Bu based in Chicago to flood the East Coast. A lot of the funds from the drugs trade go into the secretive Exchange Stabilization Fund. The drugs trade is a secret economy five times the size of the visible economy of the World. The Afghanistan war was not about oil, a barrel of oil does not compare in value to a barrel of opium.

The role of the military intelligence networks is to protect the economy at all costs. The role is not what you imagined. Military intelligence are the main players in the drugs trade for the elite families like Matheson, Astor, Dent, Bourbon, Savoy, Swire, Rothschild, Sassoon, Baring and Keswick etc. British MI6 are the masters of the heroin trade along with the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst. The Cocaine trade is mastered by the DVD/CIA for MI6. Israeli Mossad are the masters of the Ecstasy trade for MI6. The North Korean, Ministry of State Security and DVD master the amphetamines. The role of banks like the HSBC is to clean up the drugs money laundered through the stock exchanges of the World.

The House of Bourbon master the entire drugs trade with the House of Savoy through The Worshipful Company of Apothecaries part of the pirates of the Livery known as the British Empire hiding behind veils like the City of London Corporation. Some of the best exposers of the intelligence drugs trade are Brian Downing Quig, Gary Webb, Dr John Coleman and Michael Ruppert. The first two men were killed for exposing the truth on the drugs trade.

kak0,"&gt; However, it seems a little odd that immigrants would want to bring over a system that repeatedly oppressed them in their own homelands.

They don't' want that system. There are  few imbalanced criminals that want to do mayhem liek in woolwich. And there are many who are upset at the brutality of the police as in stockholm and istanbul.

&gt; What do you think about the radicalization of Islam?

It's over. The qutbist, talibanist and salafist movements are on the decline. They realize that they will never win. Their chance is gone.


&gt; Would you say that this radicalization will lead to splits and revolution in the religion in general or become so radicalized that a new denomination is created?

No islam doesn't have a central authority like the catholic church. There is nothing to rebel against. 


&gt; Most of the Muslims here in the US (minus a couple aka Boston Bombers) are generally kind, courteous, and respectful to all religions.

Most european muslims are also like that.

But the numbers in europe are larger and there is opportunity to make gangs and do gangster stuff.

Just like the LA riots and the looting in oklahoma there are gains waiting for opportunity to make mayhem and get back at the authorities. UIt has nothing to do with islam. 


&gt;  There are a few things I avoid like women, politics, and drinking, but avoiding those topics aren't exclusive to Muslims.

Why? I talk about these things all the time with muslims, even if they get upset, and especially if they get upset. 

There is no reason to have no-go areas in thought. 


&gt; I'm not sure if it's the media, but it seems to me that Europe is heading for a direct collision course with Islam. Is that true? If so why?

Not true. Europe is not headed there. 

Europe has economic and cultural problems. Muslims are a small part of it.

Hasidic dynasties went by location: Bobover, Pupa, Bostoner. and each one considers itself unique.

Zionists believe that all Jews descend from the Israelite people that were exiled from ancient Israel. They simply use the Bible/Torah to make their case (same way many nations use their ancient lore as a common ground for unification, Zionists simply followed the Torah). Every Jew is a former Israelite. Which is why Zionists go bersek if anybody bring up the Khazar letters. It weakens the argument that Jews in Europe descend from exiled Israelites.

It's not a trivial thing to incinerate a city full of people, on purpose. We did it with two nukes, and with firebombs, and with regular bombs, too, not only in Japan but all over Europe.

The guys who made the decision to deliberately target civilians in cites were not monsters. (In fact, the guy in charge was FDR, who seems to be a pretty popular guy around here). They were facing an enemy army that was genuinely hideous, and inflicting utterly intolerable abuses on entire nations they had set out to seize for themselves. FDR, and the men he chose to advise him, believed that such attacks on civilians were necessary; not necessary for the greater glory of the Imperial United States, but morally necessary, for the sake of humanity.

It saddens me to see this trivialized into half-baked moral equivalence and misplaced apology. Yes, the tens of thousands of Japanese dead are an appalling thing, but to ignore the hundreds of thousands of people whom the Japanese destroyed is also a moral outrage.

My willingness to apologize for our nukes is closely related their their willingness to apologize for things like what they did in Nanking - and the last I heard, they don't even teach their children about Nanking in their own schools, even to this day.

The Arab world collected all of the learning and art it could save and made great advances as Europe fell into an era of book burning and religious dogma. Unfortunately, much of Islam ceased to be the religion of knowledge after a series of power grabs by fundamentalists, but the same thing has happened to countless religions, not least of which was Christianity. And not all of Islam is so repressive. We have a tendency here to describe Islam as a unified bloc, when there are literally dozens, if not hundreds, of sects, offshoots, and competing schools. That would be like saying Jesuits are just like Southern Baptists. The non PC version is that Jesuits are smarter and less shitty than Southern Baptists. Furthermore, there are large swaths of the Middle East that hold Christians, atheists, and others. So it's incorrect to characterize the Entire Middle East as ""mostly very tribal people enamored with a Stone Age religion."" After all, most religions are stone age; it's their application that matters.

So this is a pretty recognizable historical cycle, I'd say, and the current incarnation of religious repression and fanaticism is bred through poverty and resentment. Let's just say you don't get very many golden ages when distant foreigners split up your ancestral land, sell it to collaborating families, and sell arms/information to maintain a favorable outcome for Europe at the expense of civil liberties in brown countries. I don't doubt that it will take a long to modernize, but I stand by my point that it's important for people to feel the power of their own Public.

&gt;In May, Britain responded to the blockade with a proclamation of neutrality, which the other European powers followed. This tacitly granted the Confederacy belligerent status, the right to contract loans and purchase supplies in neutral nations and to exercise belligerent rights on the high seas. The Union was greatly angered by European recognition of Southern belligerency, fearing that it was a first step toward diplomatic recognition. But British Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell said, ""The question of belligerent rights is one, not of principle, but of fact.""

All of the Civil War history books I've read indicated that the failure of the CSA to gain diplomatic recognition, or find any real foreign allies, was one of the keys to their defeat.

I'd love more info on the CSA's treaties with Native American tribes.  I had never heard about it and would enjoy reading how such a deeply racist nation (more so than the Union -which is saying something) was able to secure some Native American support.

This (plus recent restrictions on alcohol), among other things, has really intensified and solidified the fear of nonsecularism by the current government.

* Danny Rose - 4.4m
* Gervinho - 9.2m
* Nikica Jelavic - 7.9m
* Bobby Zamora - 3.1m
* Aaron Lennon - 14m

**Total Received: 80.8m**

* 7 MF -Marin/Lallana/Sinclair/Hoolahan/Pienaar/Sissoko/Brunt
* 2 ST -Crouch/Holt

**IN: 6 Players - Transfer Budget: 40.8m**

* **Oliver Baumann 4.4m (SC Freiburg)** - Very young, very good keeper playing regular first team football for a team that narrowly missed out on the champions league. IMO of equal caliber to Krul. Can start and be under tutelage from the more experienced Shay Given. 

* **Marcel Schmelzer 7.9m (Dortmund)** - Very good German international with Champions league experience. Experience with Europe and winning the league will help translate to leadership role on team. Will also lead by example on the pitch as he is a consistent performer.

* **Michu 11.5m (Swansea)** - Has proven that he can score and put a team that was expected to struggle on his shoulders. Will no doubt be happy to be reunited with former teammate Sinclair. Scoring machine that will be needed in midfield. 

* **Victor Wanyama 4.4m (Celtic)** - Young, relatively cheap and battle proven (albeit in the Scottish League). This lad can play and can handle the rigors of starting at a big club although he is only 21 years old. An enforcer that any team could use (especially United - hint hint Moyes). 

* **Salomon Kalou 5.7m (Lille)** - Kalou has shown he can play in the premier league and score. He has just had a fantastic season in France with Lille scoring 14 and setting up 5 goals. At only 27 he will be at the club during his prime without a Drogba or Anelka to steal playing time from him. Can also be utilized on the wing and is therefore even more useful.

* **Jelle Vossen 6.2m (KRC Genk)** - A young striker with a fantastic goal scoring record thus far. National team player and captain of his club at only 24. A great striker in the making and would benefit from squad rotation and the chance to play on a bigger stage than the Belgian Pro League. 

**Total Spent: 40.1m**
**Profit: 700,000**

**New Squad:**

* 3 GK - Baumann/Given/Taylor
* 3 RB - Smalling/Kelly/O'Shea
* 2 LB - Wilson/Schmelzer
* 4 CB - Taylor/Heitinga/Ferdinand/Hooiveld
* 9 MF/W - Marin/Lallana/Sissoko/Sinclair/Hoolahan/Pienaar/Brunt/Michu/Wanyama
* 4 ST - Vossen/Kalou/Crouch/Holt

**Starting 11 - 4-2-3-1**

* GK - Baumann
* RB - Smalling
* CB - Heitinga
* CB - Ferdinand
* LB - Schmelzer
* CDMR - Sissoko
* CDML - Wanyama
* RAM - Marin
* CAM - Michu
* LAM - Sinclair
* ST - Kalou

Smalling and Schmelzer will both be asked to bomb forward more often than not in an attempt to supply the attack with support as well as to keep opposing wings pinned back (best defense is a good offense). Central midfielders will be holding/enforcer type midfielders winning the ball back and helping out the CB's if the FB's do get caught up field. The attacking midfielders will be allowed plenty of attacking and creative freedom. I'll be looking for them to play a fast paced, direct game with a lot of switching of positions, wing-play and killer through-balls. 

Bench

1. Given
2. Kelly
3. O'Shea
4. Brunt
5. Lallana
6. Vossen
7. Crouch

O'shea makes the bench ahead of other defenders for his versatility. Brunt as well. Lallana can play on either wing whilst Vossen and Crouch will be back up strikers. Both strikers can come on for wingers as well as Kalou can slip onto the wing in replacement.

* Many people do not acknowledge you like in America. I noticed that I would always say hello, how are you doing, good morning, thank you etc... but most Brits just want to continue their lives and not be bothered. They're in their own bubble. NOTE: THIS IS NOT RUDE THERE, unless you made a point to say hello and they ignore you. Many people are kinda jolted ""awake"" when I acknowledge them in public.

* WALKING. You will walk everywhere. This is great.

* TRAINS. You can take the train pretty much anywhere you want to go. If you can't, you can usually take the bus.

* Everything fucking closes by 6. Oh, and on Sundays they close earlier. 

* No WalMart. This is okay, if you live near a high street you can get whatever you need, and what you can't find you can get at Tesco... or just go online. The stock isnt as incredible as it is in America, but it is close.

* If you do get a car, the gas (petrol) is freaking expensive. They also measure it in litres so have fun figuring out what you're buying if you're used to buying in US gallons. And UK gallon is a different measurement. Also, forget about getting an automatic transmission. They exist but are far less popular than manual and people will judge you for driving one.

* The houses are MUCH smaller than in the US. Seriously. Again, not really a bad thing I guess, but they are generally older too. I remember seeing a segment on QI (TV show) that the UK has the smallest house sizes in all of Europe, so there's that.

alttt,"I'm copying a post that I wrote one or two days ago because I think it is very relevant. GMO-opponents are not stupid or conservative or anti-science, there is (at least) one very convincing fact-based anti-GMO argument. Please ignore the tone as it was as a response to a ridiculously biased post.

Okay, I am generally pro GM but I want to mention *the* anti-GM argument. GMO opponents are not merely uninformed or tech-phobe or stoned anti-corporation protestors. European, Japanese, Chinese and plenty of other legislators are not just stupid or uninformed or influenced by ""organic industry lobbyists,"" they have actual reasons for being doubtful of GMO foods:

There are [many many many arguments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies) against GMOs, most of which I won't address here.

But I want to point out one main argument which I sumarize as follows:

###Genes are not Lego.

Inserting genes from one species into another species' genetic code does not simply transfer one property of the first species to the second. The process is *very* imprecise in many respects. The main ones:

1. The exact ""target location"" of the inserted genes is (literally) impossible to choose. 
2. The exact expression of certain genes in another species is impossible to predict.
3. The exact interaction between genes and the effect that one gene can have on existing genes is impossible to predict.

There is no guy with a pair of tweezers that pushes a certain set of genes somewhere into a nice stack of other genes - most of the transfers are done by engineered viruses and most of the new plants generated die straight away. Others are bred over four to ten generations and, if they have ""the right properties"" the company will try to license them. Thousands of specimens are generated in attempts to generate a new hybrid species with the desired property (e.g. repels a certain type of pest) - but that does not mean that those few that actually end up with this property gained *only* that property.

Consider the analogy of medicine: Despite *trillions of dollars* and many years going into the development of modern medicine for most modern medicine the *exact way in which they work is unknown.* We know how antibiotics work but e.g. for most drugs for mental disorders (schizophrenia etc) all we have are *guesses* regarding which hormone pathways are affected.

Research in the GMO area is by far not as advanced as that in medical research. Arguably a grain is simpler than a human, but the genetic code is still highly complex and *not understood*. We understand part of the effect of some genes (e.g. *some genes are known to cause the production of certain chemicals*, that is, it is understood *that* those plants that possess them *can* produce the chemical (a bug repellent or similar) but the exact way in which the genes cause the production of the chemical is rarely understood).

That leaves some problems, additionally to the imprecise nature of the insertion process - which of course can also cause issues:

* Gene interactions can create additional chemicals or harmful effects that might e.g. cause a higher mutation rate
* The resulting plants are rarely, if ever, ""original grain plus X"" - there is not a wheat with an extra vitamin, there is a wheat with *an extra vitamin and some other stuff*.
* The change in the plant itself can have unexpected effects on (a) other plants that share the environment with the GM crop, (b) insects that live on, from or besides the crop, (c) farm animals that consume the crop and (d) human consumers.

As said, I am not generally against GMOs, in contrast I am very strongly in favor of more research in the area. GMOs have a great potential to solve some of the worst problems in the world, such as lack of micronutrients in the diets of the majority of the world's people.

BUT, and that's the big but: GMOs need to be tightly regulated and their *long-term effects* need to be assessed before they are licensed and sold for consumption,  which *largely has not happened yet*. Most GMO studies are costly and *all* big corporations that produce GMO species (Monsanto, Bayer CropScience, DuPont, Dow Chemical, ...) have already at various times been exposed as either suppressing evidence of negative effects or of tweaking their studies to give positive outcomes for the licensing process. If you deny that GMOs *have* long-term effects then you are certainly not a ""sciency person.""

There are many issues that have been raised and various evidence has been brought forward, particularly against the ""RoundUp Ready"" crops by Monsanto, but also against other crops (effect on fertility of farm animals, benefit to secondary pests, gene flow to other plants, effects on the soil and bacteria species, effect on sugar levels in consumers, ...) and to simply ignore those and dismiss all critics as idiots that don't even understand evolution is the argument of someone that either hasn't bothered to understand the issues or that wilfully misrepresents the opposing position.

**tl;dr**: the concerns are scientifically sound and are taken seriously by experts and regulators in many developed countries. 

**Genes are not lego.** It's not a matter of ""adding a bit of vitamin"" into a soup. The currently used gene insertion processes are in no way advanced enough to achieve one and only one specific effect. The long-term effects on human and animal health, biodiversity, the crop plant itself, bacteria, insects (particularly bees and worms) and small animals (e.g. rodents, birds) and plenty of other things have, so far, rarely been assessed appropriately. What is needed are stricter regulatory processes and more transparency to expose fraud by the GMO producing companies.

GMO crops *could* be safe, but they have not been demonstrated to be so - and until that has been done in a transparent and scientifically sound manner there will be critics.

So, well, I support Ben &amp; Jerrie's decision. It's not stupid, hippie-esque or catering to a specific audience. The arguments against GMOs are scientifically sound - GMOS *can* be the food of the future, but currently they are not, although *a lot* of industry lobbyists are pushing the message that GMO are ""safe and healthy.""

REDDIT_DOESNT_EXIST,"&gt; 1) How do you know that this character is ""death?"" Doesn't sound like he ever introduced himself or gave any real information aside from your task. 

That's a good question, I will respond by linking to a response I gave to another redditor. [The link is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmAFiction/comments/1fgghi/fic_iama_student_who_has_been_given_a/caaadbg)

He hasn't given me much information at all, and it makes me very uneasy. But I have guessed a lot of it, but I'll explain that soon.

&gt; 2) What was your easiest choice?

I think the easiest choices are the criminal vs. innocent person ones. However, I tend to get sent choices that are more in the grey area. And that's I guess what my job is, to make hard decisions.

The investigation into who killed my Mother is ongoing. My father won't drop the case, but he has put it in the background. So far it's leading nowhere, but as soon as we find who is responsible, I will kill him, I swear.

&gt; 3) Are all the people you choose between in your local area, and, if so, do you think there are more people like you scattered across the world?

You are very observant, to notice this. Yes, there seems to be a pattern, that at the moment it is only within the bounds of my city, which I find very interesting.

Perhaps it's to do with the fact that my piece is a pawn, and I am a lower rank.

Perhaps there are others out there with higher ranked pieces. Maybe they actually get a choice to kill anyone. So far I'm looking for these people, I've had a theory in the back of my head, that in order to stop this, I have to beat Death at a game of chess. But how do you beat a King and his Queen?

For that, you must have all the other pieces on the board. So at the moment, I am looking through different local newspapers, and world news, to see if there are any interesting anomalies.

I have found another, that I believe has another chess piece, another pawn. I think he has the same responsibility as myself, but a little different. He is a priest of a popular church, in Europe. People everywhere are calling him a miracle healer, but it's strange that he only heals one person a day. The local media has taken special attention to him, and there are many critics.

The person that is healed is always in hospital, and ready to die. Things like late stages of cancer, heart disease, and other diseases. Then miraculously, they make a recovery, at guess what time? Midnight. The exact same time, that I choose a person to live and die. It can't be a coincidence, it's too similar. He heals one person a day.

I think he chooses between two people every day, like myself. But I think that he doesn't contact the victim, like I do. And I also believe that he goes to the one he has chosen to live, and pretends to use his healing power on them, often converting them to his church (or cult).

I've still got to do some investigating into it, but it sickens me to hear.

I think there are others, for this reason. And I believe that every person has a chess piece. And I believe that there are 16 chess pieces. But Death may not have given all of them out just yet.

It's a long shot, but I think that if I have enough pieces, I may be able to defeat Death in a round of chess, and get him to release me from this. I don't know. Again, it's a long shot, but I've got to consider that it means consciously murdering or stealing the pieces from the people that hold them.

&gt; 4) What exactly is your day job, or are you in college? I'm presuming the depression that accompanies this situation puts a damper on your social life and hobbies. 

Currently, I'm applying for a university to study forensics. Only a year ago, I was out of school.

I wish I could say that I had a social life. I was never really popular, but there was this one girl that I've always been friends with. I'm too nervous to ask her out. I'm more of a ""nice guy"". But then, it's hard for me to pay attention to my personal life. My responsibility consumes me.

I still work with one of my hobbies, and that is solving cases. Though, the only case I've been on lately is my own.

&gt; 5) You mentioned that you're getting media and police attention. Would you mind expanding upon that?

Yes. My father is a detective in the police department, and although most cases are confidential, occasionally he has one that he can share with me. I've always wanted to do what my dad does.

Lately he has had me on an interesting case. Interesting, because I'm investigating myself. It's interesting, because I have to pretend that I don't know as much about myself as I do. When we narrow down the police investigation a little, it gets scary. I can feel when they are dangerously close to figuring out my identity, but I have to go along with it.

I mean, just the other day, they had the idea to post more surveillance cameras outside of all the remaining phone booths in the city, and my father asked me if I thought it was a good idea. I had to agree, I had no other option. I felt like I was shooting myself in the foot.

I'm no hacker, I can't hide my phone calls from the police, and worse, the FBI or the NSA. I'm not even going to try. But what I can do, is take precautions, and always use payphones. I make sure to use text-to-speech on my phone, so they can't hear my voice. Once or twice, I've had to flee from the box, while police were after me. Once was during the day, at a shopping mall, and I managed to disappear into the crowd.

The other was at night. Before I had went, I had memorized the alleyways and streets around the payphone I was at.

I always make sure that I take precautions, and have an escape plan.

Oh and the media? Well it's crazy. The deaths are always at midnight on the second, and are always random. One lady even committed suicide, after stressing out, after I called her to tell her she was going to die.

The reaction from the media? They know that that there is a murderer behind it, because of the phone calls. I usually word the calls in such a way that I apologize. I tell them that they did not deserve to die, and that they are saving another life by dying.

For this reason, the media have earned me the name of, ""Cold Blooded Savior"". [ooc: Title of the book, when I release it]

There are many that hate me. Many of the people that were killed were good people, that served the community. Veterans, public servants, good and normal people. They have reason to be angry.

But at the same time, there are the people that worship me, or rather their perception of me. They know that I am saving someone by doing this, and they can see the bigger picture.

This is a question about refugee status.  By sending the refugees to Germany, Italy is in violation of of the '67 convention, namely the point of entry must be the country that handles the hearing on their status.  They also can't be arbitrarily kicked out, so Italy really violated multiple aspects of a treaty they signed.  Shitty.

Triptolemu5,"&gt; can lead to a downwards spiral and stagnation

Do you know why everybody was so terrified of a deflationary spiral after the massive inflationary bump? The monetary system *really* needed to deflate, but the government didn't let it. Why? Because they owe so much money. Our monetary policy is now strictly guided by our massive debt load. Deflation would have seriously increased the functional cost of our debt.

The myth that modern societies operate under today is that growth should always be permanent. That after every boom, there should never be a bust. If you are going to allow booms, you must also allow busts, because that is how the system corrects itself. Instead, what we had in 08 was the massive boom became the massive subsidization. Privatized gains, but socialized losses. Society as a whole did not benefit, but a few people got very very wealthy, while overall, the standards of living for the general middle class has been steadily inching downward to pay for it.

&gt; That this isn't done, is the problem and has to change,

Again, I'm in complete agreement about this, but the current problem is, the spending was out of control during the boom time, and the solution of throwing even more money at the problem is a terrible long term one. I'm not sure if there even is any sensible spending that can be done anymore, nor that the political will can be found to implement it. You may simply be more optimistic than I am.

&gt; Compared to after the war

But that's the thing. Sure there is a good deal of potential in developing economies, but the environment politically, socially, and culturally in those countries is very different than post ww2 Europe and Asia, and real actual wages are way down in developed nations compared to what they used to be.

&gt; If it relies only on exploiting natural ressources, then in the end you are right, it is unsustainable. But isn't growth also caused by scientific progress and advances in manufacturing?

Here's the thing. Every modern society relies on exploiting natural resources at a level that would be impossible to extend currently to the population of every developing nation. The fossil based energy source required for *everything* that happens in a modern society isn't even sustainable for the extant modern societies past the next 40 or so years.

Modern societies depend on cheap energy and resource extraction from the '3rd world' to function, let alone grow. Scientific and manufacturing advances amount to ever more efficient conversion of fossil energy to mechanical energy. There may in fact be a way forward out of our looming energy crisis, but if there isn't, there will be a very hard ceiling to the world's GDP followed by a catastrophic collapse of it. Modern societies cannot grow, process, and distribute food without fossil fuel. The energy itself represented by the cubic mile of oil humanity uses every year is so often overlooked that it's simply taken for granted that the electricity will always be on, and that the food will always be there in the grocery store.

Not only that, but it has been predicted that the global population will reach close to 9 billion before it levels off. Growth has historically been a function of expanding populations as well as scientific and manufacturing advances. Once population growth stops, that will leave science and development of the global south. Development of which will be functionally impossible without a very large breakthrough in how humanity gets it's energy, it's fertilizer, and it's raw materials.

Now, all of those problems about growth and resources are the hard limits of humanity which are about 40-60 years out. There may be solutions to them, there may not be. Government spending and debt is more of a shorter term problem that in comparison to the aforementioned problems is tiny. 

However, the shakier ground the first world economies are on, the less likely it will be able to get it's shit together to fix the bigger problems, because the politics of representative democracies have devolved to kick every problem down the road a few months, and only deal with the right now, which leads to things like deficit spending to prop up the economy, consequences be damned.

A rough analogy would be if you as an individual were taking out loans to go on vacations, and suddenly your car broke down. Now you have too much debt to secure the loan it would take to fix your car. Now that you have no car, you can't make it to work, which puts you in a real bind, because now you can't pay your mortgage and keep the electricity on. Whereas if your debt load was 33% of your net worth to start with instead of 100%, you could have easily gotten the loan to fix the car, which keeps the roof over your head and the lights on.

I like the solution that was attributed to Warren Buffett on the budget problem. Simply pass a constitutional amendment that if the budget does not show a 5% surplus or more, no one gets re-elected.

[MY SQUAD](http://i.imgur.com/yw8dlPv)



SUBS: Krul|Clyne|Bartra|Lampard|Pienaar|N'Zogbia|Hooper

I feel like I brought in a good mix of youth and experience and pretty much everyone's position is covered with almost all the young squad members having mentors in their positions.

GK is extremely deep with Cesar and Krul able to switch out whenever they want with Krul eventually leading the club

Rio and Raul Albiol can teach young Bartra and Santana 
The fullbacks are very young however some already proven for the senior national squad.

The midfield was an expensive overhaul but I liked the choice of the holding midfields and that a lot of the midfield can swap positions. I picked up Frank Lampard for what I would assume is 1-2 yrs max to teach the younger midfields. If an injury occurs in center midfield Lampard could easily fill any of the positions. 

We have extremely young wingers in the likes of Fischer, Niang, and Lallana. Hopefully N'Zogbia and Lennon could help ease the younger crowd in. 

The team is based upon speedy wing play and Taraabt having somewhat of a free role behind Benteke. Brought hooper in as a solid sub/starter if Benteke was to be injured. 

Realistically, many of the young talent could turn out to be superstars but there is a chance they may flop. In the first year i see a about a 7th or 6th place finish but after time to gel and learn and grow I can see being a consistent top 5 finisher (European football)

This was fun.

Rarehero,"You got the impression from the last years Euros. But he had no other choice. The key players were recovering from injuries, and the young lads weren't ready for that stage yet. The two years of Dortmund in Europe prior to the Euros should have shown that, but somehow everybody expected Löw to win the Euros with ease because of players like Götze, while even the allmighty Klopp couldn't even survive a group stage with prior to the Euros. Why do we expect something from Löw, what Klopp couldn't do in two years, although he's working these players every day?

Yeah, the tactics in the semis were shit. But we wouldn't have won the Euros anyway. We have made too many mistakes throughout the entire tournament. Because the players were either inexperienced or recovering from injuries. We haven't lost against Italy because of the tactics, but because young players have made mistakes. And that's completely fine because that's the only way, how young players learn to compete on that stage. 

Löw has played the strengths of the team in one match. In that match we have conceded two goals against a weak opposition from Greece. Imagine what Portugal, Netherlands, Italy or Spain would have made with that line-up. Many people wanted Löw to play with the Dortmund players. The same players that were choking in international group stages the two previous years? Players who have never survived a group stage of an international tournament, would have won the Euros, if Löw were just a bit more competent?

ThePhlogist,"You make a good point. I think however that if an European army was properly integrated and patrolled dangerous boarders to keep the peace (like in Cyprus) then an invading nation would  have to go through the EU army. Military nations would inevitably feel attacked as their soldiers would have been shot at or could have been shot at. I would think an aggressive invasion within the EU would feel like a security threat for military nations anyway. In terms of nuclear defence I don't think a nuclear war would be started over an invasion; conventional forces would be sufficient. Nukes would only be used (I hope :/) against another nuclear country threatening the EU. 

Having said all that it's kind of a fantasy ATM.

Haurian,"&gt;In 1986, The ""VT700C"" model rear fender took on a flair look over the rounded style. The engine is the same as the 1984 model except polished instead of black with the right engine cover graphic painted black. The mufflers were a little lower and changed from the flair look to a more straight style. The front pegs and controls were moved forward, the rear foot peg support bracket became solid and the back rest was optional this year. The cast wheels changed from a ten-spoke to a five-spoke design and the access covers were chromed. The ""VT750C"" was available outside of the USA (Canada and Europe) with a larger engine displacement  
The 1987 ""VT700C"" model featured the same engine as the 1986 model but with the right engine cover graphic not painted. The side covers are chrome, five-spoke cast wheels with a single front disc brake.

Jorlung,"A little documentation through my journey through this game:

Expedition #1:

I am dropped in the middle of a residential street in somewhere that looks to be North American. Saw a McDonalds, a stop sign in English, and cars driving on the right side of the road. Probably safe to assume it's in USA or Canada. I tried to zoom in on a license plate of a car, but the image quality is too low to see properly what it is. There are leaves on the ground, so it's probably safe to assume it's either Northern USA, or Canada. Saw a Sonic, which I'm pretty sure is a USA only franchise (as a Canadian I've never seen one over here). Saw a building for the ""Bank of America"" so if there was any doubt left, I am definitely in the USA. I found the ""Chaves County Courthouse."" So I know what County I am in, but how the hell do I find out what state I am in? I see a sign saying Roswell ________ (some advertisement of some sort) so I know the city I am in is Roswell. But the problem still remains, what state am I in? I wander around for a bit and try to pick up clues, but to be honest I cannot find what state I am in so I give up and google it. I am in New Mexico. I zoom into New Mexico on the map, and Roswell pops up, zoom in a bit further and seem Main St, which was the street I went on and found all that stuff. I guess that I was south of main street and pop a guess that turns out to be 1.6 KM away. Not bad for my first try.

Expedition #2:

I'm dropped into a place that looks to be somewhere European. I can see castle walls and a little blue and white castle that almost looks like something out of a Disney movie. I finally find my way outside of the castle, and there are cars on the right side again, so that rules out a few countries. I see cathedral looking buildings everywhere, and find a store that looks like it has Russian writing. I see street signs that display destinations, but they're in bloody Russian so it doesn't help me any. I see a street sign that says Mockobckar (backwards R at the end). I decide I'm gunna cheat again and use google. I still can't find shit on Mockobckar, Russia despite some dude on the Sarnia Sting comes from Mockobckar (damn you Canadian google...). Through further Google research Mockba is apparently Russian for Moscow, so I just say fuck it I'm dropping it in the centre of Moscow. I'm tired of this one anyway. I'm 718 KM away, it was apparently in Kazan.

Expedition #3:

Dropped on a bike trail near a river/channel with a bunch of skyscrapers. I try to make my way across to the city but can't find a way to get over there so I follow the bike trail. I see the bloody Olympic rings on a little raft in the river/channel thing. So wherever I am has hosted the Olympics recently. It's obviously not London, cars are also driving on the right side. I see a tour bus that says ""Cruise Victoria"" so I think I'm in Victoria, B.C. which would make sense because B.C. held the Winter Olympics a few years ago. I zoom in on Victoria, B.C. and I see a little place across from the city. I then see Songhees Walkway, I'm sure that's where I am!!!! I place a logical guess to whereabout I am, and I am 99 KM away... Apparently Cruise Victoria doesn't just cruise Victoria, but all over mainland Vancouver. Whatever, that's pretty close I guess. I didn't cheat this time too so that's good.

Expedition #4:

Middle of the fucking desert... I'll finish this later.

jabbercocky,"No, it's easy to explain, because of the way the Alliance was structured.

Recall, the alliance was more like the European Union than it was like the United States of America. There's a shared currency, and tariff-free exchange of goods between planets, and a common military. This is governed by a parliamentary body.  That's it.

The shared currency reverts back to planetary-based currencies. This results in problems for the Blue Suns corporation, as all debts they held become largely worthless. This has a knock-on effect, whereby Stock in their company likewise plummets. Those who had the most invested (the Lords and such) thereby lose the most. This results in the ironic effect of ruining Tam's parents - ignoring their daughter did, in the end, truly ruin them. The regular people, who weren't shareholders, lose relatively little in this corporate intrigue.

The military, being practically supported by the Blue Suns, runs out of ways to pay their officers and enlisted men. And without that, those officers and enlisted men do the same thing the USSR's military did - sell it to those who would pay to buy such assets. In this case, it is other corporate entities who have profited by the fall of the Blue Suns corporation (their fall creates a power and market share vacuum that is quickly filled by others).

Many of the planets were only recently brought under Alliance control, and these would most quickly and easily revert to independent status. The others would likely turn to their individual elected parliament leaders, assuming those leaders have not lost the trust of the people after Reaper-gate (which is highly likely). These leaders call on those military members who were from their individual planets to return home, bringing home any military assets they could. Some, feeling a pride from their homeland, answer this call - and others become mercenaries answering to the highest bidder.

On individual planets, serious collapse and riots only occur when either food or energy become scarce (just like when any government or country collapses). However, there is a large extra-governmental group that trades in materials such as this - Captain Mal being but one example of this group. As that the economy was already heavily barter-based, the likelihood of riots beyond the first initial shocks of reaper-gate seem unlikely.

And that's about as uber-realistic as it gets - far more than would actually be needed to explain to the audience (as that the story would pick up 5 or 6 years after Reaper-gate, anyway).",0,t3_1fh5bx,7,firefly,,,caabms1,1370127478,False,,1430958465,False,True,t5_2qs24,t1_caabms1,t1_caabbqn,0,0,7,
