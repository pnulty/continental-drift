There was a story recently on NPR about Hermes, and their silk scarves. A reporter wanted to know why the price was $200 (or whatever it is) and he set out to do some research. As it turns out, they control the whole process; they own the land where the silkworms live, they own the silkworms, etc. They want to own the whole process so they can guarantee quality control.

I bought a shirt from Ermengildo Zegna once, at a half off sale at a Men's clothing store in Knoxville, TN. The shirt *felt* like quality and fit was nice. At 50% off, the shirt was $115 plus tax. I believe it was made in Italy, but I don't have it now to check. Compared to other shirts I've owned, it was better (though it didn't seem *better enough* comparatively? I spilled oil on the shirt, so I don't wear it anymore to know how durable it might be for purposes of a fair comparison).

I would imagine that items produced in Europe or America would have a higher price tag due to labor, among other factors. I've been inside a Burlington Coat Factory and I've been inside Hermes, and I know there are aspirational consumers who are only buying the brand name or whatever the hell. The Zegna shirt that I had *looked* like any plaid type casual button down shirt. I doubt that any ten people on the street could have identified the maker. I think people who are buying the names are buying names that are more obviously identifiable. TOMMY! and the like. I dunno...",2,c6ulpj6,

That was given right then and there. PdC never even acknowledged his involvement, nor did he explain anything... Because things can be taken out of context (even though... in those... I hardly think so).

The sports you mentioned, some lacked investment (and were on the brink of closing) and just recently were brought back. Just take in last season. Benfica won almost every sport (but handball, I admit). And winning two championships in a row is not an anomaly. Not even 10 if you're the only team investing on the sport. But winning more championships than every other team combined while they all invest heavily, for over 30-35 years, that is an anomaly.

And by the way, befica won 3 of the last 4 Basketball championships.

And glad you only mentioned 2 sports where Porto is clearly besting Benfica has over 15 professional teams. On the others, some Benfica dominates, others are even, but THAT is normal. They even out, but Benfica manages to win some and lose some.

Miles worse, by what measure? Apart from the team Mourinho built, no other team was miles ahead of any other. They have been even through and through. And reaching an European final does not prove anything. Ask Sporting and Braga that did so with mediocre teams.

You say the nationwide titles prove the teams were better, but that's exactly my point and a huge fallacy. There are many reasons for Porto to have won more championships, and only one is a better team. If you steal the trophy every year, you're not the best team. At all. It's logic 1 o 1.

The difference with stability is that Porto sacks managers right before the start of a championship and they still win. They lose them to Chelsea and still win. They lose key players, and they still win. And that happening once or twice, it's fine. That happening every single time, it's not. And, in my opinion, it proves there is something fishy.

And I don't doubt for a second they might all crooks. they also might not. But PdC has irrefutable evidence that he, indeed, is a crook. It is not word of mouth or anything else. That, tied to the statistical anomalies I've been talking about is enough to convince me that Porto has not been playing fair. Have the others? That's for you to prove otherwise. I'm sure they've been stealing them one way or another.",2,c6ulpy3,

I'll assume you read what you posted, and noticed yourself that this article did not specify that the word ""gaijin"" is derogatory or discriminatory. 

For others, the gist of this wikipedia article about the word gaijin is :

- it's a old word, nowadays used as the colloquial form of Gaikokujin. It's particularly used for non-Eastern Asian ethnicities.

- second paragraph is about other words that were used for westerners (nanbanjin, ijin, koumoujin, etc.)

- and third paragraph is what this is all about, how non-Eastern Asians, and specifically Europeans and Americans, feel that this specific word emphasizes the ethnicity rather than the nationality and is discriminatory, and is sometimes indeed used in discriminatory situations (eg. school playgrounds). It finishes by stating that even if used without such intention, there is a growing feeling in the non-Eastern Asian foreigners living in Japan that this word is discriminatory. Which I assume is what you feel.

TLDR; ""gaijin"" is not discriminatory, unless you make it so.

I'm sorry if I mislead you to believe the Supreme Court actually re-wrote the law.

http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Health-care-law-survives-with-Roberts-help-3669996.php

Can you please explain to me how our gun laws in AZ put thousands of weapons into the hands of Mexican drug cartels?

Then why does Obama have all these Czars, that aren't authorized by the Constitution? Why has Obama passed over 900 executive orders, in just 3.5 years? Why is the EPA now enforcing the Cap and Trade provisions that weren't passed into law? Resulting in numerous coal burning power plants being shut down? Why is emminent domain now being used to ""increase the tax base"" while enriching political cronies, instead of commonly used infrastructure devices like highways and bridges? Why is asset forfiture becoming the normal way for police forces to increase their budgets, preying on the people? People's assets are being seized even without any charges being filed for any crime, and then they are told to spend $thousands to get it back. 

The size of the federal budget is increading astronomically, much of it going to political cronies, with no end in site. Entitlements are unsustainable and will disappear altogether in the next few decades because nobody has the political will to fix them. Obamacare does nothing to control costs because it ignores the 3 main reasons prices increase: lack of tort reform (capping doctor's liability), lack of competition amongst insurance companies (across state lines), and too many policy mandates (politicians telling people the minimum health coverage they must purchase, by law).

U-Boats are deadly when used to prey upon merchant ships in surprise attacks, but if the enemy knows where they are (and the British would most definitely have knowledge of the German invasion attempt beforehand), their effectiveness is severely reduced. The Channel isn't prime U-Boat terrain, either.

German fighters lacked the range to be launched from Scandinavia, fly all the way to the British Isles, duke it out with RAF fighters, and return safely to Scandinavia. Without fighters, German bombers were sitting ducks. The Allied bombers in the latter days of the war had the very long-legged Mustang to provide cover, and even then they suffered large losses. Germany can't replace losses like the allies could.

The Royal Navy would be far from sitting ducks, even if the RAF was destroyed (which is impossible, because the RAF had significant forces that were far out of range from the Luftwaffe). The Luftwaffe wasn't nearly as well versed in anti-ship combat as, say, the Japanese Navy. It wouldn't have been Pearl Harbour. The Battle of Britain cost the Luftwaffe heavily, and in this alternate universe, it would be even more so. So lets say what remains of the Luftwaffe attacks. For a starters, they can only attack during the day. Even then, the Luftwaffe had very few planes that could actually carry out torpedo or dive bombing attacks on Royal Navy ships. Strafing merchants is one thing, but attacking battleships is another. Near the shore, British ships would be protected by the RAF, but I guess you want to play in some fantastical alternate universe where the RAF was destroyed. So, the Luftwaffe manages to sink a few ships - some destroyers, maybe a cruiser. The Royal Navy can take those losses. It would literally only take a group of destroyers, maybe a cruiser, to disrupt the pathetic thing the Germans had in the way of amphibious forces.

The Allies had significant experience and nearly unlimited resources when they were planning Overlord. The Germans had neither in the war. Even if they never invade Russia, taking Britain is hugely unlikely.

Germany's best chance to knock out Britain would be to cut her off from America. This is what they tried to do with their U-Boats. However, the Allies adapted and were capable of producing more ships than the Germans could sink. Maybe if they developed the Type 21 U-Boat earlier, but such development is fairly unlikely.

And, once again, I haven't even discussed the Soviets. The Soviets were no fans of the imperial British, but they would not let the Nazis rule Europe. By the time the Germans grinded down the British, the Soviets would be strong enough to invade from the east. Such an invasion would devastate Germany.

You cannot compare the population density of Australia to the US. The vast majority of Australians live along the coast, The US has a huge population all over the country. Australia is like Canada in this regard, a low population in a massive territory but geographically very concentrated... the population density numbers mean absolutely nothing.

Second, 93% of Australian households do not have fiber internet, not even close, to suggest so is absolutely absurd. Australia has some of the slowest internet in the developed world. [In a sample comparison of 27 countries, all in Europe and North America along with Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, between 2005 and 2008 inclusive, the fastest DSL service was Japan and Korea at 102,400 kbit/s. **Australia was ranked fourth from the bottom at 1,536 kbit/s**, above Greece, Spain and Mexico who were each 1,024 kbit/s.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Australia#Pricing).

$535 billion is an enormous amount of money, not exactly reasonable or trivial to upgrade peoples internet connections... as it is about half the US annual deficit. Efficiencies of scale wouldn't be as amazing as you make them out to be. Installing fiber, switches, routers, trunk lines, etc. over a way more spaced out area than Australia isn't as trivial as you make it out to be.

'AFKing in a bush is Toxic'. I disagree. I don't think it's toxic (as I don't think it ruined the game for everyone. The Eve finished with a very good score and they won the game). I don't think it's fine at all though, but I understand why the Eve felt completely demotivated the play the game after she was getting bullied and abused so hard.

If you'd like to report the Eve for AFKing in a bush during a team fight - you have the evidence to do so.

He called mid only AFTER Eve was mid. I don't feel like that justifies him going mid. Eve had just as much right to be there as him.

I don't agree that 'Froggen took the bait' because Eve confessed that their lost their focus because of all the awful things he had been saying... Because, you know, HE HAD ALREADY BEEN FLAMING THEM.

Leave some food around uncovered, and in a few hours rats or birds or ants will pick it clean. If you don't live in an aseptic city, that is, where vermin have been exterminated. Even today, with all sorts of storage technology, about 1/3 to 1/10 of the yearly crop is destroyed in storage by rodents and other pests. It would have been much, much worse for our ancestors in the distant past. That's a lot of calories you could potentially save, if you had a clay bowl with a lid, or a clay pitcher with a stopper.

I think the need for food storage became extremely urgent pretty much since the day humans had any surplus food to store. This was definitely true with the start of agriculture, when at harvest time you have more of the product than you can immediately eat. But I would venture to say that storage was important long before that. Relying on the luck of the day's hunt, or the luck of the day's forage, pretty much guarantees that you will have continuous feast and famine. The feast part is fine, but nobody likes famines. Our nomadic ancestors had the problem that they couldn't carry a whole lot with them. But as soon as permanent or semi-permanent settlements appeared (which was long before agriculture), people must have wanted to store food.

As for boiling water to make it safe, huge swaths of Europeans were revolting against the very idea as late as the 18th and 19th centuries, barely a hundred years ago, when hygienists suggested it.

Yup, it's called Europe! Europe, particularly the part you want to cycle, is incredibly good for cycling and cyclists. Really, it's that good. Get a good map and start joining the dots of where you want to be. 

There are good long stretches of dedicated bike paths by many of Europe's rivers/canals, but taking them means you end up just a number amongst the thousands of cyclists you'll pass on the way. You'll be passed by grannies, grandads, and their grandchildren on their bikes. Soon, you'll start to feel decidedly un-special.

It has been. But that's because its what worked. I am working on a degree in history of art (so my following argument (it is not against you, simply a wall of text partially explaining why religion worked 'back in the day') is going to be from an Art Historian's perspective), and almost everything in western (european art) 400BC to 1600AD is religious. Either through pagan cults (think greece and rome) to medieval/byzantine/islamic art that influenced the Renascence, asia, latin america and other parts of the world were the same. But logical thought in place of blind faith could not be taught in a time when the majority of the population could not read, and only the wealthy tended to be educated. blind faith *was* logical for them. Imagine living in a world where you have no idea how the fuck things work, and if someone offers an explanation, a logical theory, which you cannot refute; isn't that half of a proof? They needed hundreds of years of science to disprove religion, but at the time, they were going with the best they have. I am not defending religion, logically following the evidence shown in art of this time of this kind forgoes whether it is right or wrong. 

This is a very complex and long argument, but there are also dozens upon dozens of books on the matter. Taking religion as a marketing and manipulative tool (with teachings aside) was what religions wanted, they hired the best people that existed to do that for them. 

We are living in a different time, and if you look at art today as compared to then, you no longer need to be under the patronage of a religion to produce art, so the influences of religion and hence the mass manipulation have decreased. I hope I haven't muddled things up since I'm not the most eloquent of writers especially when I haven't dedicated time to flesh out structure to what I am writing.

To be honest pretty horrid, although I have nothing to compare it against. Cycling to work is legit, but a lot of traffic get pissed off if you use the road while there is a cycleway next to you. If you are in Auckland read up on the available cycleways.



**I noticed on your governments immigration site that IT skills were listed as a long term need.**

I work for a web development company, dealing mainly with Java as a software language. I believe there are many opportunities for experienced software developers/IT guys here.



**Xenophobia**

It really depends where you go. I'd say we're less xenophobic, more racist. Most of the South Island is NZ European, so they tend to be racist not because they are bad people, but because that's the way it is.

In Central Auckland (city centre) there is a large Asian population (Chinese, Korean, Indian, Sri Lankan) so you don't notice a lot of racism.

West Auckland again is mostly white - the westie stereotype is racist bogan with long hair and rock band t-shirts.

To be honest I wouldn't be able to tell you much having not experienced a great deal of racism (I'm white), but pretty much everyone here is an immigrant anyway; either that or they are second, third, fourth-gen immigrants (I myself am a fourth gen).



**Canadians**

I've only heard good things about Canadians. People will think you're American at first, and when you tell them you're Canadian they'll apologise profusely. It's funny.



**Sarcasm**

Learn it. Use it. And don't get offended by our cruel jokes. It usually means we like you!



**Racial/Religious tensions**

See Xenophobia above. From personal experience a lot of NZ Europeans are fairly racist towards the Island populations (Tongan, Polynesian). It's not really a fair thing, and I think it's just the culture difference causing the strain. There is tension between Maori and NZ Europeans, but most of it boils down to idiots on both sides not representing their race fairly.



**Libraries and museums**

I like our library/museum culture. We may not have the absolute cream of the crop on display, but it's always nice to wander through quiet museums to get a feel for the local history. I highly recommend Motat (transport museum - not so quiet).

Look at a futuristic universe like, say, Star Trek or Star Wars.  Ignore the technology and plot devices that make the impossible possible (warp drive, transporters, etc) and focus for a moment on the universe itself, the political situation, the state of the human race and the human condition.  There's a sense of getting along with each other.  There's a sense of an ability to resolve problems.  

In the Star Trek universe you have the Federation that functions like the EU or the UN.  It brings people together to solve problems.  It looks for peaceful solutions to problems.  It's an expression of unity.  In the Star Wars universe you're dealing with something a little darker but *fundamentally* it's the same deal.  With the exception of a hiccup for a few decades, you've got a republic with a senate that at some level encourages the same ideals that the Federation does.  Also, and this is key to most mainstream science fiction, you have a situation where, fundamentally, there is always hope.  There is no insurmountable obstacle.

I don't find that kind of universe to be realistic.

Now take a look at a universe like the 40k universe.  This is a really, really dark universe.  Nobody gets along.  Groups that should be willing to get along based on having a common purpose hate each other.  Despite the fact that they all share a subset of goals that are common, the humans, Eldar and Tau can't get along.  Diplomacy doesn't even really exist in this universe.

Now take a look at humanity in this universe.  The Emperor of All Mankind waged a grand crusade to unify humanity and to eliminate the concepts of religion and faith.  In this universe, the Emperor is truly the most powerful human to have ever existed.  He's kind of an enigma.  He could have, at any time really, seized the power of godhood and gotten the whole of humanity to worship him but he didn't.  In fact, in one of the best short stories from the Horus Heresy series he does the exact opposite.  He argues about faith with the last man of the cloth on Earth and destroys the last church on Earth.  Yet at the end of the Horus Heresy he is mortally wounded and entombed within the Golden Throne on Earth to keep him alive.  What happens?  In his absence, worship of the Emperor becomes the official religion of the Empire.  The most powerful organization in the universe becomes the Emperor's Inquisition, which has effectively unlimited power to root out heresy.  The Emperor is no longer this enlightened man championing rationality and reason and leading humanity to great triumph but becomes the Father, Guardian and God of humanity.

And if you look at it, because of all that has happened since the years of the Horus Heresy, the value of human life and the value of a human is nothing.  People live on forge worlds with populations in the hundreds of billions in unthinkable squalor and their sole purpose for existence is in building tools of war or supporting the people who build and utilize the tools of war.

Despite all of this, it's not enough.  Despite the fact that humanity is unified in the purpose of making war; despite the fact that humanity is the most powerful single race in the galaxy; despite the fact that humanity has the greatest soldiers in the galaxy in the Space Marines or the most powerful tools of destruction in the galaxy in the Titan Legions and the Imperial Navy, humanity is losing the war.

I think GW does a great job of summing things up with the opening blurb to every book:

&gt; It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.

&gt; Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.

&gt; To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.

Maybe it's because I have such a dim view of humanity as a whole, I don't know, but I imagine this is a more realistic future for humanity than the (comparative) utopias of Star Trek or Star Wars.  Again ignoring the technology side of things I think if we ever make it out to the stars and find intelligent life we're more likely to try and kill it than make friends with it.

There is some absurdity to it which some people find cool and others dislike in the form of things like 7 foot tall super soldiers who are essentially one-man armies but the universe itself is, in my opinion, so rich and amazing and dark and gritty and, on some level, realistic, that I just love it.

So that's my extremely long-winded explanation as to why I think everyone should give the 40k universe a chance.",1,c6uo097,

Sometimes that means If they earn more money but creating tax loopholes through cronyism than producing jobs then there is less incentive to create jobs and more incentive to increase margin. In the interest of making businesses more profitable, presidential hopeful Romney would promote layoffs as a way to control revenue.  One of tonight's headlines: 

&gt;DETROIT — Shares of General Motors surged Wednesday after the company announced big job cuts in Europe and reported third-quarter earnings that were far better than Wall Street expected.

Exciting news!

We see on Wall Street that laws created to curb graft don't dissuade criminal behavior when the benefit - the  likelihood of getting caught + stiffness of the penalty = a large enough profit then the decision is a no-brainer.

Essentially, I see the argument that the rich, the job creators, will go Galt if we raise their taxes (or threaten their loopholes, or create laws and regulations to protect the leeches of society, etc.) is bunk. The job creators aren't doing anyone any favors when they create jobs. they do it because it makes them more money than not doing it. If cutting jobs makes them more money than not doing it, then there will be layoffs. 

Reich asked - if cutting taxes makes for a robust economy, then how do you explain the recession of 2008 coming on the heels of the Bush tax cuts?  Why all the layoffs and unemployment if the job creators were suddenly license to keep more of what they earn? It didn't stop businesses from deciding they could earn more if they eliminated employees, it didn't stop Romney from hiding money offshore/his grandfathered 1996 Mormon tax shelter.  That's where the money that isn't being taxed at the higher rate is going. The people who are going to invest will still invest because for them, that's the easiest way of making money. 

While Laffer said ""You can't love jobs and hate job creators"" with a straight face, I heard howls of laughter in the audience. 

""I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone -- not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 -- shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain.

This sounds like the whole EU is blaming the UK for opposing the budget.

But it is not like they are the only opposed to the budget.
[Germany shares the same oppionion](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/london-and-berlin-demand-billions-in-cuts-to-proposed-eu-budget-a-864560.html).
The article in [German](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/eu-haushalt-deutschland-lehnt-billionen-budget-ab-a-864432.html)
uses an even stronger headline with saying that Germany is blocking the budget.

Those article don't say where the German politicians wants further cuts. But seeing such a reaction from France and knowing that more than 40% of the budget is used for farming, it seems clear that they also want to cut the CAP.

They are still talking about the budget and I would like to acknowledge that the France position on it is not the position of Continental Europe.

And on a personal note I want to add that this is also one of those times I think the British participation to Europe is needed. 
They are needed to balance the French demands. Alone the German opposition of the budget is not enough to agree on a reasonable budget. Especially since I rate the diplomatic skills of the French much higher than the ones of their German counterparts. 
I think that it is highly possibly that France joins arms with some of the other members of ClubMed (maybe in return of a grow package they will vote for). 
Isolating Germany even more from their Eurozone partners. 


While you really seem to be well informed about Europe, I don't know your knowledge about the German post-war Psyche  
Germany will not defend it position against the rest, they will agree on a compromise. German European politics only consist of the ""Scheckbuch"" (Translation: checkbook ) and compromises. 
We never defended our position or morals point of view to the bitter end. and since we can't use our checkbooks to solve the problems (because we don't have enough money) we will try to find a compromise.

Some Muslim immigrants admit their bias quite openly. An Islamic Mufti in Copenhagen sparked a political outcry after publicly declaring that women who refuse to wear headscarves are ""asking for rape."" Apparently, he's not the only one thinking this way. “It is not as wrong raping a Swedish girl as raping an Arab girl,” says Hamid. “The Swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards, and she had probably fucked before, anyway. But the Arab girl will get problems with her family. For her, being raped is a source of shame. It is important that she retains her virginity until she marries.” It was no coincidence that it was a Swedish girl that was gang raped in Rissne – this becomes obvious from the discussion with Ali, Hamid, Abdallah and Richard. All four have disparaging views on Swedish girls, and think this attitude is common among young men with immigrant background. “It is far too easy to get a Swedish whore…… girl, I mean;” says Hamid, and laughs over his own choice of words. “Many immigrant boys have Swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers. But when they get married, they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy. That’s what I am going to do. I don’t have too much respect for Swedish girls. I guess you can say they get fucked to pieces.

You *assume* that they arose naturally.

I assumed that once, too. But what if it's a trait they inherited from Denisovans?

Asians only diverged from Caucasoids some 20,000 years ago. They're an extremely young race. North Asians cluster closer to Caucasoids than Southern Asians. And now in Southern Asians (i.e., Malaysians, Borneans, etc.) we found genetic evidence of crossbreeding with Denisovans.

My point is that the human race is surprisingly static. 20,000 years is not a long time in terms of human history. To put that in perspective, the Welsh have been in the British Isles some 30,000 years. Iberians have been in Spain and Portugal between 40,000 and 50,000 years. And when you dig up skulls from those time-periods, the people look remarkably modern. An Iberian skull from 45,000 years ago looks like a modern Western European in every respect. They haven't ""evolved"" since the upper paleolithic.

Here's a famous reconstruction of a Cromagnon Man from the upper paleolithic: http://www.davidpratt.info/americas/amer8-4.jpg

If you placed him in modern 21st Century France, he wouldn't look out of place at all.

So, no, I disagree with you wholeheartedly about your assumptions that we're ""evolving"" at these rapid clips. The fossil evidence kind of refutes that. So if Western Europeans haven't massively changed in appearance over 50,000 years, what happened to Mongoloids after only 20,000 years?

What accounts for their sudden shift in appearance, height, biochemistry, etc.?

Why don't they look like the Caucasoids that they branched off of?

The answer may just be that they encountered Denisovans. And that these traits we think of as ""Asian"" are in fact Denisovan traits.

Because let's face it: 50,000 years and little or no change in European appearance? 100,000 years and little or no change in sub-Saharan appearance?

Yet only 20,000 years and boom: Asians?

Something's not right here. Other population groups aren't suddenly shifting and morphing over the same time-period.

And now we know for a fact that they bred with Denisovans.

I think circumstantially Coon's theory makes more sense than the older ""They-evolved-that-way"" theory. If that were true, than a European from 50,000 years ago shouldn't look like modern Europeans. But they do.

Europe had been virtually mined clean of gold, at least to the depths that they could reasonably mine before the invention of the steam engine.

The Mamluks held a total monopoly on spice trade with the east, and charged Italy whatever they wanted. I remember reading about how one year the Venetians had to pool basically all of the gold they had in the city just to buy their year's supply of pepper (which was needed for food preservation, etc) out of Alexandria.

Slightly tangential, but the Mamluk monopoly on spice trade and subsequent gold crisis was the direct cause of (a) the foundation of a fiat currency banking system and (b) exploration to a new route to the East via ship, both of which were major causes of the Renaissance.

Bottom line is, putting the crown's value in terms of loafs of bread is nearly impossible because (a) you don't buy loafs of bread with ducats and (b) the value of the ducat varied heavily with the scarcity of gold currency, which was all over the map through the 1500s.",3,c6uohkw,

http://www.compasscayman.com/cfr/2011/01/05/Riots-or-responsibility--Lessons-from-Sweden/

""The fall and rise of Sweden
Many European countries now seem to have little choice but to perform agonising austerity measures to avoid the collapse of their economies. But this is not the only path to reform. Sweden serves as a good example of a democratic country that has changed its course in a radical way after being mired in debt and suffering from economic stagnation, while avoiding the street protests.

In the beginning of the 1990s, Sweden was a lost child in the world economy. After gaining political power in the 1930s, the Social Democratic party took on the task of building the Swedish welfare state. The goal was to save its people from all ills. The state would not only protect the citizens from unemployment, but also protect the nation from swings in the economy. At first, classic Keynesian policies were followed – public spending increased in economic downturns and grew more modestly during periods of economic growth. The model seemed to be working fine until the industrial job market declined in the 1960s and 1970s. With the rise in unemployment, the social welfare system expanded rapidly while an ever larger share of the workforce was employed in the public sector.

An economy cannot thrive on government subsidies. For Sweden, that became clear with the oil crisis in the 1970s. By then, the country was notoriously business unfriendly, with both excessive regulation and prohibitively high tax rates.

To “protect” domestic industries in harsh times, huge amounts of tax revenues were wasted on dying sectors, most notably the ship building industry. To keep up with the spending, the maximum marginal income tax rate had reached 87 per cent in 1979. Yet this did not keep the public debt from soaring, which peaked in 1996 at 76 per cent of GDP.

The reversal of the Swedish, socialist/welfare state model started with the deregulation of the financial sector in the 1980s. In the beginning of the 1990s, Sweden suffered a major banking and financial crisis, primarily brought on by mistakes in monetary policy, as well as the continued drag from counterproductive taxing, spending and regulatory policies. This crisis made it apparent for officials of most political colours that the existing Swedish economic model would not be sustainable over the long run.

An observer of the Swedish crisis almost 20 years ago might have anticipated a scenario like the one we saw in Greece in 2010. But, since the early 1990s, Sweden has not only been recovering, but seems to be coming out of the current economic crisis in a much stronger position.""

To paraphrase Marx : government ownership of the means of production.

Now if we look to Europe, we find people who call themselves socialists.  Namely in France the 'Parti socialiste', the German Social Democrats etc.  They're not afraid of the word.  Their agenda is basically ""government control of most of the economy through regulations, laws, taxes, redistribution, social programs etc"".  Many european countries have over 50% total tax rates.  That, to me, is government control over the economy when they control half the money.

In my opinion, that's what the president thinks is a good system.  Many of the left sing the praises of European social democracy.  That's his agenda.  Health care reform puts 20% of our economy under federal control, and the control will only tighten with new laws, regulations, mandates etc.

For Germany I'd focus on the Rhine River valley and Munich, heading down to Fussen and up to Dachu. That would be at least a week. A little expensive for a Yank at the current exchange rate, but not bad. Book your rail pass before you go and have reservations at hostels ahead of time. A good WiFi app (free spots) helps too. 

For the UK it depends on time - I lived there and in Germany years ago. London is fantastic but insanely expensive for a student. Must sees are Parliament (make a reservation if you can), the Eye and Windsor. You can save a little staying out of the city, but you burn time traveling. Oxford is worth a day, and the Lake District is a nice couple of days if you like nature. Heading to Lands End and Tintagel (King Arthur's alleged castle) is fun. If you have time I'd add Edinburgh. 

Spain is big - if you have time it can be worth spending more time there just because it is less expensive than the other places and, in some ways, it is more interesting. The concern this coming summer will be the political climate - there have been many riots and protests. 

Rome is fascinating, but again I would spend a little time there and either head north or south.

As to stories, well, there are a million. I will share my time in Scandinavia as warning.   No political issues, but a single young man ran into a public square and started destroying a police car that had just parked. No one did anything, and he ripped off the lights and smashed the window, then took off. I was more concerned there than I've been in the USSR, China, Vietnam or Israel - it wasn't that things don't happen everywhere, but that it was unexpected relative to the reputation.  When you have all your things in a pack out in public you lose a lot of your options. Always be aware and have fun (and yes, you should go and never be 'that' afraid). 

The other thought is to research Rick Steves' and his books - he focuses on Europe and has good tips. The focus is to avoid the 'common' places if you have time. For example, Hallstatt has a salt mine and an ice cave within 10km. It is an hour out of Salzburg and still a bit touristy, but they are things most people never see and better than 'an old castle that some dead dude lived in'.

I'm saying that, like language itself, it is a social and cultural reality. We need to be clear here. The construction of race we have inherited, though rejected by many in an attempt to ""forget it"" (usually those least affected by race), is something that has been a reality since colonialism. 

Colonialism installed European ancestry as the dominant imperial force across the planet, and with the military and technological benefits of developing in Eurasia spread the construct of ""Race"" across the world. Colonized subjects had their inferiority justified by their race, and lost complete sovereignty over their fate. 

Over centuries, independence from Europe spread. First with the white nations, finally on to the darker ""races.""

These independent nations continued their inherited racial hierarchies and inscribed ""race"" into the law. This continued for centuries, even through a Civil War; the Reconstruction failed. Blacks had to wait a century for the Civil Rights Movement. 

They had to wait until White people decided to finally get sick of it themselves, and for a racist Justice system to grant them equality. 

And now, today, White people want us to **""just forget about it guise, that was totally so long ago.**

It was not so long ago. Racial stratification is clear as day. 20% Black unemployment. Huge gaps in median income. Less access to computers, internet, education, cultural and real capital.  Oh, and the racism.  It's easy *for you* to forget it, because it plays no role in your life. It does for us. White people don't think of themselves as white on a daily basis. White is ""normal"" and everyone else is ""the black guy.""",1,c6upi9i,

Forget about the KKK and the propaganda that you are brainwashed by, and look at your friends that are white and the people that you know.   Now look at your friends that are minorities, blacks, jews, asians, and arabs.

There is no doubt as to who is more racist and more racially sensitive.     

Multiculturalism has brainwashed whites to implicitly recognize that minoriities have deep attachments to their racial group, and recognize by this very fact that humans have a natural love of their ethnic group. 

Yet, these cultural marxists call upon whites to deny their history and deny any pride of being a european.  You have to pretend that european culture did not create great advances in morality, common law, and that they created america and canada.  

Minorities stand for authentic traditions, vibrancy, color, and persecution  by whites.  Educated people are indoctrinated with this view and to be educated, you simply criticize all things that promote european culture.

The hatred some of these people have towards whites is palpable.    The KKK is not relevant to this discussion, because it is a fringe group, and what is happening to white european culture is the destruction of it.  

You may welcome a country where whites are a minority and lose their ethnic power, something that all ethnicities, except whites, try to hold onto.  But one thing about these blessed minorities, is that they have deep hatred for whites, and they might not be so kind to us when they are in power.

### Initial experiences

I first switched out bash:instigation for weapon throw:mighty throw, and my largest initial fear with the build seemed to have been justified. Getting that very first burst of fury, to be able to cast battle rage is __fraught with peril__. I can't tell the amount of times I have been 1 shotted by random elite phasebeasts on the azm spawn point in core of arreat.

Once battle rage is cast though, it's a ridiculously smooth ride from there on in. But god help you if you die in something like an uber fight, and then have to try and be hit by something that won't kill you out right.

The other problem I had with it, is survivability. I have been using tough as nails for 2 reasons only, specifically keeping my armor at a reasonable level when cursed by fscking succubi .. and also when fighting uber SB.. without it he is actually able to hurt me.

It took me a bit of fiddling, but i finally switched overpower:crushing advance for rend: blood lust. What a difference this made!

### And now ?

My runs are a lot more interesting, although I am not sure they are 'faster' per se. I've been farming on MP6 recently, because even if I could handle MP7 with ease, i didnt like how long extra health succubus and occultist packs were taking to wear down. All that running around after them was exhausting. With weapon throw however? HAH. Stuff just cant run away from me anymore, i'll just pick them off at a distance and loot their corpse.

The switch to rend also increased my DPS to such a degree that I could comfortably start farming MP7, and not leave much trash alive in one pass through. I now finally feel comfortable increasing my HP to a much higher number, because I know I'm capable of healing it to full during most fights.

I've been able to keep WOTB up through entire alkaiser runs on mp5+ (and 1.0.4) using bash, but weapon throw makes this child's play. On mp7, i can recharge 2/3 of my wotb timer on a single scorpion I find in a jar. A large part of this is probably due to me being an IAS fetishist. In (perma) zerker, my attack speed is 2.6/2.8 with plans to get it over 3APS. This means that my weapons fly so fast, that it far exceeds the requirement to keep zerker up and running. 

When I am fighting Ubers, I switch to the stun rune and a lot of previously painful encounters become like baby town frolics. I can keep kulle stunned almost all of the time, and when he teleports somewhere new, he gets stunned before he gets to do anything. I just need to run in now and then to keep rend on him. Since you can't pound on magda without her shield going up, ive taken to ww'ing around leoric and every three or four turns i zip out and stun her. This significantly reduces the number of rogue butterflies flying around, and makes reviving people a shit ton easier.",1,c6uplov,

In fact, culture here continues to morph continually as you said. Just look at the difference between the '90s and 00's, most of us can remember the difference between then and now. 

&gt;See the thing is, all throughout the world among non-european nation, its the western culture which is sweeping through. If you go to India, western culture is the biggest menace to the conservatives. If you go to Middle East, Pakistan, or to European countries, anywhere if people have rejected their own culture and values, its in the favor of western values.

I agree that 'Western Culture' (American Culture) has influence all across the world. But I hold the belief that this is not generally a good thing. Think about the stereotypical American for a moment, a fat, unintelligent, uneducated, irresponsible individual whom rides his fat mobile down to wal-mart then stops at McDonalds for lunch after he's done shopping and then goes home to watch the football game. Now granted, that is a massive over generalization of the American public but I'm sorry to say that there are more of these people than there should be. The point I'm trying to make is that 'values' really isn't the right word to be used when it comes to American Culture. 

This topic really is complex so there's really no way I can get into this without writing you a 10 page essay. To truly give you my perspective I feel that I need to talk about technological advancements, and the dangers those technological improvements have the ability to inflict. Also the importance of history and traditions, dangers of modern corporatism and globalization and quite a few other factors.

But to put it plainly, I believe we are living in a very dangerous age.

This with the superior advanced technology will conquer the lesser technological societies through time and all ages, and write the rules to it's own advantage. It is the nature of man to covet what is not theirs, and to justify the taking. Wrong or right. 

Hawaii stood no chance once other nations began to industrialize first. Even though they did trade, and welcomed Europeans with open arms. Hawaiians were not prepared for Machiavellian strategy of European nations nor Washington. That being said if it was not the Europeans or Americans. It would have been another industrial nation like Japan or Russia, who btw did establish a fort. It's like nature. The large shark swallows the reef fish. Hawaii sad to say was that reef fish. 

The only way Hawaii will have it's independence is if all people are accepted as Hawaiians, and they all come together and revolutionize through peaceful means like Gandhi organized. Also Hawaii will have to make conditions and allow the USA maintain Pearl Harbor. Otherwise Hawaii will have to wait until the USA falls as a nation with no military to support. Then again unless Hawaii has the economic might to build a superior military then it is open to the whim of the next despot who wants these islands who has the force to take it.

We want it too but the bloody EU demands we have open borders. Its arisen to some pretty bad situations in the UK, i.e. more immigrants + less jobs + worsening education = impoverished youth and scenes like the London riots cropping up.

I live in the mainland of England in a city called Leicester. Birmingham, London, Liverpool, Nottingham etc all have tons of immigrants and little low end jobs and as a consequence have some of the worst crime rates going (as in you will literally be stabbed for being English in some areas).

But Leicester takes the biscuit. It's the only city in the country where whites are a minority (and that's including French, Germans, Polish). Everyone else is from all over the shop, mostly Pakistan, Turkey, India, Northern Africa, Middle east.

Not wanting to stereotype but Indians tend to be the best, they know what British culture is, we have history, they value education etc. 

But there are a lot of Muslims there, a lot of everything, Jews, Muslims, Christians, Academics, Buddhists. All in such close proximity. From an academic point of view its pretty awesome because everything is so raw, you're exposed to so many different cultures daily and it really does broaden the mind without having to travel.

On the other hand it is a massive problem, all of the Muslims have ghettoized themselves into the poorer parts of the city, which you do not go to if you are not Muslim. The older ones do not know British culture and are hell bent on imposing their way of life on everyone. The youth are mostly bad Muslims, they are very violent and incredibly rude, constantly causing trouble with black youths and white youths. 

The London gang culture affects most youth in the cities but mix that in with religious prejudice and hatred and you have a volatile mix. 

For instance my friend was walking back from a club by himself one night, he was carrying a bottle beer, some Arabs pulled up next to him in their car and jumped him, started trying to kick the crap out of him. Luckily he was an Irish pikey so he had been in scraps before and didn't come out too bad, but the fact that it can happen to anyone is a bit distressing.

Various times I've been shouted at on the streets by random people and I've seen many kids going to school littering in my garden, smoking etc. Really I blame the parents because they just don't have a fucking clue when it comes to raising children, but in the UK if you have a child then you get a free house and benefits.

That was quite a lot but let me summarise:
1. Immigration can be a good thing but in the UK it is destroying our society
2. Bad parenting, mixed with a system that rewards doing less, gang culture and fundamentalist religions means we are all going to have a bad time.
3. Government not even coming close to addressing the issue means its only getting worse.
4. The streets aren't safe, I've been in a fight in broad day light, in the city center while I was just out shopping and not to mention the riot we had over immigration back in 2010.",6,c6ur6v6,

When the British came to Australia, they found a people who had no legal system, no leaders, no government. In other places, they had found native leaders with whom to make treaties to acquire the land; they couldn't find these people in Aboriginal society.

In addition to this, there was no development, such as one would see in ""civilisation"": farms, towns, roads, and so on. The Aborigines didn't use land in the same way as Europeans. Most importantly, the Aborigines didn't seem to have permanent residences, or make ongoing use of any piece of land. Therefore, the British assumed that the Aborigines didn't *own* the land. If possession is nine-tenths of the law, then *lack of* possession is also nine-tenths of the law.

Therefore, the British ruled that there was no legal ownership of the land in Australia. And, where there's no legal owners, everything's up for grabs.

Of course, it helped that this gave the British exactly what they wanted: a legal way to acquire the land.

&gt; it was common for settlers to have ""picnics"" where they'd hunt the Aborigines for sport. is this true? how common was the practice if it's not made up?

As for ""picnics"" such as you've described, these did exist. There are eyewitness accounts of them, from both white fellas and black fellas.

A notable case was [the Myall Creek Massacre](http://www.myallcreekmassacre.com/Myall_Creek_Massacre/The_Massacre.html), which is unusual in that it's almost the only time that the British culprits were arrested and convicted of murder. During that trial, it was indicated that these people were doing something which was common practice. However, it's not clear just  how common these killings were. The ones we know about are only the ones which were mentioned or recorded. There may be many which were not diarised.

- Commuting

It rarely snows in the North Island, much more often in the South Island. Many people do cycle to work, but if you're planning on living in Wellington and to a lesser degree Auckland you will have to get used to biking up large hills. Auckland is very spread out and it will take you forever to bike to work unless you live close. 

- Jobs

If you're looking for a software development job Auckland and Wellington are your best bet, there's always jobs being advertised. Immigrants can sometimes be unpleasantly surprised to find that some jobs get paid less in NZ than in other places in the world. [Seek](http://www.seek.co.nz) will give you an idea of what kind of pay you might expect.

- Xenophobia

Like many places, this is found in a greater degree in our older and more rural citizens. Places like Auckland and Wellington are very multicultural but you still hear the occasional story about Asian or Indian people being verbally abused. NZ is a nice place to live but not utopia. 

Be aware that people are going to assume you're American (just like we get mistaken for Australians) and there are people who are very against many aspects of America's foreign policy. The vast majority of NZers are extremely anti-war for example and we have a history of tension over our banning of nuclear ships entering our waters in the 80s.

- Canadians

I have had the same thought about the similarities between our nations. We both have larger and more powerful (many would say more arrogant) neighbours. You won't have any problems being Canadian in NZ.

- Humour

That's our type of humour, everyone is like that. We like our humour dark and the greater we like someone the greater we insult them. It may come off as mean to other cultures, but if you don't think you can handle it then fuck off cunt. 

- Religious/racial tension

Most NZers keep their religion to themselves, we are a heavily secular society. Yes there is still tension between Maori and Europeans. There are the same issues faced by any nation that was colonised.

- Libraries

Most cities have libraries and museums, I have no info on job availability sorry.

- Megathread

We just don't like people asking the same questions when they obviously haven't done any research at all. You're fine. 

- Other stuff

There's not really much difference in accents in NZ. Some places at the bottom of the South Island roll their Rs more than the rest of the country but that's about it. Now, we do have a metric shitload of slang that is unique to NZ, and it might pay to do some research. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/u04le/i_am_conducting_an_experiment/c4r9u8o) is a start. 

If you're looking for the sunniest spot, Nelson usually has the most sunshine hours. It's pretty tiny and you might have some trouble finding an IT job there. 

Don't take anyone too seriously in NZ. We're joking. Probably.

* You have a major UK credit or debit card.

Also, laws generally apply based on the county in which you are resident rather than the country of which you are a citizen. You pay taxes at the rate of the country in which you are living, and if you want to buy a beer in the UK then you have to wait until you are 18, even though other countries have a lower legal age.

Because more LoH and/or lifesteal didn't do it for me, I changed my approach. After doing some reading, I went Blackthorne's Set: 2p bonus - 100 vit and Life Regeneration on each item. So in the end, to my 1100 LoH, the added 1100 life regeneration, greatly increased my survival chances.

To put this in perspective, some numbers: the UK's net contribution to the EU is something like €6-9bn. They are arguing over a 5% increase, so about €300-450m (or £250-350m). The UK's budget is about £600bn (with a £90bn deficit), with tax evasion costing [about £70bn a year](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/11/tax-avoidance-justice-network).

Money going to the EU might actually get spent on something useful (it seems it is some of the Internet infrastructure programmes which are being cut at the moment, if [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_xpYXoo8q4) is anything to go by), rather than money that will be diverted by the Tories to companies such as G4S (incidentally, who have operating income of around £500m - more than this argument is about).

That may not be a bad thing on its own, but may force him to take other actions to try to make himself look stronger.

As for the expensive/home made stuff - I am all for it, but you need to understand that in some societies people value things differently and they see expensive stuff as a social status. They will spend their entire monthly income on a smartphone. They will live in 1 room apartments but they will drive a BMW. They value tangible expensive stuff over anything else, and this is at the societal level. Everybody does it. 


People with cheap stuff are looked down upon and not being willing to make the huge sacrifice to get a loan to buy an iPhone is seen as something stupid. An average salary in Bulgaria is 300$ per month, the smartphone prices are the same. I've seen hundreds of people taking loan for this kind of stuff.

I'll tell you why: I've travelled abroad enough to realize the problems of adjusting to new cultures and customs, especially where there is a language barrier. It can be very difficult and you can innocently offend someone very simply with one small move or a wrong gesture. Assimilating is tough when you don't have a lot of knowledge about a culture and travel books can only provide so much information. 

But here's the deal...want to understand Halloween in America? Here's how tough it is:

1. DRESS UP (as anything. Literally. Hobo, vampire, homeless person, gypsy...nobody gives a shit. 

2. Knock on ANY door and say 'trick or treat!'

3. Hold out bag, collect candy. 

4. Repeat for 2 hours. Go home, eat candy. 

That's literally the extent of it. How long does it take to teach this? How much care was involved in conveying that oh-so complex cultural element?

The thing is, ALMOST NO Americans understand the history of Halloween and none of them care. There is no cultural depth or history of importance like something you'd see with Christmas. 

It is literally that simple: dress up, knock on doors, yell 'trick or treat' and collect candy. Suggesting that it takes more than five minutes to 'teach' that is absurd. That's why OP's post comes off as self-absorbed unctuousness. A dog could learn the 'specifics of our culture and Halloween '

That's the truth. Sure there is a history to it that originated in Europe and was brought over to America but it's long lost and only explored on history channel shows late at night at this point. Just as Christmas is mostly about gifts at this point, Halloween is about free candy. 

It's a shame but American culture tends to boil things down to the lowest common denominator and the substance ends up getting lost over time when it comes to holidays. ",-3,c6urnnv,

Saying that we were right to take down the Taliban for actively defending Osama is not even remotely close to saying we should attack Pakistan for not telling us he was there.  Reductio ad absurdum here is taking it down to ""we should attack anyone who defended Osama"". It's not that simple, and thus you can't apply reductio here.

We disagree on basically everything else.  What's done in the past is done.  We pissed them off a while ago, that doesn't give them permission to perform acts of war on civilian targets.  That's exactly the same reasoning that says that it's morally acceptable to discriminate against white people.  Also, yes I damn well support the 60 million deaths it took to stop a maniacal dictator who thought nothing of ordering the deaths of an entire race.  I wish the deaths weren't necessary, but the options were die fighting, or die in a gas chamber when Hitler ruled all of Europe because no one would stop him.

&gt;Lets list the things I never said:

&gt; You act like all we did and do over there is kill innocent people to get our jollies.


&gt;I say I support the war, but regret that civilians died, and you respond with ""you support civilian murder""

&gt;Okay, those aside, lets answer some questions:

I've said multiple times that every death is a bad thing, and shouldn't happen to begin with, yet you continue asking me if I find the casualty numbers acceptable or agree with them.  

The past is irrelevant at this point.  The only ones who hate us bad enough to attack are the radical Islam sects.  We do the best with what we're given, and peace is not an option once they start killing civilians. You let it slide once, they do it again worse, and then again worse than that, and so on, and so on.-

Given the option, I would vastly prefer no war at all, and total world peace is an ideal endpoint, but that was not an option.  As of now, we should finish restabilizing Afganistan and Iraq, then get out.  

War in general is reprehensible, but once it's started, the options are lay down and die, or fight back.  Don't talk to me about Washington and Jefferson, Jefferson didn't have a war to deal with.  Washington was the commander in chief of the revolutionary army, even with his pacifistic views, he recognized that sometimes pacificity is not a viable solution.  You just supported my point even more by the mention of Washington.

&gt;If the US had never gotten involved in their politics, forcing undesirable commercial situations and setting up terrorist groups like al qaeda then they might still have a good view of the US. 

So the fact that we meddled in their politics and made some money off of them means that we sat up Al-Qaeda, and that all the innocent people in the WTC deserved to die?

Basically what I'm getting from this is that you want pacifism over war at all costs.  Would you defend yourself from a mugger, who you fired from his job 15 years ago, who had a knife and decided he didn't want to leave a witness?  If so, if you'd rather not lay down and die, then you're being hypocritical.",2,c6uroqq,

 Putem sa cautam mult timp si sa ajungem la aceiasi concluzie. Da, propaganda se refera si la omul de rand, dar se refere *mai degraba* la cea de tip politic facuta de un partid/entitate/etc. 



Propaganda is a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position **by presenting only one side of an argument** *Propaganda is usually repeated and dispersed over a wide variety of media in order to create the chosen result in audience attitudes.*
As opposed to impartially providing information, propaganda, in its most basic sense, *presents information primarily to influence an audience*. Propaganda often presents facts selectively (thus possibly lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or uses loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented. The desired result is a change of the attitude toward the subject in the target audience to further a political or religious agenda. Propaganda can be used as a form of political warfare.--wikipedia

I understand what you are saying. Remember: EU law only applies when you travel between different EU States. 

As you pointed out, Gibraltar is part of the EU (true). Now you just have to make the case that it's a different State than the UK and you're set.

Only, that's a case that is hard to make. As you pointed out: ""The Treaties apply to Gibraltar **as a European territory for whose external relations a Member State is responsible**."" Furthermore, because of a declaration of the UK in 1982 Gibraltarians are to be counted as British nationals for the purposes of Community law. All Gibraltarians have since been granted full British citizenship. In the 2004 European Parliament election the territory formed part of the South West England constituency of the United Kingdom, so it didn't have elections in its own rights. The inclusion was unsuccessfully challenged by Spain before the European Court of Justice. Gibraltar is part of the EU, but only under the responsibility of the UK. It's not a different State than the UK.

But why look at Gibraltar and not at Spain, where you live? I'm actually going to look this up, but I guess it has to do with the background of the freedoms, which is making one common European market.

If your building isn't to code, it should be reported to the city. Rentals have to go through inspection, if it doesn't meet electrical codes, the electric company won't install a meter, or they will pull the meter.

I doubt the wiring in the building is still in it's original form since the 1930's. The codes get updated every three years, if it were still wired like it was in the 30's most of your appliances would probably have killed themselves by now. (I am assuming you live in the United States, I have no clue about European Codes)

I am not going to go into too much detail, because I have already edited this post about ten times because it got way too long to read.

There are two different types of electricity being used in your computer. One is the AC feed from the wall, the rest of it is DC power. Since you're asking about the AC feed from the wall, I won't talk endlessly and ramble about DC power, like I am known to.

You have a three pronged plug that goes into the wall. The two blade prongs are electrical feed and the round prong is the ground. AC is Alternating Current. Residential electricity alternates between the two prongs at 60 Hertz.  Basically, 60 times a second those prongs alternate between approximately +120 VAC and -120 VAC. (Most of the time it's not that even, it's usually around 114-116 VAC).

Inside the power supply, after where it plugs in, there are two types of overload protection (not grounding). Either a physical breaker/fuse or basically a circuit that will overheat and open. ""Open"" meaning shut the circuit off. [Going into detail can get tedious, this is what the schematic for a small PC power supply looks like](http://www.pavouk.org/hw/atxps.png). 

So technically, even without a ground, you're protected. One leg of the input power is fused. If your PC were to start malfunctioning and pulling more current than it was designed to, it would pop that fuse or circuit.

But the ground on your PC cord is a necessity. If that fuse or circuit that protects you were to fail, the case has the potential to become electrified.  Most of the electricity would however run directly to ground. Meaning that it would travel in, and right back out to ground, more than likely tripping a breaker in your apartment due to excessive current flow. Redundancy with electricity isn't a bad thing.  

The chances of it happening are slim, shorts to the chassis are usually *after* the input voltage changes from AC to low voltage DC.  But the potential is there for AC short to chassis is there.

When electricity ""goes to ground"" it goes to a non-conductive earthen ground. Meaning it's dumped to something that won't conduct electricity, like physically the ground outside. It can be a large 6-8 foot piece of 1/2"" solid copper rod driven into the ground.

Your ground (in this case) does nothing if the circuit is working correctly.  It may pick up and remove static electricity, or minimal amounts of electricity being transferred to your case but for the most part, the ground is there when the circuit starts doing something it isn't intended to do. 

This changes depending on what type of ground you're speaking of, in this case, I am talking about chassis grounds.  Without the ground in that case, you may notice a hum from speakers or headphones, in *some* computers, the signal ground is connected to the chassis ground.

The wiring in your building will have a minimal effect on your PC as your PC power supply has a tolerance level. It has a minimum/maximum input level for both voltage and frequency. It's usually a pretty wide tolerance too.  So it doesn't need *exactly* 120VAC/60Hertz it needs *relatively close to* that number. Unless you notice your lights dimming from bright, to almost out and you're blowing light bulbs constantly, you're more than likely okay.

The power supply regulates the DC power after the AC input. If you're using a laptop, the charging block will regulate the AC input. 

I am done editing this, it got long anyway. Sorry.

There already is a ProMode in tf2, it's called 6v6 (or 9v9) with ESEA or EU banlist. 
-----------------------------------------

Now, I think what you're trying to get at is great **in theory** but looking at the state of the current scene I don't think it would work.

TF2 has a fairly large playerbase, but a small competitive scene; the pub play can be so wildly different from the competitive play. Now what would a mod do? Create a game mode that functions in the same way the current competitive 6s play does (maybe with an option to play highlander). So it would esentially be a PUG but have the added feature of finding it in game with the server browser. 

But who would be interested in this mod, especially coming from existing pub play? Look at the number of players TF2 has at a given time and look at the size of the competitive scene. The people who would benefit the most from a mod that is ProMode would be people who **want** to get into competitive play in the first place. 

The people who you would need to help build the mod (and keep it running) though, the existing community, would probably never agree on what is right for the mod. I know you can never please anyone, but it's easy to reject a mod when there is existing solutions (some would probably argue better solutions) to get into a comp environment. There are a lot of channels for pugs and introduction to the comp side considering how tiny the scene is. 

The balances you talked about already exist in different leagues. 
There are already certain maps that are for league play (_pro versions etc), there are existing ban lists, there are class restrictions (6v6 or 9v9) already but it is organized in a different fashion. 


I don't know what you could do that the existing community has already done in terms of balance. Sure NA has a larger unlock list than EU but it's existed for a while, and while a change to vanilla wouldn't be the most upsetting thing, I don't think many NA players would *vote* for that. Better management in game would be great for people who don't know much to start hosting a ""comp server"" but again it goes to the issue of who would fill these. 

Unless there is a radical change in the way TF2 is developed, like a feature of adding a built in lobby system, I don't think a mod would gain much traction.

**EDIT**: 

I guess I see what you say about weapon balances but I there are only a few balances that could be done to change much (that you would have people agree on at least). I.E. If you tried to buff the pyro for comp play. That's probably the first class you could alter to fit in a 6v6 format. It could definitely spice up the 6s play but I don't think it can be done with many other classes (maybe I'm not creative enough). Besides the cookie cutter in 6s, the other classes are too slow, or pick classes.

If you do more than this (like altering the heavy that he is not like the heavy at all), then you're making a new game and then... well, it would have to be a balance with the existing 6s or 9v9 game for there to be a crossover with the current scene. ",2,c6us2g6,

If you only look at the subject from one side, then your perspective is skewed. You unknowingly make political statements and spread propaganda.

Israel and Palestine is a very complicated issue. Watching one documentary take from one side's point of view isn't going to educate you.

Not all attacks against Israel is due to anti-Semitism. But there are a lot of people in Europe that automatically take Palestine's side without any thought on any issue. Why do they do this? Why do people have a knee jerk reaction to anything going on in the Middle East and jump to the conclusion that ""it's all Israel's fault""?

I have long discussions with people on Israel, and in the end you ask ""what is your long-term solution to the problem?"" The scary thing is their answer is basically ""the Jews should just fuck off"". Where should they go? ""I don't care."" And that is where it becomes anti-Semitism. Europeans tried to exterminate the Jews, and instead of realising that their actions directly lead to the situation in Israel now, they take zero responsibility, and simply think the Jews shouldn't fight for their survival and just lay down and die. The Arabs don't accept that they tried to destroy Israel from day one, again saying the Jews should just go back to Israel, and accept whatever fate Europeans have for them.

It's sort of like the Birther movement in the US. Technically they just want to prove Obama wasn't born in the US, and therefore not eligible to be President. But underneath that is an irrational racist notion that ""A black man is not eligible to be President."" No one wants to think of them self as a racist, but racism motivates people to construct some reason that is not racist to cover up their racism.

This is similar to what's happened with Israel. No one wants to think of themselves as an anti-Semite. But that feeling motivates people to look for reasons to hate Israel. Saying ""I hate Jews"", will turn people against you. Saying ""I hate Israel because the oppress Palestinians"" makes you look like you're sticking up for the oppressed.

Now there are a lot of people that aren't thinking this way. But just like the Birther movement, when you have a calm rational discussion about the subject, it becomes apparent that the arguments aren't rational. Some people can get to the point where they can say ""Yeah this is a complicated issue. Both sides have done wrong, both sides need to make compromises. But when the end of the discussion gets to ""The Jews should just fuck off"", what is the real motivation for that person's arguments?

Anyway, the point is, there is a hell of a lot of propaganda. On both sides. Take what you see and read with a grain of salt. Whenever you read anything on Israel or Palestine, always think of the motivations of the people talking to you. Are they describing what's going on? Or are they trying to get you to take sides?",1,c6us2tc,

I think it's only right (and reasonable) for me to go point by point through your counterargument, and here it goes:

&gt; If you put yourself into a clearly dangerous situation and are then are harmed, are you NEVER to take any blame/responsibility for what happened?

&gt; &gt; A clearly dangerous situation? Having drinks with a friend is a clearly dangerous situation?

As I said, alcohol is a poison, a drug, that changes, affects, and undermines the drinker's thoughts, actions, behavior, self-control, and decision-making. And it's a fact that females have lower tolerance for alcohol than males, AND that much fewer females are alcoholics. I don't know if you have experience with drunkenness, but somehow 1 drink becomes 2, and 2 becomes 3, and 3, 4, and so on... Fateful words: ""What harm could one more drink do?"" or ""Another drink never hurt anyone.""

&gt; This wasn't a brutal ambush by a stranger on an dark street at night--and if THAT were the case, I'd have very different advice on how to deal with what happened

&gt; &gt; You don't seem to know very much about rape, lucky you! You might wanna check some statistics, the majority of rape cases isn't committed by strangers in dark alleys, but by friends, relatives, partners. But bear in mind that these statistics only include cases that were reported, and many rape survivors never file a report, especially if they were raped by a person close to them.

I know that statistic is true, and hey, given how she feels now, I DON'T think she would have wanted to sleep with him that night if she were sober, but she made herself un-sober, and that was her own doing. Are you going to say that she may have also been forcibly pressured into drinking by others (males or females) earlier in the night?

I think there's an obvious cultural issue at play here, and this may sound like an extreme generalization, but I think it applies to the situation, and I'd like to hear your answer to the question at the end of this paragraph: over the past 10 years, I've spent time living in 4 other countries (Brazil, France, Italy, Romania, and Russia) and have traveled to a few more, and have also met, dated, pursued, been reject by, and befriended foreign girls from many different countries since I've moved back to New York, and I can say with a great deal of certainty that foreign girls (at least ones from Europe and Latin America, at least) have a much stronger instinct about men, and are much quicker and readier to suspect--and rightly so--that a guy in private, one-on-one, is going to try to get sexually physical pretty soon. They are definitely much quicker to flatly reject a guy's advances, laugh in his face, push him away, slap him, or even hit him--they are much tougher and more streetwise about men than American girls SEEM to be... They START OFF distrusting a man's intentions, or at least tending to believing that men are dogs, regardless of how much a man strains to seem sensitive or pure-intentioned. If this sounds totally outrageous to you, I just have to ask if you have had conversations or social interactions with 5 or more different guys from Brazil, Italy, Russia, or any other country in that part of the world (and not ones who've already been living in America for a few years). Sure, there are some emotionally sensitive geeks here and there, but most are much more overtly sexual-minded about females than are American guys. If you've been to those countries, or met guys from from them, do you basically agree with the stereotypes about the men--namely, that they more nearly fit the traditionally and commonly understood meaning of the words ""masculine"" and ""macho""?

Granted, I only know what I've seen, heard, and experienced myself, but there's a lot more repression and hesitation that even just surrounds the subject of sex in America, and there is also a pervasive fear among girls of seeming like or being called a ""bitch."" So then there are situations like this one: a drunk girl goes by herself to see a bartender dude who shes likes and whom she's hooked up with on recent previous occasions...they wind up back at his place, sex happens, and then she wakes up not remembering it, but seeing the signs that it did happen, and then she goes to the internet to share the story in hopes of making some sense of it. That story would be a cause for much sympathy and despair for American girls hearing it, but to the majority of non-American girls I've known and know now, the solution is to either that the excessive drinking led to the sex, OR that the guy is indeed an manipulative asshole and should just be permanently avoided forever afterward. **Sympathizing is nice and thoughtful, but it's not going to help the girl prevent herself from doing the same thing again, and I think that's her goal in sharing the story here. She doesn't like how she's feeling about what happened, so the choice is clear: control your drinking, or avoid the guy.** If she really JUST wanted to vent and have that be an end in itself, why would she both sharing it to an audience of potential commenters/advice-givers? You're offering up your perspective just as I'm offering up mine, and there is unlimited room for analysis, debate, and explanations to take place.

&gt; I'm not saying that she had willing slept with him, but rather than she had willingly and knowingly (as she herself recalls it) decided to go to see him late at night when she was drunk.

&gt; &gt; So you acknowledge she didn't willingly slept with him but still suggest it is her fault.

As I said in the line you quoted, ""she had willingly and knowingly (as she herself recalls it) decided to go to see him late at night when she was drunk,"" that is, when her judgment and her physical self-control were impaired. Just how helpless do you think she is? If she's as utterly helpless and exempt from self-responsibility as you seem to think, then she should probably be living back at home with her parents, and they can set some guidelines and curfews that will help her make better choices in her social and interpersonal life--not to mention how she takes care of herself (again, alcohol is the cause of more trouble than most people would like to acknowledge!). 

&gt; ...but it's not so simple as saying he's this ruthless predatory monster when she has acknowledged that she LIKES him, and that she herself made the decision to go BACK out, later that night, to see him, and knew that he's a bartender who can throw down shots of liquor one after another, and that they had slept together previous times.

&gt; &gt; I am not making him into a ruthless predator, that's what you are doing. You are insisting that she is to be held responsible for what happened because she went to see him and decided to have drinks with him, so she was supposed to know what would happen. You are saying a woman can't get drunk in the presence of a man without having to expect that she will get raped.

As I said in my first comment, it's a matter of self-responsibility. She sees what has happened and now it's time to make a decision: stop drinking (preferably altogether, but at least much less than however much she remembers drinking that night), or avoid the guy who slept with her when she was either blacked out (awake-acting though the time is later forgotten) or unconscious. Do you think this isn't a probable factor in the story? -

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_%28alcohol-related_amnesia%29

She had been sexually involved with him other times, and went to see him when she was drunk this time. I don't know if you've ever known girls who get very uncharacteristically horny when they are intoxicated around guys they like, but that is something I've definitely seen in my lifetime. And blacking out is something that really does happen to some people when they are intoxicated. And if I had to guess--and this is just a guess--I'd think that a girl who has been hooking up with a bartender is a girl who likes bars and who likes alcohol; consider how she included her increasing state of drunkenness prominently throughout the story, so, while you may be offended by my saying that she was being irresponsible with herself for that exact reason, it seems pretty logical to me. It's like that phrase that parents use--""Don't hang out with the wrong crowd,"" which typically means troublemakers who are caught up with drugs, or at least very least with smoking and drinking, two staples of ""being bad"" in adolescence and young adulthood. Alcohol is a drug, and a common cute saying attributed to bartenders is ""Pick your poison""... (Continued--)

It really wasn't just an expansion pack, like at all.  Alexander?  Yes that is an expansion back, Napoleon? No.  The difference between Empire and Napoleon is an interesting one.  They take place in the same general time period, with the same general weapons yes?  That's about where the similarities end for me.

Empire is what it sounds like ""EMPIRE"" you are literally creating one.  You have almost the whole globe at your disposal and you can choose how to build your empire and where.  You can go trading, conquering etc but in the end you are spreading your influence across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and India.  The battles are awesome but a bit wonky and the AI is unpolished and the armies lack a certain variety. Also the engine is horribly optimized.  But nevertheless its a fantastic game that reminds me of Rome in many ways with its ambition and size. 

Napoleon works the same some ways.  The basics, taxes, research, trade etc all work pretty much as in Empire BUT it is a much more focused release.  It keeps it eye on one area at a time and allows you to fight in the Napoleonic Wars, you can't really just sit back, you've gotta join this big event and the fighting is fierce and considerably more polished than Empire.  Seriously though, NTW battles are absolutely stunning and are a lot less awkward than Empire, but that goes for the whole game.  Everything about NTW is much more focused the battles, the campaigns (there is one in Europe, Egypt and Italy) and the rest of the game feels trim and streamlined.  Its a thrill to play and much more challenging than Empire.  So where Empire has pure ambition and size, Napoleon has focus and intensity. 

Don't listen to people bashing either game, they are both fucking amazing and I love them to death.  And yes they are quite different.  But both worthy games for your money. It just depends on what YOU want to play! ",15,c6usgwu,

I'm genuinely curious (Historian here) and numbers from medieval Europe are, at best, suspect.

&gt;That's more due the fact that their land was being taken away, rather than the jobs they were moving into.

Yeah. And I wonder who was pushing all those neat laws that took their land away. Hmmmm.

&gt;This is not the same as the risk of famine. A lack of food security means if there's a harsh winter, you're f*cked. The 1708 East Prussian famine killed 41% of the population. Fifty million people not being able to feed themselves is shocking: but the State can make some efforts to make sure they don't starve. 

It is the same thing. Repealing a program would result in millions of people in the U.S. starving to death. Your well-being is at the mercy of politicians who admit that they don't really consider you citizens, much less actually people. You'll find plenty of folks on here who want to get rid of food stamps.

&gt;This is largely due to a lack of balance in foodstuffs consumed, rather than nutritional constraint. The US stunting rate is so small the WHO can barely detect it. 

Yes, and that lack of healthy alternatives is because of the inefficiencies of private industry.

&gt;The US has a vaccination programme with a reasonably high degree of compliance, right? This should protect against the epidemic diseases that ravaged populations in the past (think Smallpox).

[Inocculations and vaccines originally came from pre-industrial England.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#History) We have vaccinations in public schools, but to give you an idea, one of the contenders for the presidency wants to get rid of the public school system. So, it likely won't be around much longer.

&gt;Also, the water system is such that diseases like Cholera aren't too much of a problem? 

It depends on your location. I went to graduate school in a very very poor town, and the tap water was pretty much undrinkable. 

&gt;I'll concede that most of these are me quibbling, and I'm not trying to argue that unrestricted capatalism caused all these things to happen simply because times are better now. But, honestly, I think given the choice most people would rather be alive now, than then. 

You're right. If you took me now and put me in 1700's Lancashire, I wouldn't know what to do with myself. That's not what we're talking about, though. The Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism actively made the lots of most people worse. Yeah, there have been improvements, especially in medical technology, but you can't attribute those to capitalism, and capitalism doesn't even let everyone have the benefits of it. I'm poor.

Here is one hell of a reason why not producing your food is very bad : if you don't produce it, you have to import it from somewhere. Now, that Somewhere's problems become your problems, because if they have problems you don't get your food. The problems between you and that Somewhere also become your problems, because it can affect your food supply.  
There is also the question of how that food is made. Somewhere is probably a less developed country than yours, because if it were as rich, it probably wouldn't be cheaper to grow it there and ship it here than to produce here. And you have to trust Somewhere with adhering to *your* standards of growing food, and if they don't do a very good job at it, people are going to be sick and die of food poisoning.

In Europe right now, war is probably the least of our concerns regarding food supply. But that's because we produce a lot of food, so we're cool. Imagine if we were importing even 10% of our food from, say, Iran, or any country from the region that Iran could easily strike in case of a conflict. How about Syria ?  
Sure, you can and should diversify your supply chain, but then you multiply the number of problems of other people that you can add to your own. For example, if we were importing most of our food from north africa and the middle east, consider the Arab Spring.

Finally, there is the fact that you can't just jump-start agricultural production with the snap of a finger. You need heavy machinery, people knowing how to grow stuff, land, seeds, animals, etc. So, if you want to be able to produce food in the future, which you definitively want if only for the reasons stated above (and those are only a few), you have to produce it now to conserve the capacity.

Now, I'm not saying we're doing it right, I don't know much about it and have absolutely no data. However, there is no question that we have to do it.",3,c6usop7,

Lancaster, H.O. (1990) Expectations of Life. 

&gt; I wonder who was pushing all those neat laws that took their land away.

[Tories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_North,_Lord_North) (proper) weren't capatalists. Inclosure was as much about installing English friendly landowners in [rebellious areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_risings) as the march of progress.

&gt;  Repealing a program would result in millions of people in the U.S. starving to death.

A general lack of food security is more that the State is impotent in the help it can offer. The fact that so many people are being supported is indicative of surplus. 

&gt; lack of healthy alternatives is because of the inefficiencies of private industry.

Or that [industrial food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Matthews_Farms#Turkey_Twizzlers) is much cheaper than fruit and veg. Which is a shallow victory for capitalism. 

&gt; We have vaccinations in public schools

Is that the medium of delivery, or is the programme tied to the schools? Would abolishing public schools means that the vaccination programme was suspended? Because that's mental.

&gt; I went to graduate school in a very very poor town, and the tap water was pretty much undrinkable.

It's the same in much of Europe actually (and they have the cheek to complain about our taps!). 

&gt; That's not what we're talking about, though. The Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism actively made the lots of most people worse.

Honestly, I will concede that you have raised some valid points- the one about the working week was very interesting. However, I would still maintain broadly most [critical indicators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals) have improved since pre-industrial times. Though, as you pointed out you can't attribute those to capitalism- though I would add the caveat *necessarily*. It may be the case that a more capitalist orientated society did contribute to the rapid improvements in the 18^th century, but we cannot be sure. Causation in history is hard.

&gt;  I have a lot of chronic illnesses, but American society basically says ""Fuck you!""

I'm so sorry to hear that. I honestly hope that things pick up for you, I can't imagine what that must be like.

Yes, we do have moral relativism.

&gt;And if that's true, then what is ""society""? A state? A country with man-made borders? Or a planet?

It can be define a number of ways. In loose terms all ""society"" means is a group of people living and/or working together in some sort of community. That community itself can be define by a number of factors: law, customs and traditions, religion, whatever.

&gt;If it's a country, then Americans or Europeans can't decry the actions of the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Not so. This is like saying that just because we recognize that we all have different opinions, we can't say that our opinions are better or more correct. People dislike the actions of the Taliban and other such organizations because they disagree with our moral values, laws, and perceived rights. Of course we are then justified in disagreeing with them within our world view.

&gt;After all, it's their ""culture"" and we are no more ""correct"" because we've said no absolute morals exist. 

Now we are getting to cultural relativism, which is a serious source of debate. The point is though, that just because there are no absolute morals doesn't mean there aren't some that are proven to be more efficient and effective in maintaining a society.

You see in Europe you know all about the news &amp; politics in neighbouring countries, but mentality doesn't come accross (mostly).

The only thing i can say with certainty is that the French riches claim the ""poor"" hate succes.

&gt; Europe is a lot more homogeneous

Definitely wrong for Europe. There's 27+ countries, each with their own history &amp; culture. Also : our politicians (goes for western Europe) are so proud of their multi-cultural societies. We've had quite some immigration in the 20th century.

eg. Brussels, Paris, London, Amsterdam,... : almost all races are present there.

In eastern Europe it's different eg. racism is pretty prevalent in Poland


I can only tell you how it goes in Belgium : The poor do get looked down upon by the rich, but never by politicians or media.

The main reason for this tactical shift came about as a way of coping with the significant number of outrageously talented trequartistas that existed around the early 00's.  Guys like Zidane, Baggio, Bergkamp, Del Piero, Figo (for part of his career), etc.  Not all of these players had exactly the same style, but generally speaking they all sought to exploit the space between the banks of 4 midfielders and 4 defenders in the 4-4-2.

The shift to a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 (with the split midfield) served the purpose of creating two banks of midfielders, one of which sat deeper and robbed any would-be trequartistas of space in which to operate.  

Additionally, for any team who wants to be truly dominant (read: any team with ambition) having 3 central midfielders versus a team with only 2 (if they're playing a 4-4-2) will almost always mean greater control of the ball allowing you to dictate the style of play more often.

There are some other effects of the shift to a 4-2-3-1, like the movement of technical talent to the wings, more false 9's, a greater role for wing backs, etc., but those are largely results of the change not the reason it occurred.   

Basically, it's almost impossible to compete for titles (domestic and European) while playing a 4-2-2.  It is slightly easier in England than other domestic leagues and the CL, but it's still difficult to be dominant with the 4-4-2.

My definition of an Arsenal fan is someone who's part of the Arsenal community and prides that, in footballing terms, as a higher community than any other (only debatable is international level ie I could support Spain more than Arsenal).

On what your 'mate' is saying, again he's a prick and doesn't understand football. If he's having a go at you for trying to fit in and trying to become a part of something tell him; 

'well mon amigossss, football as a sport was created, popularised and has become what it is today, through the fact it was both a community former and a community that anyone could join' if that stupid cunt doesn't understand that then put it in plainer English.

Ie: 'The main reason football clubs are in industrialised cities is because the former peasants needed hubs, communities, places to congerate; when they moved from the farm land to new industrial centres. Look at the data of when most football clubs started (late 1800's around the time of the industrial revolution). Arsenal was founded by workers at the Armoury in Woolwhich (I think Dial Square). The reason we are called 'the gunners' is because the founders made guns and after making guns they needed a place to get together and have as a hub. Just to further this point, almost every major club that has won a European trophy (or been successful in their own league) is from an industrial city (rather than an academic capital). The exception to this is Real Madrid, who won because they had some cunt of a dictator feeding them, and then recently Chelsea (though they're now winning becuase of silly mone). The point, which is getting convoluted, is that your mate's a cunt (no sorry, although he is). The real point is that football is football today because of community; that's why it's so popular; that's why it's such a great spectacle and that's why thorugh wanting to be part of a community you're totally normal and actually a vauled member. On the other hand your mate is trying to wreck, break that community and is again a cunt who doesn't understand what he's talking about.'

Sources Soccernomics.

To be honest mate, being an Arsenal fan's about enjoying yourself, having a community and it's so much more than the football played. You wouldn't be an Arsenal fan if you're cheering for Spurs on the weekend, that's something Arsenal fans don't do and if you were then you'd be a football fan.

But these fan chats are long and pointless and the conclusion is: Your mate is a cunt.

We agree on most things. Where we disagree is that I don't think you look at crossbreeding as an evolutionary mechanism to acquire beneficial traits faster.

I do.

I think, for instance, that, say, Denisovans developed the short, squat build and epicanthic fold after aeons of seclusion. I think evolutionary pressures shaped their look. But I think modern humans cheated. Rather than gamble on whether or not they'd adapt to the same conditions, given the same amount of time, they merely slept around and acquired these traits faster.

Because that's what the time-frame implies.

You didn't have a long, slow, gradual shift in skull morphology. It happened rather rapidly after Caucasoids branched off and went into Siberia and China. And coincidentally, these new traits matched traits from older proto-hominid groups in the region.

So you can either ascribe that to a shocking amount of coincidence, or to crossbreeding.

(I happen to believe, given the brief time-frames in question, that cross-breeding makes a hell of a lot more sense. As I said before: a Cro-Magnon dug up from 50,000 years ago would fit rather easily into any crowd in Paris or Barcelona. The populations haven't morphed or evolved over 50,000 years! Yet Asians, for instance, branched off just 20,000 years ago. And they suddenly morphed. Not at the end of the 20,000 year period. But right at the beginning of it. So something happened to their population-group that *didn't* happen to Europe's. Some event. Because let's face it: If we all evolved so quickly, a Cro-Magnon shouldn't look like a modern Western European. But he does.)

I think, in the end, it's a matter of redefining terms. I think the old 19th Century kneejerk reaction of calling proto-hominids ""a different species"" will have to be re-evaluated. Typically different species can't interbreed. Or if they do, you get infertile offspring (think of mules, who are the sterile progeny of horses and donkeys.) But when we crossbred with Neanderthals or Denisovans, the children were quite capable of breeding afterward. Which is why modern people show traces of admixture. I think, if you factor out genetic drift, we're probably not so far from them as we've been led to believe. I mean, there's a paleontological find called ""Mongo Man,"" I believe. It's this fully modern skeleton that's really ancient. Scientists were initially stumped because, when they did DNA tests, it looked non-human. But clearly it's bones were fully human and fully modern. What they didn't know at the time? Genetic drift. It can make a fully modern human 100,000 years ago look like a member of a different species. But he's not. I think this same phenomenon makes other groups like  Neanderthal, the Denisovans and Homo heidelbergensis look artificially ""far-removed"" from us. In reality, clearly they're not. (After all, we could interbreed and produce viable offspring.) So they weren't like aliens from outer space. Or even chimps. So we'll have to re-evaluate our old paradigm of thinking of them as a different species, and have to consider assigning them more of a close kinship relationship . . . like that of a different (archaic) race.

The way the Russkis celebrate New Years is clearly better. It's a Christmas/New Years combo day!

First off, there's often no gift exchange on Christmas Day. The gift exchange happens right after midnight on New Years. There's usually a big feast/party with friends and family New Years Eve, and you basically stuff your face silly. No one goes home, everyone sleeps drunkenly at the hosts house. Big breakfast in the morning. 

There's a New Year's Tree instead of a Christmas Tree. The New Years tree is small, typically. There's no real Santa, instead there's Grandfather Frost who looks like a blue wizard. He's got a more epic outfit, a staff and a larger beard.  He's quite the badass and has a really hot daughter named Snegurachka (Snow Maiden). 

See, the Soviets were anti-religion, but they knew they couldn't eliminate Christmas. New Years *became* the new Christmas - because it was secular. 

Growing up, this was my favourite holiday. My Jewish family celebrated it because it was a state holiday, not a religious holiday like Christmas. Also I had my little gifts from Hannukah. 

I found it sad growing up, learning some of my fellow american classmates simply sleep through the New Year, or simply stay up and watch the Times Square Bash. 

I kept the Soviet tradition alive. Last year, I hosted Russian-New-Years for my American friends at my place, complete with big feasting and gift exchanges!

On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited’s Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple’s registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.

In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products: 

""The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""

""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.""

That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 18 October 2012. A copy of the Court of Appeal’s judgment is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.

However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad.""

Which is now a Democracy with its laws being not-similar at all to the US. Where the leadership is Shi'ia, and more likely to become friends with Iran.

&gt; Vietnam

Where they tried to keep a Democracy. The war was horrific, and the resulting retreat by the US, cost the lives of millions of Southern Democratic Vietnamese. Why don't you ask some Vietnamese if it was a good thing for the North to take over.

Again a democracy, where the leadership even speaks ill of America, just to score political points. What an occupation indeed. An occupation where US spends resources helping Afghanistan. Where US sends troops to secure regions, provide police-work, and clear areas of violent zealots.

Wrong, post world war 2, the US was more left-wing than Europe. Only up until the 1980s, with Reaganites, did US slip more right-wing than Europe. I think it was a result of the ""high"" from winning the cold war, that people embraced right-wing ideals.

If redditors like you shut up and stop throwing liberal presidents under the bus, we'd have more left-wing victories, more liberals in congress and the supreme court and the presidency, and we'd become just like Europe. But you won't stop damaging the US liberal efforts.

&gt;1) Can you deny creeps or towers? If not, is it very important to harass your opponent in lane to compensate for this?  

No, there is no direct denying of creeps in LoL, which make laning phaze much more complicated than it is in Dota2. In time you will learn lane control: freezing* your lane to keep your opponent from cs-ing, when to push the lane*, when to reset the lane*, when to back*, etc.  
freezing: having the enemy's minions meet your minions at a point closer to your tower than theirs. This allows you to effectively deny your enemy some cs, as he is more exposed to ganks and harass if he tries to kill creeps (he will have to walk longer to the safety of his tower in case of ganks, or if you decide to trade with him and win the trade)  
pushing: quite obvious what that is. In general, you want to push your lane when your enemy is not in lane, or against a champion who has trouble cs-ing under tower. That way, your opponent looses more creeps, and as a result, he will have less gold than you.  
backing: when you blue-pill to shop. Same as the above. as a general rule of thumb, you want to back when your lane is pushed so you will not loose creeps, and your opponent does.  
resetting the lane: the opposite of freezing. Controlling the minion number to make so next wave of creeps meet again in the middle of the lane, between your and your opponent's tower. This is the counter to freezing, and what you want to try and do when your opponent has frozen the lane and is keeping you out of range of the creeps.  
As i said, all of this is lane control and in time you will learn it. Watch some high-level streams, and pay attention to how this players control their lanes.  

edit: Also, check this post for a better formulated/more experienced answer than mine: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/12gjwg/coming_from_dota_2_to_league_a_few_questions/c6ux4qy  

Some streams i recommend (mostly European, since i am European):  
[CLG.eu Wickd](http://www.own3d.tv/wickd) (top laner)  
[CLG.eu Froggen](http://www.own3d.tv/Froggen) (Ap carry)  
[CLG.eu SkumbagKrepo](http://www.own3d.tv/Krepo) (support)  
[CLG.na Doublelift](http://www.own3d.tv/Doublelift) (Ad carry)  
[M5 Alex_ich](http://www.own3d.tv/Alex_ich) (Ap carry)  
And i'm sure you will find others, this are just a few.

&gt;2) Is there a rough figure for the amount of influence points you earn each game? I would like to buy new champions but wondered if the amount decreases the more games you play.  

Already answered below, but here is the link again anyway:  
[Influence Points formula](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Influence_Points)

&gt;3) Do the games increase in difficulty the higher level you get and the game automatically assumes you get better the more you play?  

They increase in difficulty in the sense that you get matched with better players. This is based on your elo. In LoL you have an elo for ranked hames (you can only play ranked post level 30) and normal elo, which is not shown anywhere, it is just used by the game to match you with equally skilled players.

&gt;4) Is there a way you can trade champions/skins, like you can trade items in dota2?

No, Riot has hinted at maybe implementing this feature sometime in the future, but as of now the only way is to buy a prepaid card and give the code to a friend to redeem it for RP.

&gt;5) Do players NEED to have runes to be effective? I have not even touched that side of the game yet.

Well, in short yes. You need runes since everyone else has runes, and you would be at a disadvantage if you have no runes. Obviously, you can outplay someone regardless of runes, but it is much harder. Having said that, it is generally recommended that you only buy level 3 runes, which are available only after you reach level 20. (One could also make the argument that since most people don't buy runes pre-20, if you have some runes you will be at an advantage. It is extremely minor though, and usually pre-30 you either outplay someone or you don't.)

&gt;6) Final question: is there a guide specifically for people who transfer from dota 2 to league? I read the dota 2 subreddit and there is a guide for league players who want to play dota 2.

Not that i am aware of, unfortunately. Just watch streams, look up some guides, play the game, and you'll learn fast.  
One of the more highly regarded site for guides is [Team Solomid](http://www.solomid.net/guides.php). You will find there champion-specific guides, as well as more general ones. 

&gt;I'm only level 6 but it seems that (and this is not a criticism at all) the game is easier than dota 2.

Sure, in some aspects it is. However, IMHO, the removal of denying creeps mechanic has actually made laning faze much more complex in LoL than it is Dota2. Also, having shorter cd on abilities causes team fights and skirmishes to be a lot more...energetic. :)

&gt;I'm playing morgana a lot and people keep walking into my q and w abilities. Conversely, I find it strange that you can see where the enemy chooses certain abilities to land and just avoid them. I was facing ziggs and had no problem as I just saw where he was putting his bombs and walked away, but team members did not!

As you level up, you will find that people start playing better, and you will miss the days when they would just walk into your q. ;).  
As for seeing where abilities land, it's a double-edged sword. It also means that your opponent can see where you land your spells and can avoid them. That only means you have to become better at predicting where your opponent will be, and where to place your spells so he can't avoid them. All of that come with time.

Well, hope that clears up some things for you. Some others you will learn while playing. Have fun out there (most important part of the game), don't get demoralized by trolls and ragers, and maybe we'll meet some day on Summoner's Rift.


edit: grammar. Also, a question to more experienced redditors: why in the answer to q1 do i have a part of the answer in italics?! i didn't try any formatting at all, and to me it's no different than the rest of the paragraph. Shows how much i know reddit, i guess...

Grocery shopping downtown can be a bit of a challenge. I believe there is a small grocery store in one the apartments on East 12th, but I have never been there.

There are a couple of liquor stores too: One off of Old River Road, and one on West 6th. For pharmacy and toiletries there are a couple of CVS pharmacies around downtown. I believe that one of them is extending their hours so it will be open until 11 PM. I work just outside of the city so I do most of my shopping on my way home, but there is also a Walmart and a Target just south of downtown at Steel Yard Commons in Tremont. There is also the famous West Side Market and a Dave's Grocery store across the river in Ohio City.

Retail shopping downtown could be better, but it is on the upswing. Tower City Center off of Public Square has the most shops, but some of them are stinkers. There is also a movie theater there too, but one I hear that is worth checking out is the Capital Theater in Gordon Square. There is a couple of other ""malls"" downtown too. Check out the Galleria (I think they are calling it Life@Erie now), the Arcade, and the Colonial Marketplace (I think this one might have a new name now too...East 5th shopping center or something...). Banks and ATMs can be found at pretty much every corner. Also, don't be surprised if most places are closed by 7 - this is a trend that seems to be changing, and more places than ever are open later.

The city is pretty proud of the local culinary scene. We have an Iron Chef, Michael Symon! He has a couple of restaurants around town, but his most famous one is Lola's on East 4th. Speaking of East 4th...it is a great place to go out to eat. Lot's of good restaurants here, but if you are looking for a cheaper bite to eat, check out the nearby places off of Euclid. The Warehouse District (http://www.warehousedistrict.org/) downtown is home to a few restaurants, bars, and clubs. This the place where a lot people go out on the weekends...some of them are douchebags with popped collars, but they tend to stay away from the cool places like the Map Room on West 9th, and Little Bar on Frankfort.

Getting around Cleveland is easy no matter how you do it. Downtown is pretty much on a grid, and not at all big. I walk, and bike it all the time. The RTA (http://www.riderta.com) is the transit authority here. They do a decent job for a city that doesn't have a huge population density. Buses, the Rapid (light rail), and the Healthline (BRT), all use the same fare system. $2.25 for a one way ticket, $5 for an all day pass. They also offer downtown ""trolleys"" (http://www.riderta.com/trolleys/) that are green little buses that run small routes around the city. These are free to ride, and incredibly awesome during the winter. I think they just started a new route that runs close to you on East 12th. I assume that since you have a car that you are most concerned with driving. It's dead simple to get around here. Cleveland was designed with these ""European Avenues""...which essentially just means that we have wide streets, and hardly any of them are one-way.

Cleveland is a city of neighborhoods. There is, of course, downtown, but other places like Ohio City (http://www.ohiocity.org/), Tremont (http://tremontwest.org/), University Circle (http://www.universitycircle.org/), Little Italy (http://www.littleitalycleveland.com/), Gordon Square (http://www.gordonsquare.org/), Asia Town (http://www.asiatowncleveland.com/), etc. are just as relevant, and I am sure you will hear about them frequently. Take the time to visit them, as they are pretty unique, and for the most part have a lot going on during the year! The city of Lakewood isn't too far away either, and most people would agree that it might as well be a suburb of Cleveland. 

Hmm... I hope that helps. There really is a lot of great stuff to do here, just takes a bit of time to find it all. I highly recommend this book, New to Cleveland, too: http://newtoclevelandbook.com/

&gt;On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited’s Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple’s registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.
&gt;
&gt;In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:
&gt;
&gt;""The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""
&gt;
&gt;""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.""
&gt;
&gt;That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 18 October 2012. A copy of the Court of Appeal’s judgment is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.

&gt;However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad.",6,c6uvd2u,

However, that is not *at all* what the CAP is about. If you look into the CAP, and the necessity for Europe to produce its own food in case of ""emergencies"" of some sort, I'd say that the CAP is actually working against it. 

For example - shouldn't we then stop giving aid to for example wine? Is wine a necessity? And, if we look at what is necessary to suvive, we should focus more on the calories - start planting onions and cabbage on the wine yards, use far less cows (the demand to much energy), and actually stop protecting the little farmer? Also, why are we supporting some parts of southern Europe? Do you know how inefficient it is from a water/energy point to grow some stuff there? So, if we need to keep some capacity  - maybe we should focus on that, but we do not. What part of the CAP actually does that? 


I can agree that we might need some aid for the cause that you mentioned, but the fact is, to that cause the CAP is in fact so inefficient (and corrupt) so I personally think it would be better to tear it down and replace it with something new.

And UK government jobs? Firstly, the UK would have to reduce the number of public sector jobs by simple extension of the fact that Scotland isn't part of the union any more, and Scotland would have to establish public sector jobs for the same reason.
 
edit: And with regards to EU membership, bear in mind it is an unprecedented situation. The UK press is almost entirely unionist, so all you ever see in the Guardian, on the Beeb, etc, is the cynical anti-independence legal speculations. Firstly, Scotland is a country in its own right, not a breakaway province. So *in as sense* Scotland is already part of the EU. Secondly, it has been stated that there is no legal basis under which citizens of a newly independent Scotland could be stripped of their EU citizenship (making it hard to block Scotland some kind of automatic membership). Thirdly, Scotland is legally an *equal* partner in the UK. If Scotland has to reapply, it's possible the remainder of UK would too (given that the UK would no longer be the same country it was previously). If Scotland doesn't, then neither would the UK. Of course, none of these are *at all* set in stone, but I'm just driving home the point that you only really see the other side of the speculation (because that is what it is) in the UK press.

If you're really interested in what a Medieval person thought when encountering a wildly different culture, I strongly recommend you read William of Rubruck's [account of the Mongols](http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/rubruck.html) from the 13th century. It can be seen as a precursor to modern day ethnography and gives great insight into the way Europeans viewed other cultures (if you'd like some cliff notes: Rubruck is most interested in the way their women behave, their religious practices and the way they dress. He is also surprised, but not shocked or appalled by the customs and behaviors that are different). 

You might also look into travelogues by John of Plano Carpini or Marco Polo to get an idea of what it was like to encounter vast cultural difference. For what it's worth, none of these men are especially powerful - they are educated and wealthy, but are monks or merchants of middling rank.

As to your specific example, I imagine it would be more of a shock to an Englishman that to a Turk.

I then held a coup of the marathas by placing a full stack next to each of their cities(they were gone within two turns). 

By this point I was pretty much unstoppable because of my wealth, I then conquered the rest of the earth. The End

There was a flourishing interchange of ideas between the middle-east and the rest of the world (with the ME being scientifically, philosophically, culturally more advanced) for a very long time, and certainly before the the 20th century. Your Greeks, for example, survived primarily due to Byzantium and the ME scholars - they were rediscovered by Western Europe due to ME scholarship.

If you really want to see what ME could have been look at Iran/Iraq around the mid-20th century. Baghdad, for example, had flourishing universities and there was a great deal of cultural exchange going on at the time. (Of course, this is not indicative of the entire region, but I find that it tends to shock the viewer out of the prejudice that ME is entirely backwards due to religion/*pet theory* reasons. 

The backwardness of the middle-east is a very complex political and cultural phenomenon, in which the Western nations are more than a little complicit. Extremist groups took advantage of a lot of this; just as there seem to be a lot of extremist groups in Europe and US now. 

I always find the sole labeling of Islam as backward/barbaric/etc to be not only myopic, but also facile. You can't disconnect religion from the practice; Islam these days tends to be extremist because of the horrific conditions of so many of its practitioners. Are there things within Islam that inspire such? Sure. All the Abrahamic religions are pretty fucking disgusting.

First of all, do you think there is some utopia out there that you'll find by moving? For some, immigration is the best decision that they could make. I fully understand that; but, migration theory holds that it manifests it self as a search for upward mobility (See the work of Karen Fog Olwig or Angela Torresan). I know people who moved to ""escape"" to get away from a place or people, and you know what? They can never get far enough; because, moving to a new place wasn't the problem. It was who they were on the inside. 

People always threaten to leave for Canada or Europe because they don't like the policies of their government or (potentially) elected leaders.

No. You find a solution. FIND A SOLUTION. Telling American conservatism to 'fuck off' isn't constructive. As someone who studied political science, you should know that social movements are not founded by people getting up and leaving, but by uniting and working together.

As a Canadian, I get that Americans hate their government sometimes, but threatening to come here doesn't solve your problems.

We can survive if our outsourced production of iPhones is cut off for whatever reason. If there is a problem with the food supply, the consequences are a bit more serious.

Right now, we have a country in Europe that can produce a lot of food. That's France, but I read somewhere else in the thread that Poland's share in the CAP is rising, so that would be two big producers in the future. If we conserve this strength, we have food security for the foreseeable future. That means paying now (and later, too, of course).  
If we lose that capacity by outsourcing our food production, we will lose much more than just the amount of trade. We'll lose the expertise, the land use (if it's not farmed anymore, we can build stuff on it, or it will be pretty much abandonned), the machinery, etc. You can't rebuild those easily in the short term, so once you start outsourcing, and there's no predicting how far it is going to go, you can't go back without a massive investment, and even then it's going to take a long time.

And diversifying your sources will also multiply the problems that become yours. And what about the day when someone, say China, comes along and is willing to pay more than you for that same food you want ? As westerners, we're not used to think about that side of the problem, but with the rise of other powers on the world stage and our own decline, it's going to happen sooner or later.  
If we grow food in the EU, we can somewhat control how it's grown and where it goes. That's pretty important.


With the CAP, we're buying food security for the entire EU, and the importance of that cannot be over-emphasized. We cannot outsource food production without expecting massive problems down the line.

Maybe something that should also be clearer. When I say ""from any images"", that might be misleading, as it is only from online images. That s one reason I added the ability to take images from Dropbox, it is a way for me not to handle uploads, but still allow users to use photos that have not been uploaded to facebook.

So no, no resizing on your machine, no uploading, nothing. I only fetch images from the cloud, and resize them on my servers.

That said, I was experimenting initially with doing most of the work (resizing, analysing colors, creating the actual mosaic) on the client machine. I figured that would save server resources and be faster, since users's browsers had already loaded the images. But that ended up really hard, if not impossible, to make it work in all browsers. I think I reached a good stage in google chrome, but as soon as I tried in Firefox, it was maybe 20x slower. So I gave up that direction, and accepted that I d have to pay for more servers :)

If you look at the Aaronson report however it points out that it should not be aimed at SMEs but large business, so 'toothless' it will not be.

GAAR will have no impact whatsoever on the ability for companies to falsely record profits in a tax haven instead of the UK to avoid tax purposes. This is what Starbucks and Amazon and others large tax avoiding companies do. For this reason it will have no impact at all on multinational companies or those large enough for it to be worth their while to set up a fake subsidiary in a tax haven to channel their profits through. High profile cases where huge amounts of tax are avoided will continue, and large businesses will not be targeted. They have simply used the idea that it may harm business as an excuse to set up such a narrow focus as so that it will not much of an effect on anything at all. Hardly the actions of a government doing all they can to tackle tax avoidance.

&gt;Yes. It was brought in to allow people that have their fortunes overseas to bring them back to the UK as a pseudo-armistice. 10% of nothing, and then an increase of 50% in capital gains thereafter, is a lot more than nothing. About £4bn more and counting, beating all projections.

You could call it pragmatic, but we don’t have these kind of amnesties for other criminals. If you rob a bank, the government isn’t going to let you off if you pay 10% back, but if you evade tax apparently that’s fine. What message does this send to hard working people that do pay tax, that those who have decided not to are let off paying a token amount instead of being punished? Letting tax evaders of the hook shows the government are not serious about tackling tax evasion either.

&gt;The article you linked yourself makes clear that real steps and developments are being made. I couldn't care what the union says about efficiency, and let's face it they don't have any sort of record to launch themselves off, but it remains a fact the government through the HMRC is launching task forces to get more for less.

It’s odd that you focus so much on a single line of an article about a Public Accounts Committee report because it quotes “A union”. What the union says is not important here, it is the Public Accounts Committee that are saying that £1.1 billion pounds of tax has gone uncollected due to cuts at HMRC. The report is available [here]( http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/hmrc-compliance/). 

Of course the government claim they will do more with less at the HMRC. They say the same thing with the police, education and other areas where funding is being cut. If you believe government press releases then you would think they have the unique ability to cut a departments funding and make it work better at the same time, but reality doesn’t work like that. The fact is the government is losing over a billion pounds by making cuts to HMRC; it’s a great example of self-defeating austerity and another example of how they are not doing all they can to defeat tax avoidance or evasion.

&gt;The ironic Michael Meacher school of tax avoidance bill which Labour had a decade to implement. It's political diatribe to wait until something is being done and then to vote against it citing that you'd do more. The independent Aaronson report even warned against a GANTP sized bill as being harming against Small and Medium Sized Businesses, citing that it was not conducive to close genuine and justifiable tax avoidance in place to assist and further SMEs, rather the aim was to stop large companies from exploiting the holes intended to aid small and medium sized enterprise.

Yes Michael Meacher should have done something more about tax avoidance when he was in government, that doesn’t mean he’s wrong to raise the issue now. And Richard Murhpy who helped write GANTP knows much more about tax avoidance and evasion that Graham Aaronson so I don’t believe his excuses that tax avoidance and evasion is essential to SMEs and therefore shouldn’t be clamped down on.

&gt;Yes, they voted on it. They wanted the UK to hand over control of taxes to the EU and it would have crushed several smaller economies in the EU which would inevitably still ended up costing in further bailouts. It's not enough that they've taken currency control mechanisms out of their hands, they wanted to take corporate taxation away from them too.

Small economies don’t need lower corporation taxes unless they are tax havens set up to allow companies to avoid tax in economies that are actually productive. There are also other options than a fixed European wide corporation tax rate, such as having a sensible minimum level of corporation tax and/or enforcing transparent country by country reporting. If the people of Europe want tax avoidance tackled then handing over control of corporate taxation to a different democratic authority so that it can be managed more effectively at a European level would be a good way to do it. Nobody’s having control taken away from them against their will. It’s the same with currency by the way - no country was forced to join the Euro.

&gt;It's not even practical to discuss it. It would never pass in a month of Sundays in the UK. As it stands it isn't even currently an option. We might as well discuss returning to an absolutist monarchy or cheese mining the moon.

Why wouldn’t it pass? Are the politicians against it or the people? Or is it just something you personally dislike? What are you sources for this, where are the polls showing British people don’t want European wide action on tax avoidance? It’s clear people want something to be done about it and there is a limited amount a single country can do unilaterally in an international world.

&gt;You seemed to have made your mind up and are only now looking for evidence that fits your world view, rather than doing it the other way around.

Nice ad-hominem. I could say the same about you, but then you could probably accuse anyone of this during any debate. I don’t see you offering up any evidence that contradicts your own position either, though there is plenty available. You said you didn’t see what more the coalition could be doing to tackle avoidance and I was merely giving you several answers to this. One (GANTP) you ignored because it would be too effective and allegedly may harm business. One you completely ignored what the Public Accounts Committee said and instead decided to focus on a quote from a union, and one you ignore due to hyperbole about losing tax sovereignty and countries going bankrupt. Who’s really being selective with the evidence they accept here.

""Business"" doesn't pay the tax or at least not all of the tax. The cost will be passed on to customers or in the form of marginally lower wages. But business, customers, and workers on the whole would benefit. 

In developed countries, transit is basic infrastructure. NYC is crippled without its subways. While in most European cities and major metro areas around the world public transit is used by all classes, in smaller US cities transit is used mainly by poor people or people with disabilities that prevent them from driving. The funny thing is that society still needs these people. They work the majority of the low-wage jobs that keep the prices that we pay low. Transit is the infrastructure that allows many of them to get and keep jobs. If more have access, then this effectively increases the labor pool, meaning that those who are best able to work are the ones who are hired, not just those who can access transit. 

Though they will complain about carrying an undue burden, in the long run, business won't eat the cost--they will pass it on. As customers of businesses that pay a transit tax, we may end up paying slightly higher prices for better service. Or wages on average will go slightly down and prices remain about the same. But people who couldn't access jobs before would have access. Additionally, business on transit lines would likely see an increase in customers. Because they weren't paying for transport, poorer customers would have slightly more money to spend.

""**Samsung / Apple UK judgment**

On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited’s Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple’s registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.

In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:

""The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""

""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.""

That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 18 October 2012. A copy of the Court of Appeal’s judgment is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.

However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad.""",90,c6uww7y,

After all, the Soviet Union managed to turn a war-torn rural backwater country into one of the biggest super-powers in world history. Politics and violence aside, that seems to indicate a large degree of economic success in industrializing, right?

It indicates success, yes, but the question then becomes one of the degree of economic growth.  The economic policies of Bukharin, for example, created much the same rate of growth prior to the rejection of his policies in favor of those that we typically associate with Stalin.

I wish I could give you the hard data on this -- it was part of the subject of my undergraduate thesis and I combed through some great economic datasets to get it, but they're all ensconced in the basement of UVA's library and I, regrettably, no longer have a copy.

&gt; My question was actually more specific to the actual nitty-gritty of the methods of industrialization. What was the process of creating a factory-capable workforce?

Can't answer that one for you.  I could hazard a guess or two, but someone else should take that.

&gt;  How exactly was investment achieved, seeing as it was a socialist command economy?

Well, the USSR depended on exports - typically agricultural exports - for an influx of foreign currency which could then be used to purchase industrial equipment.  That's typically how that worked; agricultural surplus (or not, depending on how you want to deal with the Holodomor) was used to purchase industrial equipment which was then staffed and assigned quotas.

&gt;And how did the process compare to European industrialization, in terms of the effects on peasants?

Well, Russian peasantry has an implication of yoemanism (that's a word now) which is to say that it is intrinsically rural.  Generally the urban population -- who made up the bulk of the industrial workforce -- wouldn't be included in our modern understanding of that word and I'm not terribly confident that the Soviets would have used language with a similar translation.  That said, I think we both know who you're talking about so, for the purposes of linguistic sanity let's just call them peasants.  It's also entirely possible (and I don't actually know if this is the case) that the term would have had a classist overtone at the time but let's ignore that for the moment.

During the same period that the USSR was industrializing the farms -- the peasants -- were undergoing collectivization and dekulakization^1 which more or less boils down to an attempt to apply methods of industrial efficiency and organization to agriculture (collectivization) while simultaneously instituting a system of political persecution against farmers who were somewhat more successful than their peers (dekulakization).  That didn't go so well.   

I'm not super-familiar with the industrial period in Europe as a whole but my vague recollection of it is that it spurred a pretty decent urbanization trend.  Urbanization happened during Soviet industrialization as well, but not for the same reasons - the Soviet penchant for creating industrial cities played into this, but urbanization happened in the existing urban centers as well.  

Without getting into the specifics, I'd say that the collectivization and dekulakization experience were what really set the Soviet peasant experience apart from that experienced in Europe.

Read Raymond Jonas, *The Battle of Adwa* (2011) for a good retelling.**

To begin: Ethiopia (specifically the Emperor [Menelik II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelek_II)) gained support--domestically and overseas--and *then* remained independent.  So you've got that kind of backwards there.  

The tragedy of [Tewodros II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tewodros_Ii) and his poking of the British, including the *incredibly stupid* act of hostage-taking which ended with the Indian Army invading Ethiopia and ending his reign at Magdala in 1868 (and then leaving because they had no interest in the high cost of occupation), as well as the hubris and navel-gazing of [Yohannes IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohannes_IV) were important.  Those two things were important by being instructive to King Menelik of Shewa, who used the time between his accession in Shewa and Yohannes's death to build constructive alliances and contacts outside the country and expand his own power base so he could successfully contend for the throne after Yohannes stupidly got himself shot in battle in 1889.  This included close ties to the Italians on the coast in Eritrea, [the treaty with whom (Wuchale) was so problematic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Wuchale) because its Article XVII purportedly ceded Ethiopian sovereignty but only in Italian.  But it also included a careful navigation of Anglo-French rivalries regarding north-south (British) and east-west (French) blueprints for African empire that ran through his country, not to mention a significant public-opinion campaign that he, and the [Empress Taytu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taytu_Betul), ran brilliantly in Europe.  

Still, Menelik waited to repudiate Wuchale and face the Italians until he was ready--after recovery from *rinderpest*, after he'd reconciled or crushed his domestic foes, and after harvests were in. He also managed to get more modern weapons via arms dealers, European (especially Swiss like Alfred Ilg) advisors, and the French governor at Obok (today in Djibouti) who was a long-cultivated friend who feared Italo-British hegemony over Ethiopia.  He also took advantage of the expectation of Italian victory in an age of empire to make his enemies overconfident.  Menelik's army had artillery that could outrange its Italian opposition, and machineguns--things no other African state successfully obtained in meaningful numbers.

After the Battle of Adwa in 1896, where a much larger Ethiopian army defeated a smaller, equally equipped Italo-Eritrean one, he used that time to garner the legitimacy and the treaties that would guarantee Ethiopia's security--but that also neutralized it as a space that could play off the British and French (and Italians) against one another.  The result was a slow closing of doors to Ethiopian overtures, and for their part Ras Tafari Makonnen (a prince and the worldly son of Menelik's foreign advisor, who would become Haile Selassie I in 1930) sought support from powers that could not or would not provide it in an effort to counterbalance the Europeans (e.g., the US or Japan) and reluctantly had to accept it from Italy, France, and Britain.  The Italian invasion of 1935 was the result of France and Britain deciding that Italian militarism in Europe could be salved by letting them do as they wished in Africa.  But even then Ethiopia fought hard, never surrendering the countryside, and outmaneuvered Europe in the end (1941) by openly declaring their equality with the ""other"" Allied Powers and virtually daring the British to *try* to treat them like an ex-Italian colony.  Ethiopia ultimately took a small part in the European theater of war, which is itself a fascinating story, and in the end they got control of ex-Italian Eritrea in the aftermath.

Menelik, Taytu, and Haile Selassie are exceptional characters in world history and I'd encourage you to read Harold Marcus's (and others', including Prouty on Taytu) biographies of them to understand them better.  The question of whether another emperor could have pulled off Menelik's feat is an open one, but he was incredibly aware of doings beyond Ethiopia, and dispatched envoys regularly in a way few other emperors had or likely would have.  As a result, he had an appreciation of the way that colonial powers worked, knew what they'd probably try, and made sure he was ready to use that knowledge against them.

For the longer-winded coverage of all of this, one recent book in particular is worth your time.  Raymond Jonas has done a very good job of explaining the Italo-Ethiopian relationship and Menelik II's rise to power in his *The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire* (2011), which I actually reviewed for a journal.  The major issue I had was that he overplays the relevance of their resistance by suggesting it was the main reason African decolonization in the 1950s/1960s even happened (!?!), but his narrative on the major developments and their short-term, localized meaning is very good and extremely engaging.  He doesn't have any Amharic sources but a lot was translated after the campaign of 1896, and he treats the Ethiopian court and countryside with respect on its own terms.  I'd strongly recommend it.",40,c6ux31b,

Then you are understanding incorrectly.

&gt;most towns now have their own little muslim neighbourhood (halal butchers, mosque etc).

Most?

Anyway, immigrants tend to gather together.  It's normal.  There is a difference between immigrants living close together, and immigrants being isolated.

Where I grew up, 35% of the city was immigrant Muslim.  Every single child of immigrant parents is significantly more American than their parent's culture.  The city mixed well.  How come stuff like this is only a ""problem"" in Europe?

&gt;Parts of London are apparently under Sharia Law (Walthamstow).

That article where you say this is happening was proven false.

If there is anything like what you consider Sharia law, it's simply family actions and marriage rituals, which are harmless.

&gt;surely you would happier in the place where you are originally from?

Isn't it the same for everyone?

But not wanting to die in a war or of famine is better.

But what about people like me?  I'm from America, and I'm Muslim.  What about British born Muslims?  Regardless of what you hear, they are significantly more British than whatever their parents are, even said Muslim denies it.  Do we all have no where we are allowed to go?

&gt;when the very things that made you want to leave - you're bringing with you and imposing on those around you?

The things that made people leave their countries are, again, war or poverty.  If a woman WANTS to wear a modest Muslim dress, what's it your business?  Why do you imply people are running from this?

On top of that, no one is imposing anything.  You are simply believing the fear mongering.  Don't you see that the same countries that are being invaded by Western Nations are the ones who's culture is being demonized by your media?

You say you aren't attacking, but insist Muslims are imposing their views and laws.

If you really are worried about the negative aspects of whatever culture of immigrants in your community, then reach out to them.  Befriend them.  You give your new ideas to them, and they give your ideas to you.  You both see a new perspective, and everyone gains.

The reason for this is that the UK government has agreed to a binding referendum, by doing this they have shot some of their arguments in the foot really. Yes the EU and other international bodies might find it difficult to accept a unilateral declaration of Independence but with the agreement of the UK government it'd be difficult to argue with the legitimacy of a new Scottish state, it could be accepted as a successor because it has not unilaterally split off. 

All these arguments over Scotland's place in the world are now largely irrelevant as the UK government has already accepted that the decision of the Scottish people in the referendum will be accepted by both the Scottish Government and Westminster. They have taken a big gamble by assuming that the No side will win because if it doesn't they have no grounds to stop Scotland acceding to international bodies.

EDIT: There was also recent evidence from [Graham Avery where he stated Scotland could not be asked to leave the EU for practical and political reasons.](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm)",2,c6uxpe3,

&gt;In my opinion it's pretty obvious that Scotland would need to reapply. 

Well take look at the expert evidence which is being given to Westminster

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm

&gt;. In the debate on Scottish independence it is natural that opponents tend to exaggerate the difficulties of EU membership, while proponents tend to minimise them. This note tries to address the subject as objectively as possible. In summary it argues that:

&gt;· Arrangements for Scotland’s EU membership would need to be in place simultaneously with independence

&gt;· Scotland’s 5 million people, having been members of the EU for 40 years; have acquired rights as European citizens

&gt;· For practical and political reasons they could not be asked to leave the EU and apply for readmission

&gt;· Negotiations on the terms of membership would take place in the period between the referendum and the planned date of independence

&gt;· The EU would adopt a simplified procedure for the negotiations, not the traditional procedure followed for the accession of non-member countries 

Scotland is within the EU at the moment. It is represented in the EU by the UK which is a political union of England &amp; Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Why should leaving the political union of the UK automatically mean that we leave the political union of the EU? Is the rUK guaranteed to be the successor state? Would it also need to reapply again? And even if you answer all of the above, why would the EU spend years kicking out x-million EU citizens only to later spend years letting them in back in again? It goes against common sense.  

&gt;But Westminster doesn't want Scotland to leave. Why would they potentially make a stronger case for independence when they can just leave the question open?

Westminster has a responsibility to represent Scotland in Europe. It is a relevant question to ask as the Nationalist secured enough votes to form a majority government. Westminster might not like the answer, but if they want to continue representing Scotland in Europe they should show that they are willing to when the need arises.",6,c6uxqey,

Really?  That is your insightful addition to this conversation?  
Before you get defensive and misconstrue the spirit of my reply as some type flame war of Europe v America.  Or take this as some type of personal affront against you.  Hear me out.

*Presumably* you just read an article focused around a 1990 GEO METRO (a car that was not ever sold by that name in Europe).  The article specifically uses this car (which was only sold in North America) to illustrate a couple key points.

1. Gas milage (specifically MPG) has not significantly improved in 22 years.

2. The cost of ""equivalent MPG"" cars today has far outpaced inflation.

The author of the article makes many references to ""Fed Funny Money"" (The Federal Reserve) and also references the word ""Uncle"" in terms of legislation - in this case he means Uncle Sam which is synonymous with the United States Government (the author even included an iconic picture of him at the end of the article). 

The biggest clue about the country this article is relevant to is the use of MPG or Miles Per Gallon.  Europe uses Litres/100KM... due to the fact distances in Europe are traditionally in Kilometers not Miles and fuel is sold by the Litre not U.S. Gallons

So yes, this article is applicable to the United States.

While 100% accurate, your comment makes about as much sense as posting ""This only applies to Argentina.  The voting age in Europe is 18."" in reference to [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/12g5an/argentina_lowers_voting_age_to_16/) in /r/worldnews.  (referenced article is: Argentina lowers voting age to 16)

So again, before you reply or get mad please understand what I am saying here.  I am not calling you names, yelling out insults or questing you intelligence here.  Rather I am trying to encourage you to add some awesome discussion points or insight when you post - rather than just post something.

Yes, I think that's the reasoning. But I don't think you say ""don't vote yes because who knows what will happen with the EU?!?"" while simultaneously blocking the ability to find out what will happen with the EU.

I thought [this analysis](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm) of how the transition might work was quite sensible. It would be in the best interests of Scotland, the rUK, and the EU for an independent Scotland to continue as part of the EU, so a way will be found. I don't think the argument that Scotland should be ejected is any more sensible than saying the rUK should also be ejected since it no longer contains a union of kingdoms.

&gt; I also don't understand why the Scottish are so keen to get rid of Westminster but snuggle up with Brussels. Especially when the main argument against Westminster is it's too far away and too detached from Scotland. How is Brussels any better??

I think Scotland would be better of participating directly in the EU, rather than as 8% of a somewhat Euro-sceptic country. That does not mean we would have more power or influence (we would probably have less, as the more populous countries will always dominate overall direction), but it does mean we would be able to represent Scotland's interests directly rather than have them represented via the UK.

E.g., you might see a difference in something like energy policy. The UK's target for electricity generation from renewables is 15% by 2020. Scotland is currently at 30%, is aiming for 50% by next year, and 100% by 2020. That level of difference in investment and capability means that the Scottish government is going to have different priorities than the UK when it comes to exporting power or technology to other countries in the EU.

There are plenty of other differences in policy (nuclear weapons, NHS reforms, healthcare/education funding), however Scotland can only implement some of those under the current system of devolution.",3,c6uy0fm,

Morals are determined by culture and society (Unless you believe that people are born with morals, which doesn't explain why people have different morals in different cultures. Maybe it's genetic? No, still doesn't work. i.e. adopted children picking up morals from the culture they are raised in rather than their birth culture). Most cultures being in agreement with a moral value does not make it universally true. 

First of all, I would like to state that my observations lead me to believe that morals are strictly subjective, as people cannot have an objective view of the universe, because that would require removal from it. (Some people like to think they can achieve this, but the fact that we are part of the universe if inescapable. Influence is constant as long as we are in existence.) As morals are subjective, they are altered by the human experience, and are not universal or objective. This is my warrant. If you disagree with it, you can disregard the rest of the post and simply debate this topic.

Take the Aztecs for an example of morals being changed by might. Human sacrifice was a ritual for them. Their morality was not any more or less correct than the European's morals, but when the Europeans arrived they put a stop to this practice. In this case, might made right. 

Alternatively, if someone had a moral conviction that killing ANY kind of animal was wrong, stepping on an ant would be immoral. However, if they have no way of impressing this upon anyone else (no might) then the moral will not become widely adopted (no right).",3,c6uydy8,

I don't find this very persuasive. 

I'm not familiar with The Help and Django Unchained, but Inglorious Bastards is about killing *Nazis*, not ... ""just white people"" (although there was no shortage of racism among Americans or other Europeans at the time either). Additionally, the Nazis' victims are European/white Jews, and the ""heroes"" or protagonists are all *white*--with perhaps a very weak exception of the Jewish woman's black lover, who is barely seen. 

In A Time to Kill, the white victims are killed for being brutal rapists (their racism is just icing supported by their general society). The story takes place during great, racial oppression and the main protagonist is white.

&gt;but I have never ever seen a movie where the opposite is the case.

That sounds pretty ridiculous ... historically and presently, there are plenty of movies/stories wherein white protagonists overcome non-white villains. ",10,c6uyitk,

First of all, I didn't say autonomous, I said relatively autonomous compared to the rest of the world. These two things are not the same. The middle east was by no means autonomous, but they were more autonomous than the rest of the world for most of their history. Politically, Africa was colonized with western powers exercising political control over it in one way or another, this control was so entrenched that the Europeans felt comfortable enough to get together in Berlin in the 1890s and put it to paper. Most of South, East Asia, and the Asian Pacific had been colonized directly by western powers. China was divided up into spheres of influences, and South America had been colonized and become independent. This all happened prior to the start of the 20th century. Now, Iraq, Syria/Lebanon and Jordan didn't come under western control after World War I, with the adoption of the UN mandate system. Most of these mandates lasted less than 20 years. Afghanistan and most of Saudi Arabia never came under effective political control by western power. So, I think that saying the middle east was relatively autonomous compared to the rest of the world is realistic. Unless you want to equate 20 years under political mandate to 200 years of political and economic meddling that occurred in other parts of the world?

The second part of your argument, that there had been constant exchange of ideas between Europe and the Middle East since long before the start of the 20th century is partially correct. There was certainly exchange, but to what degree this exchange occurred and how much traveled in each direction is the more important part. Saying that there was meaningful substantive exchange between the two during the Byzantine period or during the renaissance, therefore what I stated in my previous post is falsified is ridiculous. First, because during antiquity and the renaissance the technological and social divides were much less. Second, because a it's 300 years removed, while it may have had some effect, a lot happened in 300 years politically and socially. It's kind of like if I called up my best mate from my first year of undergrad after all the time that has passed. I might know some things about him, but I don't know about his kids, his wife, or what he's been doing recently.

So lets squish this right here and now, no part of what I've said in any way implies that (1) the middle east was destined to be 'backwards'. Your word not mine. I certainly wouldn't have chosen it. (2) That the middle east is 'backwards' because of Islam. In fact, I'd agree with you that the this is more the fault of a complex set of social norms, many of which predate Islam and modern economic and political factors. It's certainly not monolithic. I said the middle east was used to being judged by its own set of political and social norms and that these norms are now clashing with a set of global norms, that although varied, have through interaction or colonialism, have largely been integrated to the point where at a minimum they can begrudgingly co-exist. 

The simple fact is, there was relatively little interaction between the Middle East and West in 'recent' history. For the most part this lead to ambivalent feelings in the Middle East towards the West. Most of the ideas that people in the middle east were the result of their opinions about the pro-Western regimes installed during the Cold War and the US involvement in the brokering of peace between Egypt and Israel. This views tended to be more abstract and less directly linked to the West and more directly linked to their constituent issues. Then in the 1960s the amount of economic and social interaction between the Middle East and the West spiked. US spending alone in the middle east between 1950 and 1970 was $4.4 billion, between 1971 and 2000 this had become $66 billion it had reached. On top of that, in the late 1990s you've got the development of satellite television networks in the Middle East which give it exposure to the West in ways that it never had before. Now, you have a group of folks within the Middle East that that their long standing beliefs are threatened by the influence of an entirely different set of norms, and what happens? There US with support from other Western powers comes knocking at their door, first in 1991, then again in 2001, and finally in 2003. So you get a visceral reaction. It could have happened anywhere in the world given different circumstances, but it didn't, it happened in the Middle East.

Don't believe me? Lets try this counterfactual situation. Imagine a world that evolves where the entire world develops under a system under autocratic rule, where commerce is completely regulated by the state in an effective manner, and everyone atheistic. Now imagine that the United States exists in this world, but has been more or less isolated from the rest of the world for the last 200 years. American's know the outside world exists, but we don't really have a firm grasp of what they believe or how their system works. They know that the rest of the world have some beliefs that don't sit well with out local customs. Maybe they don't like apple pie and capitalism. Then one day the rest of the world finds out the US has a ton of Apple Pie, and they really want Apple Pie. We think this is great, we're getting some money from selling them Apple Pie. More and more people from the rest of the world show up telling us ""hey, capitalism, democracy, and free religion that's not really the way to go"". It's OK though, there's an ocean in between us, the effect they have is minimal. Then, all of a sudden, you exposure gets dramatically increased. There are TV broadcast with all media that broadcasts the rest of the world's ideas into our homes and to our children. Signs go up everywhere that say ""let the state run the economy"" and ""free religion is bad"". The rest of the world invades Canada and Mexico and install regimes that look like their own, with societies that are still similar to ours, but not quite the same. You're really going to tell me there's not some red-neck in Georgia that's not going to get his buddies and his gun as a result?

As to my ""pet theory"", it's not my theory, it's not even necessarily one that I agree with completely, it's one that is often used to explain this type of phenomena. For example, Walzer uses it in his discourse about human rights and global justice and Waltz uses it his explanation of state behavior in the international system.

Yes, they did. Harder on the outside, softer on the inside, just achieved differently. Katana were actually fairly brittle and fragile when compared to a medieval sword made for battle.

Katana are pretty and featured in animes, hence people like you believing that they were a miracle of craftsmanship. They weren't, they were a weapon created for a very specific purpose and they worked well enough at it.

Karma: +20.00,t1_c6uuj9o,"&gt; The Aztecs are set to trigger in the 1200's, Atlantic Pack Ice and glaciers didn't even start growing until 1250. The first Norse settlements in Greenland were thought to still be active until the Western one was abandoned until 1350, 100 years later, although the Eastern settlement was still active until the 15th century. Greenland had no lumber of its own and was reliant on trade with Norway and Iceland, so the route was still possible, at least in the 1200s.

Possible for supplying a handful of struggling, doomed colonies, yes.  Being a practical route for tens of thousands of Aztecs and their horses on longships is another matter.  How do they feed this army?  Preserved food only goes so far and they would not be able to forage or steal significant amounts in North America or Greenland because of the differences in population size and farming practices.  They would be starving for the months it takes to reach Europe and supply sources comparable to mesoamerica.  What happens to the hundreds of boats that would inevitably break?  Where do they get the lumber to repair them so they can keep moving their massive army?  How much time do they spend stuck in a sub-arctic climate, something central americans would not be prepared for no matter how many vikings they talked to.

&gt;Would they not? If the Vikings brought Smallpox and other European diseases with them - they would've also had time to mutate into forms Europeans are not resistant to.

Though it is possible all of the survivors would become carriers, it seems much more likely to me that a continent that couldn't support its own diseases in the first place would not be capable of permanently maintaining disease introduced from elsewhere.  There's no guarantee disease will remain after the first waves of victims die - they still have all those qualities of their society that I listed above that make it difficult to spread disease.  Without easy access to new hosts, any disease will die off.

It's also important *how* the introduction to small pox and the like take place.  Europeans swarmed over the Americas exploring and settling, speeding up the spread of disease and introducing it to more remote areas.  If the only contact with small pox is the sparsely populated tribes living around Vinland, it would have to go on quite a voyage South to inoculate every American.  It isn't a matter of 90% die in the year 1000 then repopulate to full power 200 years later, it would either be a short lived spread that is halted due to one tribe or region's isolation or a slow spread spanning generations as it spread from community to community.

&gt; This is not necessarily true; if the settlement at Vinland maintained contact with the settlers at Greenland, they would pass some of the new mutated versions of the disease along to the Aztecs via Icelandic traders.

Wouldn't the Europeans be aware of the Aztecs then?  I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a completely unexpected invasion.  What would the Americans have to trade that would give Norsemen incentive to make the dangerous trip across?  Compared to Europe, they had no easily accessible supplies of iron, no good source of food.  None of the spices and silk they traded with the East for.  The wealth of central america is a long way from Vinland and, evidently, the Aztecs aren't the friendliest bunch with Europeans.",1,c6uz1ir,

Physically ideal, at least. She knocked on the glass as I walked away, as if she could read my mind, or saw that ""whore's mark"" glint in my eyes when I glanced at her, I don't know.

It's weird because they don't seem like ""prostitutes"" in that context. Their windows or storefronts or whathaveyou are out in the open, the girls done up, everything's well lit (with red lights, of course), and there's not a shred of shame in their eyes. It's almost like you have to remind yourself of what you're looking at. Like, that's a prostitute, not a girl you can go chat up and take out to dinner and a movie, so get your dick on straight.

As a midwestern American raised in a highly Christian environment, where the only safe sex is no sex and masturbation doesn't exist, it was trippy to see something so closeted back home be so open there. It's weird because Amsterdam is known for being this place to go to smoke weed openly, but I saw waaaaaay more people openly smoking in Granada. Less whores, though. Anyway, to return to the article linked, the things I remember most about Amsterdam have nothing to do with drugs, but I don't think many people would go there without that allure. 

**edit** - Since I sort of led y'all on, I'll tell my one story about a guy I know who did visit a prostitute.

So they were a bunch of American college students, Sophomore age, who were studying in Spain (Seville, I think) and decided to go to Amsterdam because that's what upper middleclass kids do when they're in Europe. Because you definitely can't find weed in Andalusia...

Anyway, they're in Amsterdam and they all decide fuck, we're here, we've smoked weed, we've eaten brownies, we've got drunk (remember these kids are 19/20), now at least one of us has to fuck a prostitute. But prostitutes in Amsterdam are absurdly expensive--costs money just to get in the door, then more money for everything after that. No matter what happens, if you want to have a good time you're going to be shelling out at least a few hundred Euros.

So these kids say listen, we'll all chip in and pool the money, then one of you goes in and gets a blow job. Fuck no, no one's into it. Alright, two of us will go. We'll both go to separate prostitutes, then enter at the same, get handjobs (which they guessed would be cheaper), and leave. Sound good? Yes, sounds good

Eventually they settle on my friend and one other guy. The two of them go up to the doors, look across at one another, nod a few times, and then open their doors. Except only one, my friend, walks in. The other one just pulls on the handle and turns right around. Classic psych out.

Now, the doors to a lot of these prostitute little... cubbyholes, I guess... are glass doors, which they pull a curtain over when you go inside. So these prostitutes would have been standing right on the other side of the glass (they push themselves up against it almost to the point of touching when trying to attract a joe), watching this whole thing go down. My friend walks in not knowing that his friend just ditched him, thinking he'll be able to share his shame with another and take solace in solidarity. No such luck.

Anyway, everyone's a pussy and this guy ends up backing out as well, but he still has to pay for coming through the door. I guess that's a common thing for people to get nervous and back out, which explains the doorcharge. Long story short, he's still awesome in my book for going in, but he didn't get a handjob.

I've met other people who have been to prostitutes but honestly it's not really interesting. The sex shows are much more interesting.

Err, a [brief glance at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj#History_1858_to_1914) makes this a very suspicious statement:

&gt;The 1861 Census had revealed that the English population in India was 125,945. Of these only about 41,862 were civilians as compared with about 84,083 European officers and men of the Army.

But this is somewhat irrelevant; I believe the main point of contention was whether imperialism was economically beneficial for colonizer.

My parents moved around a lot when I was young due to their research and the transient nature of the work they did. As a result, I found myself battling with identity issues having to adapt to new locales, people, and countries. Friends were few and far between, largely kids of similar circumstances or girls attracted to the poorly adjusted.

While love and affection were in short supply from my folks, I was constantly inundated by activities to foster my mind. I had tutors, I lived with researchers, helped with field work, and was given every opportunity to eclipse the vast majority of people I encountered. My intelligence flourished almost at the same pace as my arrogance, and before too long I became a condescending douchebag of fantastic proportions. I took my rebellious angst to South Africa, Ukraine, and the Arctic circle. Eventually, my mother decided that my petulance was a distraction and decided to ship me off to buttfuck nowhere in Ontario, Canada. In this little town in Northern Ontario I met, and lost my 'one'.

The relatives who tool me in owned a farm - poorly maintained, and as efficient as a well in the desert. My rehabilitation into society would revolve around rehabilitating this farm back to fruition. In short, I spent days plowing, digging, weeding, thinning, and blistering. It was hard work, but the alternative would be watching paint dry, or counting nothing-shaped clouds in the sky. It was a 'community' of 500 officially but that sign must have been the small-town equivalent of a penis-measuring contest with the village nearby. 

That being said, to my great surprise, the farm next door was owned by a former teacher from the 'big city', who had a dull little wife, and a gorgeous daughter around my age. We met by accident when I trespassed on their property looking for a break from plowing hard ground, and the occasional manual stimulus.

I stumbled on their delapitated barn, and as I was nonchalantly working on ripping off some side boards to get inside, a stern (but delicate, oh so delicate) voice warned me I better not do that if I were her. Now, let me step back a bit, small-town Canada isn't all about pleases and I'm sorries. She had her father's long gun, and I had no interest I'm finding out if she knows how to use it. She had seen me walk through our farm and across into hers, and decided she would welcome a new neighbor in this quaint, welcoming way. I told her who I am, and that I was bored. I also called her barn a delapitated shithole I was planning to explore (not that I'm into that, just poor wording). She promptly told me to go home and that she will be letting her father know 'a comedian moved in next door'. I walked back through our farm, but left my heart behind like a trophy for the little brunette with the big gun.

I would work the edges of the plot a lot more intensely from then on, hoping to catch a glimpse of Samantha, Sam, Sammy.. And every so often I would be greeted by a watchful eye, watching my every move lest I stray. This was good enough for me, and it wasn't long before I started yelling things in her direction. They were stupid things like 'take a picture, it will last longer' or 'instead of just standing there you could make yourself useful.' At first, she wouldn't humor me with a response, but I guess I grew on her like the veggies on my farm. She started mocking me, imploring me to quit my job and become a scarecrow, or pursue a career in crime, failing to break into a barn without being caught red-handed. In short, our relationship improved, but I had yet to have a conversation with her, not to mention time alone.

My uncle and Sam's parents went away on a hunting retreat, which presented just the opportunity for that. I spent the whole day plotting how to approach it, building castles and slaying imaginary giants in my mind, but did nothing. Until night brought with it a storm that gave me an excellent idea. I put on my boots and coat, disconnected our power generator and headed towards my lovely neighbor's farm. Rain was pouring, thunderstorms up over my head, and covered in mud practically up to my knee, I reached her house and pounded on the door. It felt like an eternity, I was standing in a puddle a frog prince could live in, dripping on the deck like a thousand icicles melting into spring. She looked through the curtain and seemed unimpressed, but finally opened the door and casually asked if I forgot where I live. I loved it. 

I proceeded to explain that our power got knocked out by the storm and that there is obviously no heat. I asked if I could borrow some lamps, and maybe a few blankets so I don't freeze. I must have looked pathetic, because her eyes softened and she invited me in (sans boots). She gave me her dad's undersized clothes, offered me tea, and seemed appreciative of the company. We spoke for the first time. We chatted, and then conversed. She was down to earth, feisty, had a sharp sense of humor, and man, was she fucking stunning. We didn't sleep together, because we just didn't sleep.. In the morning, I walked back, knowing we will see each other again soon. I've made a connection with someone I've known for months.

But life is a bitch, and in what must be some sort of cosmic karma, cut off that connection like I cut off that generator. Word came to my uncle that my mom was seriously injured in a drilling exercise. I was packed and out of buttfuck nowhere in an hour, on my way to Europe where my mom was fighting for her life. 

She survived and went back to her research within months, whereas I was sent to continue my refinement in a new school, far away from farms and bumpkins. Never went back, but I can't help but feel that this was the one I let get away. Every girl I've been with since has made me think of Sam.

That's my sad story.

In regard to ""stream snipers,"" again the witch hunt is absurd by fans of streamers.  Let me ask you something... if you don't want to get mugged, do you think it is a good idea to walk around central park at 2 AM wearing expensive jewelry in the open?  Because I don't and I imagine any reasonable person would agree with me.  Similarly, I think that if players don't want to get ""stream sniped"" (mugged), they shouldn't queue in 5v5 during EU prime time (central park at 2 AM) while streaming with no delay (wearing expensive jewelery in the open).  It's not rocket science!  And even if a streamer was legitimately getting stream sniped--which I don't believe occurred here--that is not a good reason for abusing a ""bug"" openly on stream.

I just don't see it being feasible for Scotland to be removed from the EU. The case of the UN is different as only the state is represented not it's citizens, the EU puts citizenship and the citizen first and foremost. There'd be some negotiation certainly but for Scotland to be kicked out the EU would be more difficult than just allowing it to remain a member through a fast-tracked process.

Would the Empire Strikes Back have been as fun, surprising, and exciting to audiences in 1980 if the story had been in paperback since 1960? People were gleefully shocked to find out that Darth is the daddy, and had to wait another couple of years for Jedi to resolve the cliffhanger ending. There is by definition no way that anything this exciting could be done with the movies if they stick to familiar EU canon. I want to be surprised, the thrill of not knowing what is going to happen to our heroes next.

One other thing to consider: Star Wars films are designed to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, and the original trilogy succeeded wonderfully at entertaining everyone 8-80. The expanded universe is designed to appeal to a narrower, geekier strata of acknowledged *Star Wars fans* who care about things like the backstory of the Hammerhead alien from the cantina scene. This stuff is often great, but not necessarily what makes for a great Star Wars film.

My personal big geeky hope is that they bring back as many main actors from IV-VI as possible. Mark Hammil's aged face looks perfectly dramatic for the once young Jedi who has been through 30 years of some serious shit.

---EDIT and update--- I just looked at [Star Wars Expanded Universe on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe) and at the end of the first paragraph it states that while the EU has its own canon, George Lucas views it as separate canon from the film series. I wonder if this is a very recent wiki edit. If so, that could indicate a pretty clear message from Disney. Quoting Wikipedia:

&gt; This material expands and continues the stories told in the films and, excepting where it contradicts the films, is generally considered canonical. However, George Lucas has viewed it as a separate canon from his movie series.",4,c6uzwux,

It strongly concludes that ""force feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds.""
&gt;
&gt; Members of the committee describe how geese and ducks show ""avoidance behaviour indicating aversion for the person who feeds them and the feeding procedure"". Although the committee reported that there is no ""conclusive"" scientific evidence on the aversive nature of force feeding, and that evidence of injury is ""small"", in their overall recommendations, the committee stated that ""the management and housing of the birds used for producing foie gras have a negative impact on their welfare"".

From my point of view it was a big mistake to integrate the former Eastern Block states. Instead of welcoming new members without the necessary basic attitudes the old EU members should have pushed for an deeper political integration of the old member states and offered some kind of ""associated memberships"" to the new ones, creating some kind of ""cordon sanitaire"". Most of the eastern states would have never accepted, because they are not really interested in the idea of an united, integrated Europe but are graving for subsidies instead.

Whose society?  On what grounds do you have the expertise to make this distinction?

&gt;Absolutely. But it's still a barbaric ideology. The kind of discrimination against blacks for example is quite vivid in much of the middle-east. 

Barbaric ideology?  Europe has been killing and subjugating people for centuries in the name of bringing ""progress"" and ending ""barbarism"".  Columbus in the Americans, the Dutch in Africa, Americans on the Frontier, the Bolsheviks in Russia, Hitler in Germany.  Whenever a person declares something to be barbaric, they are invariably forwarding an ethnocentric and discriminatory viewpoint that usually contradicts the very values they equate to progress.

Arab Nationalism is not barbaric.  Nationalism is a product of the modern era and arises in every nation-state during times of conflict or unrest.  Discrimination is also a universal component of the circumstances generated by modernity at well.  You have either missed or avoided the point I made:  you can't equate ideologies to things like Fascism without first demonstrating an equality of discrimination.

&gt;I'm making these parallels because your tone seemed as though you intended to excuse Arab nationalism as not discriminatory. 

I'm debunking your statement that Arab Nationalism is as racist as antisemitism. 

&gt;From what I inferred, it's almost as if you are trying to validate Arab nationalism as acceptable, claiming it's not as racist as anti-Semitism. 

Arab Nationalism is the business of Arabs.  Not me or, I suspect, you.  

&gt;Just because there hasn't been a genocide against non-Arabs doesn't mean that it's not as intolerant as anti-Semitism.

Yes, it does.  The degree to which you are willing to mistreat a population reflects the degree of intolerance you hold for them.

&gt;Now, compare that answer to this thread, and tell me that they are not related. Note the context. 

They are related but that wasn't in question.  You said the mod's post was specifically a response to a single thread.  Demonstrating that they're related doesn't prove that.

He showed up with a few friends of mine, but hadn't been invited himself, that was ok tho, we're a friendly bunch. After about a week, he's still staying at our place, says his ex kicked him out and burned all, his stuff. We don't mind and let him sleep on the couch and party with us. Eventually him and I hook up and when we get evicted for trashing the place (was all the boys, not me I promise!) We look for a place together. We move in and things are good for a while. 
After about 4 months things start to get a bit rough, he goes out with his mates, says I can't come coz it's 'boys night' when it's not, there are mutal female friends going along and several people comment on how I never go out, am such a sad sack staying at home all the time. Being young as I was, since the relationship wasn't fun I tried to end it, but he comes to me all serious and tells me the doctor says he has throat cancer and they're gonna start screening etc thne chemo and/or surgery.  I decide to stick it out, but after a few months, he's still out partying all the time, working very little and we're having major problems so we split and he leaves. 
A few days later I take his stuff to where he's staying, he wouldn't come get it. About a week later he accuses me of taking some of his thing (which I forgot during my inital packing of his things). I tell him to come get them, make a small pile of his shit in my living room and after 3 days of ' I'm coming to get my stuff, be there in 10' I get fed up and put his things on the street. I have not seen him since then.
about 2 weeks after we broke up, I learned that he was living with his new gf (a chick who used to text him incessantly while he claimed they were just mates, also one of the girls who he hung out with when I wasn't allowed to come) I wasn't suprised, just angry, plus she's ugly, like waaay ugly. Way to make me feel like shit.
A few years later I caught up (and had a fling) with his former best mate. Who informed me that said ex bf of mine never had cancer and it was all a con to get attention and sypmathy. by this time I had also found out that he was actually dating a now friend, then aquantiance of mine when we got together. She said that after they went to the party at my place, he stopped messaging, calling etc her so she cut her losses and moved on.
He had added me on fb so I messaged him about these things, he said his gf before me was a liar, they were never official etc and that his doctor has said there was a POSSIBILITY of cancer and that I misunderstood and he never corrected anyone coz they asked.
What an arsehole.

I am not happy with Obama or any of the politicians but I don't hold it against them. I am kind of on both sides of the fence with big government.

As for what I would do:

- Identify some new industries that could create large numbers of payable jobs that many people could work in. Cloud computing and other tech fields would be a start, but we would need to think of any industry so we could get people with varying skill sets back to work.
- Create new grants and government grants to help stimulate these particular industries.
- Relax some regulations to make it easier for them to operate. However, some other regulations might need to be tightened.

I think the government can be helpful in stimulating the economy to a point, but not to the degree many people do. I believe that at best the government should be viewed as more of a catalyst in helping stimulate the economy and create private sector jobs rather than an active participant. That's why I don't fault either party for everything that happened. People place far too much emphasis on the ability of the government to fix this crisis and not enough on the roles of companies in our free market system. If people want to advocate a communist government then I can see their arguments for relying on the government to replace all these jobs.

As for your point about building public projects, I agree to a point. I think the missing piece is that no one has been accountable for determining what the country really needs and doing a cost-benefit analysis to ensure projects yield a high return on investment (i.e. future jobs, GDP growth, more convenient lifestyles etc.).

I am all for building roads in areas that need them to generate commerce and connect disconnected communities so people can travel more and find employment in adjacent cities. If someone can show a tangible benefit to building a project that justifies the cost then I am for it. I am not for simply pissing money away on projects hoping that they will create jobs down the road. I think far too many people want to ignore the debt issue now in favor of the economic crisis which is more imminent. However, the debt will be a real issue later on if it isn't addressed. We aren't on the precipice of a disastrous debt crisis now like Europe is. But what if it takes 10, 15 or 20 years for the economy to recover even with all the spending you suggest? Regardless of how much money the federal government spends there is no guarantee that it will create private sector jobs (I assume you already know and accept this but just wanted to emphasize it to clarify my next point).

The long-term debt would be a grave concern long before then. What if investors decided to stop lending money to us or demand much higher interest rates three years from now? Austerity is never good for the economy but there becomes a point where it is no longer a choice. I can't fault politicians from either party for not getting too carried away with spending too much now, because they have to be wary of both issues.

Not sure whether I agree with your solution or not, because I don't know exactly what you want to spend money on. What kinds of projects would you work on and how would you justify spending tax dollars on them?",2,c6v0c1h,

1. The square street grid is boring and does not give rise to great architectural perspectives, [like in Europe](http://emdx.org/rail/canard/France2010/France_20101126-164736_28355_PalaisBourbon.jpg).

1. The city is far too much car-friendly; pedestrians and cyclists have a particularly hard times, despite all the claims about Montréal being ""bike friendly"".

1. There are not enough parks and green space; hell, Montréal has less green spaces per capita than New-York!!!

1. It is not dense enough; Montréal should, right now, amend it's zoning to allow 1.5 extra stories than there is right now (1.5 story = 1 full story + one with a setback so it's not visible from the street) to increase it's population in order to make housing more affordable and transit more profitable.

1. Not enough brown people. In addition to be much better-looking, brown people are much nicer than white people: for example, when you smile at them, they smile back at you.

1. The pigs are [total assholes](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/11ty8g/montr%C3%A9al_camera_seized_by_cops_for_an_unexisting/).

1. The subdivision in boroughs is nothing but total, complete, absolute utter bullshit.

1. In new developments, it is making the same errors as the surburbs did long ago by not allowing mixed-use* 

* Mixed-use is the best way to have a nice city; where I live, on my block, there is: a garage, some strip joints and bars, some offices, a woodworking shop, some low-income housing, an electronics warehouse, a (small)movie/(big)recording studio, a plumber and a lot of housing, ranging from condos to HLMs. During the last 20 years, I worked 15 years within walking distance (in all sorts of places ranging from a book design company, a museum design company and a paper mill), and I seldom needed to get out of the neighbourhood for my errands. Yet I have 3 Métro stations in a 1.2 km radius from my place.

This book talks about Eastern Europeans, but might be useful as a historical case and to prove that its not Islam in particular that results in extremist immigrants, but rather something about the immigrant experience. 

2. [On the Jewish Question by Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jewish_Question): To me, this essay by Marx has everything to do with how many people view the Muslim Question in Europe today. Marx claims that a Jewish citizen cannot realistically separate his religious life from his public life, and advances an argument for secularism and atheism FOR EVERYONE. He sees something particularly incompatible about Judaism and democratic society, much in the same way many contemporary atheist writers see something particularly wrong with Islam.

In fact, the Dutch laws on weed are more of an accident then a matter of high demand (pun intended). The main reason is an experiment by the local police during one of the first major popfestivals, the Holland Pop Festival in 1970. The police experimented by only deploying undercover agents that would observe the drug use and report if there were any incidents. The festival was a huge succes (bands like Jefferson Airplane, Santana and The Byrds were performing). And there were no real incidents, even though there were a lot of drug users and sellers. The results from this experiment gave politicians some basis to start the 'gedoogbeleid' (condoning policy). The fact that this policy has become a sort of Dutch heritage is because regulation had a positive effect on reducing drug sales in streets, reducing addiction and improving the quality control of drugs. 

These laws were the basis for methadon clinics, school instruction on drugs and open discussion about the dangers of softdrugs. People are against deregulation, not because they are users, but because it would undo all these accomplishments. The tourism part is a side effect that only concerns Amsterdam. Most Dutch people defend the law, because it is working positively on many different levels.

So drug use is much less common in comparison to other European nations. [-source-](http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Netherlands+lowest+rate+cannabis+Europe+study/2188397/story.html)

My guess is that most people here lose interest in softdrugs when they are past their twenties. Aside from the actual cannabis culture, which is a relatively small community, it is considered somewhat childish by most people to still smoke weed after you are 25.

Now I'm only painting the picture because how it's really going down remains to be seen. 

The Dutch can't legalize due to international pressure / fear of international implications. 

But mainly because it's current status quo. It's illegal but allowed for personal use in small quantities. 

It's political suicide to try and push for full legalization because of said international conflict, but there is also little immediate pressure because it's 'legal'  already. 

You're not the only country with politicians who are against it and they are the loudest voice on the topic of weed..  Because of the current status quo. Why risk your political reputation by being in favor of something where there is no real public pressure to be in favor of it.. and there is enormous international pressure/implications not to legalize it? 

The problem of the current status quo is that it's all fine and dandy on the selling part, but the back door isn't.. 

It won't either due to simple math. A person is allowed to have (read buy) 5 gram of weed for personal use.  A coffeeshop is allowed to have 500 gram of stock. But large quantities of weed are still illegal. 

(Interesting to note anyone with more as 30 gram is considered to be dealing, and you can imagine a shop needs to have an off site cache to make sure they don't run out during a day, but I digress ) 

So where does it come from? And when? Well officially there is no investigation into this (on phone but this is pretty much the exact quote you can find on Wikipedia if you look for the back door policy)..  Of course because they can't sell without supply.  This was a fine workaround for the first couple coffeeshops 40 years ago but by now it's not. But because the status quo, nobody can improve it either. 

The first shop when the law started to allow small personal use 40 years ago didn't immediately have a back door problem because they could meet demand..they had 5 plants and started with a tiny customer base.. oh and it was in amsterdam and a few more sprang up overnight., and it's not like every person walks around stoned all the time, on average it seems because it's 'legal' we have slightly less usage of it comparatively to some countries. 

That doesn't mean that people don't buy it either - and sure Amsterdam has ample coffeeshops to meet demand but in most provinces it's at most a couple in a big city and maybe one in some villages. 

Roughly in my province (15 times larger as Amsterdam) that borders germany - which didn't get affected so far thankfully - in an (15 times larger) area with roughly the same amount of people as urban area (not the total metropolitan) A´dam we have around a dozen coffeeshops. While Amsterdam has around 200.  You can see why small villages in the border areas feel like everyone travels there just for the weed.. 
 
But yeah partly it could come from illegal growing, because mass growing (and you need to keep up with demand) is illegal by definition.

The problem with illegal things is that criminals get involved that don't play so friendly.  For example a drug runner from France can be quite interested in buying too. 

Drug running and things like stealing power and using homes as growing spot all give illegal growing a bad name and 'illegal growing'  ends up as spearpoint of certain politicians as to why this whole weed thing is bad. 

Another problem with the fact weed is for sale in the Netherlands is that it isn't for sale in the surrounding countries. 

This might sound silly out of context but unlike crossing, for example, the Mexican border with weed and getting into trouble directly at the border you can cross the border in European countries without border control. Period. I'm not saying it's a good idea either but it's possible. 

Regardless, in the border areas there are a lot of people from Belgium, France and Germany that come buy weed.  Now we don't hate selling it to them and most won't cause any inconvenience but think of it like this;

If you're playing simcity and you're going to build a theme park or stadium you build it on the edge of town next to the freeway because that makes sense for traffic and keeping an otherwise quiet residential area. 

40 years ago when the first coffeeshops started, 1 the borders weren't open like that and 2 things had to stick to the zoning principles.. Just like in simcity..  If you have a industrial zone there won't suddenly be houses and in a residential zone there will not suddenly be a steel mill or any other heavy factory. 

Since a shop is commerce and downtown usually is the commercial zone coffeeshops located themselves there..  Surprisingly they're a huge success and draw visitors... Even more so now with the tourism in the border areas, because there are relatively tiny villages where it's not just noticable that people just travel to it to buy weed but increased traffic got to a point where it's a nuisance.. maybe there is a school or a church nearby - and in a tiny country with tiny villages there's always a church or a school nearby.. 

It's equivalent to building a stadium downtown of a small village and despite the fact your stadium has no hooligans the amount for people are a nuisance to some (downtown is commercial+residential.)

If your neighbour throws a party where everyone is invited for 5 minutes. It's not the soft but slightly audible music that will drive you nuts but the flow of traffic and the constantly ringing door bell.. Even if the guests don't litter the hallway

A solution could be to just acknowledge this tourism and build a drive through coffeeshop near the border..  It's not our problem that they don't want to sell it on their side of the border but of course this would have been a bit sensitive internationally and all plans for moving coffeeshops or building new ones outside of those border towns got shot down. 

In a lot of the border areas in the surrounding countries the police and population slowly is getting more inclined to legalization but on country level it's still illegal. Their governments are pushing us to solve the problems. 

We can't simply because we can't make them change the status of weed in their countries and we can't make weed legal (right now, because no politician is driving it forward, because it's political suicide). The only thing our government can potentially do (with the least amount of effort and most public backing) is look into this border issue.. And they did. 

(remember the public backing in this case is only there because the general public gets fed, on the news, the bad side of illegal growing, drug tourism in the border, drug running etc,not the pro legalization message ...  they are either normal people that don't get the full story or are a mislead type of voters) ^edited ^out ^a ^political ^joke 

Just because it's allowed to buy weed doesn't make weed a popular topic. Sure in Amsterdam it's not unknown to everyone but on average it's not a popular topic .. I think it´s safe to say half the population ..the normal ones from above joke.. would say 'drugs isn't something they would do' while holding a glass of alcohol just as much as in a lot of other countries. 

Remember that political suicide thing, yeah this results in the only party actually looking at this being a party inclined to restrict weed not legalizing it.  They thought they had an answer.. We just won't sell to them. 

Of course this lead to protest but long story short a law got pushed through which meant since last May in three out of twelve provinces (the ones with the border issues)  only residents could buy weed. 

Now the problem with this is that it's discrimination to selective sell to some but not others just of them being white or black or foreign..  So to work around this you could only buy when you're registered as a buyer. And you could only get that when you live there. (not that this changes anything but the court case deciding that would still be pending)..  

Problem here is that it's still a dumb idea for other reasons, they will just drive to the next province.. But mainly the coffeshops had to oblige but others jumped into the spot and people started pushing drugs on the street.. So the initial small protest turned quite large when the little nuisance from coffeeshops turned into a lot of nuisance from street dealing, But i'm getting ahead of the story.

 Long story shorter,.  The law was first in effect in may in the three border areas and would have been effective everywhere januari first. 

Of course for the border areas it's different because selling to tourists there was considered a problem.. (ignoring that any local fix won't solve anything but shift to other towns, while being too hesitant to allow large enough coffeeshops on the outskirt of their tiny town)   

In Amsterdam it is not a problem because they already have tourism anyway.. They're used to this ""stadium alike mass of folks"" running around whether they are stoned or not.  In fact in Amsterdam there is ample of economic benefits to the selling of weed so quite quickly this city declared it would actively ignore the weedpas law even if it went into full swing. 

While all this was happening the entire government fell and by now the new guys are trying to solve the mess. The new text is phrased vague enough to enable the border areas to restrict selling to foreigners but allowing Amsterdam to just stick to the old 18+ scenario

The problem remains that purely on official ID it would still be discrimination to deny a sale to one person and allow it the other.. However due to the enormous protest against formally registering for a pass to be able to buy they probably thought it was a bad idea to keep the pass but they had to imagine another way. 

The current idea seems to be this certificate you can pick up at the community you live in however this ignoring that the certificate is only valid for a month and costs 144 euro a year if you get one every month. This is why people think it will not really get to that point. 

Tldr.  Stupid politicians from former government messed with it, new law from next government retracts some of it with vague enough wording so (hopefully) it enables towns in border areas to have something to deal with the large flow of traffic and to please international pressure. while Amsterdam stays happily able to sell to tourists. - but it's all still fresh and up in the air.

The purpose is to keep an agricultural production capability. Not an emergency capability, a real one, where we feed ourselves pretty well without having to rely on outside help. For that we need to keep actively farmed land, know-how in the form of people who actually know what the fuck they're doing on a farm, and heavy machinery. You can't do that with onions, because no one gives a shit about onions.  
What are you going to do with your onions, who's going to buy them while there is everything else ? And if you don't produce enough to be able to feed everyone in Europe, your plan is worthless because you won't be able to meaningfully increase production by orders of magnitude in any useful time scale should the need arise.  
So, you need to produce a massive amount of onions and other stuff that no one wants in anything close to the quantities you need to produce to keep your agricultural capacity intact, and then what, do they go to waste ? So much for efficiency.  
Yes, we aid wine producers. But the land they use and their machinery could be used for other purposes should the need arise. Once the land isn't farmed anymore, it's going to be built up, or abandoned, and then you can't easily kick it back into production. Even worse if you don't have the machinery or the people knowing how to use it.

Again, the problem with your thinking is that you're thinking of emergencies, when the CAP is here so that we *never* get to the point where our food supply is being threatened. If we produce a lot of food inside Europe, then we have control over it. That means a lot. It means we don't risk a famine because a war broke out in Dumbfuckistan again. It means no one is going to out-bid us on the food we wanted to buy.

If we control the biggest part of our food supply, we're cool for the foreseeable future on this front. If we start outsourcing it like we did with industries, there is no way to tell where it's going to go, when it's going to stop or how. And losing control on the food supply is one of the worst thing that can happen to a society.

Whoever controls our food supply controls us. I'm not saying the CAP is efficient, or perfect. However, we have a vital need to control our food supply and that means keeping production home. It's an insurance for the future, so that we know we will be able to feed ourselves.",1,c6v1322,

Samsung / Apple UK judgment

On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited’s Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple’s registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.

In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:

""The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""

""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. **They are not as cool.**""

That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 18 October 2012. A copy of the Court of Appeal’s judgment is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.

However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, **Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad**.

I am Dutch (in the Dutchlands, Europe) and it cost me quite a bit of money. It just wasn't necessary, till then. Bicycle, bus or metro, and train took care of my transportation needs.

Due to some personal circumstance, in 1998 it became desirable for me to travel between two cities on a regular basis, say two times a week. In 2000, I decided the one hour thirty transit time from one front door to the other using public transport was a waste of my time, seeing as the same travel could be accomplished using a private car in roughly 30 minutes (at the hours of the day I was using the road).

So I went to a driving school (a concept unknown to many of you Americans) and took driving lessons. 77 in total, 1 hour 30 minutes each. After sixty lessons, my tutor was willing to let me have a go at the exam. I failed miserably. I ran a red light and then almost hit a mother bicycling with her two children (one on the front, the other on a back seat construction) while pulling out of a parking spot (I *did* manage to parallel park correctly into the parking spot, to my credit).

Two other failed attempts followed, after waiting out the waiting list and keeping up the (rather expensive) driving lessons. Finally, it was determined that I suffered from some sort of anxiety. I went to my house doctor, explained the situation, and she agreed to prescribe me some anti-stress pills. I don't remember what they where called.

Anyway, they worked perfectly. On my fourth exam, I was as cool as a cucumber. I saw the mother with the stroller at the zebra crossing, checked my mirrors and decided I could stop safely. I saw the gap magically opening in highway traffic when going up the ramp. I matched speed, and even put my hand up as a sort of ""thank you"".

The examiner made me do a three point car reversal (don't know what you call this - on a narrow two-lane street, you stop the car, put it in reverse, twist the steering wheel so you are moving towards the wrong side of the road until your rear wheel almost hits the curb , put it in forward and twist the wheel the other way and drive carefully until your front wheel almost hits the curb, then you reverse once again, put it in forward gear and away you go, in the other direction you where traveling before you started the back and forth).

Fourth time, I did win the prize. To this day, I'm still not sure if it was me being adequate or my driving mistresses *grok* with the examiner. Anyways, I passed the driving test.

Today, at age 52, I drive [this magnificent beast](http://imgur.com/R0LoW). 

I am happy to report the following:

Number of DUI: zero. (I love to consume alcohol, and know when to not do so, which is when I know in advance I will be driving. Yes, I am a responsible person).

Number of accidents involving other people: 1. They backed into my car (a Volvo, not a Roller) in 1999 while I was not moving. Not my fault, methinks.

Things in your setup get complicated to explain. The 16 solar panels aren't enough to run the quarry at full speed, so any power the produce will be consumed entirely. Also, if you e-link is connected to conductive pipe, and THEN the quarry, you'll be losing up to 50EU/t. You aren't producing even 22EU/t, but also consider the MFE's. An mfe won't send a packet of EU until it has 128EU. Even with one mfe (you said you have 6), you'll be waiting 128/16 ticks for a single packet to the quarry (or ~.4 seconds, or one packet every 8 ticks, that's 7 ticks of no power). Whether your setup is parallel or serial is worth more discussion, but we'll ignore that for now. Just know that more mfe's aren't helping at all with this situation (unless they were powered before hand) With just one packet of 128 EU, if your e-link is attached to a conductive pipe, it will take 72 EU of it (return the rest) and waste 50 of it, and only 22 will be taken by the quarry. The other 5 packets would return to their mfe's.  Regardless, you aren't providing even 22 EU/t from your solar panels, so your mfe's will drain. But your quarry will continue to run, just not at full speed.

EDIT: mfe isn't a problem, but something to think about

EDIT 2: my mfe argument is based on empty mfe's. Powering them beforehand will resolve the stutter I explain. Once they drain, however, you'd see a stutter in power sent to the quarry (as explained).",2,c6v1bx2,

But when they screw up, they do it in a big way. This happens often when they talk about countries outside Europe-US-China. If you don't know particular case/country they talk about, it sounds all plausible. But if you know the situation, they may make extremely one-sided comments. This happens because they have to rely one or two reporters for each country. And when this one reporter is biased from start and surrounded by same kind of people in the country they live in, they may make extremely one-sided, biased remarks. One example I can give is, at some point TE started to downplay coup plans that army cooked in 2004. It turned out that their correspondent in TUrkey was someone who was really pro secular-establishment. And there were a couple of articles on TE that was incredibly one-sided at this point. They reduced argument mostly to a government cooked conspiracy. 

Also the way they label factions in islamic world is very misleading. They nearly label anyone Islamist as long as they don't belong to a minority that strongly secular. It gives the impression that there is a strong coalition of fractions and they support each other, and all of a sudden you end up with a picture where hundreds of millions of muslims supporting Al Qaeda like organizations.

Operation Dirtpipe:  This is your run-of-the-mill anal series, with a twist.  For some reason, every once in a while  they involve cake.  They're either eating it during the scene or it's used as a ""plot device"" for literally no reason.

Scott Schwartz: This is a bizarre reference, but Scott Schwartz was the kid in ""A Christmas Story"" that licked the flagpole.

I think this was in ""The Dweller 3"".  It was an Elegant Angel movie.

Alex D.:  This dude is a director of bondage porn somewhere in Europe.  I don't know how our program director found this content, but it's really fucking weird and disturbing.  In one scene, he uses a penis pump.  Like, a lot.  To the point where his dick is all swollen and red due to all the blood pumping into his dick.

The bank bailout has already turned a profit. The bailout can more be compared with lending at inflated rates to someone who desperately needs it to survive - and they did survive and it has turned a strong profit for the moneylender.

If there had been a chain of bank failures it's likely that the economy would have been much worse. You simply let your rage and hatred for banks blind you to this.

&gt;and in terms of the wider economy nobody expected what would happen.

One of the biggest reasons why I loved it was the tipping culture. The service in America is 10x better than anywhere else I've been in Europe and Australia. Well, American service often makes mistakes in terms of what they should actually be doing (replacing cutlery at a restaurant for example, a pedantic example but one I notice since I've been to a lot of nice restaurants) but the FRIENDLINESS of the service is honestly one of a kind.

I liked to tip well when I was over there because I wanted to go around making everyone happy so even if the service was meh (didn't really happen) I still made a nice tip. I was tipping well at a resort I stayed at for a week and the bartender ended up giving me half my drinks free on the last couple of days so I think overall I saved money by tipping. Tipping makes everything NICER.

 We have a more logical tipping culture in Australia: if the service is good, you tip typically and if the service is not remarkable you don't tip. Makes sense right? The end result is service that is not HALF as good as American service. Seriously guys. I was so against tipping before I went to America and now I'm a convert.

By what measure would you say it's the richest when the Premier League clubs have [somewhere in the region of £2.4 bn of debt](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/premier-league-clubs-are-24-billion-854183)? Yes, there have been recent successes in Europe, but undeniably this has come at a massive financial cost disproportionate to the rewards.

Real financial fair play isn't about preventing investment *or* protecting the big clubs; this is part of the reason I take issue with the FA's complete inaction on the matter. My opinion is there should be wage caps based on each division's average revenue, so that the big clubs can't just run enormous squads with effectively two first teams of top players, but that still allows clubs to spend more on a few stars if they want. Of course, this kind of thing needs at least Europe-wide support, but [Michel Platini seems receptive to it](http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/81197.html).

Saying that relegation is punishment is a cruel and misguided way of looking at things. Take Portsmouth for example: the owners who caused their problems are long gone, but the club (and its fans) still suffer. Responsible stewardship is essential, and the FA are not meeting their duty of care by allowing unscrupulous businessmen to become club owners only to run the business so poorly the club suffers repeated relegation and asset stripping as a consequence.

Ultimately financial fair play is not about telling clubs how to spend their money but setting parameters for the size of that pool and ensuring the pool is not being artificially filled from revenue streams outside of their footballing operations. Outside of football, salary caps are not uncommon, and unless you're talking to wealthy sports franchise owners, aren't controversial. It's about time we had them in football too.",2,c6v27ar,

One may point to Europe as a place where Latin language persisted for a long time after the fall of the Romans, but I don't think that Europe was ever reunited to the extent that the Romans had united. Not only was China reunited using their same 'Latin', but this occurred several times. 

That written language was in fact used in the ROC (otherwise known as Taiwan) until the 70s or so for government documents.

Of course language comes down into one aspect of it all, but also the way rulers perceived themselves and such. As interesting as it is to point out that the Mongols may have done it only to make the population easier to rule, we can't really say that the rulers didn't actually believe what they said themselves. Perhaps they really thought they were the son of Heaven.

The Mongols in fact still asserted that they had a 'Mandate of Heaven' for a couple centuries or so even after they were expelled from China proper. I hardly think that they were doing so to make the Mongols easier to rule =-P

Of course these are one piece of the puzzle, but I think alot goes missing when we assume that it is all completely a silly myth. Confucianism comes to mind here too (at least from the Han until now, which was rather early).

Your country is still stuck in the law of the jungle phase. Other countries have surpassed that stage.

If someone is serving food to me in Europe, and they make a good job of it, I leave them a tip to show I appreciated their performance. If they make a bad job of it, I leave them a lesser tip, or maybe no tip at all. Even in the latter case, this will not affect the servers ability to pay the rent or buy groceries, because they get paid a decent minimum wage (as mandated by law) and tips are only an extra.

In your country, people serving food cannot rely on their basic remuneration to pay for the basic cost of life. They actually do need the appreciation of strangers in the form of tips to make ends meet. To my Socialist European sensitivity, this is a very bad thing happening.

&gt;Samsung / Apple UK judgment
&gt;
&gt;On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited’s Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple’s registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.
&gt;
&gt;In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:
&gt;
&gt;""The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""
&gt;
&gt;""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.""
&gt;
&gt;That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 18 October 2012. A copy of the Court of Appeal’s judgment is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.
&gt;
&gt;However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad.",1,c6v2rhk,

Of course there's working solutions in the middle -- most developed nations fall in that middle. 

Canada is an *outlier* with out strict public-only non-profit system.  

Europeans are often shocked to learn that it's *illegal* for a private hospital to charge a patient for care here.  There are private hospitals in Germany, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom and most other EU nations, often taking at least some patients on contract from the public insurers as well.

And while Canada is rather alone in outright banning so-called ""queue-jumping"", we actually rank fairly high in OECD nations for what percent of healthcare is paid for out of pocket -- many countries which have the dreaded private systems actually have*a higher share* of public coverage in healthcare for their citizens. 

* [Out of pocket expenditures of more than $1000 USD / year](http://i.imgur.com/cPacn.png)

* [% of household income spent on healthcare](http://i.imgur.com/BD2EQ.png)

That's not to say that privatization is a panacea.   I'm not personally convinced there's anything private healthcare can do that a public system is inherently incapable of doing.  I just think Canadians are perhaps overly phobic of any private involvement in healthcare.  It doesn't necessarily mean ending up like the Americans. :)",8,c6v2v5p,

Those are times when people are traditionally going off on their own. A high school senior might use the money for college, or he/she might use it to backpack Europe or something. I see your point there. I'd like to point out that they did buy you a trip, though, which is different than a pile of cash. They let you pick out where you wanted to go, but the gift was travel.

Still, as a general rule of thumb, when there's an occasion to pick out a gift for someone, it should be hand chosen for that person. Cash just isn't the same. 

I remember when I was a kid... we have a large family, and so we'd do a Secret Santa gift exchange. Any time we got one of my two cousins in one family, they *always* asked for a gift card (usually to Blockbuster because it was the 80s and 90s). Everyone hated it. Imagine if you had a gift exchange, and everyone just got everyone else a $20 gift card. What would be the point? ""Here's $20. I wonder what I got? OOooh! $20! What did you get? $20!"" It would be stupid, right? The point of gift giving is to get a person a gift. 

I know people really disagree with me on that point. The subject has come up a few times on r/secretsanta. I'm pretty much the only person who says cash is a bad gift. Well? It is. That's the one time when you basically have a stranger figuring out what to get you. My secret santa last year read my posts and found out I had kids and liked to make things. He sent me a whole book on kids' crafts, and I *loved* it. I would have never spent the money on something like that for myself, and it was perfect. If he had sent $20 instead, it would have gone to groceries. I mean, I would have appreciated it, but that's not the meaning of gift giving over the holiday season. In my opinion, that's especially true when it's from someone you love. ",2,c6v2wve,

China as well is not as homogeneous as is often portrayed. There are various mutually unintelligible dialects held together by written Chinese, which basically acts as a lingua franca for the whole country. For us moderners, I think, looking back at Roman history and comparing it to the various ethnicities in modern europe, I think it's two easy to say ""Well, of course that was going to fall, and there was no unifying identity"". In light of modern nationalism, it's practically offensive to say otherwise.

I think you should fuck off to Miami.  If you're West Coast, it's practically a world away and it has just as much beach, music and rich jerks who sweat money as Ibiza.  If you want something more downtempo, there's a million small laidback coastal towns in the damn country that don't care about anything other than music and surf.

A lot of history about the Sadr movement since the 80's. However more focus on Baqir-Al-Sadr and Sadiq Al Sadr (Muqtada amounts to nothing compared to them). Part three is about Muqtada. 

He's very angry and radical because his people suffered the most under Saddam. American Sanctions hit the poor the worst and Sadrs people suffered a great deal. 

Book says living standard dropped from European to below African country after 91'. [100,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iraq) kids died, this sort of stuff is expected to bread angry radical people. 

On the flip side I've heard from a well respected Iraqi Journalist that the Mahdi Army is basically old Shia Bathist. Most Iraqi Shia immigrants don't like Muqtada. He is also seen as ordering the Murder of Majid al Khoie. Book expands on that as well. His base of support is domestic iraq.
