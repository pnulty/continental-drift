http://ponerology.com/

&gt;Like a color blind man incapable of distinguishing red from green, a small minority of the human population cannot experience or fully comprehend the normal range of human emotions. And like those color blind who may conceal their condition by using the correct words while not understanding their meaning (e.g., the top traffic light is “red”, the bottom is “green”) - so does this minority conceal their condition by playacting an emotion's exterior signs (facial expressions, exclamations, body language). However, they do not actually experience the emotion in question. Their deception is revealed in the laboratory, where they respond to words like DEATH, CANCER, DISEASE, as if they were DAY, CREAM, or PAPER. They lack the ability to comprehend the emotional “punch” that certain words contain. They use others’ emotional reactions as cues, and they adjust their behavior to portray the correct ‘emotional’ behavior. (Hare, 129-30)

&gt;These individuals are known as psychopaths. Not only can they not feel the pain of others, they often seem to deliberately cause others pain. Lobaczewski refers to this disorder as an “essential psychopathy” to distinguish them from others with deficits in their genetic/instinctual endowment, essential psychopathy being the most severe and disturbing.

&gt;Many so-called “antisocial individuals” acquire similar characteristics in their life-time, whether caused by brain damage to certain areas of the brain, or functionally, because of close contact with and influence by such individuals. Lobaczewski terms such individuals characteropaths. The vast majority of both these groups cannot change. The acts that we call evil (especially on a macrosocial level) can be traced back to this deviant minority of human beings and the effects of their actions on their family, friends, and society.

https://www.sott.net/articles/show/210473-Ponerology-101-The-Political-Psychopath

In fact, **Vaknin makes a perfect case study** for the type of psychopath that is most dangerous to political institutions, and thus entire nations. Best known as an Internet guru for ""malignant self-love"", Vaknin was arrested in Israel in 1995 for major securities fraud. **The documentary follows Walker, Vaknin, and Lidija (Vaknin's wife) as they visit several European institutions to test if Vaknin is indeed a psychopath. Vaknin ends up scoring 18 (out of 24) on the PCL-SV (Screening Version),**

developed by Dr. Hare, a score higher than the majority of offenders in US correctional facilities, and the cutoff point for psychopathy. **However, according Walker, Vaknin, like many of the so-called successful psychopaths now being studied by Hare, Bakiak, and others, is not an ""archetypal, textbook"" psychopath. Contrary to the criminal populations, Vaknin is never physically violent.** He has also been married to the same woman for ten years, while most psychopaths are seemingly incapable of such 'commitment', engaging in a string of short-term relationships. (His emotional treatment of her is another matter, however.) Most interestingly, he is remarkably self-aware, and his insights agree with what the experts have to say. **For example, in total seriousness, Vaknin had the following exchange with Walker:**

&gt;Vaknin: **""I like to present a facade of the self-effacing, modest person. It gives people the impression that, underneath it all, I'm human.""**


&gt;Walker: ""But you are human, aren't you?""


&gt;Vaknin: ""I firmly believe that you want to believe that, yes. ... [The psychopath] regards people as instruments of gratification and as disposable things to be used. ... The vast majority of psychopaths, like an iceberg, are underwater, and like an iceberg, they are inert. They do nothing. They're just there. They torment their spouse by being unempathic, but they don't beat her or kill her. They bully coworkers, but they don't burn the office. They are not dramatic. They are pernicious. Most psychopaths are subtle. They are more like poison than a knife, and they are more like slow-working poison than cyanide."" 


After subjecting Walker to a series of degrading insults (a regular occurrence during filming), and with Walker still visibly in shock, Vaknin coolly, and with disturbingly sadistic insight, described the process to him:


&gt;""Your body was flooded instantly with adrenalin and its relatives like norepinephrine ... Now when these moments pervade the bloodstream, your brain reacts. It shuts down certain centers and activates others. This is called the stress reaction, or stress syndrome, actually. Then when the abuse recedes, the adrenalin levels begin to drop. As they drop, the entire system goes into mayhem. So what bullies usually do, they start and stop, start and stop. That achieves the maximal stress syndrome, and this is the great secret of bullying. Never overdo it. Small doses. The victim will do the rest. - Although you are shaking much less [now] ... I must do something about that."" 


This type of self-aware psychopath is perhaps the most dangerous to humanity. When his instinctive drive for domination of others is coupled with the means to attain to positions of power, he is not only free of the restraints of conscience by nature, but finds himself largely above (or indeed the architect) of the laws that are meant to protect normal human beings from the the deviant impulses so clearly defined by the psychopathic mind. **As a president, politician, military or corporate chief, a vast number of people are literally at his mercy.** ",t3_qbcpx,[deleted],,0,True,

1. I'm a heterosexual male, but I think generally black guys have it better in a lot of respects. Shaved heads on black dudes are much better looking than on most of white dudes. (As male pattern baldness strikes, it is an issue.) Tattoos in general look much better. If you work out, your body looks much better. (A muscled up white dude rarely looks as graceful as your pumped up black dude.) Plus why do you think so many white dude are trying to imitate the ""ghetto culture""? They actually think it's cool.

2. Girls... c'mon, man, just look at them. Girls of all colors -black included- are gorgeous. I was seriously in love with all the en vogue girls when I was a teenager... The curves, the color, the attitude -everything's just perfect.

If you don't believe me, watch any music videos from the '90s. :)

**Wait** you mean the Germans selling arms to Victoriano Huerta like I said way up there? You know *why* they were selling them weapons, right???

You mean *that* was one of the reasons that we got involved in WW1?

&gt;American didn't go to war because of 2 years of no deaths - America went to war because Germany decided, in Jan 1917, that it was going to kill American sailors.

No. America went to war with Germany in 1917 because American relations with Germany went to shit in 1914 because of what was going on in Mexico *before* WW1 even began.

This was seen as a **direct** challenge to American sovereignty and due to the material wealth gained from Western expansion it was understood that Germany was no longer the dominant military/industrial/economic superpower on the planet. 

&gt;America went to war because Germany attempted to entice Mexico into attacking America.

This, like the maritime deaths, all happened in 1917. If you think the United States decided to go to war in 1917 and did not make the decision prior then explain why the US began taking active steps earlier?

&gt;From a crude dollar-and-cents point of view it is hard to justify the war based on the trade lost to the United States. U.S. exports to Europe rose from $1.479 billion dollars in 1913 to $4.062 billion in 1917.

Now if trade to Europe rose by 3billion dollars per year in the span of 4 years and Europe was purchasing weapons... that would mean the the United States was expanding it's military-industrial complex starting in 1914. Factories were acquired. Workers were trained. 

&gt;However, on May 18, 1917 a draft was imposed and the numbers were increased rapidly. Initially, the expectation was that the United States would mobilize an army of one million. The number, however, would go much higher. Overall some 4,791,172 Americans would serve in World War I. Some 2,084,000 would reach France, and 1,390,000 would see active combat.

&gt;Once the size of the Army had been determined, the demands on the economy became obvious, although the means to satisfy them did not: food and clothing, guns and ammunition, places to train, and the means of transport. The Navy also had to be expanded to protect American shipping and the troop transports. Contracts immediately began flowing from the Army and Navy to the private sector. 

Made a lot of money so far, time to really do it on the large scale! Private sector you say? I wonder what platform Wilson was running on and who supported him in the election, hm:

&gt;Candidate Wilson's platform called for limits on campaign contributions by corporations, tariff reductions, new and stronger antitrust laws, banking and currency reform, a federal income tax, direct election of senators, a single term presidency, and the independence of the Philippines. Unlike Theodore Roosevelt's call for the strict government regulation of monopolies, Wilson followed the advice of his key adviser, Louis Brandeis, in calling for the breakup of all monopolies

Hmmm... break up monopolies? I wonder what this means? Let's take a look at DuPont:

&gt;DuPont continued to expand, **moving into the production** of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (now Hercules Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AstraZeneca).[2] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[3]

&gt;In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont **invested in** the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock of General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, **further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest itself of its shares of General Motors.**

Clayton Trust Act, you say? I wonder who signed that into law and when? Oh, that's right, Wilson, in 1914.

&gt;Let me make it simple: Had Germany not killed those 63 American Merchantmen (or sent the note) in the 2 months leading to war, war may never have been declared.

Let me make this even simpler: **NO**

So what you have here is really quite simple. On one hand the Germans were trying to pretend they were still the top dog (in our own backyard no less,) and on the other you have American industrial interests not only selling weapons hand over fist to Europe for the war, but *very clearly* exerting influence over the electorate (like in all elections) to promote their interests in the private sector: so they can make and sell more guns and be more profitable. This was going to *inevitably* culminate in war. 

The only way this argument flies is if you can honestly convince yourself that the US was going to sit by and let England get conquered while they were purchasing (on credit) all of these weapons. It simply wasn't going to happen.",t3_qab9t,imoffthegrid,,0,False,

No one really treats you any differently on the basis of you being ""Irish"" or ""Scottish"". So really, how connected are you with your heritage? I'm going to guess not that much. I'm saying that as a white person of English descent myself. Do either of us really need a national recognition that, why yes, your heritage is good and important, yada yada. I know I don't. When I do feel interested in celebrating my heritage, I just do a quick google search on my last name and drink some Guinness or something. Then I go about feeling normal and fine and whatever, because it really doesn't make any difference to me or others.

Now imagine being a person who with nearly every interaction with others, people consider your heritage. Not only that, but often those considerations that others make on your heritage are negative. Your heritage is not only noticed by other immediately, but often seen as inferior in some ways. But at least theres some time where, on a national scale, your heritage is noted and celebrated. A time where people are supposed to realize and learn that your heritage does not indeed make you inferior and that it is great in many of its own ways.

You know its not meant that way. But these people, who get the whole year to enjoy their heritage's privileged status, can't take a break and learn about you without whining.

Well I know I would feel pretty bad in that scenario. But I'm lucky. I get to spend the whole year celebrating my heritage. In fact, I've spent most of my life indirectly celebrating it.

I obviously think it would be incorrect to divorce historical change from religion, it has been a strong and extremely complex force throughout history and has worked in many directions to many ends.

But particularly in a place like the Middle Aast, it is really important to understand that, for example, there is no entity called ""Islam,"" you can't pick up a phone and call the ""representative of Islam,"" at least not in a meaningful sense. There are innumerable expressions of Islam now and in the past, and it is not even close to as simply as Sunni/Shi'ite for example. Also religion is never isolated from other things, so you can't look at say Hamas, pull out a Quran and figure out who they are and what they are doing. I mean there is really no religious group you can understand simply through their holy text, but that is beside the point. 

My problem, then, is not with religion being discussed as a motivator of historical events, but with people totally misunderstanding how it functions as a historical motivator. 

So lets take the example of religious groups taking political power, and for the record I agree that these are usually, if not always, terrifying.

But the question that I would ask here is, why is this a bad thing and are there other examples of things which are similar?

The conclusion that I have been able to draw, thus far, is that strongly ideological individuals and groups are extremely dangerous in positions of political power. This is a much more useful definition because it explains why you see highly repressive and violent regimes both in theocratic regimes and in a wide variety of ideological regimes (see communism and pretty much every european government in some way from 1930-40). I think this is a result of the fact that ideologies expose what is best for the world in general, and since they are trying to created a ""better"" world, they are willing to go great lengths to achieve that end. Furthermore anyone who disagrees (ie apostates or bourgeois capitalists) is an enemy to be destroyed, this us vs them attitude is EXTREMELY destructive and one of the things that terrifies me the most about the New Atheist movement, but that is also an aside. This is a fairly rough typology and one that I would likely change quite a bit with rigorous analysis, but I feel that it nonetheless affords us some analytic teeth. 

The point here is that while I totally agree that religion is important, I don't think using ""religious governments"" as an analytical tool is particularly useful, because they don't have their own means of functioning. To further illustrate my point allow me to discuss one more example.

It is that of the divine right monarch a la Saudi Arabia. This functions much more along the lines of the warlord/monarch/dictator. Yes there are religious laws in place, but they are flexible. The reason these religious laws are still in place in this scenario is not so much out of the fact that it is a religiously affiliated regime, not to say that thats not a factor. But it is more because this sort of government is fundamentally conservative, looking out primarily for the interests of the elite, and changing those laws doesn't further that end.

&gt; 1) It IS possible to live without speaking French. 

Et bien il faut faire tout pour que ce ne soit pas possible. En ce sens, la loi 101 aurait besoin d’être renforcée grandement, tout d’abord par l’instauration d’une véritable police de la langue, chose qui n’a été jusqu’ici qu’une chimère issue du cerveau des rhodésiens paranoïaques.

Cette police devrait aussi avoir des pouvoir plus étendus, comme par exemple d’interdire toute personne ne parlant pas le français de travailler dans un poste public.

&gt; It isn't a very good idea, … you're going about protecting French the wrong way.

&gt; 2) Bill 101 does not, … apply to private conversation. 

Mais  je n’ai rien fait de ça ici! Je me suis simplement défendu contre un  rhodésien qui s’offusquait que je parle français.

&gt; The person who was going to order food from your restaurant may choose to go elsewhere, 

Et bien tant-pis! Combattre pour sauvegarder sa langue et sa culture n’est pas une sinécure.

&gt; That's their problem and your choice. It doesn't have to be an issue of politics. You live somewhere, you should do your best to learn the language. But that doesn't mean it's right for you to go out of your way to make other people miserable.

Pourtant, partout ailleurs au Canada, une personne ne parlant pas anglais est condamnée à la misère la plus abjecte! Mais il est vrai qu’on a là le deux-poids deux-mesures si typique du Canada et de l’empire.

&gt; It was a conversation in English. So yeah, he should've realized the Montreal subreddit means there are francophones, but it was not a hostile question, and you responded with hostility.

C’était on ne  peut plus hostile.

&gt; The proof is that your response revealed you as the intolerant hateful person that you so clearly are. 

Le plus intolérant, c’est celui qui s’offusque que je parle français dans ma ville natale. Et vous aussi, pour me reprocher de me défendre!

&gt; The words ""speak white"" imply hatred and racism. The question ""why are you speaking French?"" does not. 

Dans une question addressée à moi, avec mon histoire de défendre vigoureusement ma lanque, oui. C’était une provocation délibérée qu’il ne fallait surtout pas laisser passer, pour ne pas que personne puisse croire que c’est correct de questionner la présence du français à Montréal.

&gt; If you fail to see that difference you need to take a long look in the mirror and realize that if you're going to go around bragging about how French think the world should be, you're going to offend people a lot more than they ever intended to offend you. 

Et bien tant pis! Nous n’avons pas besoin de gens qui ne sont pas convaincus que le Québec soit français.

&gt; The two statements are not equivalent, and I suggest you stop interpreting every instance of someone speaking English as a personal offence

Ça fait plusieurs semaines que je l’ai fait, et là, je ne répond qu’à une attaque délibérée.

&gt; Uh... what? No. It's an advantage at every level of life to be bilingual. 

Oui, mais les anglais ne sont pas près de réaliser ça, témoin les hipsters du Mile-End qui sont ici depuis des années et ne parlent pas un traître mot de français.

&gt; I was born an anglophone. My parents realized I would need better French education if I wanted to stay in Quebec, and sent me to a French high school.

Et bien en tel cas, cessez de critiquer nos efforts pour défendre notre langue.

&gt;For the last time, nobody told you to ""speak white,"" 

Chaque magasin, chaque restaurant, chaque endroit où il est impossible  de se faire servir en français à Montréal est un acte hostile envers le français.

&gt; I assure you the vast majority of anglophones are not ignorant assholes.

Et bien ils ne font pas beaucoup d’effort pour le prouver, la preuve, votre tirade ici même!

&gt;  You've told me I don't belong in Quebec even though I was born and raised here and speak both languages fluently.

Pourtant, vous vous considérez canadien avant tout, et pour ça vous allez voter «non» au prochain référendum. Et à la prochaine élection, vous allez voter libârâl, comme 95% des anglais, en bon vote ethnique.

&gt; Oh, and while we're at it, you should learn Mohawk,

En fait, pas exactement. Quand les anglais en ont eu assez des mohawks, ils les ont expulsé de leur territoire et nous, les français, bien qu’étant les ennemis des mohawks, nous leur avons donné asile. Pourquoi pensez vous qu’Oka est appellé Kanesatake? Parce que les algonquins outaouais, qui étaient là en premier, ont été déplacés par les mohawks.

Soit dit en passant, la loi 101 protège tout autant les langues autochtones que le français.

&gt; If you're a waiter at a restaurant with lots of anglophone customers, speaking English to them is a simple courtesy, and has the benefit of assuring repeat customers as well as good tips for you.

Oui, mais ce n’est pas une raison pour justifier l’unilinguisme.

&gt; that's simply good business. 

Nous, les français, n’élèvons pas, à la manière des anglo-saxons, les affaires sur un piédestal déique. Les affaires sont les affaires, certes, mais ce n’est pas la chose la plus importante qui soit.

&gt; The same is true on the other end - if you, as a customer, can't receive service in French, it is your full right to leave and take your business elsewhere. But if the person you're speaking to is struggling in a language you're fluent in, it isn't submission to speak it to them, it's courtesy.

Non, c’est un devoir de leur faire apprendre la langue de la majorité.

Nous y voilà. Le chat vient de sortir du sac. Vous déplorez l’impossibilité qu’ont les immigrants d’envoyer leurs enfants à l’école anglaise, ce qui a toujours été la pierre angulaire  de la politique de minorisation du français au Canada.

&gt; That would be oppressive and wrong, and under any other context you would be shocked and appalled by it. 

C’est le cas dans tous les pays. Pourquoi ce ne serait pas le cas ici? Qu’avons-nous de différent? Ah, mais c’est vrai, nous sommes une colonie du Canada…

&gt; Wow, I'm glad you aren't a hypocrite or anything.

C’est normal, je suis français. Contrairement aux anglais, l’hypocrisie n’est pas un trait de caractère français.

&gt; And the rest of the Montreal subreddit has the right to tell you its opinion of your contribution, myself included.

Mais bien sûr, et vous vous ferez répondre en conséquence.

&gt; you're the asshole in the equation no matter where on Earth the conversation is taking place.

Oui, et j’ai justement cessé de le faire; nous parlons présentement de ma réaction à quelqu’un qui m’a reproché de parler français à Montréal. Mais bien sûr, c’est encore le deux-poids, deux-mesure du Canada à l’œuvre, encore une fois. C’est bon pour les anglais, mais pas pour les français…

&gt; Concluding remarks: I have no intention of carrying this conversation further, because you strike me as irrationally threatened by the English language and I have the displeasure of encountering enough people like you in everyday life, let alone on Reddit.

C’est très bien, je vous concède donc la défaite.

&gt; I have no problem with people who speak French or any other language on Reddit or anywhere else they please, and I only wished to convey to you that there is place for English and French (and other languages, because let's face it, Montreal is more rich culturally than simply English+French) to mix and interact without hostility in a beautiful way which enriches both cultures, and you clearly disagree with me on a level which is beyond discussion.

Subvertir, minoriser, anéantir n’est pas enrichir.

&gt; I intend to stay in Montreal and raise bilingual children (well actually trilingual, my girlfriend is an immigrant who speaks 5 languages and we intend on teaching at least one of them to our children. Sorry about your heart attack.), attend English school long enough to preserve the right to make the same choice for their own children, and then switch to French so that Quebec is full of opportunities for them.

Grand bien leur fasse!

&gt; If my life plan disgusts or offends you, too bad. Just remember that **your misery is self-inflicted**, 

Bien sûr, c’est de notre faute si les anglais ont tenté de nous minoriser sous de l’immigration hostile…

You ramble for paragraphs on things irrelevant to the discussion, but then completely fail to cite any supporting information for your claim.

You may find this hard to believe, but politics worked differently a hundred years ago. That was an age where popular opinion ruled. A time when representatives were representative of their voter base. America would not have gone to war without popular support. 

All the information i have presented thus far has been an attempt to show you that the actions of Germany in the first quarter of 1917 provided the final catalyst to sway support to pro-intervention, thus leading to a formal declaration of war.

You might want to read your own sources as well. The very source [you used](http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/rockoff.wwi) supports my stance that America entered the war after public opinion had been sufficiently changed by the actions of the germans.

I will include the relevant section of your source as a quote, so that my reply looks to be as long as yours.

&gt; Once the war began, however, it became clear that Churchill was right. By the time the United States entered the war Americans knew that the price of victory would be high. What, then, impelled the United States to enter? What role did economic forces play? One factor was simply that Americans generally – some ethnic minorities were exceptions – felt stronger ties to Britain and France than to Germany and Austria. By 1917 it was clear that Britain and France were nearing exhaustion, and there was considerable sentiment in the United States for saving our traditional allies.

 &gt; The insistence of the United States on her trading rights was also important. Soon after the war began Britain, France, and their allies set up a naval blockade of Germany and Austria. Even food was contraband. The Wilson Administration complained bitterly that the blockade violated international law. U.S. firms took to using European neutrals, such as Sweden, as intermediaries. Surely, the Americans argued, international law protected the right of one neutral to trade with another. Britain and France responded by extending the blockade to include the Baltic neutrals. The situation was similar to the difficulties the United States experienced during the Napoleonic wars, which drove the United States into a quasi-war against France, and to war against Britain.

 &gt; Ultimately, however, it was not the conventional surface vessels used by Britain and France to enforce its blockade that enraged American opinion, but rather submarines used by Germany. When the British (who provided most of the blockading ships) intercepted an American ship, the ship was escorted into a British port, the crew was well treated, and there was a chance of damage payments if it turned out that the interception was a mistake. The situation was very different when the Germans turned to submarine warfare. German submarines attacked without warning, and passengers had little chance of to save themselves. To many Americans this was a brutal violation of the laws of war. The Germans felt they had to use submarines because their surface fleet was too small to defeat the British navy let alone establish an effective counter-blockade.

 &gt; The first submarine attack to inflame American opinion was the sinking of the Lusitania in May 1915. The Lusitania left New York with a cargo of passengers and freight, including war goods. When the ship was sunk over 1150 passengers were lost including 115 Americans. In the months that followed further sinkings brought more angry warnings from President Wilson. For a time the Germans gave way and agreed to warn American ships before sinking them and to save their passengers. In February 1917, however, the Germans renewed unrestricted submarine warfare in an attempt to starve Britain into submission. The loss of several U.S. ships was a key factor in President Wilson's decision to break diplomatic relations with Germany and to seek a declaration of war.

The low point of college for me when I lost all remaining respect for it was in a 300 level history class on medieval Europe.  We were supposed to read 5 books through out the semester, and then pick three of them to defend a position on our final exam (essay format).
I was one of the 4/22 people that got a 4.0 on the test and *I didn't read any of the books.*  All I had to go on was the 5 minute summaries of the main themes of the books that the Prof went over in class, and I didn't even take notes on that.  So me remembering 50% of the main points briefly run through in class was apparently more knowledge than the majority of the class got from reading them all AND having them all laid out by the Prof.

I had another philosophy class where literally ***the only grades*** consisted of a weekly 8 question quiz.  The professor would blatantly say out loud ""Take note, this will be a question on the quiz"" ***and then read the answer word for word*** and about half the class would still fail.  How?  The prof didn't take attendance, so people simply didn't go to class.

Cool anecdata bro. I bet that was real hard for you. Oppression sucks amirite? But really, do you actually feel insulted that you don't get a month? If so, I think you might need to get your priorities in check.

&gt;Absolutely fine. It's not about taking away Black History month. It's about recognizing other heritage groups as well on other months. What's wrong with that? So far in my areas, black history is the only one that's garnered any significant public attention. How about you stop making this an issue of black vs white?

You do realize how ridiculous it is to compare black history month to Scottish history month right? A much more apt comparison would be Scottish History month to Nigerian History or Kenyan history month. Or are national divisions in heritage more important when they are between different groups of white individuals?(Since you put disgusting words in my mouth, let me do the same for you: ""Africa is all the same, not like the beautifully diverse Europe, the only continent with important and differing cultures and heritage."" Wow man, I can't believe you said that, I guess we do need black history month after all, huh?). So when you say this is not about skin color or race, or that heritage and race are not linked, do you really believe that? I mean, after you generalize all black people as having the same heritage, unlike us whites.

&gt;I get it, you're white and you really hate racism. Congratulations. So do most white people. This isn't about racism.

It sure as hell is about racism when people spend the whole month in which Black history is supposed to be learned and celebrated complaining. The amount of racist comments in this post is astounding, and so are the amount of upvotes they get. 

&gt;Uhhhhh, yeah. This sums up your entire argument: ""I secretly feel white people are superior, so black people should have February to celebrate their inferiority."" That's terrible.

You also seem to be blind to the fact that racism is still a huge problem in the United States. Its not that I see black people as inferior (thanks for putting words in my mouth), its just that I realize that I have it much easier than they do in my day to day life due to decades of racial tensions. That is still the way it is in most places in this country, whether its explicit or not. The very fact that you interpreted what I said the way you did ""speaks volumes"" though.

&gt;I come from a poor, Apalachian town. I refuse to be ashamed of being white.

No one is asking you to be ashamed of being white. If that is a serious issue to you, maybe you are the one with a problem. I certainly am not ashamed of being white. I never suggested that you should. Empathy is th ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes by realizing that they are a person just like you, assessing how would feel in said shoes, and acknowledging that. I see no reason why this implies feeling ashamed. Or what your poor Apalachian town has to do with it either. I come from a poor urban area, whoop dee doo. Unless I'm supposed to infer from that that you are indeed racist (just kidding, generalizations suck though, huh?)

Because they find the black woman's body attractive but not the black facial features and dark skin. Perfect example women like Kim Kardashian and CoCo (rapper ice T's wife) They do not have darkskin or black facial features but they have a non european physique.

Common outdoor temperatures? I'm ok with a scale going from -20 to 40. It has a convenient zero-point (ice/no ice). Decades are convenient: 30s is t-shirts and tank tops, 20s is a sweater, teens is jacket, and anything less is a coat. How many different kinds of jackets do you have, anyway?

The precision argument is a total crock – if that was true we would measure everything in angstroms and amu.

China will obviously wage economic warfare against the US, which I think is largely what's going on right now but, the US has easily shown its capability of not only keeping its military intact but expanding it is possible despite the money to really pay for it. So, from an economic perspective on the front end Iran can't really do a lot. 

On a military perspective on any end, shy Russia, there isn't a lot that can stop the US from beating Iran. Swarm attacks and terrorism aside, (much of that is based around the head that is Iran) Iran's military forces can be removed pretty quickly. The civilian population is more difficult but, I think that most of them will step aside after having seen what blunder-fuck the US did to Iraq and Afghanistan... and I also don't think the mass of the Iranian peoples have any interest in war. Hell, I think the head of their separated political arm cares for it.

I don't think the US can outright invade and occupy Iran, at least not like Iraq. Its twice the size and twice the population. but I think they most definitely can occupy the outer areas and keep the cities in a containment level. As far as Israel is concerned. They can easily take care of Syria, and Iran won't be able to do much from an air power level not only against Israeli jets but US air dominance would stop that.

From all of those perspectives, I think the US is prepared to handle it. Obviously if Israel gets into it, the US will defend. The EU is quickly being bought up by the US so their compliance or at least neutrality is almost guaranteed. Like I said, the two main variables are paying off the Russians and neutralizing the Chinese economic threat, something I think the US is preparing itself for because, even without an attack/war on/with Iran, an economic 'butting of the heads' is with China is all but inevitable. 

The main thing about it isn't the hawk war mongering that Israel and US-elements are doing that scares me, its the lack of anti-war sentiment to counterbalance it that makes me worried. Its already postured as if a war with Iran is a given. Hence why I posted this article. Its as if its already been written, and, it has in scenario playbooks over and over and over, its just a matter of getting one of those in play.... something I think that is nearing every day. I would be very surprised if another terrorist attack or major assassination *doesn't* happen within much sooner than two years... on a Sept 11th level. ( [example](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/publisher-regrets-suggesting-that-israel-assassinate-obama/) )

The other thing that worries me, obviously there are alternative paths to war but, which ones are realistically being presented. I would say there are over 10x as many alternatives to a path to war with Iran than there are paths to war with Iran. All of them being postulated combined seem to amount to less than 1/10th the paths to war with Iran, and are talked about 1/100th as much.

My real question is, why? and I think their stance is almost 'why not?' It scares me personally. Not just for the Iranian people, but for what it will do to the rest of everything else as well. 
It reminds... there is more of a build up to this in many ways than there was to WWII or Iraq. When watching the shows on those, I always used to ask myself, the paths were so obvious of what was about to happen that... why didn't people leave? many did. most didn't. many couldn't. If I were in Iran, I'd be doing everything I could to stock up on things in the city (non-perishable foods, water, etc). That if I couldn't get out of the city. If I couldn't get out of the country, I'd at least get out into the country of Iran.... and, again, stocking up on food, water, etc. Attempting to create a less urban-dependent lifestyle. I'm half convinced to do something like that in the US and I don't even think its that big of a fear here... yet. But, if what I think is about to happen to this poor country (poor as in sympathy for, not poor as in their poor) is about to happen, I feel horrible for them. And, unfortunately, I feel powerless to stop it. That doesn't mean I want to just wipe my hands clean of it and say 'there's nothing I could do. their problem not mine"" but, I really do *not* see much if anything that I really *can* do.

The Freemasons, the Illuminati, etc. Not only that, but you really have to understand how monumentally important the American Revolution was. It laid the foundations for most of the conventions of not only the Western world, but the entire modern world.

* In Old World, the elites were the aristocracy. In America, it was businessmen. Power and prestige came from those who exercised the greatest business acumen. This is true to this day. The most powerful people in the world are the rich, not the royal. It's possible the Assassins seized advantage of this emerging class change and secured an era of dominance over the Templars.

* The United States was the very first colony to successfully mount a rebellion against a European power. It would become the inspiration for other colonial uprisings and also the French Revolution. A powder-keg scenario that leads to an international uprising against the established aristocracy of the Templars.

* The United States was the first country to be founded upon the principles of the Enlightenment. It was the birthplace of modern democratic ideals. Individualism, republicanism, freedom, liberty, equality, universal suffrage, etc. Very Assassin-friendly ideas.

* It'd be cool to play an American Indian protagonist. For people asking how an American Indian enters the family, keep in mind that [Altair and Ezio are not related to one another](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/21/alta-239-r-and-ezio-aren-39-t-related.aspx). They are both ancestors of Desmond but from different branches of his family tree. This hypothetical protagonist can be a Native Assassin who is from yet another part of Desmond's ancestry.

Also consider this. To me, it seems self-evident that the designers wanted to really nurture the idea that the Assassin-Templar War is a **global** struggle. If the game was set in the French Revolution, we are back to the Old World yet again. Assassin's Creed and its spin-offs are set in the Middle East, Assassin's Creed II and it's spin-offs in Europe, and Assassin's Creed III will be in America. You cover three of the major continents with only Asia remaining to be explored. Maybe Africa and South America, but there's not much fuel for conspiracy yarns in those places.

Featuring an American Indian protagonist compliments the feeling that the War is a battle fought by all of mankind, not just white guys. It is something that affects all races, all cultures, and of course, all creeds.


**EDIT**: For the people attacking me for being Americentric for the point on the United States being the birthplace of modern democratic ideals.

* Notice that I used the phrase *modern democratic ideals*. These were the ideals in the context of the time. We have a different view of what liberty and equality means now (open to people who aren't just white men with land), but those are the ideals we still go by on what we consider a democracy. Suffrage was far more lenient in the United States than other nations at the time who either had no voting or if they had voting, required you to have a title (be part of the aristocracy).

* Every other nation during the Enlightenment had tried to implement Enlightenment ideas, but they met heavy resistance from aristocrats who were unwilling to cede power. The United States didn't have nobility and therefore didn't have this obstacle. It was able to start with a clean slate. 

* Claiming that the United States isn't the blueprint of modern democracy is like claiming that Russia wasn't the blueprint for communism, because ""it was done before"". Just because a few people tried to implement the ideas of Marx and Engels here and there doesn't mean they ""did it before"". Marx also was heavily influenced by Aristotle, particularly *The Politics*, *Economics*, and *The Metaphysics*. Does this mean Russia isn't unique in its position in history and Athens already did it?

&gt;people buy from them because they give great prices, oh let me guess now you will say employees get paid less there, so what? did anyone force them to work there?

Actually, in many cases, yes.  Wal-Mart comes in and drives out the competing stores, because it can afford to operate individual stores at a loss until the competition dies.  When that happens, the options for those displaced workers are frequently only Wal-Mart or a similar chain that has done the same thing.  And not only does Wal-Mart pay less, but it's usually a huge drain on the local economy.  They don't pay taxes on their land or property (because they demand those breaks from the local government, or they refuse to build in that location), they pay their workers minimum wage, and they frequently schedule those workers to have under full-time employment to avoid giving them benefits like health care.  Wal-Mart actually plans for state aid to pick up the slack in some locations - and when I say ""state aid"", I mean food stamps, welfare programs, and medical assistance programs for the poor. 

&gt;Also by getting everything for cheap they are able to give us the consumers cheapter products, at the end of the day the consumer wins.

The consumer win is not the end-all of the equation.  Nor is it true in this instance.  Go look online for any of the NUMEROUS stories about how 24-hour production, horrible labor conditions, and business owners bribing foreign officials has resulted in toxic goods, poisoned food, inferior worksmanship... not exactly beneficial to the consumer.

&gt;Why are you coming up with such a big exaggeration as that these companies don't give jobs anymore, please move to Silicon Valley and you will see offices everywhere and hiring ads in every corner, yes some stuff are outsourced and I see nothing wrong with that.

It's not an exaggeration.  PRODUCTION jobs have been leaving Silicon Valley like anywhere else.

Coding projects require far fewer people, is an industry where unreasonably pushing workers is already considered the norm, code can be recycled, and coding projects end quickly.  Add to those issues that places like India, China, and Japan are also churning out programmers, and it's foolish to think those jobs aren't in trouble as well.

&gt;As for stifling innovation you are wrong, remember YOU the consumer has a choice not to use AMD

Intel illegally conspired against AMD to keep competitors from using their chips, in turn killing off their ability to develop competitively with Intel.  (http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-intel-antitrust-idUSTRE8182HX20120209)

&gt;Better medicine, more startups/companies to solve problems for us, science, innovations etc.

Why do you assume that any of this comes from deregulation?  Drug companies already try to sneak products with horrible side effects by the FDA as it is, and a company with sufficient market share isn't interested in innovating, it's interested in -preventing- innovation, because that leads to competition.

So did being a world superpower with abundant resources, wealth, and manpower, which helped lure in immigrants who contributed scientific advances.

Assassin's Creed and its spin-offs were set in the Middle East, Assassin's Creed II and its spin-offs were set in Europe, and now Assassin's Creed III and its spin-offs will be set in the New World. If we go to France, we'll be robbed of the sensation that this is a worldwide conflict that is fought on all fronts.

* Thematically, the monumental importance of the American Revolution fits with the mythos of the freedom-loving Assassins and the security-minded Templars. The Thirteen Colonies was the first colony to successfully mount a rebellion against a European imperial power. It acted as an inspiration for other colonial uprisings, and also heavily influenced the French Revolution. This could be viewed as an Assassin led coup that incited a worldwide insurrection against the aristocratically established Templars.

* The United States was the first country to be founded upon the principles of the Enlightenment. It was the birthplace of modern democratic ideals. Individual freedom, equality, liberty, universal suffrage, a rejection of despotism, etc. Very Assassin-friendly concepts.

* The elite of the United States overturned the power structure of the entire world. For the rest of the world, the aristocracy commanded prestige and power. It was based on a tradition of family trees. In the United States, the elites were self-made businessmen. Your power and influence was determined by your wealth and business acumen. Today, the most powerful figures in the world are almost always the richest, not the ones with the most royal blood. This could signal a time when Assassin's had the upper hand in the war by capitalizing upon (no pun intended) this emerging social change.

* American history is steeped in conspiracy theories. The Freemasons, Illuminati, etc. [The Eye of Providence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence#Freemasonry) is featured prominently on American money, and its history goes far beyond Christianity. It probably has its roots in Egyptian mythology and Hinduism -- rich material for Assassin's Creed.

* I would love to play as an American Indian protagonist. For people wondering how this plays into Desmond's bloodline, remember, it's officially stated that [Altair and Ezio **are not** related](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/21/alta-239-r-and-ezio-aren-39-t-related.aspx). They are from totally separate family trees though they are both ancestors of Desmond. It is easily possible for Desmond to have some Native blood from another branch of his Assassin ancestry. This again would also add to the global feel of the conflict. The Templar-Assassin War isn't just between white people. It's a war fought by all of mankind. All races, cultures, genders, and of course creeds.


**EDIT**: For the people attacking me for being Americentric for the point on the United States being the birthplace of modern democratic ideals.

* Notice that I used the phrase *modern democratic ideals*. These were the ideals in the context of the time. We have a different view of what liberty and equality means now (open to people who aren't just white men with land), but those are the ideals we still go by on what we consider a democracy. Suffrage was far more lenient in the United States than other nations at the time who either had no voting or if they had voting, required you to have a title (be part of the aristocracy).

* Every other nation during the Enlightenment had tried to implement Enlightenment ideas, but they met heavy resistance from aristocrats who were unwilling to cede power. The United States didn't have nobility and therefore didn't have this obstacle. It was able to start with a clean slate. 

* Claiming that the United States isn't the blueprint of modern democracy is like claiming that Russia wasn't the blueprint for communism, because ""it was done before"". Just because a few people tried to implement the ideas of Marx and Engels here and there doesn't mean they ""did it before"". Marx also was heavily influenced by Aristotle, particularly *The Politics*, *Economics*, and *The Metaphysics*. Does this mean Russia isn't unique in its position in history and Athens already did it?

&gt;Hitler was a disciple of the atheist Nietzsche (the philosopher who declared: “God is dead!”) – not Luther. 

In his public pronouncements, Hitler championed Christianity and presented himself as a fighter for Christ. Some argue, though, that Hitler only pretended to be a Christian.
Whatever Hitler's private views may have been, he used religion publicly to justify his persecution of the Jews.

&gt;He justified his fight for the German people and against Jews by using Godly and Biblical reasoning. Indeed, one of his most revealing statements makes this quite clear:
&gt;
&gt;*""Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.""*

In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.*

Luther's statements against the Jews, religiously-based as they may have been, were used as justification by later antisemites, including Nazis. 

&gt;The prevailing view  among historians is that his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany,  and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an ideal foundation for the National Socialists' attacks on Jews.  Reinhold Lewin writes that ""whoever wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther."" 

Reference: [Martin Luther and antisemitism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_and_antisemitism#Influence_on_modern_antisemitism)

Luther seemed to become much more intolerant of Jews later in life.

&gt;Luther's attitude toward the Jews changed over the course of his life. In the early phase of his career—until around 1536—he expressed concern for their plight in Europe and was enthusiastic at the prospect of converting them to Christianity  through his evangelical reforms. In his later career, Luther denounced the Jewish people and urged for their harsh persecution. 

Reference: [Martin Luther and antisemitism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_and_antisemitism#Evolution_of_his_views)

Many Lutherans in Germany supported Hitler.

&gt;At a celebration at Königsberg, Erich Koch, at that time Gauleiter of East Prussia, made a speech which, among other things, compared Adolf Hitler and Martin Luther and claimed that the Nazis fought with Luther's spirit. Such a speech might be dismissed as mere propaganda, but, as Steigmann-Gall points out: ""Contemporaries regarded Koch as a bona fide Christian who had attained his position \[of the elected president of a provincial Church synod\] through a genuine commitment to Protestantism and its institutions.""

Reference: [Religion in Nazi Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany)

Hitler did persecute Catholic and Protestant clergy that opposed him. His support for Christianity was qualified as support for ""[Positive Christianity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Christianity)"", i.e., Christians who would support National Socialism.

It just isn't unhealthy. Artificial sweeteners are chemicals that *taste* sweet, but cannot be absorbed into the body and therefore have no nutritional value.

Can it be unhealthy? Sure, anything can be in high enough quantities. How much do you need to consume though? For aspartame (the most widely used artificial sweetener), the ""...U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority established acceptable daily intake levels of 50 and 40 mg/kg bw/day, respectively"" ([Informahealthcare.com](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408440701516184)).

This means that a 150 pound (68 kilogram) person would need to digest over 2700 milligrams (2.7 grams) or roughly a tenth of an ounce of solid aspartame within a day to have negative effects.

A typical diet soda has about 15 milligrams of aspartame per ounce.

No, because the United States was exceptionally *special*. Like I said, it was the first nation founded upon the philosophical ideas of the Enlightenment, and it was the catalyst for many other colonial revolutions. It is also rich with conspiracy lore.

It's dismissive write off the United States as just another European country. Even since its founding, the culture in the Thirteen Colonies was quite different from Europe, and even from Great Britain. 

&gt; Honor, duty, and a persistent state of persecution imposed by an Imperial regime seem like pretty Assassin-friendly concepts, too, and backed by a loooooong history of tradition and martial warfare. Frankly I'm surprised they haven't hit Asia sooner.

Long history of tradition and martial warfare, but very little on conspiracy theories. There's definitely a lot of interesting ground to touch upon with the Qing Dynasty and its failure to repel the influence of European powers, but none of the events there had a global impact on the scale of the American Revolution.

&gt; It's also worth noting that setting the game in China would allow them to continue with the building-climbing themes that the series is so famous for, since the New World lacked any cities large enough to be practical for those purposes, and there were no cities larger in the world at that time than those located in China.

I don't get why so many people picture American colonial cities as European shantytowns. [Here's a picture of the Boston Massacre](http://cdn.dipity.com/uploads/events/678fb6838adbe3abf330419c4f424555_1M.png) that ran in the Boston Gazette in 1775. Those buildings are not tiny or unclimbable.

* The game has to be set in America for the Templar-Assassin War needs to feel global. Assassin's Creed and its spin-offs were set in the Middle East, Assassin's Creed II and its spin-offs were set in Europe, and now Assassin's Creed III and its spin-offs will be set in the New World. If we go to France, we'll be robbed of the sensation that this is a worldwide conflict that is fought on all fronts.

* Thematically, the monumental importance of the American Revolution fits with the mythos of the freedom-loving Assassins and the security-minded Templars. The Thirteen Colonies was the first colony to successfully mount a rebellion against a European imperial power. It acted as an inspiration for other colonial uprisings and also heavily influenced the French Revolution. This could be viewed as an Assassin led coup that incited a worldwide insurrection against the aristocratically established Templars.

* The United States was the first country to be founded upon the principles of the Enlightenment. It was the birthplace of modern democratic ideals. Individual freedom, equality, liberty, universal suffrage, a rejection of despotism, etc. Very Assassin-friendly concepts.

* The elite of the United States overturned the power structure of the entire world. For the rest of the world, the aristocracy commanded prestige and power. It was based on a tradition of family trees. In the United States, the elites were self-made businessmen. Your power and influence was determined by your wealth and business acumen. Today, the most powerful figures in the world are almost always the richest, not the ones with the most royal blood. This could signal a time when Assassins had the upper hand in the war by capitalizing upon (no pun intended) this emerging social change.

* American history is steeped in conspiracy theories. The Freemasons, Illuminati, etc. [The Eye of Providence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence#Freemasonry) is featured prominently on American money, and its history goes far beyond Christianity. It probably has its roots in Egyptian mythology and Hinduism -- rich material for Assassin's Creed.

* I would love to play as an American Indian protagonist. For people wondering how this plays into Desmond's bloodline, remember, it's officially stated that [Altair and Ezio **are not** related](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/21/alta-239-r-and-ezio-aren-39-t-related.aspx). They are from totally separate family trees though they are both ancestors of Desmond. It is easily possible for Desmond to have some Native blood from another branch of his Assassin ancestry. This again would also add to the global feel of the conflict. The Templar-Assassin War isn't just between white people. It's a war fought by all of mankind. All races, cultures, genders, and of course creeds.

I won't disagree with you there, the US certainly had a role to play in the arena of world politics. I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy of saying that France was unsuitable ""because Europe"" when the US is still a part of Europe during the period in question.

&gt;I don't get why so many people picture American colonial cities as European shantytowns. Here's a picture of the Boston Massacre that ran in the Boston Gazette in 1775. Do those buildings look tiny or unclimbable to you?

The research I could find on the population of Boston in 1775 suggests the town held roughly 20,000 people. Conversely, the population of Beijing, China was approaching 1,000,000 people. Quite a stark contrast, don't you think?

We're talking about a game series that features the most populated cities in the world: Acre, Damascus, Jerusalem, Constantinople, Rome... even the largest towns in the colonies during this time could be considered shantytowns compared to that.

Something that hasn't been touched on yet (and IMO the only *real* reason to choose the colonies) is religion. Obviously the colonies have a long religious history, centered around churches and witch hunts and ""moral justification of the resistance of tyranny.""

1. With the exception of some traditional old world European cheeses the vast majority of cheese made in the US and UK use GMO rennet, [around 90%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet#Genetically_engineered_rennet), literally cow genes inserted into bacteria.     

2.  We don't live in a perfect world.  Do your best as a vegetarian, be informed, but no one, not a single person, is 100% vegetarian or vegan.  You can nitpick the veg philosophy to death, to the point it's impossible in practice, or you can do your best and realize that in the end, practicality rules.    

3.  Rennet is such an incredibly small part of cheese making, you're missing the forest for the trees.  The real concern is the milk production itself.  If you are a lacto vegi like many of us you're supporting the veal industry plain and simple.  If the moral qualms of that concern you more than your love of cheese, consider veganism.    


4.

If you look at my last big trip (ten weeks), about half of that was spent staying with people I had met off OkCupid.  Some of those were people I had just met that year, most were people I had met in previous years.  A lot of the time when I wasn't staying with someone from OKC, I had someone I'd met from OKC showing me around.  The same has happened in both Europe and Australia.

The reason this works so well is because if someone has a 99% match rating, it's almost guaranteed that we're going to get along well.  Plus, it's very clear that I'm not (just) looking for sex.  Interesting people are awesome, and tremendous amounts of fun to hang out with, even if you're not sleeping together.  In fact, it's pretty much [one of my own rules](http://not-a-jerk.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/sex-on-road.html) that if I'm staying at someone's house—and we're not already romantically involved—then I'm not going to need to see a lot of interest from them before initiating anything.  The potential for things to be weird and awkward is just too much, otherwise.

Besides couchsurfing, I've made a *ton* of friends through OKC.  A decent chunk of my social circle in my hometown—and almost my entire social circles in other towns—can be traced back to OKC.

Of course, using OKC for sexy times works as well.  Half my sexual partners ever have been directly due to OKC, and I'm doing pretty well for my [age and smart-phone type](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/dont-be-ugly-by-accident/).

First off, the only way that the US was different culturally from the Brits was that they also had Irish, Germans, Dutch, French there. But they still were culturally very similar to the British. In fact, many of the colonists were insulted when the British brought the Hessian mercenaries because they believed it was a dispute among Englishmen, which then prompted them to get mercenaries from Brunswick.

Secondly, why do you keep saying things like it was special. The ideas of the Enlightenment *was* present at the time of the founding, but it is not the only country to adapt them. Frederick the Great (Frederick II of house Hohenzollern, king of Prussia and Electorate of Brandenbug) was a noted philosopher on the Enlightenment and instilled many of the ideas of the Enlightenment into the government of Prussia. For instance Frederick Hohenzollern II established Freedom of the Press, Universal Religious tolerance, and set up numerous protections from the law. Or for instance San Marino has been a republic with a constitution since 1600. The Venetian Republic was a republic for like since 697. The Republic of Genoa was established in 1005. The Swiss were a federation of states since 1370.  The Russian ""Republic of Novgorod"" was founded in 1136. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had numerous laws protecting the rights of its citizens, and it was clearly established that the King did not reign over the people, and they went so far that the King was elected by an assembly of nobles. The szlachta in Poland-Lithuania had rights, which was 15% of the population, but the US on founding only gave rights to the land owning, white males, which amounted to 25% of the population. In England there was the Magna Carta which protected rights of the citizen. Comparing the United States to elective monarchies, or republics at the time, they were roughly equal to the voting rights given to citizens. This is also ignoring the classical republic of Rome and democracy in Athens. The United States was if anything not special, it was just founded on an already present tradition of rights of the individual, ideas of government, voting rights, and protections of the people that was already present in Europe, and had been for hundreds of years.",t3_qca1r,nerga,,0,False,

I love my student pub. 50+ beers and you'll always get the glass you ask for. At another student pub I became ""friend"" with a bartender by discussing sour ales. While others were served plastic pint glasses, I got the the biggest snifter I've ever seen. The bartender also told me how well stocked they were on every beer (and suggested a few). I drank the penultimate Imperial Yeti. That is awesome.

Outside of my university, it really seems like a lot of knowledge is dropped. Except for places that kinda specialize in beer. Fine restaurants might (should?) be good at beers and glasses, but since I'm a student I haven't found a good reason to visit any of them.

Anyway, as a Swede I'm quite jelly at the 'merkins. The US ought to have the best variety at beers (of excellent quality), there's so many breweries. Belgian abbey/trappist beers is probably the only type of beer which is, beyond argument, better in Europe.

I probably should incorporate an answer that actually answers your post too: 

In my opinion anything above like 7% should be presented in a glass similar to the glass than what was intended. ""Above 7%"" there is a lot of alcohol (and if properly brewed) a lot of taste/smell. Having the right glass emphasizes the smells, and thus the tastes. 

Alltough everything below 7% doesn't need a proper glass. My experience is that as alcohol content increases, focusing the intended smells becomes more important. Which is done through glasses.

I'll just focus on german National Socialism, there are other parties in other countries I'm not that sure about.

First things first: The idea of ""National Socialism"" that came up in the 1920s was more of a buzz phrase than a consistent ideology. Just look at the name: Nationalism was widely popular among the conservatives, socialism among the workers (and the unemployed, for that matter). Take both words, mix them together, you get an idea that has the potential to overcome the young democracy most people didn't really like.

But I'll be focussing on the idea of National Socialism (I'll call it NS from now on) that took over after 1933. The most important factor of NS is the so called ""Volksgemeinschaft"". My dictionary tells me to call it ""National community"" or ""Folk community"" in english, but that's not exactly what it means - so I'll call it Volksgemeinschaft. Volksgemeinschaft means a nation consisting of all those who have ""german blood"" in the definition of the Nazis, which means that no jew (and no enemy of the system) can be member of the german state. 

To understand the power of that idea it's important to look at the state of the nation in the 1920s: Germany lost a prestigious war, had to get rid of its proud army, had to pay war reparations and most people had the feeling that they were oppressed by the enemies of WWI. Germany had been a proud nation for a long time and basically got abased. And this was even before the worldwide economic crisis. 
So we have a climate of dissatisfaction with the modern germany of the 1920s. And whereever someone is dissatisfied, they need scapegoats. National socialism took the oldest scapegoat of world history, the jews and added a strong nationalism which defined itself not only through the country one lives in, but the blood, the heritage and the will to give all your power to the Volksgemeinschaft. This was extremely attractive.

One has to keep in mind that the NSDAP was a relatively young party, not just in terms of the age of the party but the age of the leading figures. In 1933, Hitler was 44, Goebbels was 36, Heß was 39. This is not the ""Cranky Xenophobic Grandfather party"" as you called it, this is a party that defines itself through being young, because the old folks failed in the NS opinion - they lost a war, they signed a humiliating peace treaty, they established democracy. The NS needed a new, young movement to get to a new, young German Reich. The NS programs state this extremely clear. But there is one possibility for old people to become young: Admit to National Socialism.

To sum things up: Older people would vote for the NSDAP because of Nationalism, workers would vote because of socialism (and the perspective of getting a job), young people would vote for the NSDAP because they were called not the future of germany but the present - they got offered the opportunity to gain control even in younger ages. And a whole lot of people voted for the NSDAP because antisemitism was vastly popular. 

Last thing: There is no nugget whatsoever of NS worth saving. It's an ideology that bases all of its primary success on the exclusion of minorities, on violence against people with a different opinion and on the (most often than not violent) expansion of the Volksgemeinschaft. It's important to know that the Third Reich couldn't have existed in the form of 1933-39 without the war in eastern europe coming.

So Graphics, Gameplay, Sound, Control and Multiplayer (when present) and rather than judging it in terms of success and failure, it should be a bit more biased. Tell us who might like it and what to expect, with your highs and lows as a wrap up.

For example :
Darksiders

1. Graphics - A smooth graphics engine renders beautiful comic book inspired designs with a biblical context. You play as War going up against the hordes of heaven and hell. 

2. Gameplay - Some say Darksiders is a Zelda clone, but it isn't. It's a DAMN FINE Zelda clone. The story is well told and well paced. Very little frustration in the puzzles and the enemies can be challenging without being overwhelming. Satisfying ending without using any cop-outs like leaving it open for a sequel. 

3. Sound - Excellent voice acting, moody music and all the right ambient noises. Darksiders is an great example of sound done right. Using the Zelda comparison, your version of ""Navi"" is a demon voiced by Mark ""Luke Skywalker"" Hamil.

4. Control - While a mouse and keyboard will serve you well, the game plays best with a controller. The menu UI isn't hard to navigate on your PC but it'll feel more natural on your console.

5. Multiplayer - No multiplayer exists for Darksiders.

Highs - A high amount of polish over the entire game, Darksiders is just plain fun. You will get a lot of game for your money.

Lows - Combat can get a bit repetitive, especially against ""puzzle"" bosses. The sections where you control Ruin do not control as smoothly as those where you control War. 

--------

Now this is just off the top of my head. Your system is good, but utilize your plus / checkmark / minus system as a way of pointing out what the developers did particularly well, what they succeeded with and what could have been better. Stick with a positive tone and when you have a criticism provide examples of games that did it right. Not only will this give your audience a better idea of what to expect (which is critical as your review would be used for that very purpose) and if a dev happens to read your review it's much better than ""ZOMG CONSOLIFICATION GARBAGE LEAVE THIS GAME KTHANKSBAI"". 

**Protip** : Also provide players information about where the game can be purchased, if there is any DRM (and how it works, limited activations or needing an online connection, that sort of thing) and DLC. Do not comment on if you like it or not. We know what these things are, and it will make you seem a lot less baised if you're simply informing people. If it's a PC game, maybe provide links to GameFly, Steam, Desura, GreenMan Games, Origin, and other sites for convenience and include at least one store each for North America, Europe and Australia.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

The US Federalists made good points. And they had good reason to confederate and centralise power. But the anti-Federalists were right as well: beware the encroachment of government in your lives.

That's the thing about US gov't and the bizarre relationship Americans have with theirs. Their distrust of gov't isn't unfounded. Federalism in the US is a mess. Take my mom, for an example. She's an American, born in the 30's. She remembers the New Deal quite well and like many of her generation, were wary of social security.

Now social insurance isn't the problem. The problem is that it was meant to be paid for and used by certain people for a certain purpose. Now, it's grown to encompass other things - supplemental income, disability. Not just retirement. It's expensive and it's broke. Why? Because like any unaccountable federal construct, it grew beyond it's scope. The Federalist left/Democrats had a good idea, but the anti-Federalist libertarians were right yet again: things grow and because they're federal, you can't stop them.

Alternate scenario: I live in Quebec. We run our own healthcare, just like every other province. Ottawa does not. We have our own pension plan, the rest of Canada has a different one. And of course we have social insurance.

Do you see the difference? We may have a federal mandate for certain things, or a federal law establishing rights or responsibilities, but the Federal gov't doesn't run these things. In the US, the pension programme is broken because it grew to encompass other things. That is the inherent flaw of federalism. 

You see it here in Canada. We're getting a boondoggle of F-35 jets. The Americans are selling civil rights wholesale for border protection. Americans are not stupid. Canadians aren't stupid. We're no different than Europeans in that regard. Where we're different is that we're saddled by onerous federal gov't that cannot help itself. The big debate in Canada is spending money on federal prisons we don't need. Even the Americans tell us we're wrong. They know!

Taxes from overseas provinces is also capped, which dampens their profit a bit also. They both probably have a high trade efficiency also, so how much they take from trading is going to be higher. But your upkeep will be a bit higher than someone like France only expanding in the old world and connecting everything. So all 3 of them are immensely wealthy, but France didn't have any investments to make like sending colonists. France probably has a monopoly on 5 Center's of Trade in Europe, and couple that with their super high production efficiency and trade efficiency, and their taxes they are going to be rich, they also don't have to spend the upkeep to keep all of those ships up and running, so that is a lot less they have to mint.

Once you have multi-ethnic nations like America, it became harder to be ethnically prejudiced because the european ethnicities were mixing so frequently, and you no longer had a cohesive ethnic background to determine ""otherness"", so they also adopted a far more simpler system for prejudice, skin color.  

Why be prejudiced at all?  Because the world has scarce resources, and you need a way to determine which group will be ""ok"" to you and which group will be ""others"" that you bash/subjugate.  Easiest way in an ethnically devolved society is to use race.  Easiest way in a single ""racial"" nation is to use ethnicity.

Oh, and I'm not sure I agree with all cultures having a concept of dragons. I think that we use the same English word to describe them, collectively, is simply because we need a word to describe them. I can't say much for the other types, but the Chinese concept of a dragon is completely different from the European.

The exact same effects that had made it necessary for Ireland and other countries to bail out the banks would have made yet more bank bailouts necessary in the rest of Europe, had Ireland and/or its banks defaulted, and this would have caused other countries to get into the same kind of trouble Ireland got into. Note how Spain and Italy are on the brink even without this additional shock. The whole contagion and credit default swap thing has been explained over and over again by now, so I won't go there.

The point is, letting the Irish banks and/or the Irish government go bankrupt would almost certainly have spread the exact same problem throughout Europe, and this would have affected pretty much everybody. No banks, no credit, no investments into growing businesses, no new jobs. That's not even the whole problem, even perfectly healthy companies have to refinance debt all the time, and if there is no credit then they go bankrupt because they can't pay back the loans that come due, which means that jobs are being lost. So it would have had effects far beyond the financial sector, and there is no entity that is large enough to bail out all of Europe.  
Yes, those affected include PRIVATE investors from France and Germany, or at least those of them who had invested in bonds etc. instead of ~~betting on~~ insuring themselves against ""credit events"" with the likes of CDS'. But to say that PRIVATE investors (which, btw., includes retirement funds and so on) were the primary reason why this was done, and ones from specific countries at that (surprise: most investors live in the countries with the largest populations), is like saying the fire department only put out a house fire to save the cat.",t3_q9wq0,CountVonTroll,,0,False,

""On the eve of the United States’ entry into the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (“ACTA”), there is considerable confusion as to just what legal effect the agreement will have. In written answers to
Senator Ron Wyden, the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) went to lengths to describe ACTA as non-binding, asserting that “ACTA does not constrain Congress’ authority to change U.S. law,” and that it would operate only as an “Executive Agreement” that “can be implemented without new legislation.” But
European negotiators have described the agreement to their legislature in very different terms, asserting that ACTA is “a binding international agreement on all its parties, as defined and subject to
the rules of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969).”

I started coming here because my students told me about, and chose the user name with them in mind, not under any desire to ""flout credentials"". I was unfamiliar with reddit at the time, and if I were to choose a username now, I would choose something different. One thing I have always enjoyed is trading ideas with a large variety of people. It's why I love teaching. I learn as much from my students as they learn from me. I'm sorry you find it offensive that professors mix with others here. We're people with ideas too, and enjoy the give and take on reddit. I have learned a tremendous amount here. I don't come here for ""floating around and willing to bless the ignorant masses with the way the truth and the light of hard descriptivism"", and I don't think anyone else does. 

&gt;Firstly, many countries have formal bodies that set standards for their national languages, such as the Académie Française.

Those aren't linguists. 

&gt;Secondly, while language change and dialect diversity are 'naturally occurring' so are prestige differences between dialects and efforts to enforce standards. There is some wilful ignorance on the part of hard descriptivists who choose to focus on the naturalness of diversity, meanwhile ignoring the equally natural reaction to it.

You are referring to having a standard written language, which does indeed facilitate communication, and is something that, as writers, we all appreciate the need for. However, spoken language (which is what linguists talk about, for the most part) cannot be changed by pronouncements from above, and no spoken language or language variety is inherently better than any other. I know linguists who have worked with language communities to develop a standardized written language. Linguists do not ignore this phenomenon. Linguists just consider it an entirely separate issue.

&gt;Thirdly, while some linguists may wish to study languages without making value judgments, that does not impart them with the duty to patrol the internet for dissenters who dare to make value judgements on everyday language use.

Are you saying that because of our knowledge and experience, we should abstain ourselves from discussions? If you, in your areas of expertise, find someone saying something which you know to be incorrect, would you refrain from pointing this out?

&gt;So there you have it. Those are my some of my objections to American liberal hard descriptivism. 

Why do you think descriptivism is American? Most work in typology and language description is being done in Europe and Australia (while American linguists tend more to theory).

&gt;At the very least I hope you have realised the apparently universal approach of your immediate peers isn't as universal as you thought.

You're right. I now realize there is one dissenter.

I carry an [altoids first aid kit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11-Pwp_bWqg) in the hope that it will be (more) useful (than nothing) in an emergency, as well as having an E01 and Vic Classic on my keys, and a swisscard in my wallet. Other than that I don't really EDC. I used to EDC a vic huntsman on my belt, but it needs oiling so it's languishing in a drawer at the moment.

I find that EDC is more about helping in hundreds of little situations you just don't notice, like putting a hole in a belt, cutting a label off, opening a package, than the big things.

Of course when a big thing comes up and you can help, you feel validated, like all that pocketspace wasn't wasted after all.

Anyway, probably the closest I've come to anything heroic was the time we were on holiday with my wife's family, and her (70 year old) dad fell down the stairs in our apartment at night, while carrying a mug of water. The mug smashed, gashing his arm about 16 inches from his wrist to his elbow. We were in bed at the time and just heard this huge crash. I thought a window had smashed and knocked something onto the floor. Wifey jumped out of bed, ran out of the room to check, ran back in pale-faced and screaming at me to get out of bed and bring the sheet. Naked, I quickly pulled on my jeans and ran out.

The bottom of the stairs was covered in blood, about an area of 5 feet square. Her father was lying at the bottom in a daze with blood all up his arm.

I really can't remember the details of what exactly happened and when,  but I'd done first aid training as a kid, so I kept my head and just naturally took control of the situation. After briefly assessing for injuries, breakages, etc, we got him sitting up with a sheet wrapped around his arm (the cigarette-packet sized FAK in the house contained 3 plasters, nothing else. f**king useless holiday company).

Anyway the point of the story was supposed to be that it wasn't the kit I had - I had none - it was the training and knowledge that I carry with me every day. While everyone else was running around holding their foreheads, shaking and looking dumbfounded, I was telling people what to do, remembering that the European emergency phone number is 112, assigning someone to call the ambalamps, someone to apply pressure, someone to arrange a bag with passports, medical cards and so on.

Generally when you're in Egypt, sellers and beggars will flock to you trying to sell you their wares. After the revolution it has became worse. A couple of months back I took a couple of foreign business partners to the pyramids and I cannot stress the fact that the sellers were around us like vultures and were very desperate for whatever they wanted to give off. 

You will want to steer clear of Tahrir square as this is where most of the commotion happens. Unfortunately the Ancient Egyptian Museum itself is there. If you're visiting the museum, its probably best to head there with a tour group. 

When visiting the pyramids, the price of admission for a foreigner is about 60-70 pounds (between 10 and 12 US dollars). They'll ask if you'd like to go inside the Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) for an extra price (I think its paid at the entrance of the pyramid itself) . Its not really necessary as there isn't much to see and its dark, cramped and you'll be bending over.. a similar experience to it is right next is a room that shows the mummification process which I think is included with the ticket. 

Another site worthy of seeing in Cairo is the Khan el Khalili Bazaar situated in old Cairo. Given how the tourist situation is going right now, you could try to have an advantage. The whole point of the bazaar is knowing if you could haggle down prices in various trinkets, ornaments, spices, perfumes clothes and other wares. If you think the sellers in the pyramids were like vultures, then the sellers in Khan el Khalili are aggressive. So you may or may not have an advantage in that. Another bit to see in old Cairo is the Citadel that was built by Saladin and was completed upon by Muhammed Ali (not the boxer, he was the ruler of Egypt and Sudan during the 1800's when he seceded from the Ottoman Empire). The Citadel gives an awesome view of most of Cairo. 

Moving on other areas you could visit in Egypt for Ancient Egyptian stuff are Luxor and Aswan which are down south. Various temples are there such as the Luxor temple and the more famous Abu Simbel temple. Be advised though, summer temperatures down south are well over 50 degrees (more than 122 farenheit). This is a temperature that not even a local such as myself could even stand. I've even heard stories of rubber wheels on luggage melting from the heat. Sunstrokes are pretty common with tourists so definitely always carry a cool bottle of water with you. I'd advise against going there given the weather but its upto you.

After checking out the various monuments and temples, a great way to relax is to visit the resort towns in the red sea and Sinai. Specifically Hurghada, Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab and Nuweiba. lots of sandy beaches, plenty of water activities to do there as well. Most of the people that visit there are tourists namely the Russian/Eastern European, English and German tourists. I'm hearing its pretty empty over there so again be weary of aggressive sellers. 

Now that I've shown you all thats pretty awesome about Egypt, there are a few things to be wary about.  

First off, again is the weather. During the summer season, temperature is usually over 35 and sometimes 40 degrees (104 farenheit) as the norm. Sometimes it would spike to 50 and 55. Egypt is the most hottest in July. So definitely carry some water with you. 

Second, the presidential elections are coming up. They should begin on the 24th of May and end on June 16th. I'm definitely expecting there would be a lot of commotion as well protests and I'm actually not surprised if something were to happen. So take heed and steer clear of tahrir square. 

Third, the holy month of Ramadan is coming up. It should start on the 20th of July and end on the 20th of August. It is even more of a dry spell when it comes to tourism in general. Basically people do not eat or drink from sunrise till sunset. Most restaurants and shops will be closed then and if you would dine out at the time you sometimes need a reservation. Most 5 star restaurants that serve drinks won't be able to (hotels however are more lenient and are able to serve you it). In the United Arab Emirates and its other gulf countries, its actually forbidden by law for anyone to eat or drink before sunset. I've never heard of that happening in Egypt but you should take care not to drink or eat in front of people to avoid any trouble. You (and especially your fiancee) should also dress modestly so as to not attract attention. 

Finally and this one pains me the most but the state media has been constantly fear mongering the locals when it comes to the protests or events with acts of violence. The government has been vague saying that foreign forces are attempting to sabotage Egypt from within. This in effect has created xenophobia and distrust with Egyptians whenever they see foreigners in the streets. Usually they would look at foreigners with weariness and caution. While you will not experience such a thing in popular areas such as the pyramids or the resort towns in Sinai, it would most probably happen when interacting with locals in the street.  Another thing to note is that petty crime is steadily increasing which was something unheard of in Egypt prior to the revolution. So take care in that regard. 

Finally, if you need other points of views, head on over to [r/egypt](http://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/). Hope this helps. =)

However, after the first trimester when the risk of miscarriage is significantly decreased, I did quit for the rest of my pregnancy.

It's really one of those things I'm not sure if they can do an actual study on, kind of like alcohol. There are birth defects linked to smoking, just as there are birth defects linked to alcohol consumption. But they can't do a study on it, because if they do, they're putting the fetus in danger. If you go to Europe, it's not uncommon to see a pregnant woman enjoying a glass or two of wine. Those babies can come out with no defects. 

But really, it's hard to get an unbiased study on something like this. Because people tend to lie. There was a woman who used to live in the apartment above us, she would say she was an occasional drinker, the problem is, that occasion was daily. She said she wouldn't drink more than a beer or two a day when pregnant, the thing is, that beer was a 40oz bottle.

The same can go for smoking. Someone can say they only have one or two a day, and instead of meaning one or two cigarettes, they're vague about their answer and really mean one or two packs a day. There are plenty of women who have had perfectly normal pregnancies while smoking cigarettes (or even drinking alcohol), but that doesn't mean it's safe. It's all about the risks. Are you willing to put your child at risk before they're born? Or would you rather play it safe?

For the record, my mom smoked with me and my brothers when she was pregnant with us. We all turned out pretty healthy. Same thing with my husband and his siblings. My mother-in-law smoked during every pregnancy, no birth defects for any of my in-law siblings.

He was able to collect rain, and was basically surrounded by a school of fish that weren't terribly hard to catch with what he had available in his raft/craft. He stated after a few weeks of eating nothing but the fish, he began to start thinking about eating the eyeballs and not the flesh. It turned into a craving and he eventually gave in. For a time, he couldn't get enough of them. It was postulated that this was a response to a deficiency, along hte lines of his body telling him ""Hey, I'm not getting everything I need, that's edible, and you aren't giving it to me."" I can't recall of the top of my head and have been thusfar unable to locate a transcript of the show, but there was an actualy dietary need found in the eyes that was not available in the fish flesh.

The point here is to make it illegal for financial institutes within the well regulated zone to hold potentially toxic financial assets from the unregulated zone. I.E. we won't allow companies to export their bad debt in a way that means they are still dependent on it but the EU won't benefit from it.

It really does not matter if they split the company in two provided that the assets that regulated institutes depend upon is sound.

Companies in the EU won't have trouble raising funds. You have the balance of power backwards. We control the market. They need our accent to operate in it. They want to operate in it and if they don't then someone else will. If we allow them to operate in it without upholding our regulations then they'll happily do so. That is why you make it so they can't do so.

The BRICs are irrelevant. For the most part they don't have a service industry that can benefit from financial services. They could only benefit if companies were allowed to move there for tax purposes while trading in the service economies. Something we're going to explicitly disallow. They can move there and not have access to the market that will actually make money.

The only reason it would be difficult is it runs against the international global economic consensus of the past 10 years. In reality it is impossible to have safe banking and a global market unless everyone agrees on sound regulation. If we get bad actors then the only sensible thing to do is exclude them rather than taking part in a race to the bottom.

Given a choice between the EU and the BRICs the US will always choose the EU as a trading partner but the EU has to be prepared to use that leverage to get what it wants. It isn't as if the BRICs are going to refuse to sell us the cheap crap that they are renown for.

*exactly*

Look, I'm not saying that everyone who is poor in the US is poor because they choose to be. That is obviously not the case. I am saying that most (as in, at least 50% + 1) are poor as a direct result of decisions they made in their past.

Now, we can go into analyzing why each individual made the decisions they did, and whether or not they had the tools at their disposal to make the right decision in the first place, but that's immaterial to my comment.

I'm not taking the position that everyone who is poor ""deserves"" to be. I'm stating my own analysis, based on having lived in the South my entire life.

&gt; thinking that all someone has to do to get out of poverty is ""grab the bootstraps"" is a fallacy

It's not that easy to get out of any bad situation. Again, I'm saying that the reason most of the poor in America are poor is because they are living the consequences of their own decisions, not that they aren't trying hard enough.

&gt; it allows the thinker to place blame on the poor person

Completely irrelevant. My point above is that most Americans (of which I am one) see a person's situation as that person's responsibility. From the perspective of other cultures, this is seen as society's responsibility. Notably, most Western Europeans see the issue through this lens.

This is reflected in the governmental structures of nations, as well. Many European countries are social democracies, where much is provided by the state. A minimum standard of living is sought, at the expense of the productive - this burden is simply seen as the cost of a civil society.

Until the 1930s, the US federal government was pretty much the polar opposite of this. After the Great Depression, there was a cultural shift towards collectivism in the US, which really began to be codified in government with the New Deal. This trend has continued tot he present day, though to European sensibilities we are shockingly individualist to this day. 

Today, it appears that there is at least a strong movement back towards a purer individualist society. There are calls from the right to repeal many of the social spending programs at the federal level, including phasing out things like Social Security and Medicare. I believe we're seeing the pendulum slow to a stop and swing back away from social spending and taxation, though that may indeed be an artifact of my own political position and personal optimism.

&gt; and delude themselves that such a thing would never happen to them.

Of course not. People do not have perfect information when making a decision, nor do we have the ability to understand all potential consequences of our actions. Life is a series of risks, and some of those risks have serious potential negative consequences. I could lose my job for reasons outside of my control tomorrow, and my business could fail next week.

&gt; Also, if Ireland had defaulted on its bank debt, would that not simply have the donor countries to put the same money into bank recapitalisation instead of EFSF loans to Ireland? Less in fact, because we're also borrowing to close a general deficit that arose from the collapse of tax revenues/climb in social spending.

That would have been extremely dangerous, and almost certainly much more expensive. First of all, there are other countries on the brink. If we had let Ireland default, markets would have had to assume that this was how Europe now operates, that we wouldn't even *try* to prevent defaults, and that there was no reason to assume that the EU would step in and help out if any other countries get into trouble. Interest rates would have gone up, which by itself has the potential to make otherwise elevated but still manageable debt levels of some countries unsustainable. What would make it even worse is that this would have come at a time when they would have had to bail out their financial sector and economies due to the fallout from Ireland, because:  
Without a solvent Irish government to back them up, large Irish banks would have defaulted. Other banks would have to assume that yet other banks they do business with would be next, and stop lending each other money. Corporations as well as countries roll over their debt all the time, it's not like they have a credit window on their account. They take out a loan for a given time (e.g., by selling bonds), and get a new one when it comes due. But if there's no credit, because banks stop lending each other or even have defaulted themselves, they can't refinance their debt in time or at an affordable cost, and therefore can't make the payment. Now, their creditor might have relied on that payment itself, and the cycle begins anew. This means that otherwise perfectly healthy companies would default.

Yet another factor are credit default swaps. Those are basically like an insurance against a ""credit event"". That is, you can insure yourself against Ireland defaulting on its debt, so if Ireland can't pay for the bond when it matures, you get the insurance money instead. Of course this makes a lot of sense, and it's entirely legitimate. Only, you don't actually have to own Irish bonds yourself to insure yourself against a default. You may be exposed to that risk indirectly. Maybe you own a lot of stock of a bank that is heavily invested in Irish bonds, or simply fear you might lose your job if the Irish economy would tank as a result. Or, possibly, you've insured somebody else against an Irish default, and now it seems more likely than it was before, so you shell out for a couple of CDS' yourself in case you'll have to pay out yourself.   
Credit default swaps are unregulated, so nobody even knows how many are out there, but estimates are that they'd make up for the outstanding debt several times over. It's a bit as if people in your village could sell each other insurances against your house burning down. Now some will want to burn it, while others will do all they can to prevent it, and yet others that had previously sold insurances are beginning to insure themselves and hope that those they bought it from will be able to cover what they have to pay if it comes to that. And yes, that's insane, and it needs to be addressed.

&gt; Those are all fair points, but I read the emphasis on 'private investors' as referring to the issue of moral hazard. If investment in sovereigns and banks always gets paid back, it's an incentive to disregard inherent risks in those investments.

Moral hazard exists whether we're talking about private entities or public ones. That's why Merkel insists on the fiscal compact. Without it, it will be politically impossible for Germany, the Netherlands, Finland etc. to accept any solutions that might result in future bailouts or transfer payments, like Eurobonds or even a fiscal union. Why enact unpopular laws, tax increases or budget cuts if the other countries have no way to enforce debt limits and, if push comes to shove, have no choice but to bail you out?  
Of course, the fiscal compact will be no guarantee against possible bailouts becoming necessary, and Ireland is actually a good example for that, but the Greek bailout could have probably been prevented, we wouldn't have to worry about Italy (!), Spain would have to pay less interest without the looming risk in Portugal, and there would be more financial and political capital for bailouts -- I believe this thread is the first time I've ever seen the Irish bailout being questioned in any way, whereas others are, shall we say, politically more difficult.

Anyway, you're right about the ""privatize profits, socialize losses"" thing being a problem that needs to be worked on. Somehow. However, keep in mind the effect I mentioned above, about increasing interest rates letting otherwise sustainable debt levels spin out of control if markets have to assume that the Eurozone would simply ""let"" members default without even trying to step in.  
There's even more, in terms of counterproductive incentives. Take the housing bubble. It was a gravy train as long as prices went up. Now imagine you're an investment banker. How do you think are the odds, in a given year/quarter, than the trend will reverse? Five percent? Ten? Sure, the consequences would be enormous. But for you, personally, it means a giant bonus if it goes well, and you still wouldn't have to live like a peasant if, god forbid, you'd have to make do with your base salary. How does this translate to the credit default swaps I've talked about above? If you sell a lot of CDS' and insure clients against a possible but unlikely default, and those never have to pay out, you get a giant bonus. If not, well, base salary, in the worst case you lose your job. But maybe you've even insured yourself against that.",t3_q9wq0,CountVonTroll,,0,False,

Laffer and the 50p rate :

http://www.answers.com/topic/smoot-hawley-tariff

&gt;At a party in the late 1970s—or so the story goes—economist Arthur Laffer used a cocktail napkin to sketch an upside-down U that became the basis for an entire movement in economic policy. The Laffer Curve, as the U came to be known, represented the theory that as taxes went down, government revenue would actually go up, as lower taxes would stimulate the economy and provide more receipts. Laffer's theory was adopted as part of Ronald Reagan's platform in his 1980 presidential campaign, and after he became president, Reagan pushed through the largest package of tax cuts in history. Counter to his expectations, the deficit mushroomed, and Laffer's theory was discredited. While most scholars agreed that a budget deficit would grow by slightly less than the full amount of a tax cut, because some economic growth would result, credible economists from across the political spectrum agreed that the net effect would be negative. During the 1980 presidential primaries, Reagan's opponent George H. W. Bush had ridiculed his theories as ""voodoo economics."" Twenty years later, Bush's son, President George W. Bush, promoted another package of enormous tax cuts, arguing that they would stimulate the economy, government receipts would increase, and the budget gap would be closed. Bush's detractors, who viewed the maneuver as blatant pandering to wealthy constituents, called it voodoo economics all over again.

http://leap-lrc.blogspot.com/2012/02/having-laffer.html

&gt;However, the Laffer Curve is not a tool solely of the right. Toby Young - a man whose knowledge and arrogance seem to have an inverse relationship - obviously hasn't read much about the Laffer Curve. If he had he might not be advocating a 70% taxation rate. That according to Mathias Trabandt &amp; Harald Uhlig in 'How far are we from the slippery slope: The Laffer Curve revisited' is the income tax rate after which revenues start declining.

and

&gt;So, if we could effectively cap salaries at £300,000 (and therefore also reduce the ridiculous pension pots to the super-rich) that money could then be spent more productively - on research and development, or improving the wages or working conditions of general employees. Then the right would cry that British business could not compete. But the German Commerzbank caps its top pay at 500,000 euros or £416,000 - about one-third of what Stephen Hester will receive as his basic salary, even without his now defunct bonus.

http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2011/09/07/should-the-50p-tax-rate-be-abolished/

&gt;It’s also true that while the UK undoubtedly needs tax cuts to stimulate the economy, a cut in the 50% tax rate is probably the least likely to do this. Cutting it will boost savings, of which we already have a glut, or house prices in the south-east, which are already too high. There’s little or no chance it will stimulate spending.

&gt;Nor will it boost entrepreneurship, which is about people taking risks and creating companies. Most people earning £150,000 a year do neither. They speculate for banks and pension funds using other people’s money (where, let it be noted, most have been so successful that their average rate of return in the last decade has been about zero at best) or they rise through the ranks of multinational corporations, enjoying secure employment and large pensions until appointed to positions where they can distort pay and rewards in their own favour. As a result their main contribution to society is, in fact, to increase the income and wealth gaps, which we know produces worse outcomes for all.

&gt;So that’s not entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship which leads to growth, new business and new jobs is done in small companies by people who often work for long periods for nothing (and so pay little or no tax). Their income is usually sheltered in companies – and those companies only pay tax at about 20%. The 50% tax rate is no disincentive to real entrepreneurship.

http://taxjustice.blogspot.com/2012/02/itep-debunks-loopy-laffer-again.html

&gt;So how, exactly, did Laffer get it wrong? It's very simple, really. Laffer's findings were caused by population growth in the high-growth states, not by economic growth stimulated by tax cuts (and incidentally, that population growth had nothing to do with tax cuts either). And that's it, really. There are a few other factors, too: some of the states, for instance, were able to afford tax cuts because they had large natural resource windfalls.

&gt;And oh dear, there really is a big error in the claim made: to suggest that talent and remuneration is correlated is, shall we say, just a little bit of an error? There are extraordinarily talented people in this country making a lot less than £150,000 a year.

&gt;Second, this shatters the myth that voluntary codes with people like banks work.

&gt;Third, this also shatters the CBI’s claim that only the most egregious tax abuse schemes need be covered by a general anti-avoidance principle. The scope needs to be far wider.

&gt;Fourth, it supports my long held view that the tax gap is created by this type of activity and not a few R&amp;D and capital allowance claims as the CBI and the right wing like to claim.",t3_qcpf4,Noodlehands,,0,True,

That wasn't the case until 2004.  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act is not something with judicial legacy or built on precedent, and it is not something that is universally uncontested.  

That being said, the personage is not the issue at hand, neither is the morality.  The issue is that Paul believes in personal freedom so long as that freedom doesn't extend to women's rights over their own bodies. 

Paul says that while he's morally and medically opposed to recreational drug use, personal freedom means he doesn't believe that the government should be allowed to intrude in that sphere.  But somehow, it's acceptable to allow the government control over women's bodies?  It's bullshit.  

Obama is against abortion on a personal moral level.  But he doesn't believe there is a secular justification that warrants that intrusion.  So what does he do?  What he can to reduce the number of abortions.  That means diminishing unwanted pregnancy through increasing the availability of contraception, and increasing social support so that women feel like a child isn't an undue burden. 

Ron Paul, on the other hand, thinks that churches should be free to nix coverage of anything they don't want to pay for on moral grounds.  So, more unwanted pregnancies...  He also wants to eliminate social welfare programs, worsening the burden of childrearing.  So, more pregnancies are unwanted...  

And if abortion was made illegal again, women would die seeking abortions illegally.... But, you know, it's cool because Ron thinks we should have the freedom to use drugs recreationally?

He's an isolationist.  He calls it ""non-interventionism"" like he's from the fucking starship Enterprise bravely maintaining the prime directive, but it's just a euphemism.  He's against foreign aid, the UN, NATO, and intervening.  The guy [openly said that if the US hadn't been attacked, we should have stayed out of WWII, even knowing the holocaust was happening!](http://winteryknight.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/ron-pauls-isolationist-foreign-policy-views-echo-neville-chamberlain/)  Like, fuck it, let great britain and all of europe fall, I mean, we're good over here, right?  He's foreign policy is infantile at best.  

I see you didn't address the gold standard, or any other of RP's economic delusions.  

&gt;P.S. Why are you voting for Obama at all if he enjoys war as much as George W Bush?

couple points:
1)  The president is commander in chief, head of the military.  Obama inherited this war, and I doubt the guy would have started it.  I don't blame him for attempting to do a better job and not immediately retreating to let the region implode.  That would be disastrous in terms of international politics.  

2)  Obama isn't handing out no-bid contracts to his buddies.  Biden is not Cheney.   This isn't some roundabout way of lining the pockets of everyone who contributed to his campaign.  

3)He's better at it.   Yeah, I said it.  Out interventions in Pakistan and Libya were prime examples of how to correctly use special forces, it was goddamn brilliant.  He did what bush couldn't, and it didn't take killing a million peasants along the way.  

4) He's managed to use diplomacy to prevent more clusterfucks from happening.  Like North Korea, yesterday.  But RP wouldn't have done that, because a massive food aid to bribe them out of nuclear production and into arms inspection would have been interventionist.  

I don't think obama is the greatest politician in the world, but he's definitely expansively better than anything the republicans have, including Ron.  Ron has an exceptionally juvenile, short-sighted view of politics and policy, but his commitment to that is somehow ennobling enough to merit consideration?

that's my opinion at least.

Not to go all Jimmy-the-Greek (nfl sportscaster who got drunk and said racist shit about black people on tv about 20 years ago), but that genetic make-up seems to have a greater propensity for both lean muscle mass as well as the thin skin (decreased sub-dermal fat retention?) required to showcase such a dynamic musculature.

What people do not understand (some white people at least) is that American Caucasians have the benefit of a tremendous amount of ""racial averaging"" from the so-called melting pot effect.  Italian, irish, eastern european, it's all in there.

Some may associate beauty with the subtlety created by averaging the less attractive features of a multitude of specific races over several generations.  Those people would likely not be drawn to a person who was genetically distinct and displayed the strong traits of their race-region combination.

It is evident of latent racism that in many people's minds black is black.  the portion of the African Genocide that brought slaves to the united states indicates that those long-time americans are likely of Angloan descent, or siera leone, or iaround that general area of the middle west coast of africa.  They generally look nothing like kenyans for example.

A more open-minded person would have been more specific or have used region of descent rather than skin color to differentiate people.

I for one can understand not naturally being drawn to certain groups based on whichever feature.   that is normal.

Saying ""black people are whatever"" is closed-minded, and bigoted, and absolutely wrong.

Beauty is many things, and ultimately lies in the perception of the individual.

1. We can only guess whether the markets would have distinguished between debt issued by the sovereign and debt guaranteed by the sovereign. If it didn't we'd be looking Irish assets being seized abroad (which would scare the living **shit** out of any foreign firms headquartered here) and a refusal by markets to lend to the government at a time when its balance was in deficit.

2. Even if the markets didn't link it to the sovereign, it would have triggered a credit event and an unknowable quantity of credit default swaps would have been called in. This means the total amount to be paid by all the countries affected would have been far larger than the amount Ireland has to pay now. Furthermore, our own banks would be locked out of credit markets and we'd have to cough up to the money to roll over their debt and recapitalise them anyway.

I think these factors are enough to raise doubt about whether we're some sort of sacrificial lamb.

The first is that it's soft and workable, so when the pressure jumps in the chamber, the brass casing expands, and seals it off. The second is that it's elastic, so that when the pressure drops in the chamber, the case springs back to roughly the same shape and size of its original form,  making extraction easy. The third reason is that brass is a great thermal conductor, so that while it's in the action, it absorbs a lot of the surrounding heat. When its ejected, it brings this heat with it, keeping the action cool.

Steel casings tend to not form as much of a tight seal as brass, which may result in a dirtier than normal chamber. If there are any problems with casings sticking in the chamber, your extractor may be worn more quickly than normal. Lastly, steel casings will not remove as much heat from the action as brass, so your rifle will run hotter with steel than with brass.

I have taken fewer chances and played it safer than I otherwise would have -- and part of the reason is personal security/health, as well as the ease with which one can get into debt quickly. 

I am a 40something American Redditor. I came of age in a country where credit cards with high rates are practically thrown at young adults (who typically have had little education on personal finance and the consequences of debt); where getting from Point A to Point B often means having a car payment, lots of gasoline to buy, and repairs to pay for; and where getting sick or injured means spending money you often don't have. 

And I came of age at a time when finding income/employment was still a bit challenging. It was a time of layoffs and national economic woes -- not as bad as in the last four years, though. It was easy to be unemployed, underemployed, or tragically underpaid. But the credit cards were there to help -- even though they would saddle me with lingering yet semi-manageable debt for years (for car repairs, for augmenting my grocery budget, etc). And the full-time permanent job I landed was there to offer me insurance that helped with any medical bills that cropped up.

I believed that better days were ahead and (once I figured out that debt at high interest rates would grow wildly) that there was hope for improving my income and wiping out the debt. It's not that I became a slave to the debt, but I had to work and seek better-paying jobs to ensure that I could eliminate the debt and stay out of the debt trap going forward.

And then, with an illness here and there, came the realization that having a job with benefits guaranteed some sort of health security. And then came the love of my life and a child -- and an increased need to help provide for their material and health requirements. No joining the Peace Corps at this point! (But that part of my ""dream life"" DID come true -- a loving partner and a wonderful child -- and it made the lack of ""adventure"" in life seem not so bad after all. I have arrived at a comfortable place. I feel that a new adventure has pervaded my life, that more adventure lies ahead, that maybe life really does begin at 40. Twenty years goes by incredibly fast, by the way. You won't believe it.)

You are entering adulthood at a different time -- but it's not so different. The realities for a 20-year-old change depending on when/where you are living and the economic situation at the time. To be a 20-year-old in America now seems to offer more hope than being a 20-year-old in America in, say, early 2008. Health-care changes are coming, slowly. 

But until we can live in a country where getting sick doesn't cripple you with debt; where predatory lending practices don't lure the young into a lifetime of mistakes; and where public transportation, transportation infrastructure, fuel efficiency, teleworking, etc., are seen as national priorities, we're not going to live in a country that easily lets 20-year-olds become the 40-year-olds they imagined themselves to be.

Yes, I am to blame, too. I was always in control. I still am. But the U.S. status quo to a great degree stifles ambition, ingenuity, risk-taking, entrepreneurship, and the spirit of adventure. Yes, there are 17-year-old millionaires building businesses right now. Yes, there are 22-year-olds building fun new lives in exotic places right now. Often, it's because their parents made it easy for them -- provided a safety net -- or it's because they don't care, because they have nothing to lose, because they don't worry about their health (yet), because they'd rather burn out than to fade away. (No judgment here. Everyone is coming from a different place, with different advantages, and not all attitudes are the same.) 

But, for what we pay in taxes, our government of/by/for the people sure doesn't make it easy for the people to be life/liberty/pursuit-of-happiness-embracing people.

Did we rise from the ashed of two World Wars to where we are today thinking like that? Why are you undervaluing hopes and dreams so much, when that has always been our inspiration?

We Europeans have achieved so much even when we were in such fierce competition and always trying to undermine each other, imagine the possibilities if we all worked together, forget about China and their slave labor, forget about America and their dollar, if we set our differences aside they'd all be put to a corner, that I have no doubt about.

Sure, for now it's just a dream, but it's a goal, something to look forward to, something achievable with a great effort and that would lay the foundations to stability and prosperity for future generations, and I honestly believe that's something we can all aspire to.

A unified Europe through tyranny is unachievable, I'm sure the Roman Empire, the 1st French Empire or the 3rd Reich would agree to that, but an Europe through diplomacy and mutual understanding, with common goals and core values, well, here we are, even if you consider only post Maastricht it's now been 18 years, and sure, things might be much better, but they could also be much worse. Look to the USA, look to China, look to India, look to Brasil, look to Russia... tell me, are any of them better than we are today?

Call me an idealist, but I rather look at it as a challenge rather than just a dream, increased understanding and cooperation, that's something worth working for, right?

Since when has being in midseason form been an excuse used by anybody for not playing well? Furthermore, the only player for the US that is not in the middle of his club season in Europe is Brek Shea - the only guy playing for the US that plays in MLS.

It is a friendly, but professional players tend to take games that contribute to their livelihood and reputation seriously. Italy was missing some guys and didn't come out as focused as they should have, but a loss at home is probably not going to endear them to their fans or engender confidence before the upcoming Euros. I'm willing to bet the Italians did not come onto the field with the thought ""I don't want to win today because this is a mere friendly against the lowly United States.""

Who's waving flags? I have spent most of my time here defending the US team as being at least as good as Mexico, because as soon as I expressed any optimism about the US's wins today and took a jab at Mexico's losses, somebody pointed out how Mexico won the Gold Cup over the US last summer.

I have not expressed any unreasonable delusions about how the US is now a top 10 team in the world simply because they beat Italy in a friendly. The US is not top 10 in the world, maybe not even top 20. The win is reason for optimism, but the first true test this US team will face is probably a year away in the final round of WC qualifying, with a lesser test (that should be a formality) beginning this summer with the penultimate WC qualifying round.

I will say one thing, the situation of Muslims in Europe is quite different than in the US. Just as an example, the first time the US opened immigration to South Asians was in the early 1970's. And then, you could only come here from Pakistan or India if you had been accepted into a university and you got a student visa. So for my generation of immigrants, almost everyone was a professional. Things are a bit different now, but we just don't have the problem of extremism in the way that Europe does. They brought in poor, uneducated people to fill their labor requirements. So your experience with Muslims is very different from the experience most Americans have. That being said, I'm sure you'll agree that the vast majority of Muslims in Sweden are just like anyone else, but I am not oblivious to the problems there. Still, the answer isn't as simple as Islam made them do it. A sincere investigation will show that the issue is much more complex and involves many other issues. I think you'll also find that despite me being a Muslim and you being an atheist, we have much more in common in terms of our beliefs than you would think. ",t3_q916k,pakiman47,,0,False,

So you ended up 'having enough to buy a small farm' - if you'd saved enough to buy a large one. 

For seconders, capital markets are much broader and deeper now than in WWII - there were no institutional buyers for US debt outside of the US back then, and inside the US there were very few buyers - there were no 401k fund managers, there were very few large pension plan managers, and those that were knew better than to loan their pensioners money to the US government at the scale that the US needed. 

tl;dr:  Why have dedicated war bonds when people and investors are perfectly willing to buy US t-bills at a low rate?

Cut back to 1941 - who could buy any significant amount?  Obviously not Germany, France, Italy, Russia, any of the territories conquered by Germany or Japan.  China - nope.  the UK  was pretty much liquidating everything they had and weren't in a position to lend to the US.   What does that leave?  Some S. American countries and Canada?

Oh that should be easy to pack lightly for. Last summer my wife and I did a 3 week tour through Europe. Like everyone we packed to much but I think I have a better grasp on what I would take on my next summer trip. First take stuff that dries quickly if you want to pack light. My plan for our next trip is to take essentially two pairs of clothes. One to wear while the other dries. From the items below you can see that I would lean on the side of casual and comfortable but I think that it versatile enough to wear out for most occasions.

Backpack: [Northface Alteo 50](http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/sc-gear/alteo-50.html) 50l bag should be way more than you need. For our 3week trip I took the 50 and my wife took the Alteo 35. Great bags. Just make sure to try a backpack on before you but it though, each pack fits people differently. 

Sandals: Slipons rugged ones I would recommend Teva or Reef

Quick drying shoes: I would take something like the [Merrell Barefoot Shoes](http://www.merrell.com/US/en-US/Product.mvc.aspx/26342M/0/Mens/Barefoot-Run-Road-Glove?dimensions=0) that pack up small and are light weight.

2 pair pants: I actually like zip off pants for the versatility. I would get these from [Columbia](http://www.columbia.com/Blood-and-Guts%E2%84%A2-Convertible-Pant-%7C-160-%7C-30/008949789932,default,pd.html#).

2 boxers: [ExOfficio](http://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Mens-Give-N-Go-Boxer-Brief/dp/B001M0MN16)

1 quick dry swimsuit: I actually used something similar to [these](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?l=shop,pdp,ctr-inline/cid-1/pid-172485/pgid-377263) since they could double as boxers, fit under a wet suit, and fit in around Europe

2 t-shirts : [SeV](http://www.scottevest.com/v3_store/SeV_Tshirt.shtml) from Scottvest. Or maybe make one a polo shirt or button down shirt.

There are a bunch of different legal systems for owning land, but basically it refers to three things -- they all follow from government sovereignty and agreements on how ownership works that can always be changed: 

The ownership of the physical matter itself (like the dirt and rocks), which you own like any other material possession -- like if I made a pile of DVD players and a pile of rocks, there is no difference between owning the DVD players and owning the rocks. That should be pretty intuitive. 

The ownership of the area encompassing the plot. That is, you mark off a certain territory as yours with a fence or a deed or something, and within that area, you have a certain amount of limited sovereignty. You get to decide whether anybody gets to build a house there, for example.

The rights to do certain things in that area. Like, if I buy land from somebody that has deers on it, I may be buying it because I want to hunt the deer. With my ownership comes my legal right to use the plot for deer hunting. Or I can use it to live in, or to put up a business. Of course these rights ultimately come from the government, so they get to set limits on them, like I can own land that is residentially zoned and have the right to build a house there but not a business.

There is this myth that Native Americans were so spiritual that they didn't believe in ""owning"" land. This is false. Native Americans generally had systems of land ownership, but they were based around use rights, not territorial rights or rights to natural resources. So, Native Americans -- at least the ones who dealt with Europeans, generally saw deals over land as having a term and being limited by the activity you would do on the land, whereas Europeans saw them as involving a bunch of different rights involving this notion of territorial sovereignty. 

The difference in government systems for owning land turned out to be incompatible, which was one of the reasons why there was so much war and chaos even in places where it seemed like Europeans and Native Americans had reached agreements and could coexist.

&gt; Land is here and it costs nothing. Its earth. 

This is not true in any of the three senses. If you're talking about natural resources like rocks and stuff, then that definitely has a market price. If you're talking about limited sovereignty of a territory or the rights to do certain things in that territory, there are a lot of costs associated with doing those things. 

For example, you have to find out where your land is, go there, mark it off, stuff like that. You also have to formalize the land ownership system that creates the concept of property rights, and you have to build a government to support and enforce it. None of that is free.

&gt; Then someone decides this land will be sold and the money will be theirs. Who makes this decision? 

Generally, this decision starts with the government, whatever that means. Governments establish systems of property rights, which set the rules for buying and selling land. They do this for a variety of reasons -- but private property ownership can't exist without something serving the purpose of a government. 

&gt; How can someone sell land to 1 person? Our land! Our lakes! Ours.....

Well, implicit in the idea of property ownership is the ability to assert ownership - that is, to force other people off your property by some means. This is sometimes a tricky thing to do, but not all that obscure.

The reason it is easy is because land, either in terms of materials or in terms of rights, is *used* for stuff. You don't own the land in a metaphysical sense - your interaction is entirely with other people, determining who is allowed to go where. 

The ""land"" that you own is a semiotic and cultural construction - the actual dirt qua dirt doesn't know or care that you even exist. 

&gt; everyone's land now belongs to 1 person, and someone made money out of it and they are buying whatever they wish. I don't understand this principle. Can someone explain?

Well, okay, I'll try --

**First--** Value is a social construction. Nothing has inherent value. Nothing. Any price ever paid for anything is determined by the people agreeing on how much it is worth. 

So, it might seem like a problem that money can be exchanged for land, because they seem to exist on different levels of importance or have different material qualities. Get this out of your head -- things like material qualities or levels of importance are not relevant to a thing's value -- or at least they do not supercede or exist independently of people's willingness to assign value to it with equal subjectivity.

**Second--** Ownership is a social construction. When you think you're making an agreement with a *thing,* you're really making an agreement *with other people*.

For example, say you want to buy a particular pokemon card. You can't ""own"" the pokemon card by interacting with it -- perhaps if it were a digital card that existed within an information framework, some quality of the card as coded would change -- but if you're talking about owning a physical object, nothing about the pokemon card changes if you own it. What happens is that, through a global interaction of governments and legal systems, you have made an agreement with *every other person on the planet* that you will have certain exclusive rights to use that pokemon card.

You could potentially brand a cattle or carve your name in a tree, but that only means something if other people agree it means something. You could say you own something by possessing it, but other people can choose whether or not to agree with you and potentially try to take it from you, and that all changes the nature of your ownership.

So when we say you own the pokemon card, it's a shorthand for that role within the social structure that determines what you are allowed to do with it by other people.

**Third--** Agreements beget agreements and can be traded and negotiated.

So, if I have an agreement to use one thing, and you have an agreement to use another thing, we can potentially swap those agreements, and thus, through a shorthand of language, swap the things to which they refer. 

An agreement to ""own"" land (meaning a government-supported agreement with other people over the use of the land and stuff on it), can be traded for an agreement to ""own"" a hat (meaning a government-supported agreement with other people over the use of this thing you put on your head; that other people can't put it on their heads without your permission). 

And then money is a government-created concept that stands behind this system of agreements that is meant to simplify them and also to account for agreements that are large or logistically difficult to the point where the things can't be physically traded. So I can trade my agreement with other people over the land to an agreement with other people over money, to an agreement with other people about playing a bunch of Street Fighter at Dave &amp; Buster's -- rather than putting ""the right to hunt deer"" into the coin slot and selecting Zangief.

The reason the government has to be involved is somewhat circular -- if you decide, for example, not to believe in the government-supported system for ownership of Pokemon cards and decide to just take and use them yourself, the government is whatever decides to stop you, whether it does this wth coercive force, by either killing you or putting you in prison so you physically can't take the pokemon cards, or through another mechanism of power like shaming, punishments, fines and garnishing, police records, denying you other favors, intimidation, or any of the other ways governments, official or unofficial, actually work.

You can't have ownership without a government backing it up, but really a government can be anything that backs up ownership. If it seems like there is a chicken-and-the-egg problem here, it's because there is -- and this problem exists with all human language and meaning about anything ever. It becomes a bigger problem in some areas than others, but really there is a ton of temporary consensus and moving goalposts in pretty much everything that human beings do.

Also I have to ask for example with a TV show like Game of Thrones, on Sky+ I have access to Sky Atlantic, which will air Game of Thrones usually 2 weeks after its US release. So if I download that episode on the night of its release in the US, is that piracy? I've already paid for the content through my premium Sky+ subscription, so how is that piracy?

2.  The team was awesome!  I can't stress this enough.  SSX was the first game I've worked on and I didn't know what to expect when I got in.  Pretty much everyone on the team was super smart and experienced.  So after just graduating from school I can only compare it to leaving primary school and into highschool.

3.  Games these days usually finish quite a bit ahead of release.  There is a huge process to get the game approved through Sony and Microsoft, get the game to reviewers, send it off to mastering.  So really our game is finished maybe a month to two months before actual release date.  But before that, it was CRAZY.

4.  At first I thought I was through playing SSX.  I had played the crap out of the tracks while we were building them.  But now that the game's done and fully put together, it's blowing me away.

&gt;The International Trade Committee is to recommend whether Parliament as a whole should give its consent to ACTA or reject it.

&gt;Four other committees will deliver their opinions on ACTA: the Industry, Research and Energy Committee (rapporteur Amelia Andersdotter Greens, SE), the Legal Affairs Committee  (rapporteur Marielle Gallo EPP, FR), the  Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee (rapporteur Dimitrios Droutsas S&amp;D, EL) and the Development Committee (rapporteur Jan Zahradil, ECR, CZ).

&gt;On 28 February a petition on ACTA, signed by almost over 2.5 million people from all over the world, will be handed to the European Parliament's Petitions Committee. The event will be web streamed on EP Live.

&gt;On 29 February the International Trade Committee will hold a first exchange of views on ACTA with the European Commission.

&gt;On 1 March, there will be a public workshop in which MEPs, academic experts, civil society organisations and EU officials will discuss ACTA's  possible merits and disadvantages.

&gt;What will happen after these opening debates is not yet certain. The International Trade Committee will debate the pros and cons of the agreement and the rapporteur will in the end make a proposal to the other committee members to either approve or reject ACTA.

&gt;There will also be a resolution in which the committee sets out its opinion on the agreement in greater detail. The committee might recommend asking  the European Court of Justice for a ruling on whether the agreement is compatible with the EU Treaty.

So there is still value and time to reach your MEP and relevant committee members. 

But I think in general; people should realize that ACTA was in the works for years. The problem was that there wasn't enough awareness amongst us. To stop the system that created acta, we need to change ourselves. We need to start becoming more active about politics and demanding participation in the process. 

Beyond ACTA we still have the TPP to fight. And there are different censorship bills being pushing nationally in different countries.

I don't mean to imply causation, merely heightened levels of correlation. I'm looking up a lot of this info (which honestly I had no idea about) and trying to get my subjective experience and observation to gel with the removal of the concept of race (as defined by skin color).

Subjectively I've noted correlations between people associated with certain regions. e.g. Because of my location, many people in my area are 1st or 2nd generation immigrants from various western-Asia countries, and I am often capable of determining their country of origin based on differences in a variety physical characteristics, including skin color, eyes, etc.

I know firsthand that these are not necessities (my own eyes are also heavily lidded, with a slight epicanthic fold, to the point that people often ask if I am Asian even though my recent ancestry is almost exclusively of European descent) but that there is also some degree of notable correlation, at least enough that I am able to (with some accuracy) predict country of origin.

Sorry if any of this is me unintentionally being a shitlord, I'm just trying to figure this stuff out. In referencing this sort of thing, I've discovered ethnicity seems to be the preferred nomenclature, although it also has to do more with culture and other sociological factors from my own experience, and I'm trying to stay mainly in the realm of common biological or genetic traits.

Final note, maybe I'm starting to understand things a bit better, the prominence of certain traits is only common when a region or people remain fairly isolated as far as reproduction is concerned, causing certain traits to become more common not because of skin color but because of a great deal of genetic homogeneity.

I was counting terrorists, not people's attempts at figuring out the thoughts of people about terrorists. And according to that support is only considerable in Palestine which has a tiny population and still doesn't make it over 1% of the Muslim world.

That poll was brought up in this subreddit before. The reason for the higher numbers pre-2002 was because of Palestine (the usual association with suicide bombing pre-9/11). After 9/11 when attention switched to other terrorist attacks against civilians, opinions on it changed across the Muslim world. They see a Palestinian fighting Israel as not terrorism because it's in self defense. They see 9/11 and other AQ-style attacks as actual terrorism and do not support it. If you looked at the actual questions asked  (""often"" justified or ""sometimes"" justified) you'd see that.

&gt; It's not a right language, 97.5% of world's population can't speak it. It's a bit more than half, you know.

Wrong. Just because they aren't speaking it doesn't mean they can't. Maybe for you, but not for everyone else.

It's one of the most spoken languages (one of the UN's 6 official) and if you count people who can read its script and have a rudimentary understanding of its vocab/grammar (i.e, Muslims) it doubles (Persian/Urdu/etc use Arabic-derived script for their own languages, speakers of those languages can read Arabic without a problem). Up until the 20th century Arabic-derived script was even more proliferative (the European colonial administrations of Southeast Asia for example ordered the switch to a Latinized script).

&gt; How many? Ten per year? Five? I don't see any data in your post.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers

Check the 'native' vs 'Total' speakers column.

6th most spoken language by native speakers. *Third* among total speakers (after English and Mandarin).

It's hard for me to concieve the confusion of ideas that would lead to this conclusion. His list included names and dates that were far, far after the middle ages. The important fact is that they all took place before the american revolution (denying your point about america being the first). Frederick the great was inspired and on and off friends with Voltaire, and heavily inspired by the philosoph (sp?). Your argument that the american government system is the first of it's kind is what they were trying to disprove, that means they had to show you things that came before. 

He gives you historical facts, and dates (more then I'd expect), you give adhominium.

This is the one error you can point out? AFAIK it did give English citizens rights, English citizens were people who had the vote (not everyone was a citizen).

&gt;... historically intersting setting

This is subjective, and the only place where your argument makes sense. 

&gt; ...more for the compelling story then a building climbing simulator...
 The climbing and the tech around the parkour is the core game play mechanic - if your tired of that, your tired of assassins creed. The story is interesting, especially in it's alternate history aspect, haven't you gotten enough American history though (I've got lots of american relatives, they got jingoistic histoy by the boat load)?

Europe has an even worse history. Unfortunately, this kind of thing was frighteningly common for humans all across the world.

I think the difference between them and us is modernity. The industrial revolution, basic literacy for all, mass media that turns local horrors into public demands for justice, an increased standard of living and the rise of the middle class, drastic decreases in infant mortality - all these things have elevated the value of life and changed our mindset. Life used to be incredibly cheap not so long ago. People were inured to death by having 2 of their kids die in childhood for every one that survived, the incredible loss of life in childbirth, continual plagues and famines that decimated populations. Growing up under these circumstances produced a different mindset, a different psychology from that of people today. Making a picnic occasion out of public torture and public hangings, bringing the wife and kids to enjoy mass executions, all this was very normal.

Our modern attitudes are very recent in the scale of human history. Unfortunately, there are parts of the world that are still living with 300 year old attitudes, such as these people from the Congo.

&gt; Skeptical scrutiny is the means, in both science and religion, by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense.- Carl Sagan

Who are we and what are we doing here? In fact, what does the concept of here even mean in the grand scheme of existence? These are questions that we have long sought to answer as a species, through both faith and investigation. The search for our origins and our reason for being here is the common denominator of human intellectual pursuits and it should be, as it ultimately may answer what the meaning of life is or give us an entirely new meaning all together. However, we have never agreed on the answers to these questions and indeed we cannot even agree on what methods we should use to answer them. This is merely the logical outcome of our pre-modern and pre-technological existence.

For millennia we had no true understanding of how or why our earth worked. The reason for this is that we did not have any common system of scientific analysis or the technology to make use of such systems. We were left with merely sensory perception to observe our surroundings and thus we made extremely faulty assumptions, some varying from culture to culture and others, like the supernatural, pervaded almost every society. These beliefs of the nature of the world and the supernatural gave peace to people whose lives were often nasty, brutish, and short. They were then passed down from generation to generation, engendering a culture of faith and perpetuating blissful ignorance through disinterest in anything, but cursory observations.

However, one day this façade began to be chipped away. The battle between religion and technological/intellectual advancement began and though I am mostly referring to the Abrahamic religions here, since Eastern and New World religions are so drastically different in character and prescience for me, I would like to emphasize that all religions, to some degree, are subject to my argument and to the arguments of scientifically minded men and women. From Galileo to Copernicus to Voltaire and Darwin, intellectualism and progress, spurred on by a scientific process, bolstered by technology, like the telescope, allowed for analysis of our world in a more precise and accurate manner. Our ability to double check the claims of the religious has only led to an increasing realization of their lack of curiosity and in regard to their leaders, counterproductive deceit.

With the rise of germ theory we realized that the plague was not a curse from God and that witches were not poisoning wells. Meteorologists have shown that Hurricanes result from pressure differentials, not Poseidon. With improved ship building, we became able to prove beyond a doubt that the earth was not flat and since then we have been able to prove that its surface was not permanently set in place by God, but that it shifted over millions of years. We know there were dinosaurs and that humans did not exist when they did. We have discovered that there are no sea-monsters and that the great fish’ that the bible mentions are not fish at all, but whales. Technology has allowed us to prove that the mentally ill are not possessed by demons. Video recording and medical technology have allowed us to debunk the idea of miracles. Genetics technology and carbon dating have allowed us to prove that both the earth and the human race are far older than asserted by any religion.

The most important of these technologies though is obvious: the Internet. Just as the printing press allowed men like Martin Luther to challenge and damage the Catholic Church, the Internet will be the demise of religion. The Internet has only been here since the nineties and has already drastically affected society and religion is perhaps the most notable case. Never before have people had so much access to information. The child who thirty years ago would have been either straddled by his parents passed down ignorance or limited to the culture of his local library, is now a child with access to almost every scientific, philosophical, technological, and atheistic/religious idea ever posited. I can personally attest that I was and many of my friends were, in a serious way, led to atheism through information we attained from the Internet.

Women in Iran can see how women in the West live and can desire that freedom with a passion that would have been almost impossible, in such an indoctrinated culture, without knowing the progress and happiness of others. Rich westerners now bear witness to all of the injustice, pain, and inequality in this world. And in the age of the Internet we have seen the rise of the greatest philanthropist in history, Bill Gates. However, Bill Gates is not just a philanthropist. He is a pioneer of technology and advocate of science. Bill Gates is also an atheist. He worked hard his whole life, to advance human technological capability, and now he is going to do for others what the religious seem to claim for themselves, yet cynically use to convert people, charity.

More over Bill Gates has shown us a future where enterprising scientists move forward human technological achievement and prosperity, not due to a faith or a desire for salvation. Ninety-three percent of the National Academy of Sciences is atheist; do we not see the correlation between inventive/technological thought and a lack of faith? Do we not see a correlation of ignorance and immorality to religion in the fact that less than 1% of the US prison population professes no belief. Unlike those prisoners though, we can choose our future. As a people we must decide whether we will hope that we will get a palace in the sky after we die and let religious zealots run our lives, as we domineer ourselves with ludicrous restrictions and self-debasement, or we can choose to investigate and innovate until the earth turns to dust.

This conflict is thus not merely a philosophical one, but a very real political and governmental one. Countless people have helplessly watched their loved ones die from medical issues that stem cell technology could have cured, because one of the first things George W. Bush did upon becoming President, was ban stem cell research, a technology that never warranted such treatment. This is because Bush was a born again Christian, a right to lifer, and an ignorant, callous man who watched thousands of troops die for a pointless war. His attitude though, his sense of being, which allowed him to do and not stop all of these things was an attitude of faith. Faith that God had his back in his decisions and that most importantly to me, God opposed stem cell technology.

Years before, when I was only six years old, my mother hung herself in our house. She had bipolar depression and for all of her life and her intensely Christian parents had not even believed in the concept of depression and insisted she was just in a funk. Instead of taking her to doctors, they took her to priests and when she met my dad he saw it for what it was and got her treatment. However, it was too late. My mother was a Christian who believed in the afterlife and the technology and resultant medical advances that could have saved her life would not be around for a decade. That was thanks to religions repression of technology and so was the fact that she was willing to abandon her family and children for her next joyous life. This attitude of fatalism is, as I have noted, the greatest impediment to technological advancement.

Denis Diderot once said “Man will never be free until the last King is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.” Aside from the gruesome imagery, I agree. Man frees himself in the temporal world with democracy defeating tyranny, and equality of rights triumphing over prejudice. Now man must free himself in the intellectual and technological world by abandoning faiths that stem from cultures that were some of the most backward, barbaric, and pathetic of the time. This becomes even more strikingly obvious when we observe how Christians like Harry Truman and Hitler could drop nuclear weapons on civilians and brutally torture and massacre a whole race.

Technology is not useful in the hands of the religious; it is terrifying and destructive. Religion seeks to simply acquire the technology it considers useful and brutally suppress all that questions or challenges it. The religious leaders and charlatans of the world realized over time that many technological advances were proving them to be liars and they actively sought to destroy such intellectual use of or ownership of such technology. This distinction is important since, to the faithful, it is not only what technology you use, but how you use it. While they developed few technologies to help others, the religious people of times and places like medieval Europe were very ingenious in their torture, weapon, and Cathedral building technology. This should tell you something about their priorities and why they are the bane of technological prosperity.

We need only open our eyes to see that technology and science are not in harmony with religion, but tacitly and often openly at war with it. Religion allows for stasis and encourages one to simply make up answers for complex issues and rely on unqualified, but charismatic/close, people for information. The relationship could not be more conflict ridden. 

Where science and technology seek to protect cities from natural disaster or cure diseases, faith tells you to simply sit there and rely on God. This is the attitude that has led states like Kansas and Texas to try to implement the childish notion of creationism or intelligent design in our school systems, but guess who stopped them: scientists, professors, and intellectuals. This attitude is not acceptable for the long-term existence of our race or for the progress of our technology.

(Exept the conviently allowed PT for Solly and Demo, Equalizer for Soldier, Direct hit, Kritz, Ubersaw...) Then let's get started on the reasons.

* OP: The first reasonable one. 6v6 is different and some weapons are OP.

* UP: Some weapons are banned for being UP. Seriously. If they are UP, then use them at your expense. banning ""UP"" stuff is simply poor show.

* No fun: This is the biggest bullshit ever. Every weapon in the no fun catagory is ""No fun"" because it gives classes boosts or new roles to fill. This includes ""Slows the game down"". It is a thinly veiled exuse for banning stuff that is not for soldier or medic.

* Glitched: This is perfectly fine.

At least the European league pretends to be fair with unlocks, unlike the ESEA.

If I could do a comparison, most 6v6 arguing is circular logic and doublethink. ""utilities suck, therfor don't give them unlocks that help them in 6v6 because they won't suck anymore."" The 6v6 community in action HATES utilities, and it is incredibly clear to anyone after a while. The comparison is Jim Crow. ""Put the X down because X is inferior, and the proof is the result of our laws to put X down because X is inferior.""

First, get airline credit cards!

--US Airways: $70 annual fee, 25,000 mile signup bonus.

--Southwest: $70 annual fee, 25,000 mile signup bonus (for US travel)

--Starwood American Express: Free the first year, 10K mile bonus + 15K mile bonus if you spend $5,000 in six months (I use it for work purchasing).


You can transfer Starwood points to US Airways points, so if you sign up for Starwood, spend money, and transfer to US airways, you have 50K points for $65.  This is good for a free round-trip airfare to Europe or two round-trip tickets in the domestic US.

Protip:  You can also sign up for each of these as a business card as well - sole proprietership - and double your points.

US Airways also has a ""Grand Slam"" promotion every fall, where you can buy items and services from their partners to get airline points.  I spent about $300 to get 45K points - almost enough for a free ticket to Europe.

To stay, Starwood points are good for ""Cash to Points"" - they allow you to use a small amount of points and pay a little bit for great hotels.  I stayed in the Westin Palace, Madrid for $90 + 1,000 starwood points/night.

One caveat - you have to really monitor awards travel for months to see when the dates open up for minimum mileage flying.  Start before you want to book tickets to try to discern patterns.

This method isn't for the faint of heart, but I've flown to Europe several times for approximately $120/ticket (due to taxes &amp; fees).

&gt;Basically it was about a black high school student who, in a class discussion about attractiveness in culture, was basically singled out and told that black women look like apes and are inherently unattractive, and when she brought this to the attention of her teacher, he told her to not be offended by what is ~simply~ personal preference.

I think we can all agree that the problem here is that the teacher is saying ""it is personal preference"" to think that:

* all black women look like apes
* all black women are inherently unattractive

Any statement that begins with ""all"" is going to be problematic, and any statement that is ""all black people look like apes and are inherently unattractive"" is going to be extra problematic. Here is why:

I think we can all agree that there are hot, sexy women from ALL races. However, I certainly admit that I preferentially find white women attractive. I'm not big on black women, but I have to admit, there are some smoking hot black women out there. 

With that said...here is what I would define as racist, or internalized racism:

""All black women are ugly! I don't find any of them attractive!"" If someone says this, and truly believes it, and truly practices it, they are probably racist. Because come on! There are some beautiful black women out there.

If someone says: ""My preference is white women, I'm not big on black women."" I don't think that is racist, it's just stating a preference. Now, there is nothing wrong with **having** a preference. But if you run around stating your preference to everyone, that can be problematic (and perhaps indicative of someone who is internalizing racism). 

Because I don't know about you guys, but I don't tell random people I meet in public spaces what my sexual preferences are. And I would argue that most normal people are the same way (hence boundary issues 101). 

stuccoparty says:

&gt;1. Objective declarations about the attractiveness or unattractiveness of a person are just cruel. If it's not for you, it's not for you. Just say so -- don't speak for the rest of the human race.

In a public space? I agree 100%. It's just a boundary issue, a common-sense thing. If you and your friends are having an intimate conversation, that is different. 

&gt;.2. Objective declarations about the attractiveness or unattractiveness of marginalized peoples are deeply problematic, especially when they come from a person occupying a position of privilege -- as this can reinforce racial hierarchies and ""less-than"" status.

I know stuccoparty is putting a shitty ""SRS"" twist on this, but I think if you take this statement out the SRS context and drop it into a Psychology context, it would hold true. If someone is black (or marginalized) they already have to deal with shit like stereotype threat, so listening to a white person tell them they are unattractive is probably going to reinforce negative views about themselves, which is problematic.

Again, this isn't even an SRS issue: why the fuck would you tell someone who is black or fat or whatever that you are not attracted to black or fat people? What does that accomplish?

&gt;.3. Race-focused discussions of ""attractive features"" often proceed oblivious to the socially constructed beauty standards that dominate aesthetic discourse in the west. Such discussions often serve only to reinforce these arbitrary standards (which invariably favor the privileged).

If any of stuccoparty's statements are especially problematic, it might be this one. There is a lot to dig into with respect to this comment, so I'm just going to ignore it. The guy is an SRS mod, so he is obviously a piece of work. I mean that's all you need to know: he is an SRS mod. 

But if I had to make any absolute statements: there are 3.5 billion+ females out there. There are hot black women, asian women, latina women, middle eastern women, european women, eskimo women, etc. I mean christ, if mermaids existed I would probably fuck them too. 

If someone says, ""ALL black women are ugly!"" and they stick to that practice, it might be internalized racism. And if they run around telling random strangers that all black women are ugly, they might just be projecting.

&gt;Well if that's not what you meant, then your point was irrelevant. 

It is not irrelevant to the point that I was making.

&gt;""Soldiers can choose not to kill innocent children and dad's."" You meant that as just a standalone statement without any implications behind it? If so, you did nothing but point out the obvious.

It's not obvious to those who believe in the Nuremberg defense, and there are many. 

&gt;&gt;Refuting an easily seen contradiction doesn't have to be all that deep and profound. A quick correction is all that is needed. You did make a black and white argument.

&gt;Sure it is a black and white statement, but it's still true. 

The fact that it's a black and white argument is why it contradicts your professed position that making black and white arguments is a faux pas.

And it's not even true.  The world is in fact black and white.  Black and white follows from the universe having physical laws and truths, in other words an existence.  Since humans are capable of making false propositions, as you did, that's the flip side to everything that is true.  True and false.  Black and white.  The world is black and white, and any attempt to refute that, would be a contradiction, because it would necessarily rest on a conception of true and false, which is another way of saying black and white.

&gt;There are black and white statements, but that doesn't mean the world is black and white. It isn't - the things you perceive are still subjective.

If it is a fact that what I see is subjective (it isn't always by the way), then you are making yet another black and white argument, namely, humans are something, but not something else.  We think in terms of a specific way, but no others.  Black and white.

&gt;So it was wrong of us to invade Europe and liberate all the Nazi-occupied countries along the way?

Who's this ""us""?  I wasn't involved.  Neither were you, if you were born after 1922 (1939 start of war minus 17 year old age for joining military).

First off, it was wrong of the US state to rob Americans who were overwhelmingly against joining the second (and first) world war, to finance the war.  

Second, if the US had followed a strict non-interventionist foreign policy, it is likely the intra-European conflict would have ended in late 1916 or early 1917 as a result of several peace initiatives, such as from Emperor Charles I.  The war would have concluded with a face saving compromise rather than the actual dictate.  As a result, Austro-Hungary, Germany, and Russia would have remained traditional monarchies instead of becoming unstable and very short lived democracies.  With a Czar in Russia, and a Kaiser in Germany and Austro-Hungary, it would have been impossible for the communist Bolsheviks to seize power in Russia, and without that growing communist threat in western Europe, it would have been impossible for the Italian fascists and German national socialists to seize power.  Millions of people could have been saved and world war 2 would never have happened.

The US and western European states would never have reached the heights of power then, and it would never have reached the power it has now.  Most importantly, instead of eastern and central Europe (and thus eventually half the world) falling into communist power, and resulting in almost 50 years of being plundered, destroyed, and forcefully insulated from western markets, all of Europe and the entire globe could have been integrated economically (as it was in the 19th century, growing by leaps and bounds until the rise of socialism and the watered down version of democracy) in a division of labor that encompassed the whole world.  World living standards would have far higher than they are today.

So yeah, I am not into the ""rah rah rah"" in favor of the US meddling in European affairs.

&gt;Foreign fighters were a minority of Iraqi defenders. 

I know, which is why it was weird that you emphasized foreign fighters in Iraq.

&gt;&gt;And foreign fighters is irrelevant to my argument on what YOU would think if China invaded the US.

&gt;I realized the first statement when debating somebody else. 

Well that explains it.  Try to keep track who you're talking to next time.

&gt;Regardless, if China invaded the US, then I would be all for an insurgency against them. That said, anybody who joined that insurgency still would not be innocent, because they still made the decision to fight.

They would be innocent!  There is no guilt in defending one's home and family and community from invaders.  Those who merely defend their families and themselves, using force against those who initiate it, remain innocent.

Deciding to fight and defend, versus deciding to capitulate and be slaughtered, is not a difference between innocence and guilt.  In fact, I would argue that those who capitulate and refuse to defend their families would be (morally) guilty.

&gt;&gt;If you're not even capable of trying to explain what fallacies you see, then there is no use for me thinking there are logical fallacies.

&gt;Alright, I'll list some for you to make it easier:

&gt;""Oh ya, protecting you guys from the invading Iraqis, Iranians, Libyans, Afghanis, etc, etc"" - Straw man.

I didn't say that.  THAT'S a straw man.

&gt;""Good thing the US military is killing everyone first."" - Straw man, ecological fallacy, red herring.

I didn't say that either.  Another straw man.

&gt;""Soldiers can choose not to kill innocent children and dads."" - False dichotomy, appeal to emotion.

Finally something I actually said.  

No, it is not a false dichotomy, because there are in fact only two choices.  One can either choose to kill innocent children and dads, or one can choose not to kill innocent children and dads.

Here, I think our most specific and unique problem would be the unusual racial dynamic here, concerning racism against the indigenous population, the Maori. At the surface it's the same thing that happened in Australia and the US - European colonists arrive, take stuff from the natives and subjugate them. Here, though, the attempts and reconciling this have been far more successful. Which sounds great, and, really, it is.

The problem is the attitude it leads to in some of the population. In near every open debate I've seen about racial issues in New Zealand, this line comes up: ""Well, the Maori should consider themselves lucky that they didn't have it as bad as the Aborigines or the American Indians."" Which is just not okay, clearly. A really bad thing happening to someone else doesn't make a lesser, but still very bad thing happening to a people into an okay thing.

There are other issues too that lead to a similar problem. Direct and intentional institutionalised racism no longer exists, as is true of most western countries in a similar situation. Maori, however, are still severely overrepresented in things like poverty demographics. But people counter with things like our own affirmative action - we have dedicated Maori seats for a Maori electoral role (that you can choose to opt in to if you're Maori, it's not imposed segregation), the recent Waitangi Settlement claims (returning land to Maori that was taken from them in the last 170 years since the treaty was singed), things like that, and then claim that modern Maori have nothing to complain about. 

This happens everywhere, but the attitude in a lot of New Zealanders is reinforced by the fact that the Maori *weren't* persecuted to quite the same extent as some other indigenous populations - again, as if that makes what happened here okay. 

We're doing about average on the other fronts, I think. Gender equality is coming along pretty nicely, probably slightly better than the US actually, but we do still have a ways to go. 

Same gender couples have the option of a civil union (unfortunately not marriage) that opposite gender couples also have, which ideally would confer the same rights as a marriage, but doesn't in reality. Adoption in particular is a problem if you have a civil union rather than a marriage. 

I'm not really aware of any real differences between here and the US on other issues, if any other Kiwis want to add to this, that would be helpful. But I am aware that our transgender and genderqueer rights situation is pretty damn bad.

VVD which is a 'liberal' party takes a very conservative stance and also wants to cut down marijuana availability and use in the Netherlands, but not make it totally illegal. The result is that the CDA and PVV can push law after law to restrict coffeeshops further. The CDA wants to close them all and this is working because they dont allow new coffeeshops to be opened and close them down one by one by constructing rules around schools. Coffeeshops may not be within 350 meters of a school, they want to extend this also to different types of schools. This way they can close down coffeeshops without allowing new ones to open. 

The new membership is also a way to cut this down, hidden in a way to stop 'exporting' marijuana. With the membership they want to stop european citizens buying weed in coffeeshops. But you can only buy 5 grams per person. So banning people from the coffeeshop will result them in going to streetdealers. It just makes the problem harder to control. 
Also the coffeeshops are limited to 2000 members per shop. With the closing of many coffeeshops due to the new rules about schools, and new ones not being allowed, the CDA and PVV will just have to bide their time and wait until no coffeeshops are left. These parties are in it for criminalizing trees again.

1. the Design. Decentralised power is the best way to go. It prevents corruption and political theft in massive scale and in case of war, even if nukes were used, it would have been harder to terminate many command posts rather than one. everything decentralizes during critical times.

2. Corporate interests. Look at US. I have frequented [/r/conspiracy](/r/conspiracy), which often is true. I will never go to war or serve for somebodies else greedy interests. I don't want my politicians to be bought. Yes, everyone has resistance to bribes, but to buy a nation, that is something only corporations do. We have to get rid of possibilities for Europe to be bought.

3. I don't want to deal with crap just like we had to just after becoming part of EU. Yes, I like regulations and standards for food, but asking a country to close down only factory it has left and dropping into deep crisis is not wise choice. The Brand ""Jelgavas cukurs"" then was bought by Dansukker. Our local farmers hurt. Their lives depended on that.The reason to shut down the factory:""Overproduction of sugar in EU, so close it down or pay huge fines."" Don't fuck with last straw of already robbed, corrupt and old country.

4. Traditions. I really enjoy traveling, meeting people, visiting awesome places. I don't want visit place just for its architecture. It would have been awful to tour Germany with Greek guide talking about Jewish holocaust. Europe is great thing to raise global standards of wellbeing and security of Europe, but it should not replace our own local governments.

5. Control of Government. In here we elect people who runs our country and elect people who sits in chairs in Brussels. If we dislike something - massage our politicians. It would be a lot harder to make pressure on somebody sitting in Brussels.

6. As thesarajevorose said - we are Serbians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Swedes, Britons and everybody else there can be and we all have our different belonging and culture. Germans and Balts are very different. We like to take our time - be late for half a hour or open restaurant for somebody in holiday for spare hour earlier if somebody is waiting outside and you can't expect us standing outside the door until everyone has the exact time passed on their watches and rush into the building. For Britons it is common to be drunk, acquire ""super powers"" and go ""hunting ladies"" or abusing local monuments that were earned very hard with lives of our forefathers. We cannot tolerate such a disrespect. Ethnic tensions will rise (lookup Germany before WW2 and neo-nazi Russia 21st century).

I really like how Eu is going now and it had hit our local pride very hard some times, but it just works and I do not want it to be any different.

The lack of acceptable donors isn't due so much to the size of the pool (&gt; 20M last time I checked), but rather the lack of genetic diversity. Minorities are grossly underrepresented in the current donor pool, and as a result your chances of finding such a match if you are of a non-european ethnicity is comparatively slim. Being mixed-race gives you the worst chances. We probably could add some diversity by offering incentive, but I don't think that the current lack of it is due as much to lack of compensation as it is lack of interest and education. Maybe, maybe not. I'm not one to conjecture that point, but I don't see anything wrong with allowing a separate, PBSC-only, compensation-based registry.

Fix the payments so that you get paid a flat hourly rate for doctors visits, etc. and it could easily work. The insurance co. of the patient pays for the donor's meals and travel already, so some fixed, agreed-upon rate like $10/hour doesn't seem far-fetched. Between the two times I did it, I logged somewhere between 50-60 hours doing workup and post-operative stuff, but fortunately for me, my employer let me clock most of it as paid sick time. I can imagine that if your employer is not so understanding that some compensation might make the idea more attractive, however the chances of that particular person being chosen is ridiculously slim.

The only problem I see is that there are two wildly differing ways to collect stem cells, compensation for one being clearly allowed and the other clearly prohibited, but the rationale for allowing one but not the other is, IMO, fundamentally flawed. PBSC isn't nearly as straightforward and risk-free as say, plasma donation, since you do have to take drugs for which there is little known clinical research in healthy people. In some cases like mine, the donor has to have a vein catheter surgically implanted, which carries an additional risk of embolism. PSBC clearly carries risks that traditional blood product donations do not, but it is lumped in the same risk category for the purposes of this ruling.

No worries, you are not to blame for their actions, and I personaly feel that they too are victims of a system that is flawed. What this system is, I dare not to say since I am not sure, but more than anything it's culture I guess. The muslims from Turkey and from the Balkans are very different and there isn't too much tension. 

The Kurdish, Iraqi, Iranian  and Somalian muslims are different though, that implies that culture is a bigger factor than just religon, but then again, the Balkans and Turkey are quite secular in the sense that they have few fundamentalists and the they do not have any sharia laws or anything.

The more I think about it the more I feel that it is more a matter of incompatible cultures more than anything, but saying that here in Europe would be a no-no since it would mean that you're a racist (regadless of your intentions with that statement) Europe has a big problem with being hellbent on staying PC at all costs, especially Sweden, I used to believe that was a good thing actually since I hate racism.

However, it has lead to an atmosphere were all critizism of islam/incompatible cultures gets you labeled as a potential ethnic cleanser. The memory of the holocaust is still fresh and we many people believe that even slightly condoning another culture is a slippery slope that leads us back to the dark days of Hitler. While I belive that it is a healthy thing to fear, it sadly means that the only ones who are open with their critizism are the actual racist parties, hence they get votes because some people wrongfull believe that the racists have the answer.

I wish that the government would say that: Okay, so there are some problem, let's find out exactly what they are and deal with them in a honest, humanist and rational way. But let's also be realistic and find out exactly what Sweden can do for the refugees, how we can do it and what we need to change.

I fear that by not addressing these issues, the government just make the racist grow stronger and stronger.

&gt;So your experience with Muslims is very different from the experience most Americans have. That being said, I'm sure you'll agree that the vast majority of Muslims in Sweden are just like anyone else, but I am not oblivious to the problems there.

Yes, a lot of them are just like anybody else and some of them are simply wonderful people who I have great repspect for.

It is also a integration problem and that has nothing to do with religion or race, but with feeling like an outsider. This is partly the fault of the Swedish government who well meaningly let in more people than they were ready to handle. This is due to our law basically forbidding us to deny entrance to anyone comming from a country at war (kinda the punishment sweden took upon itself for not helping Europe in WW2, I think that law was passed in the late 40s)

&gt;I think you'll also find that despite me being a Muslim and you being an atheist, we have much more in common in terms of our beliefs than you would think.

I believe that too. It is easy to forget sometimes but the things that separate us can be numbered, the things that unite us probably can't. We're looking at the same things from slightly different perspectives and that's all I guess.

Germany can't handle this kind of matches very well. I'm watching football since the World Cup in 1990 and I can't remember that we ever had a team, that could meet on Tuesday, play a match on Wednesday and win with ease. Teams like the Netherlands or England can handle such matches much better, which is why Germany hasn't been the runner up in the world rankings until recently. They usually need at least two, better three days of preparation before a match. And the ""tournament-Germany"" is completely different than the ""friendlies-Germany"". Well, every team steps up for a tournament of course - apart from England maybe. But no team can refine its play during the preparation for the tournament and become stronger with every match like Germany.

Do we have to admit, that the German team is overhyped? Yes, absolutely! We won't beat every team with 4-0 goals and become European champions with a goal record of 24-0 goals. We should not expect this team to become champions. They are still damn young and inexperienced, and Spain is still the team to beat, not because of their individual strength but because of their tactical playstyle which is still unmatched. But Germany is not as overhyped as you might think. They can become champions and they can aim for it, but they'll have to find a way to stop the possession- and pressure-play of Spain.

That is not a complicated sentence, but you seem unwilling or unable to accept it. 

&gt; the EU bill it links to even states provisions that cover (3) and (4)

I'm not sure what point you are trying to make here.  Subsections 3 and 4 exist, they existed before Sherlock's SI, and they exist now after it.  His change had no impact on them at all, because he didn't amend those Subsections, he added new subsections, unrelated to them.

Maybe a historical perspective will help you understand.  

It could be argued that this all kicked off with the 2010 [Justice Charleton ruling](http://www.scribd.com/doc/39104491/EMI-v-UPC) in the case of EMI vs UPC.  EMI sought an injunction against UPC which would force them to block its subscribers from accessing The Pirate Bay.

In his ruling, Justice Charlton stated:

&gt;  In the second paragraph of their prayer for relief, the recording companies ask for a blocking injunction against Pirate Bay. This site is responsible for the great bulk of internet piracy in this country. Mr.Kavanagh, as I have said, described how he used it. To begin legally downloading copyright material, all that one needs to do is to access Pirate Bay, download the appropriate software from them, search on their website what swarms are active and what tracks are being offered, and then join one of those swarms using the relevant software. Regrettably on a full consideration of this matter, **a blocking injunction is not available in Irish law**.

This caused the record industry to turn their sights on the Irish government to demand a blocking injunction facility in Irish law.  The absence of one was a breach of EU Directive 2001/29/EC which states  in IV.8.3 that:

&gt;  Member States shall ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right

In light of this non compliance, [EMI started the process of taking the Irish government to court](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2398824,00.asp).

This is why Sherlock's Statutory instrument was pushed through, to provide a mechanism to apply for just such an injunction.  

However, as pointed out to you, the approach taken by Sherlock is to set the bar as low as possible.  There is no obligation to attempt to resolve the situation outside the High Court.  In the case where an injunction is sought and denied, there is no financial recovery for the defendant who may have suffered tens of thousands of Euro in legal costs through no fault of their own.  There is no sanction for frivolous injunction requests.  It specifies no real protection for other users of the service provider, and other lawful uses of the service provider.  It's all skewed in favour of the rightsholders and against the service provider. 

An [alternative SI](http://www.stephendonnelly.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Amended-SI-CMurphy-and-SDonnelly.pdf) drafted by Deputies Murphy and Donnelly) would have delivered the injunctive relief mechanism required by the rights holders, while balancing their rights against everyone else's.  Sherlock acknowledged that this alternative wording would have met the EU requirement for the injunctive relief, but declined to adopt it.

Let me just finish this post by extending a challenge to you.  I provided support, in the form of a public statement signed by a solicitor, for my claim that Sherlock's SI requires no prerequisite steps before a rights holder seeks an injunction against a service provider.  Can you provide one to support your interpretation (that the rights holder must show an attempt to resolve the situation outside the court before applying for an injunction), signed by another solicitor?

There's nothing to stop the Brits from wiping out the culture either and the more they can send over, the more they need expand in addition to the births that happen here. Native American populations have only been pushed back and aside from pockets of isolated groups being killed by war/disease or displaced there hasn't been a full removal of the native culture yet. Although largely ineffectual, the area beyond the colonies to the Mississippi had been designated Indian lands after being won from the French. In the strongholds of the colonies (major towns/cities), the culture is already gone. The only thing to do is to stem the tide and manage the spread. If the natives help the colonists, there's leverage. The colonists have to live here, they're on the ground, they have to live with the natives afterwards and they need all the help they can get. The empire could not care less, they're just after the trade and taxes. 

Help the rebels secure the coasts, win the war to reduce the numbers of white Americans on the ground and prevent more from coming over from Europe then take it all back.

Here in America you start school at either 5 or 6 (depending on your parents). This stage is called **Elementary School**. The years are called grades and they range from Kindergarten-5.

Then at around  10 or 11 you start **Middle School/ Junior High**. This has grades 6-8 and is meant to prepare you for high school.

At age 13-14 you leave middle school and move onto the last form of public Education. This is called **High School**. This consists of grades 9-12. All schooling up to this point is mandatory and when you graduate at age 17-18 you can choose to continue education or join the work force. 

While you are in High school you can take the SATs, these are extremely important if you want to go to college. After the SATs you can choose to apply to college. You can chose whatever college you want and pick you major. After what is usually 4 years (unless you want to be a doctor) you graduate college and join the work force.

I think the reason that communists do retain the old symbolism is because even though they have a past of failed revolutions, there is still a romantic tradition of international marxism that can't really be forgotten- especially in places in europe where the revolution didn't 'automatically' fail like Greece or UK.

 The other reason is because, for the time, the symbology of marxism was incredibly good quality propaganda! The most well paid advertising firm could never come up with something like that! -it wasn't an accident either, because many skilled artists dedicated themselves to achieving the 'look' of communism. examples: 'Bauhaus movement', elements of futurism,  Constructivism, Suprematism... many many artists had the idea that communism was the next big thing, and that it was their avant-garde duty to forward it!",t3_q1k6r,eddiminn,,0,False,

French, and not Russian, was the language of the elite of Imperial Russia from about the 1800s or so, and in fact I remember reading a biography of Nicholas II that said that if you were to strictly tally up his bloodline by the nationalities of his ancestors, he was mostly German and Danish and only a small part Russian. 

Even if you want to limit the discussion to post-1917, I don't think the argument holds - the Russian Revolution(s) was/were openly drawing from the writings of Marx and Engels, ie communism in the form that it appeared in Russia can be ideologically traced to Western Europe. All of this is not to say that Russia doesn't have its own rich and distinct culture, just that no culture exists in a vacuum and that Russia's has indubitably been more influenced by its European neighbors than by its Asian ones.

The geologists do not know exactly, or even to within a million years when the Earth was formed, so a calendar based on the true age of the Earth would have an imprecise starting date. 

The formation of the Earth was a gradual process over many millions of years, and no one can say at which minute it finally became a planet so we should measure our calendar from that point.

If a satisfactory date was established we would be using a calendar in which this year is 4,765,243,127 and last year was 4,765,243,126. This is very cumbersome to write and achieves nothing.

Other kingdoms, empires and religions before the Christian era all had their own calendars, usually based on the years of the current king's reign. The Roman Empire counted their dates from the founding of the city of Rome. It is often difficult to reconcile such dates in historical records.

The calendar we currently use was first defined in medieval times (about AD 500 if I recall correctly) and was gradually adopted through Europe and then imposed on the rest of the world as European countries conquered and colonised other countries.

What if the actual event marking the first year of the calendar is imaginary? It is more convenient to continue using it than to switch to a new calendar. Every history book and document from before the change of dates would need to be re-written, or you would need to add a figure of 4 billion-plus to each date you encountered.

It is more convenient to continue using the fictional (and incorrectly calculated) birthdate of the Messiah than to start again.

If you wish to avoid using the AD/BC notation you can refer to the year as CE/BCE, Common Era/Before Common Era, which historians and archeologists do to avoid controversy about the Christian calendar. Usually, unless you are writing about events BCE there is no need to specify that the year is AD/CE, as it is understood to be so unless specified otherwise.

3. Aliens (some of those European priests are serious UFO watchers, I was generally surprised, in a good way.)

Doing a bit of wiki-adventuring myself, I noticed that humans are thought to have evolved into their (our?) modern form [about 200k years ago in Africa.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution#Models_of_human_origins) So I guess that's toward the end of the Pleistocene era in that hi-res graph you linked to, when the temperature was violently going up and down into repeated ice ages.

So anyway, to my non-expert eye it looks like if you're searching for global temperatures above where they are now, you can find them in the spikes during the pleistocene (again, most of which was before there were modern humans). To find a time when the temperature was *consistently* higher than it is now, it looks like you have to go back to just under 3 million years ago during the Pliocene (10x as long as humans have existed), the begining of which was so warm there were [alligators in Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene#Reptiles).

Let me tell you about my first trip to the Nordstorm Rack. I was in a black leather jacket, some raggy boy jeans, and a black T-shirt. (So boring I want to cry.) I went to just browse, but then I went over to sneak a peek at the Size 11 (US) women's shoes. I saw a pair of heels that I could not even wrap my head around. They were sexy. They were fun. They were (Most importantly) 90% off. I HAD to have them.

Once I broke the seal, my shame faded. I got a little red as the clerks running the men's dressing room snickered at my choices, (I had to try on some jeans and shirts. I had no idea what I was in women's jeans sizes) but as I found out, they still helped me. They got over their snickering and went about their day. They forgot all about me.

And I still got to walk out of the Rack with $200 in new clothes and shoes.

I still have the clothes and the shoes and any embarrassment is gone.

Don't let other people restrict you to just shopping online. Trust me when I say that you WILL want to try on things before you buy them. Ultimately people just don't care.

Congratulations on getting a new apartment! (U.S. girl here. The only thing flat right now is my chest. &gt;_&lt; )

I just looked up what a 41 converts to in US sizes! You have cute feet! They are about 1.5-2 sizes smaller than mine. /jealous

I think you are totally screwed as far as the shoe fetish goes. You have really cute designs in the UK!

*I just realized that I just assumed that you were in the UK, but those are Europe sizes? Where are you from? I hope I don't offend!*

## ""You fucked this all up by yourselves"".

He cannot say that. I assume. Lets imagine I'm the ECB guy. How would I put it more scientifically?

""You voted for Fianna Fail. This was mostly because of your family backround and the fact that they got your useless layabout brother a medical card.

When anyone in your family questioned the property bubble, you told them that property only goes up, so they should borrow half a million euros for a small family home. Then your government, more-or-less led by its finance minister, a terminally-ill dimwitted accountant, who was not qualified to lead the country normally, let alone through the greatest financial crisis since 1930, decided the taxpayer would just underwrite all of it.
All of it.

All of the debt that the private sector banks had bet on the property market. Now the taxpayer is on the hook for it. 'It will be fine, property only goes up'.

The Taoiseach was nursing a hangover.

Then it turns out ""No"". Those banks are ever so slightly fucked up. Ireland proceeded with a 100% bank guarantee without even consulting the rest of the EU. Thought ye were smart. Deposits briefly flowed into Irish banks from other EU countries due to this guarantee, causing problems. 

But it turns out that you did not have this money, and you needed support from the ECB. This support was supplied well in advance of the official bailout (via the banks), which only arose due to the ECB getting worried about how much they were exposed to debt from the Irish government.

Your banks still have thousands of employees, bloated from the boom, on salaries that are still being paid at 2007 levels. Other sectors are suffering layoffs, but the bank unions can threaten strikes in 2011 due to their benefits being cut. This is because they still have jobs.

Do you need these parasites? No. You bet the entire economy on keeping their jobs, along with preserving the investments of parasite landlords.

Today, you effectively nationalised the entire property market via NAMA. Your idea. This is a 100% Irish idea. This means that huge amounts of property are being held back from the market, to artificially support prices. People are talking about knocking down houses rather than letting people have them cheaply.

##So either pay what you owe, or fuck off and let the market decide what they will offer you for your gombeen notions of what property is really worth!""

I personally am glad the ECB never said anything like that. Would be so rude.

Here is the thing. It is 2012. Ireland: are you Greece, or are you going to surpass parochial corrupt politics?

First it should be noted that vaccines are not equal.

Let me do a quick recap, a vaccine is biological preparation which aims at giving the immune system a head start if it comes into contact with the disease. There are different types of vaccines with their own characteristics (refer to the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine) for details) and differences in manufacturing can exist from a batch to another.

There's a lot that can go wrong with making vaccine and it happens that a vaccine or a batch of vaccine can actually infect with the disease it's supposed to protect from and the big pharmaceutical corporations have a tendencies to ship those vaccines to Africa.

Starting at the beginning of the human vaccination history we find Louis Pasteur and his rabies vaccine and the famous case of the young Joseph Meister, a young boy who was bitten by a dog and subsequently ""saved"" by Pasteur and his experimental rabies vaccine. Except there's only a 15% chance of getting rabis from a bite and there's no proof the dog had rabies in the first place (it is said to have rabies because he had straw, hay and pieces of wood in its stomach) which makes the whole thing controversial. Even more when we factor in the fact that there was 2 others before Joseph Meister, a guy named Girard who turned out to not have rabies and an 11 year girl who died the next day.

So when we look closely at one of the most famous case of vaccination, we discover it's dubious at best and cover-up attempts to hide the failures. This doesn't mean vaccination doesn't work, history shows the contrary but it certainly makes it look bad which is enough to make people wary.

Closer to us, about 30 or 40 years ago, In Europe, there's been several cases of children dying after being vaccinated at schools which lead to a coalition of concerned medical practitioners and parents taking an anti-vaccination stance or more exactly a call for a reasoned use of vaccination, while the official stance was that some collateral was to be expected, that a few might endure complications for the whole to enjoy disease protection. Which exactly what you should not say to parent whose child has just died due to complications.

Then there is the theory that HIV comes from oral polio vaccines made from monkey livers infected with SIV or OPV AIDS hypothesis, which though refuted also made people wary.

Then there is thehepatitis vaccination in France that gave people permanent autoimmune disease and neurological afflication ([source](http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Hepatitis-B/francesuspends.aspx)).

As you can see, there's no shortage of horror stories about vaccines in history, from side effects worse than the disease to human error to pharmaceutical corporation ~~being evil~~ doing business as usual. But on the other side, vaccination has been proven efficient and helpful without the shadow of a doubt 

The thing is we cannot generalize, some vaccines are more risky than others, more or less efficient than others, more helpful/needed than others. So better be careful and informed to stay clear from an unnecessary vaccine that works so-so and has side-effects.  Better than being ignorant and thin ""vaccines give autism"".",t3_qctmv,madpedro,,0,False,

[George Washington, to Tench Tighman, March 24, 1784, when asked what type of workman to get for Mount Vernon, from The Washington papers edited by Saul Padover]


To give opinions unsupported by reasons might appear dogmatical. [George Washington, to Alexander Spotswood, November 22, 1798, from The Washington papers edited by Saul Padover]


...I beg you be persuaded that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution. [George Washington, to United Baptists Churches of Virginia, May, 1789 from The Washington papers edited by Saul Padover]


As the contempt of the religion of a country by ridiculing any of its ceremonies, or affronting its ministers or votaries, has ever been deeply resented, you are to be particularly careful to restrain every officer from such imprudence and folly, and to punish every instance of it. On the other hand, as far as lies in your power, you are to protect and support the free exercise of religion of the country, and the undisturbed enjoyment of the rights of conscience in religious matters, with your utmost influence and authority. [George Washington, to Benedict Arnold, September 14, 1775 from The Washington papers edited by Saul Padover]


The blessed Religion revealed in the word of God will remain an eternal and awful monument to prove that the best Institutions may be abused by human depravity; and that they may even, in some instances, be made subservient to the vilest of purpose",t3_qdodl,Switch187u,,0,False,

The question before the human race is, whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws, or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles?
-- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, June 20, 1815

The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of governments erected on the simple principles of nature; and if men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their history. Although the detail of the formation of the American governments is at present little known or regarded either in Europe or in America, it may hereafter become an object of curiosity. It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had interviews with the gods, or were in any degree under the influence of Heaven, more than those at work upon ships or houses, or laboring in merchandise or agriculture; it will forever be acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses.
-- John Adams, ""A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America"" (1787-88), from Adrienne Koch, ed, The American Enlightenment: The Shaping of the American Experiment and a Free Society (1965) p. 258, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, ""Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church""

Thirteen governments [of the original states] thus founded on the natural authority of the people alone, without a pretence of miracle or mystery, and which are destined to spread over the northern part of that whole quarter of the globe, are a great point gained in favor of the rights of mankind.
-- John Adams, ""A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America"" (1787-88), from Adrienne Koch, ed, The American Enlightenment: The Shaping of the American Experiment and a Free Society (1965) p. 258, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, ""Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church""

We should begin by setting conscience free. When all men of all religions ... shall enjoy equal liberty, property, and an equal chance for honors and power ... we may expect that improvements will be made in the human character and the state of society.
-- John Adams, letter to Dr. Price, April 8, 1785, quoted from Albert Menendez and Edd Doerr, The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom (1991)

As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a revelation. But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed?
-- John Adams, letter to FA Van der Kamp, December 27, 1816

The frightful engines of ecclesiastical councils, of diabolical malice, and Calvinistical good-nature never failed to terrify me exceedingly whenever I thought of preaching.
-- John Adams, letter to his brother-in-law, Richard Cranch, October 18, 1756, explaining why he rejected the ministry

I shall have liberty to think for myself without molesting others or being molested myself.
-- John Adams, letter to his brother-in-law, Richard Cranch, August 29, 1756, explaining how his independent opinions would create much difficulty in the ministry, in Edwin S Gaustad, Faith of Our Fathers: Religion and the New Nation (1987) p. 88, quoted from Ed and Michael Buckner, ""Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church""

When philosophic reason is clear and certain by intuition or necessary induction, no subsequent revelation supported by prophecies or miracles can supersede it.
-- John Adams, from Rufus K Noyes, Views of Religion, quoted from from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

Indeed, Mr. Jefferson, what could be invented to debase the ancient Christianism which Greeks, Romans, Hebrews and Christian factions, above all the Catholics, have not fraudulently imposed upon the public? Miracles after miracles have rolled down in torrents.
-- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, December 3, 1813, quoted from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

Cabalistic Christianity, which is Catholic Christianity, and which has prevailed for 1,500 years, has received a mortal wound, of which the monster must finally die. Yet so strong is his constitution, that he may endure for centuries before he expires.
-- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, July 16, 1814, from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

I do not like the reappearance of the Jesuits.... Shall we not have regular swarms of them here, in as many disguises as only a king of the gipsies can assume, dressed as printers, publishers, writers and schoolmasters? If ever there was a body of men who merited damnation on earth and in Hell, it is this society of Loyola's. Nevertheless, we are compelled by our system of religious toleration to offer them an asylum.
-- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 5, 1816

Let the human mind loose. It must be loose. It will be loose. Superstition and dogmatism cannot confine it.
-- John Adams, letter to his son, John Quincy Adams, November 13, 1816, from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

Can a free government possibly exist with the Roman Catholic religion?
-- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, May 19, 1821, from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved -- the Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!
-- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, from George Seldes, The Great Quotations, also from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

The priesthood have, in all ancient nations, nearly monopolized learning.... And, even since the Reformation, when or where has existed a Protestant or dissenting sect who would tolerate A FREE INQUIRY? The blackest billingsgate, the most ungentlemanly insolence, the most yahooish brutality is patiently endured, countenanced, propagated, and applauded. But touch a solemn truth in collision with a dogma of a sect, though capable of the clearest proof, and you will soon find you have disturbed a nest, and the hornets will swarm about your legs and hands, and fly into your face and eyes.
-- John Adams, letter to John Taylor, 1814, quoted in Norman Cousins, In God We Trust: The Religious Beliefs and Ideas of the American Founding Fathers (1958), p. 108, quoted from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

The Church of Rome has made it an article of faith that no man can be saved out of their church, and all other religious sects approach this dreadful opinion in proportion to their ignorance, and the influence of ignorant or wicked priests.
-- John Adams, Diary and Autobiography

What havoc has been made of books through every century of the Christian era? Where are fifty gospels condemned as spurious by the bull of Pope Gelasius? Where are forty wagon-loads of Hebrew manuscripts burned in France, by order of another pope, because of suspected heresy? Remember the Index Expurgato-rius, the Inquisition, the stake, the axe, the halter, and the guillotine; and, oh! horrible, the rack! This is as bad, if not worse, than a slow fire. Nor should the Lion's Mouth be forgotten. Have you considered that system of holy lies and pious frauds that has raged and triumphed for 1,500 years.
-- John Adams, letter to John Taylor, 1814, quoted by Norman Cousins in In God We Trust: The Religious Beliefs and Ideas of the American Founding Fathers (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1958), p. 106-7, from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

God is an essence that we know nothing of. Until this awful blasphemy is got rid of, there never will be any liberal science in the world.
-- John Adams, ""this awful blashpemy"" that he refers to is the myth of the Incarnation of Christ, from Ira D Cardiff, What Great Men Think of Religion, quoted from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief

Numberless have been the systems of iniquity The most refined, sublime, extensive, and astonishing constitution of policy that ever was conceived by the mind of man was framed by the Romish clergy for the aggrandizement of their own Order They even persuaded mankind to believe, faithfully and undoubtingly, that God Almighty had entrusted them with the keys of heaven, whose gates they might open and close at pleasure ... with authority to license all sorts of sins and Crimes ... or withholding the rain of heaven and the beams of the sun; with the management of earthquakes, pestilence, and famine; nay, with the mysterious, awful, incomprehensible power of creating out of bread and wine the flesh and blood of God himself. All these opinions they were enabled to spread and rivet among the people by reducing their minds to a state of sordid ignorance and staring timidity, and by infusing into them a religious horror of letters and knowledge. Thus was human nature chained fast for ages in a cruel, shameful, and deplorable servitude....
     Of all the nonsense and delusion which had ever passed through the mind of man, none had ever been more extravagant than the notions of absolutions, indelible characters, uninterrupted successions, and the rest of those fantastical ideas, derived from the canon law, which had thrown such a glare of mystery, sanctity, reverence, and right reverend eminence and holiness around the idea of a priest as no mortal could deserve ... the ridiculous fancies of sanctified effluvia from episcopal fingers.

    I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any Church that I know of. My own mind is my own Church. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what one does not believe. It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    Priests and conjurors are of the same trade. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    Take away from Genesis the belief that Moses was the author, on which only the strange believe that it is the word of God has stood, and there remains nothing of Genesis but an anonymous book of stories, fables, and traditionary or invented absurdities, or of downright lies. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    The Bible is a book that has been read more and examined less than any book that ever existed. [The Theological Works of Thomas Paine]


    Every phrase and cirsumstance are marked with the barbarous hand of superstitious torture, and forced into meanings it was impossible they could have. The head of every chapter, and the top of every page, are blazoned with the names of Christ and the Church, that the unwary reader might suck in the error before he began to read.[Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, p.131]


    Accustom a people to believe that priests, or any other class of men can forgive sins, and you will have sins in abundance.[The Theological Works of Thomas Paine, p.207]


    The adulterous connection between church and state... [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    The declaration which says that God visits the sins of the fathers upon the children is contrary to every principle of moral justice. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistant that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    ..but the Bible is such a book of lies and contradictions there is no knowing which part to believe or whether any... [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    The NT, compared with the Old, is like a farce of one act... [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    That God cannot lie, is no advantage to your argument, because it is no proof that priests can not, or that the Bible does not. [The Life and Works of Thomas Paine, Vol. 9 p. 134]


    ..we must be compelled to hold this doctrine to be false, and the old and new law called the Old and New Testament, to be impositions, fables and forgeries. [The Life and Works of Thomas Paine, Vol. 9 p. 282]


    There are matters in the Bible, said to be done by the express commandment of God, that are shocking to humanity and to every idea we have of moral justice..... [Thomas Paine]


    Revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication-- after that it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him; and though he may find himself obliged to believe it, it can not be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner; for it was not a revelation made to ME, and I have only his word for it that it was made to him. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    The story of the whale swallowing Jonah, though a whale is large enough to do it, borders greatly on the marvelous; but it would have approached nearer to the idea of a miracle if Jonah had swallowed the whale. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is no more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifiying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory to itself than this thing called Christianity. Too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too inconsistent for practice, t renders the heart torpid or produces only atheists or fanatics. As an engine of power, it serves the purpose of despotism, and as ameans of wealth, the avarice of priests, but so far as respects the good of man in general it leads to nothing here or hereafter. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    As to the book called the bible, it is blasphemy to call it the Word of God. It is a book of lies and contradictions and a history of bad times and bad men. [Thomas Paine, writing to Andrew Dean August 15, 1806]


    It is far better that we admitted a thousand devils to roam at large than that we permitted one such imposter and monster as Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and the Bible prophets, to come with the pretended word of God and have credit among us.


    The continually progressive change to which the meaning of words is subject, the want of a universal language which renders translation necessary, the errors to which translations are again subject, the mistakes of copyists and printers, together with the possibility of willful alteration, are of themselves evidences that the human language, whether in speech or in print, cannot be the vehicle of the Word of God. The Word of God exists in something else. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    It will be proper to take a review of the several sources from which governments have arisen, and on which they have been founded.


    They may be all comprehended under three heads -- 1st, Superstition; 2d, Power; 3d, the common interests of society, and the common rights of man.


    The first was a government of priestcraft, the second of conquerors, and the third of reason. [Thomas Paine, The Rights of Man]


    Toleration is not the opposite of intoleration, but it is the counterfeit of it. Both are despotisms. The one assumes to itself the right of withholding liberty of conscience, and the other of granting it. The one is the pope, armed with fire and fagot, and the other is the pope selling or granting indulgences. [Thomas Paine, The Rights of Man]


    ...Thomas did not believe the resurrection [John 20:25], and, as they say, would not believe without having ocular and manual demonstration himself. So neither will I, and the reason is equally as good for me, and for every other person, as for Thomas. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    What is it the Bible teaches us? - raping, cruelty, and murder. What is it the New Testament teaches us? - to believe that the Almighty committed debauchery with a woman engaged to be married, and the belief of this debauchery is called faith.


    When I see throughout this book, called the Bible, a history of the grossest vices and a collection of the most paltry and contemptible tales and stories, I could not so dishonor my Creator by calling it by His name. [Thomas Paine, in Toward The Mystery]


    Belief in a cruel God makes a cruel man.


    As to the book called the Bible, it is blasphemy to call it the Word of God. It is a book of lies and contradictions, and a history of bad times and bad men. There are but a few good characters in the whole book. [Thomas Paine, Letter to William Duane, April 23, 1806]


    His [Jesus'] historians, having brought him into the world in a supernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in the same manner, or the first part of the story must have fallen to the ground.


    The most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. It has been the most destructive to the peace of man since man began to exist. Among the most detestable villains in history, you could not find one worse than Moses, who gave an order to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers and then rape the daughters. One of the most horrible atrocities found in the literature of any nation. I would not dishonor my Creator's name by attaching it to this filthy book. [Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason]


    My country is the world, and my religion is to do good.


    Whence arose all the horrid assassinations of whole nations of men, women, and infants, with which the Bible is filled; and the bloody persecutions, and tortures unto death, and religiosu wars, that since that time have laid Europe in blood and ashes; whence arose they, but from this impious thing called religion, and this monstrous belief that God has spoken to man? [Thomas Paine, quoted in 2000 Years of Disbelief, Famous People with the Courage to Doubt by James Haught]


    The age of ignorance commenced with the Christian system. [Thomas Paine, quoted in 2000 Years of Disbelief, Famous People with the Courage to Doubt by James Haught]


    Prophesying is lying professionally. [Thomas Paine, quoted in 2000 Years of Disbelief, Famous People with the Courage to Doubt by James Haught]


    If thou trusteth to the book called the Scriptures, thou trusteth to the rotten staff of fables and of falsehood. [Thomas Paine, quoted in 2000 Years of Disbelief, Famous People with the Courage to Doubt by James Haught]

&gt;there's an American who thinks Martin Luther is that black guy who had a dream.

This is all first year argumentation, but at least you got your google on.

But you are still just wrong. America was indeed founded on a legal and political system taken from British common law, which is very Biblical in orientation, and comes right from the bowels of the Anglican Church. You would be hard pressed to find any western or european country existing today that does not have hard and fast roots in some degree of christianity dating back to 1000 AD or so. The very ideas of freedom of religion are actually from the New Testament, see;  Jesus did not come to force people to follow him.

BTW, I am not speaking as a Christian here, but a historian, and a degreed scholar of antiquities of all religions. Notice at no point did I ever argue against separation of church and state because they are 2 completely different arguments. America was founded by Christians, yes indeed. 

That doesn't mean the founding fathers wanted theocracy - they knew from the persecution of the Anglican Church in Britain that separation of Church and State was a pivotal factor in establishing a strong democracy.
 But that is not the argument you presented now is it?

or do you think one cannot be a Christian and still argue for the importance of separation of church and state? You assumed because I do not support gay marriage that this was the case, but you were completely driven by your own argument and overlooked my real position completely in your mission to prove the common redditor viewpoint and assumption about anyone who professes Christianity.  Your own prejudice, in fact, blinded you.

You do not get to rewrite the history of my country, as that would define you as merely a historical revisionist of convenience...and that is the very crime you accuse me of.

And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.  And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.  Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah . But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.""

&gt;2:216 ""Fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not.""

&gt;2:224 ""Then fight in the cause of God and know that God heareth and knoweth all things.""

&gt;3:157-158 ""And if ye are slain or die in the way of God, forgiveness and mercy from God are far better than all they could amass. And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! It is unto God that ye are brought together.""

&gt;3:169 ""Think not of those who are slain in God's way as dead. Nay, they live finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord.""

&gt;3:195 ""... Those who have ... fought or been slain, verily I will blot out from them their iniquities and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath; a reward from the presence of God ...""

&gt;4:101 ""... For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies.""

&gt;4:74, 75 ""Let those fight in the cause of God who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of God whether he is slain or gets victory, soon shall we give him a reward of great (value). Those who believe fight in the cause of God and those who reject faith fight in the cause of evil, so fight ye against the friends of Satan, feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan.""

&gt;4:89 ""They but wish that ye should reject faith as they do, and thus be on the same footing as they. But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of God. But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them…""

&gt;4:95 ""Not equal are those believers who sit at (at home) and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than those who sit (at home).

&gt;5:36 ""The punishment of those who wage war against God and His apostle and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land. That is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.""

&gt;5:54 ""O ye who believe. Take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors. They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily God guideth not a people unjust.""

&gt;8:12-17 ""Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): ""I am with you. Give firmness to the believers. I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers. Smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips off them. This because they contend against God and his apostle. If any contend against God and his apostle, God is strict in punishment ... O ye who believe. When ye meet the unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them. If any do turn his back to them on such a day, unless it be a stratagem of war ... he draws on himself the wrath of God and his abode is Hell, an evil refuge (indeed).""

&gt;8:59-60 ""Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better (of the godly). They will never frustrate (them). Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of God and your enemies and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom God doth know ...""

&gt;8:65 ""O apostle! Rouse the believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred. If a hundred they will vanquish a thousand of the unbelievers, for these are a people without understanding.""

&gt;9:5 ""... fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war) ...""

&gt;9:14 ""Fight them, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame ...""

&gt;9:29 ""Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God and his apostle nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth (even if they are) of the people of the Book, until they pay the Jizya [religious tax] with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.""

&gt;47:4 ""Therefore, when ye meet the unbelievers, smite at their necks, at length when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them) ... but if it had been God's will, he could certainly have exacted retribution from them (himself), but (he lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the way of God, he will never let their deeds be lost.""

&gt;61:4 ""Truly God loves those who fight in His cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure.""

Seriously, there's tons of it.  And if you're to be a devout follower of any religion, you must adhere to everything in your holy book.  Jews and Christians are guilty of this as well (look at the Pentateuch and the crusades), but don't act like it's bad for them but ok for Muslims.  The argument that ""Oh, it's in the context of the war against the polytheists in Mecca etc."" can be used in the Pentateuch, just replacing the location.  As for your ""sucker punch"" analogy, see the Islamic caliphates from mid 600AD to the 12th century, followed by the Turks and the Ottomans.  Things were not so rosy in the Middle East, where most of the damage was due to the wars between Sunni and Shiite.   The only thing Christian Europe did was the mostly unsuccessful crusades that shifted the power from the Byzantines to the Seljuk Turks.  The Jews never even engaged in meaningful combat with Muslims.

As for the civilian argument, well, the Koran says it best.

&gt;""Sa’b b. Jaththama has narrated that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) asked: What about the children of polytheists killed by the cavalry during the night raid? He said: They are from them.""

It's liberalizing not only in Europe, but where Catholicism is growing and thriving (Africa and Latin America). The Catholic Church's structure, though rigid in Rome, is pretty loose everywhere else. For every homophobic priest, there's dozens in Boston, Buenos Aires, NYC and San Francisco (before all the Prop 8 stuff) who are willing to marry gay couples. Plus a lot of priests follow the ""faith will find it's own way"" logic of acceptance of Atheism. 

Just because Miss America says something, doesn't mean that's a litmus for the rest of the country or Catholics in general. It's a beauty pageant, not a tribunal on the future of parochial education. 

Thing is, the Catholic Church isn't a fast institution. It never has been. For anything to actually get through the Church, it has to be studied and considered over decades. It's why it feels archaic in this society. It's too slow for a give-me-now populace. (Which explains also the low views of a Congress made to be slow and clunky but that's another discussion.)

Honestly the other factor is that minorities play a huge roll in this. Latinos are the fastest growing population in this country, and many of them are pro-Catholic and very pro-science. Science is shown as a sign of progress in much of Latin America and of wealth. It is also taught hand in hand with religion as something to help explain God and the metaphors taught fit how evolution and the big bang worked and so forth.

At least in Europe there was a pretty strong division between sacred and secular music, and we more or less know what sacred music sounded like even back to before 1000 CE. 

If you're asking about folk music though, generally we guess based on the instruments and various treatises, and also written music that was meant to evoke that style. There are also some records of troubadour/trouvere songs, and many secular motets that would have been performed in court. Once the lute became popular, there were a lot of books of lute music floating around, but that was definitely considered an upper-class instrument.

 If you're interested in Renaissance/Baroque instrumental music, an interesting place to start would be this short series:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Early-Musical-Instruments-David-Munrow/dp/B001R4GYE4

which also has some delightful BBC style humor. Maybe a library nearby would have it?

We don't really have that much accurately notated or recorded folk music until upper class people started to get interested in that sort of thing in the Romantic Period. Until the late medieval period, we didn't even have very good music notation, and people would learn folksongs by ear anyway, much as they do today.

Of course this is all assuming you're talking about Europe.

Anyway if you have a specific style in mind I can give you a better answer.

You also have to note that Hitler had an admiration for the Roman Empire, incorporating many of its cultural idiosyncrasies into the Third Reich. 

Similar to the Nazis, Imperial Japan also had ideas of 'racial purity' in the form of the 'Nippon' - that the Japanese were the 'superior Asians' of the region. Given the Japanese were so far removed from German interests I doubt they were of much concern to Hitler. In fact, even Hitler would have recognised that it would have been ridiculous to preclude an alliance with the Japanese, who could be useful in any fight against the US, on the grounds of race.

Although the Government has said that its intention is to “reinforce” the overarching duty to promote a comprehensive health service,8 the creation of bodies that are independent of the Secretary of State for Health to support a lesser duty fundamentally affects the minister's duty. This is because the test of whether the Secretary of State is discharging his or her duty to promote a comprehensive health service will no longer depend on whether a comprehensive service is actually provided.
As well as transferring powers from the Secretary of State to other bodies, the Bill leaves each CCG free to choose the patients for whom they have responsibility. Unlike PCTs, CCGs will not be responsible for all residents within contiguous geographical areas. CCGs select patients, initially assembling their patient populations on the basis of general practitioners' (GPs) lists; they will not have to cover everyone in a geographical area but only “persons for whom it [the CCG] has responsibility”. Nor will they be required to arrange for the provision of all the services that are currently part of the comprehensive health system. For example, accident and emergency services are not an explicit CCG responsibility under these proposals. Only a new category “of services or facilities for emergency care” will have to be provided for people in a CCG's area, which need not consist of adjoining or indeed whole electoral districts, as is the case with PCTs.
Another organisation, known as Monitor and with the functions of a regulator, is independent of the Secretary of State for Health, and will have oversight of providers (public and private) in the new system. However, it will not have a duty to promote a comprehensive service—a crucial consideration given that its decisions about the extent of competition will affect the financial viability of local services. In a parallel move, NHS hospitals that currently get most of their funding from NHS sources will be free to obtain almost half their income from private patients.
Although there are provisions in the Bill giving the Secretary of State for Health power to regulate the new system through secondary rather than primary legislation, that power is limited by a new clause (Clause 4), under which the minister has a duty to observe the autonomy of commissioners and providers. The autonomy clause means that commercial providers can bring legal challenges against a minister who chooses to curtail their discretion. Furthermore, the adoption of compulsory market competition will bring more NHS activity under the jurisdiction of EU competition law. Competition law is designed to limit government powers of intervention and will provide a further check on secondary regulation.
These changes will have substantial legal consequences. First, the duty to provide a national health service throughout England would be lost if the Bill became law.9 It would be replaced by a duty on an unknown number of CCGs, not GPs, to arrange provision as they see fit for various sections of the population for which they are separately responsible. Second, CCGs would not be bound by the “duty to continue to promote a comprehensive free health service” when exercising their functions. Under present law, according to a judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Secretary of State “has the duty to continue to promote a comprehensive free health service and he must never, in making a decision [about services provided], disregard that duty”.10 Third, the Secretary of State's accountability to Parliament for the provision of services to patients in the new NHS will be diminished.4, 11
At the same time, a new parallel system of public health services will be established at the local level. Under this system, the provision of a range of public health services will be assigned to local authorities, including immunisation, screening, mental health, dental health, children's services, sexual health, drug and alcohol services, and health protection programmes.

Furthermore, the loss of area-based population responsibilities has serious implications for the stability and accuracy of measurement of needs and equity of resource allocation and service provision. Loss of geographical population data and area-based structures and responsibilities will impair, or take away altogether, the capacity to plan health services by monitoring needs, access, service use, and health outcomes.
The Government has not disclosed the radical nature of this reform. The Leader of the House of Lords, Earl Howe, told the Lords that the Bill reinforces and does not “dilute the Secretary of State's overarching duty…Let me be clear: the Bill's provisions would in no way dilute the Secretary of State's overarching duty. Indeed, they are intended further to reinforce the promotion of a comprehensive health service rather than to undermine it.”7 Legal analysis of the Bill shows this is not the case. Recent amendments raised for consideration in a letter of Jan 12, 2012, from Earl Howe to Peers do not substantially change the situation.7
In the USA, opposition to health reforms under both the Clinton and Obama administrations is articulated as erosion of personal freedom by increasing government powers.13 Conversely, pro-market reforms of universal health systems in Europe are often justified on the grounds that they increase personal freedom by transferring powers from government to non-governmental or commercial bodies and by increasing choice. Citizens' rights in democracies are underpinned not just by limitations on government powers but also by legal duties imposed on governments, such as those that guarantee citizens access to health care. The Bill would withdraw this legal underpinning.14 As the Bill enters its final critical stages it is crucial that Peers observe three red lines for the NHS (panel)15 and are fully aware of the key parts of the legislation that would abolish core NHS functions, if they are to safeguard the NHS for future generations.
Panel
Red lines to protect the NHS
The Secretary of State must have the duty to secure provision of comprehensive and equitable health care for the whole of the population of England, taking action whenever there are problems.
CCGs, operating on behalf of the Secretary of State, must make sure that comprehensive and equitable health care is available for everyone and be responsible for all residents living in single geographically defined areas that are contiguous, without being able to pick and choose patients.
Nothing must be done that undermines the ability of the Secretary of State to fulfil the duty to secure provision of comprehensive and equitable health care, by bringing more of the NHS within the scope of EU competition law so that, in particular:
There must be no increase in the commercial contracting of health services;
The current authorisation system for central regulation of Foundation Trusts must be retained;
Statutory functions of CCGs must be carried out by NHS staff, with CCG finances being used solely for the benefit of patients;
Statutory and enforceable codes of conduct must be laid down for all NHS bodies, underpinned by sanctions that are rigorously policed;
Information about commercial contracting, including the planning, procurement, financing, and monitoring, must be available as a matter of course.
CCGs=Clinical Commissioning Groups.

Man lives from the frozen tundra to the Amazon forest, where ""average"" temperature differences are 10 degrees different or more.  

Our ""modern form"" may be 200,000 years old, but we're one single species, and temperature alone did not drive our evolution.  Our immediate precursors (Homo Erectus, etc) were on the planet 2.5 million years ago, and homo sapiens 500,000 years ago.  

If you look back, however, 3 million years ago, five million years ago, 8 million years ago, evolution was heading this way, from basic primates to bipedal apes.  It didn't take cold weather in the last 500,000 years to transform early proto-mammals in to humans.

We we talk about losing the big mammals, it wasn't warmth that killed them off. 

We we look at what climate scientists predict for a doubling of CO2, 3.3 degrees rise for the whole planet, it's scary.  I don't want the whole planet to rise by 3.3 degrees in the next 90 years either. That would be too much temperature, way too fast.

I don't believe that they are right to assume that the ""normal"" temperature of the planet is 0.8 degrees below where we are now.  My point in saying that we've been warmer is just that - for extended periods of time, we have been warmer.  In the early part of the holocene, say 8,000 years ago, we were a good bit warmer than today for a thousand years or more.  A few thousand years before that, we were 8 degrees cooler.

Our natural fluctuation is on the order of 10 times what the IPCC claims we've caused.  They are claiming that ""additional feedbacks"" will amplify CO2's forcings by more than 100%, resulting in this huge, terrifying rise in temperature.

They might be right.  It could happen, I suppose.  When I look back at the temperature fluctuations in the last 20,000 years, however, I see that CO2 changes after temperature, not before.   The Earth's temperature has fluctuated by a degree or more around some median temperature for the entire holocene, with spikes that we call Climactic Optimums and low points like the Little Ice Age.  We have well known terms for these periods - not be cause we made them up, but because they were observed.

If the Climate Scientists are now right, and water vapor, methane, albedo, and other feedbacks on top of the CO2 forcing are going to run the temperature up to over 290.3K (from our baseline of 287K), then we're in trouble.  If the feedbacks have been overstated, and part of the current observed rise have been natural, then maybe we're only looking at a maximum of 288.6K or something.  That wouldn't be so bad.  

My approach has always been one of acceptance of positive behavior.  If you feel that you need to do something to prevent the world from getting warmer, feel free to do it.  What most people seem to want to do is to make *other people* change their ways.  The UN seems to want to shift the economy of the world from the West to anywhere other than the West.  They seem to want Asia (China and India) and Africa to be the model for the rest of the world.  

They have an economic solution looking for a scientific problem to solve.  They've run this same solution up the flag pole for decades, using the ""population crisis,"" peak oil, the water shortage, food scarcity, and a number of other world-ending disasters to justify implementing this same solution.

I'm all for real solutions to real problems.  I'm not so excited about ""bankrupt the West because they are rich and we are not.""

If CO2 increases driving a world altering temperature were really the problem, the solution would be to cap the entire world's CO2 emissions where they are today. Each country would be told ""do not, for any reason, allow your emissions to climb.""  Reductions in high countries would be called for, as they are now, but ""emerging economies"" would need to use purely low carbon solutions.

What we are actually seeing is something different. We are actually seeing ""West!  You must cut your production back 80% while third world countries catch up economically.""  How is that a viable solution?
China is now the worlds #1 emitter of CO2.  The US is NOT the highest per capita emitter.  In fact, the US has reduced CO2 emissions from nearly 20 T per person to around 17 T per person, while at the same time China has risen to higher than many European nations.  Those numbers are from 2009.  Who knows how much China will emit in 2012. We know they've been growing rapidly, while the US and Europe have been declining.

But, even given that we're headed lower and they are headed higher, all fingers are pointed at the US. We're the bad guys. We've got to change our ways, or the world will suffer.

First, almost 99.999% of the time have an escape spell. If you take teleport, the other spell better be flash(maybe ghost depending on the champ and your playstyle but flash is always safe) The ONLY exception I can think of to this rule is shaco because he has a built in blink.


When things like that happen where malphite is in your lane and fiora is too, you need to play extra cautious. Lots of tanky champs have good damage in the early game where your resistances aren't built up through levels and items yet. Especially vs a champ like malphite that can instantly jump to you and knock you up, you should play extremely safe. Knowing the champs and what they can do is important here. What you should do is let your team know ""hey, the jungler is up here"". That relieves pressure on all other lanes as long as he is there. You just play safe and if you have to miss CS to stay alive, do it. It hurts her the longer he stays because he saps xp and you gain a level advantage over her.


In ranked, you should definitely be able to play 2 champs in each role comfortable(top, mid, jungle, ad carry, support). Playing yorick a lot is fine but knowing how to play other champs is a good thing. Try out every champ in free week to get a feel for how they work. This helps you a lot when playing against the champ. You don't have to stop playing yorick. He is a great champ and good for grinding elo.


Not all guides are just how the pros play the champ. Not every pro gives away every tip and trick about the champion. A lot are actually written to teach others how to play whatever champion. Some can be good to follow word for word but the most important thing about guides is to understand that there's almost never a one size fits all build for a champion. Builds are always dependent on the current state of the match(who is fed, how many ad/ap, how much cc, ect.). Also consider that there are different playstyles and often not one best way to play a champ. See riven in north america and she'll have bloodthirsters and a guardians angel. Watch an eu stream and she'll have a frozen mallet. 


About teleport: it's not just used for plays. Sometimes you have to back sooner than expected. With teleport, you can back and buy that important item and a ward and get back to lane quickly without missing any cs. You don't just have to use it to make plays.


In the nasus game, you should try to always keep it warded. As for the akali problem, you often should check the map and see who is mia. Don't expect people to be fast with their mia's at 900 elo. Keep your lane warded and try to know where everybody is and isn't. In a 3v1 situation like that, back off. It's better to lose the turret than to lose the turret and give the enemy team 1 kill + 2 assists. Knowing when to back off is another very important skill. Sometimes the turret will go down whether you are there or not.


As for the lane pushing question. Generally, you should try to push your lane out before you back. The logic behind this is that the turret kills minions a lot faster than other minions do. Wards can and WILL save your life so buy them all the time. Buy 2 at a time so you can stay up top longer if possible. Push the lane out and go buy a ward. If the lane is pushed, go buy a ward. You just don't have to do the pushing part. Missing 2-3 cs is worth having that vision on the map. Missing 3 cs is worth you being alive.


One thing you should definitely learn is lane control and how to freeze the lane. If your lane is pushing, what you should try to do is reset(if it's safe to push because the jungler is visible at the bottom of the map or dead) the lane. You can do this by killing the next creep wave before your wave dies and let them die to their turret. This will allow the next creep waves to meet up in the middle. Another thing to do is freeze the lane at your turret. This involves tanking the minions right before your turret range so that the enemy champ is easily ganked. There was a video of this buy a british guy(if anybody can find the lane freezing video could you post it here? please and thank you :).

 I know it's an odd thing to try and get across, but this quote just seems poorly thought out to me. Maybe it was just really offhand though.

**Edit:** Ah! Validation! Turns out the original quote was said quite differently. Updating it to modern speech corrupted it and was probably why I had such an issue with it. 

**This was by Funbelow on wikianswers:**

That's not quite what he actually said. It was, rather:

""All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Buonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.

""At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.""

Hey there, Polish born Canadian here.  On my last vacation I was on a 5 week long backpacking trip through New Zealand.  My experiences make me think that you are onto something.

I stayed in hostels in NZ and ran into a lot of different travellers.  Most of them turned out to be German.  Most of the other people I ran into were representatives from other European countries, NZ itself, and Canada..  There were only a couple Americans.

I got the distinct sense that German youths are encouraged to travel the world when they are in their 20s.  It's like the national psyche of the country is to send them out into the world and let them have unique experiences that they can then bring back to the country.  I got a similar sense from other European travelers, but there were just so many Germans there that I think it's encouraged there even more.  These people had the money and time off to travel and they were mostly in their early 20s.  They were not the ""1%"", they were regular college folk.

So yeah, it seems like a lot of European cultures have this exploration gene - and the idea that it's an important part of growing up.  In Canada this doesn't happen as often, but I've ran into way more Canadian backpackers on my travels than Americans..

It's a shame!  Travelling and experiencing other cultures gives you such amazing insights about the world, not to mention context.  It really affects you for the rest of your life and puts a more balanced head on your shoulders.

I live in Canada and I know I'm lucky to have 4 weeks off a year, not including holidays.  I'm not sure what the national standard is, but everyone I know who has a job has at least 2-3 weeks off..

Temp jobs are different, but that's to be expected because most temporary employees have a 0-hour contract. Year contracts as well, but your boss has to tell you two weeks in advance if they're not extending your contract or giving you a permanent contract, so you will have time to look for another job.

Every Spring everyone has to report their planned vacations so that a calendar of ""who is actually here"" can be made because it is so much smaller than the ""who is on vacation"" version. I get six weeks off a year, but take about two or three because of my American guilt. Mid-July, they don't even bother turning the lights on in the hallways. I go a little stir-crazy, actually, because it is really hard to work when absolutely everyone else is on vacation. My colleagues take three to five weeks off in the summer, another two in December, and usually at least one of the grammar school holidays if they have kids. The law says that you have to take two consecutive weeks off, but where I work they let the unused time roll over, so some old-timers saved up *years* of paid time off by taking only two weeks a year, and then ""retired"" early. 


Contrast that to when I worked in the US, where everyone worked 12 hours a day minimum, most worked at least one weekend day, and outside of Thanksgiving and Xmas, no one took time time off. We had nice benefits, but even so, a janitor I knew had to decide whether to take time off of work to have corrective shoulder surgery (from working his ass off at two jobs as a janitor and that would cost thousands in co-pays plus the unpaid medical leave) or power through it until his daughter finished school, at which point he would probably have permanently lost most of the use of his arm and be fired as a result. (But at least his daughter wouldn't have to drop out of college.)


A friend of mine here in Europe--also an American--was just diagnosed with cancer. Our first thought was ""shit, you're going to go bankrupt--cancer is expensive."" But then, no, wait, this is Europe where you won't pay a dime for your disease and your job will give you paid medical leave because it's not your fault that you got sick.


The crazy part is that I don't really notice a gap in productivity. People here work efficiently because they are well-rested and always looking forward to a nice vacation in Spain/Greece/Austria. And on top of that, they show up at 9 and leave at 5:30, like clockwork, and don't come in on weekends.
