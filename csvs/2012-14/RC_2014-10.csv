Mirena IUD's have the same medications as birth control pills but with lower doses from what I understand. Both forms of IUD's are used widely in Europe among females of childbearing age, so substantial information should be available in human samples. 

I like IUDs though with their near surgical sterilization rates of effectiveness, their effective maximum duration of five to ten years and which is practically idiot proof, and which is instantly reversible. In the case of the copper version, you could get pregnant immediately after removal. IUD's have the benefit of being the most effective, easily reversible, no-thought required form of birth control. Its biggest drawback is initial cost if you don't have health insurance.

There is the risk of course of uterine perforation, but given a skilled OB/GYN, I would expect the risk of this during insertion to be minimal. Your uterus can basically rip to shreds in VBAC, though it's a low risk, it is still a risk. Lots of things can screw you up, the question is the likelihood it will happen.

We defeated Al-Qaeda-In-Iraq by funding local Sunni militias to act against them. We stopped funding them, then the AQI offshoot, ISIS, comes around and says ""Hey, wanna be friends again?"" and off we are for round 2, except this time we're not funding anybody. We're ignoring the only thing that allows ISIS to exist, and that's the consent of the local majority Sunni populations. If they don't want them there, they essentially cannot exist there in the long run.

Now, while I'm sure most Sunnis in ISIS territories aren't fond of them, I doubt they dislike them so much as to go and risk their lives to resist them. If we want to actually make ISIS go away without sowing the seeds for another extremist organization to take its place, we have to make the local people feel like it's in their interests to go with us instead of ISIS. 

This is why I'm in favour of a very, very hands off approach to handling the situation. Funds and supply the fuck out of anti-ISIS groups on the ground. The big problem with Kurds wasn't the manpower, it was that they had shitty technology, not enough/inferior equipment that couldn't match ISIS in conventional warfare. 

Arm them, train them, and let them fight, because when we get right down to it, they're the only people that can actually fix the problem. We need to be funding and supporting local groups that are against ISIS and letting them do the job. Any intervention by us, like we're doing now with bombing campaigns, in all honesty reduces the legitimacy of the local people fighting ISIS, and it's painfully obvious from my view that we're not in this conflict for humanitarian reasons, we're in it to advance our interests. Otherwise we'd be doing things far, far more intelligently. 

We can't force people to hate extremism. We can encourage them to resist it. We can also, through our actions, radicalize them and drive them towards it. If we do the latter, we're only making things worse, and right now I believe we're doing the latter. 

And the same thing goes for many things to do with terrorism/extremism. 9/11 was blowback for our involvement in the Middle East - not just militarily, but economically and in other ways politically. That's not to say 9/11 was right, of course it wasn't right, it was a cowardly and disgusting crime. But it was blowback.

If we want to stop making ourselves targets of attacks, if we want to stop the Middle East becoming a breeding ground for never ending wars, we need to address the root problems, and those root problems are socioeconomic conditions which are, whether we want to admit it or not, traced straight back to us - not just the US, but Europeans as well.

Anyways here we go.... So I was backpacking around Europe and I ended up spending some time in the south of France ( I know... Not really back packing... But it was a nice to splurge on somewhere fancy) and this is bidet country. As a Canadian who was has never experienced this mythical bidet, I had always assumed they were just kinda like an attachment within the pre-existing toilet... Not the case, it's basically a toilet minus the seat and the water tank bit that is right fucking beside your normal toilet. Upon first entering the washroom in my hotel room, I thought it was two toilets... And I honestly wasn't that surprised, I mean the French have done more bizarre things. After closer examination I realized it was one of these so called bidets. 
I was so exited, because I had always wanted to try them and figured they were only something the richest of the rich had! So my first instinct was to turn it on. That was also my first mistake... Water went fucking everywhere, it was like a damn fire hose spraying all over the walls and floor and me and toilet.... After finally turning the sum bitch off and cleaning the walls with the bathroom floor mat, I took my shit, which was of an odd consistency due to the cheese and baguettes and wine and all those other things French people eat. 
So here we go! My big moment! So I hop over to this thing and realize I have no idea how to tackle it... Like no idea. So me an my shitty ass hobble around the washroom opening the cabinets looking for an instruction manual. No dice. So back at the bidet, I have questions running through my head, because this fucker is like a toilet with out the seat, so if I was to sit on it I would fall right in! Do I ghost sit it, like a dirty gas station shitter? Do I take my pants all the way off and kinda squat over it? Do I face forward or backward? Does the seat come off the normal toilet and somehow clip on to this toilet? Anyways, after trying numerous combinations and spraying water all over the god damned place. I realized my ass wasn't getting very clean. I mean water pressure alone isn't getting in my bum hole.... Was I supposed to just scrape it with my hand (was really hoping not to) or was I supposed to use some toilet paper anyways? So I got some soggy toilet paper and went to town... Getting more water on my clothes and hair and walls. After all this ordeal I just wiped my ass like a civilized human and went on with my day. The volume of water I used to not wipe my ass was enough to house a blue fucking whale, and I still killed a tree. Anyways, it was a highlight of my trip and if you ever have the chance to try it, do it! It's like Disney land, it's cool to visit and use every once and a while  but if you had one in your back yard it would suck. There would be so many fat kids in your yard and people throwing up and line ups and stuff.

It's mostly the U.K. to blame, as well as our own government at the time. But if it hadn't been for the EEC, New Zealand would be a vastly different place.

In 1960 New Zealand was the third wealthiest country in the world. Our population was barely two million, yet our strong agriculture sector sold lamb, butter and wool to the world. The country boasted high export earnings, generous public services and an egalitarian society, with low levels of inequality unheard of today. New Zealanders enjoyed stable jobs and unemployment was so low, that the Prime Minister boasted he knew the names of every single unemployed person.

This was all because of our close links to the ""mother country"". Britain was by far our largest trade partner, with exports to Britain over half of our total. New Zealand had very strong political links to Britain, in many ways we were part of Britain (much more so than Australia). The British had pillaged the native New Zealanders land, and in response New Zealand had sent thousands of troops to die in Europe's wars, at the request of Britain. 

After the war, New Zealand experienced a significant boom, but unfortunately this couldn't last forever. When Britain joined the EEC, they were swamped by the ""butter mountain"" and New Zealand's exports collapsed. We simply could  not compete with Europe's protectionist agricultural policies and the obscene subsidies. After years of backing Britain, New Zealand was well and truly fucked over. 

Our government at the time was useless, it failed to predict the calamity that would follow and responded with more protectionist trade barriers (e.g. margarine was only available with a prescription!). The economy chugged along, but we rapidly slipped in OECD rankings and accumulated huge amounts of debt. Some seriously stupid government policy at the time didn't help though.

Come 1984, we were on the bring of bankruptcy. A new notionally center-left government was elected and implement a Thatcherite revolution on steroids. ... Thing have only really improved in the last decade with the rise of China, although we still rank twenty-somthing in the OECD rankings, when we used to be in the top five.

Based on the surviving Nautilus, we determined that the animal starts out small in a tiny and grows out into the next chamber leaving the previous one empty it then uses that as a variable pressure buoyancy device, similar to a submarine.

Historically, they were thought to be petrified snakes and called snakestones.

[There's a lot of info here about ammonites.](http://www.palaeocast.com/episode-17-ammonoid-evolution-and-ecology/)

Most of England was under warm shallow sea water in the Jurassic, hence the large numbers of Plesiosaur fossils which have been found in the UK.  Sea levels were rising and where it had previously been low lying desert warm tropical seas emerged.

In fact the north sea and over to Europe is a consistent band of continental shelf, the current shape of the UK is very transitory in Geological scales.  The UK really is part of Europe.

You probably have sandstones/mudstones or limestones under your garden which were laid down during this period and contain fossils of ammonites and belemnites.

- Rave has been on fire, they stomped PR 2 - 0 and they ALMOST went into the i - League finals but because of the fact that the patch that they played was on 6.82 ( with the imbalances in gold graph) they lost to TongFu.OB even with a VERY farmed Templar Assasin. MVP is okay, but I just woudn't rate them as in the same tier as Rave is. Odds for me are about 75 - 25 especially since this is a BO3 and that Jeyo has been playing particularly well. Going BIG on them

Mith Trust vs. [Awake]

- Mith won against CSW last game, but tbh its more of CSW just not playing really well, MY god that Terrorblade was clowny as hell. Awake has been playing really well in this patch although they lost their game against insidious idol in a very close and entertaining game. Odds are about 50 - 50. I'd go for a value bet on Awake here. Going Medium

MksP vs [PKF]

- PKF destroyed nxl yesterday, and though they are not that good of a team, I saw that PKF had really good execution against them. Mksp is a tier 2 team in Korea, and they are not just the same team as the Mksp before even losing to tier 2 teams in Korea as well. This is a BO3 and I trust PKF to take this easily. Odds are around 70 -30 as well. Going big on PKF

Mith Trust vs. [Arrow]

- I'll go ahead and trust Arrow here, I just feel that the odds are really good to bet on them although this would be very risky. I just feel that Arrow is the more stable team between the two. Going Small

Zephyr vs. [Rave]

- Zephyr is just in a disarray, losing their games horribly and the team just doesn't have the same motivation as they had before, I could say that team morale is at the lowest for them, while Rave has been playing rather good despite losing to TongFu.OB. 70 - 30 odds are still favorable although this is a BO1 but it should be easy for Rave. Going Medium on them

Mith vs. [Rave] (d2wage)


- This match is for the MPGL Lan Finals, Rave posted on their fb page that they really want to win this ( Since this will be in the Philippines) and rightfully so, I think this would be fairly easy for them since this is a BO3 and the fact that they really wanna go home and play in the Philippines in front of Filipino fans. Going big on them 

[Fnatic.eu]  vs. PR

- PR is just abysmal, they lost to xGame and got stomped by Rave. Fnatic (H4nn1 stack) meanwhile almost 2 - 0 ed VP had they not throw, H4nn1 in carry role is okay, and Arise is an okay player somewhat really good in some heroes ( Particularly Magnus) It would be easy for Fnatic if they play like how they did yesterday. Its a BO2 so it be relatively safe. Going Big on them

Empire vs. [Aftershock]

- Empire recently dropped Mag ( or so it seems ) and they have been fairly inconsistent tbh, aShock lost to MYM but then again both of them are trash tier. Most likely skipping is the best move, but a small bet on a shock should be okay.

[VP] vs. KPG

- VP still has 7 games in SL and they have a large chance of getting in the LAN finals, they played well yesterday managing to comeback from almost a 20k gold lead. Although their draft in g2 was weird. Imo if they play properly they should win this, the odds are really good. Going medium as this is very risky. You should skip this if you may as KPG is not the team to be underestimated.

In many respects, Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is one of the most Earth-like worlds we have found to date. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere.

Titan is of great interest to scientists because it has a substantial, active atmosphere and complex, Earth-like processes that shape its surface. The moon is enveloped by an orange haze of naturally produced photochemical smog that frustratingly obscured its surface prior to Cassini's arrival. Since 2004, the spacecraft's observations have taken the study of this unique world into a whole new dimension.

Cassini has revealed that Titan's surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane (the main component of natural gas), which forms clouds and occasionally rains from the sky as water does on Earth. Winds sculpt vast regions of dark, hydrocarbon-rich dunes that girdle the moon's equator and low latitudes. Volcanism may occur as well, but with liquid water as the lava.

On its journey to Saturn, Cassini carried the European-built Huygens probe. On Jan. 14, 2005, Huygens achieved humankind's first landing on a body in the Outer Solar System when it parachuted through Titan's murky skies. Huygens took measurements of atmospheric composition and wind speeds during its decent, along with an incredible series of images showing telltale patterns of erosion by flowing liquid. The probe came to rest on what appeared to be a floodplain, surrounded by rounded cobbles of water ice.

As the Cassini Mission progresses, the spacecraft will monitor Titan's atmosphere and surface for signs of seasonal change. The spacecraft's radar and camera systems will continue to peer through the haze, expanding our high resolution maps of the surface. And scientists will eagerly await new data that could confirm the presence of a liquid ocean beneath the giant moon's surface.

The exploration of this amazing place is just beginning. Frigid and alien, yet also remarkably similar to our own planet, Titan is a new world â revealed before our very eyes by the Cassini and Huygens spacecraft.

&gt; they largely live in racially segregated neighborhoods

That isn't entirely true; and even if it was, if you were an Arab, would you want to live next to a Jew after all the bloodshed? If you were a Jew, would you want to live next to an Arab? There is too much fear and distrust. The segregated neighborhoods are a function of economic and organic cultural forces and not the result of a deliberate government policy.

It's also important to note that [Jews legally purchasing land in Arab neighborhoods results in violent protests by those Arabs.](http://www.timesofisrael.com/dozens-of-jews-move-into-arab-east-jerusalem-locale/) I guess the local Arab-Israelis are supporting that system of apartheid, hmm?

&gt;The government spends around $1,100/year for each Jewish Israeli student and $192/year on each Palestinian Israeli student

A similar situation happens in America concerning white and black students. Is America apartheid? The same with the UK and most other modern Western states for their own ethnic minorities. Is the entire world apartheid?

&gt;Marriage between Jews and non-Jews is illegal unless one formally converts to the religion of the other

This is a holdover from the Ottoman system and widespread throughout the region. Is the entire ex-Ottoman-Empire apartheid?

&gt;The overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis oppose interfaith relationships; more than half consider intermarriage to be ""national treason.""

The Supreme Muslim Council in Israel, which is a holdover from the Ottoman system as well, forbids marriage between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim women. The same attitude against interfaith marriage is widespread in the Palestinian community. Are the Palestinians themselves practicing apartheid?

&gt;Palestinian Israelis are frequently, publicly described as a ""demographic threat,"" not equal citizens worthy of equal rights and inclusion.

As opposed to the Palestinian territories where all Jews are seen as perfect angels.

Your link quotes a fact form 1773. Again, we're talking about the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman empire had done many great things but was on its last legs, regularly referred to by the rest of the world as the sick man of Europe. This again of course was a political move, but the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs and scientific advancement and educating its people was not high on its list of priorities.

And sure the Armenian genocide was political. It was also very religiously motivated. The Ottoman Empire had a long history of trying to convert non Muslims. In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the dhimmi system implemented in Muslim countries, the Armenians like all other Christians and also Jews, were accorded certain limited freedoms (such as the right to worship), but were in essence treated as second-class citizens and referred to in Turkish as gavours, a pejorative word meaning ""infidel"" or ""unbeliever"". Writing in the late 1890s after a visit to the Ottoman Empire, the British ethnographer William Ramsay described the conditions of Armenian life as follows in his book ""Impressions of Turkey during Twelve Years' Wanderings"":
&gt;We must, however, go back to an older time, if we want to appreciate what uncontrolled Turkish rule meant, alike to Armenians and to Greeks. It did not mean religious persecution; it meant unutterable contempt ... They were dogs and pigs; and their nature was to be Christians, to be spat upon, if their shadow darkened a Turk, to be outraged, to be the mats on which he wiped the mud from his feet. Conceive the inevitable result of centuries of slavery, of subjection to insult and scorn, centuries in which nothing that belonged to the Armenian, neither his property, his house, his life, his person, nor his family, was sacred or safe from violence â capricious, unprovoked violence â to resist which by violence meant death.

So, political? Sure. Non-religious? Not even close.

I too have talked to a LOT of Turkish people. They love Ataturk and think he was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
And sure, a country doesn't *have* to change its script. Not at all. And I never said it had to. You are misrepresenting my words. All I said was, that was his motive in changing the script. So that Turkish citizens could absorb Western writings easier. It's not the only way. But it certain is one way - and seems a logical way at that.

As for the video, I thought she was saying that Muslims who judge others and want to kill them while using their science and technology is a bad thing. That's what I took from the video. 

Well again, we were talking about two mandates. Either mandating everyone to wear a headscarf, or mandating everyone not to wear a headscarf. I thought one mandate was better than the other.

A tournament lasting a few weeks once every few years is what you think represents world soccer? This is because you have no business talking about soccer, much less ""playoff"" caliber soccer which is essentially a foreign concept in regular European play. 

So far this season, in 60 games, there have been 168 goals scored in the Premier League, for an average of 2.8 goals a game. 

The last four weeks in the Premier League have seen at least one game with 6 or more goals with 9 goals in the Everton v. Chelsea fixture. 

LAST WEEK, 5 of the 10 games played saw 3 or more goals scored, with Manchester City beating Hull city 4-2, and West Brom putting a ludicrous 4-0 up on Burnley. 

Manchester United have averaged 1.9 goals a game for 22 years. 

If you really must talk about ""playoff caliber"" soccer, we're only in the early group stages of the Champions League, but in the 8 games played TODAY, there were 20 goals scored.

If you want to talk about top caliber teams, Barcelona have scored almost 3 goals a game this season. Bayern Munich are weaker close to only 2 goals a game, but Chelsea are averaging over 3 goals a game a streak they recently managed to keep up for the entire 2012 season.  

So, while it's true that 6 goals may be the exception to the rule of 2-4 goals a game, it is not at all uncommon. And if you think 10% i.e. one game a week in the world's most popular league is uncommon, it's because you're a dumbass.

Rave is literally on fire. They would have faced VG in the iLeague finals if not for 6.82 and the gold imbalances that it provided in the Tongfu.OB comeback. MVP.Hot6 has beaten some okay-ish SEA teams like Invasion and Mith.trust, but they have not proven themselves yet IMO. Last 3 meetings between them, Rave has won 2 against MVP and drew 1. With Rave's recent form, I am willing to back them. **Big on Rave**

MiTH.Trust vs **[Awake]** 

BO1 SEA doto does not warrant much analysis. Just go for the underdogs or abstain. **Small on Awake**

MKSP vs **[Pokerface]** 

PKF looked good yesterday's game against NXL though they had some execution issues during that game. MKSP is in division 2 of the KDL and they do not have the proper practice against the upper tiers of the Korean scene. However, PFK did 322 a match against a slumping zephyr recently which makes it hard for me to trust them. **Small on PKF or Abstain (leaning towards abstaining ATM)**

MiTH.Trust vs **[Arrow Gaming]**  

Arrow has been on quite a roll recently, only dropping 2 games in the Starladder competition that they had no chance of qualifying. Again, Bo1 SEA doto so just trust your own instincts and bet on the team you favour. :D **Medium on Arrow**

Zephyr vs **[Rave]** 

Zephyr is really in a slump that does not seem to be stopping anytime. Rave on the other hand, with reasons stated above, are looking good. I cannot believe Zephyr still are getting &gt;30% odds in their games. **Medium on Rave**

Remember, this is the earliest industrial revolution, where paper money first came about, and so many steel goods were being made that it took humanity a SERIOUSLY long time to catch up with this one timeframe.

This caused several natural disasters historically due to desertification (Due to the absurd amount of resources they used in this large scale increase in production,) which caused widespread unrest and reactionary thought as the emperor was repeatedly asked to roll back the technological developments, which he inevitably did to ease the suffering of the people.

However, you the player know that the Manchu are not going to hold off the much more dangerous Mongols for long, as they historically became the next dynasty, and rampaged all the way to europe. The advanced equipment that the people want you to get rid of could save your empire from these hordes, but at what cost? How many lives will be lost to the internal conflicts caused by reactionary factions in preventing the fall of china, and the empowerment of Europe? The Environmental destruction that the industrialization has already caused? The poverty that factory workers have historically faced, being unable to afford the goods they make, while also being unable to make them for themselves?

All of these are issues the player would need to handle, with a few forgotten ones (The highly violent Tibetan empire wanting to restore its former glory, for example.)

Face internal conflict, and risk being destroyed from within, or abandon technology, and risk being destroyed by threats outside.

It's not like building a few HSR lines along dense, highly trafficked routes means we get rid of planes or something. It's just adding another option, a better option for some routes. 

The issue is that distances like NY to DC are that awkward in between distance. You can take a regular train, drive, take a bus or fly and door to door they all take about the same amount of time. 

But HSR changes all that. It can halve the time. It makes it possible to leave for a meeting or whatever from DC to NY or Boston to Philly and be home at a regular time. These are really common routes with tons of traffic, cutting that much time is going to open all kinds of doors for business, tourism and vacationing. 

And it does not need to be that expensive. You can buy a 3-day rail pass in Germany for less than $300. You can zip from Berlin to Stuttgart and then to Munich or whatever you want. It's fantastic. Leave when your meeting is over or when you wake up after a night it partying and simply grab the first train. 

It can be a lot cheaper, more flexible and a whole heck of a lot more enjoyable than flying or even driving. 

What I'm trying to share with you is that you have an awful lot of misconceptions about what this sort of system would be and what it would be like. I think youre emblematic of most Americans and that's why I'm trying to take the time to tell you about this. If more people knew about the advantages of a system like this I think we'd get about building them.

The government has become a fascist beast, cracking down on immigrants, Muslims and Catholics. The crown Princess bucks tradition and enters politics, calling loudly for change. Hers is the only voice that can rise up uncensored and unpunished. She dismisses the plutocratic parliament and holds a referendum, surviving assassination attempts and forcing her will through despite political opposition. The people rise up to support her, and drawing widely from across parties she crafts a new coalition. At the end she stands before a better Britain, crown princess and prime minister, struggling to end the fascist state and, as old Abe put it, and to see to it that her country ""shall have a new birth of freedom."" 

The second season sees her struggling to enact her vision despite threat to her life, which she does. Of course, her father dies from an assassination attempt aimed at her at the end of the second season, leaving her prime minister and Queen of England. 


In season three, parliament begins undermining her, with many members succumbing to blackmail and coercion to oppose her. She claims all governmental powers for herself in response, refusing to give in. Again, even with elite opposition the people rise up in support of her. Thus, the absolute monarchy of england is reborn. 

In the fourth season she reclaims Scotland AND Ireland from their own fascist leaning governments, and in the fifth she unites most of the commonwealth nations under one banner (more like the EU than an empire) in order to become relevant once again without Europe in a world dominated by China the US. The final season sees her struggling to return functioning and fair democracy to her people, ending with elections. ",,2,t1_ckwxk7w,,False,False,t1_ckx3986

&gt;Nowell was married to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, on the morning of May 25, Sublime was supposed to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer [Bud Gaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Gaugh) woke up to find Nowell kneeling next to the bed, lying across it.  Initially, Gaugh assumed he had been too intoxicated to get into bed, however, he noticed a green film around his mouth, and it became apparent that he had overdosed on heroin.  Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was [cremated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation) and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in [Surfside, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside,_California). A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in [Westminster, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster,_California) in his memory.

&gt;

&gt;The PKK has been placed on the terrorism blacklists of Turkey and a number of allied governments and organisations. 

&gt;The [military alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance) [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) has declared the PKK to be a terrorist group;  Turkey has been a member of NATO since 1952, and fields the group's [second-largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO#Military_personnel) armed contingent. Closely tied to NATO,  the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)âwhich Turkey [aspires to join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union)âofficially lists the PKK as having ""been involved in terrorist acts"" and proscribes it as part of its [Common Foreign and Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy).  First designated in 2002, the PKK was ordered to be removed from the EU terror list on 3 April 2008 by the [European Court of First Instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_First_Instance) on the grounds that the EU failed to give a proper justification for listing it in the first place.  However, EU officials dismissed the ruling, stating that the PKK would remain on the list regardless of the legal decision.  Most European Union member states have not individually listed the PKK as a terrorist group.

&gt;The [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) only blacklists [al-Qaida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaida), the [Taliban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban), and affiliated groups and individuals, pursuant to [UNSCR 1267](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1267).  As such, the PKK has never been designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, though three out of five permanent members of the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council) treat it as such on an individual basis. The PKK is designated as a [Foreign Terrorist Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_State_Department_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations) by the [US State Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State)   and as a [Proscribed Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Act_2000) by the UK [Home Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office).  Additionally, France prosecutes Kurdish-French activists and bans organisations connected to the PKK on terrorism-related charges,  having listed the group as a terrorist organisation since 1993.  However, French courts often refuse to extradite captured individuals accused of PKK connections to Turkey due to technicalities in French law, frustrating Turkish authorities.  On the other hand, [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) has long ignored Turkish pressure to ban the PKK,  and the group is also not included in the official terror blacklist of [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) (PRC).

He says both Mirotic and McDermott are likely to overperform:

&gt;6. Nikola Mirotic | F | Bulls
Panel score: 4.68


&gt;Mirotic is a unique rookie. He's a 23-year-old from Montenegro who's been playing at the highest level of Europe for years. He was the MVP of the Spanish Cup Finals in 2014, and was MVP of Round 1 of the Euroleague in 2013-14. He's already established himself on a stage with a higher level of basketball than anything the collegians will bring to the table.


&gt;Mirotic will likely play mostly the 4 in the NBA, but he has the mobility to guard the 3, as well. He gives the Bulls something they desperately covet -- more shooting. He shot 46 percent from three last year for Real Madrid. He also has the ability to put the ball on the floor and get to the lane. Many European scouts in particular think he could be a star in the NBA someday of the order of Toni Kukoc or Dirk Nowitzki. They are that high on him. Had Mirotic been in this year's draft (he was drafted 23 by the Magic and then traded to the Bulls in 2011) I think he would've been the fourth player chosen behind Wiggins, Parker and Joel Embiid.


&gt;The question for Mirotic will be one of transition (Europeans sometimes take a year to make the shift to the faster pace of the NBA) and opportunity. The Bulls are stacked at the four with Pau Gasol and Taj Gibson. Gasol will play some five behind Joakim Noah which will open up some extra minutes there. At the three he'll be battling for time with Mike Dunleavy and fellow rookie Doug McDermott. If he can get minutes, I think he'll outperform his ranking, perhaps by a large margin. If he doesn't, I still think he'll be an effective stretch four off the bench and that the ranking is pretty fair.

&gt;Projection: Likely will outperform

...

&gt;8. Doug McDermott| F | Chicago Bulls

&gt;Panel score: 4.38

&gt;McDermott landed in a terrific place. Coming into the 2014 NBA draft, the Bulls needed shooting and a player who could come in and contribute right away. McDermott might have been the best shooter in the draft when he gets his feet set, and four years at Creighton makes him more NBA-ready than most guards.

&gt;He also has opportunity. Mike Dunleavy is on the downside of his career, meaning McDermott could earn big minutes at small forward, if he plays well. While I don't know McDermott will be a star, I think he's going to help the Bulls right out of the gate and is likely to overperform this ranking.

Well that's the problem isn't it? It's all matters of opinion. For someone quite far on the left, anything that doesn't have a red start on it appear to be ultra-capitalist.

&gt;bring it to European levels of **market socialism**

Sounds like what Beijing tries to sell every Chinese. They use a slightly different term, ""socialist market economy"", I believe. 

&gt;given the stratospheric property prices of today, is a reasonable demand and not entitlement by any stretch of the word.

This troubles me a little bit, are you suggesting housing prices can be decided and can be decided alone, by some government?

&gt;some Americans fret at the thought of a welfare state

We are not. We ARE a welfare state. (I know a lot of my fellow Americans are going to dispute that, but let's just say ""welfare"" is no longer welfare after it became a part of the entitlement, a part of ""what a government should do"") We are scared of the loss of freedom and liberty, just like you. We tread carefully , as carefully as we can not to trade in too much of our liberty for security. (Yea, yea, we are doing a really lousy job, we know that)

There are two forms of enslavement, the kind that entails coercion, lashes and suppression, then there is the candy cane approach: make promises, give you something to loose, get you to believe you can't have those things without them, or without their help anyway. Politicians like Hugo Chavez employs the latter, Beijing hasn't fully learned its how, yet. 

A slaver, be it approved and appointed by Beijing or rose from the local population, is a slaver. That's not just something grandiose to say, that has solid foundation in reality. Obama's skin color and his energetic, fresh  exterior made a lot people think he is The One, the good shepherd. Likewise, the republicans tried their best to come up with a good looking white guy that is rich. 

&gt;People in Denmark seem to be quite happy to be taxed more than half their income in order to maintain their entitlements, 

If Beijing makes you pay half of your income to keep a rather generous amount of  *entitlements*, are you gonna be happy?

Denmark enjoys the No.1 status when it comes to trade liberty and economic freedom, way above America, even above Hong Kong, whereas HKers had a little brawl with mainlanders  a while back over baby formulas.  

&gt;and their economy hasn't crashed to the dumps last time I checked

If Hong Kong sits on oil fields, iron mines and abundant geothermal resources, she won't either, not for a long, long time. There is a reason why in WW2 Germans made it particularly easy on and for Denmark. It is a nation of light population (5/7 of Hong Kong) with relatively a large land mass (more than 40 times that of Hong Kong) and rich resources.

Although cynical, it's quite reasonable to say that people of Denmark doesn't really have to do anything other than selling what nature had gifted them to make a comfortable living (which is largely what they are doing at this moment), but they choose not to. Men can't just live for material well-being (although undeniably that's a great part of men's life), they must live for something beyond, something bigger. But since I'm American I think I'm pretty much the least qualified on this planet to lecture something like that, LOL. 

&gt;but a couple of nudges in Denmark's direction wouldn't hurt

I honest dunno about that. A lota great empires went down on a slippery slope. I don't think the founding fathers of America would recognize America's current political system. Besides a black president, that is. 

Rome wasn't built in one day, certainly didn't fall in one either.

&gt;They are the happiest people in the world, after all.

I'm not saying you're wrong - certainly the complexities of attraction are not easily distilled into such basic categories as strength or weakness that we can say women always like stronger or more powerful men; perhaps more to the point, neither men nor women are necessarily able to distill and describe exactly what can make a man seem powerful.

Maybe in the US and Canada (and maybe other mainly English countries) the measurement of power is based only on simply, easily observed criteria. Maybe in some or many European countries, the culture points to different or at least additional ways to measure or assess power and strength, physical or otherwise. Perhaps even 'permitted' to see it that way, where around my parts such an opinion is ostensibly allowed but in practice is beaten down mercilessly.

Strength and power are not simply height and money or fame or other overt social status. Shorter men are not always smaller, smaller men are not always weaker, weaker men are not always inferior in a physical confrontation - these ideas are not accepted in my part of the world by most people. Power can be a lot more than the physical ability to move mass, and being able to overpower a rival is useless if that rival is so much faster than you he can dance circles around you. Just as an example. Then if we extend the idea of strength and power beyond the most basic physical realm... it gets complicated and nuanced.

Which might be the key to decipher the whole mystery. I think most people on my side of the pond really dislike complicated and nuanced.

I always feel like I'm bragging when it gets around to describing how looks interact with height, and then the confound of size and strength gets in there too, because short does not equal small or weak, necessarily. Of course bragging gets me nothing because I'm anonymous here. It just seems like it's disingenuous of me to say ""Well I'm 5'5"" and I get tha girlz, lol"" without mentioning a lucky face and a physical presence that would not register as small to the subconscious of an average person.

I see posts from people much taller than me (5'9"" would see over my head) who think their height is why they can't get dates. Is it that my looks counter the hit my value takes by being short? Is it something in the personality? Is it the time and place, the increased focus on overt and obvious traits? If I was 'on the market' now, would my height get in the way? (Based on the attention I get, probably not much, but maybe it's one thing to admire a face and body, another to suffer the slings and arrows of a world that asks what's wrong with you that you would lower yourself to date a man with such an obvious, uh, 'deformity.')

Anyway... the original point was that being very good looking but still short means less overall women wanting a piece of you in practice, but usually higher 'quality' (and that's looks only, for the purposes of this discussion). My experience does confirm that, anecdotally. Lots of my taller friends slept with many more women than me... but if you counted only the ones we agreed were 'hot,' the ratios changed.

There was always a filtering process. If a girl disregarded me for my height, and I was sure that was why, she was erased as a sexual being in my mind. After all, she'd already done that to me. This allowed me to focus on the ones I had a shot with, instead of wasting my energy and time. The weirder situations were the ones where the girl actually was attracted to me but my height was a deal breaker for her (and most often these girls were shorter than me, as most girls are). Like they'd let me now that in some way they thought was subtle. Others have been so height focused I'm pretty sure they could not clearly recall my face five minutes after meeting me, because they never really saw me in the first place, they saw MANLET and processed the interaction under that umbrella.",,1,t1_ckwxlyc,,False,False,t1_ckx4fqd

Then and there, it strikes a wrong note with any Hindu worth his dime. Ask 50 Hindus what they believe as Hindus, they will all give different answers, but ask them the 'goal' of Hinduism, and most of them will mutter 'self-realization', even though most of them, including myself here, don't probably know the implications of this 'self-realization'. In any case, Hinduism is not a philosophical fabrication revolving around the notion that selfishness is the only moral way of life. Rand's Objectivism is.

The 'social classes' have never in History been entirely accepted, and time and again, sections of religious interpretation have always held them to be a perversion. Advaita philosophies have existed since about 1200 years as a rigidly defined line of thought, and much before that as vaguely formed by well-intended ideas aimed at elimination of the excess entropy in religion. (Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Kabir, etc. come to mind.) Rand wouldn't have any interest in knowing what Kabir had to say, or about the beauty which flowed from Tukaram's words. She was a woman who justified Europeans killing and conquering native Americans because they had not 'civilized' America, and hence they did not deserve to live. 

Hinduism is like pizza. There are as many types, if not more. Anyone saying *'Huh, this is just like Hinduism'* needs to specify which set of beliefs he is specifying.

I really don't get the fad behind Rand. She is OK to read when you are 16 years old, she says what we all want to hear when we are 16. But as you grow up, you realize that life is not as black and white as Rand puts it. You realize that her books are amazing creations of fiction, but the characters are too narrow to exist in real life. Objectivism is great in the black and white world of Rand, but not this thankfully colourful universe.

Those who say Rand's selfishness is closer to self-realization are wrong, because if it were so, she did not follow it in real life. She had an affair with her junior, and she forced her husband and the junior's wife to accept their affair by selling them philosophical knowledge about how it's all not wrong.

""My name is John. So far I have survived for the past 7 years without any help from other humans. That seems to be the only way to survive now. Not like I have seen very many humans since Day Zero anyways.""

""Day Zero is the day it all started. It was as if everything was out to get them. Weather, animals, insects, everything. People had been so prepared for everything. All the hype for the zombie movies made people react almost instantaneously to that particular scenario. This was so much worse.  It happened so fast, its almost as if she knew we would react that way. If there was a large population in a small area, they were wiped out on Day Zero. Tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes. Most of Earth's volcanoes erupted in some fashion over the next couple of days. The Earth was blanketed in ash.""

""Most man made factories went catastrophic, or shut down from their fail-safes. Luckily only one nuclear reactor blew, from what I could tell. I tried to document what I could.""

""For tens of thousands of years, probably more, Humans and their close relatives dominated this planet for the most part. This planet was our home. Somewhere a long the way we messed up. Maybe it was the CO2, maybe it was the invasive species we casually spread across the planet, hell, maybe it was the nukes.""

""We have never really figured out what happened or why. How could we? There is not a lot left to continue with, nor are there many of us left, from what I can see. ""

""News continued from the smaller stations across the planet. Then only underground military communications were up. Satellites were pointless by Day Four, most of the world was burning by then. We pretty much didn't know shit. We knew it wasn't zombies, it wasn't some strange virus. We didn't know what it was. I feel I need to get this out, so that if any survivors find it... I don't know...they can do something with it. Hopefully. My rations are running low though, I must hurry.""

""I must start this somewhere. Lets start 30 years ago"". 

We were planning on sending humans to Mars. First we needed a new fuel station in orbit around Earth. The NASA operated ISS was to be decommissioned and reused."" 

""Russia was out of this new space race due to their own warlike tendencies. After a long battle, slowly taking land from neighboring countries, they made the mistake of messing with North Korea. North Korea launched its entire stock of 5 nuclear warheads to Russia. It was enough. China and Japan cleaned up the rest and they split the land. China then swallowed up and 'freed' North Korea. Bastards still used them for their labor force.""

""Competition to get the first cheap Solar Refueler into space was between a few American companies, EU, and India. USA did the right thing and joined their companies under SpaceX, the first commercial company to resupply ISS.""

""Within a year, Elon Musk , head of SpaceX, had combined his Tesla battery factory with SpaceX. With the help of Boeing and NASA, it was like the 60's all over again. People were inventing all kinds of new things for space exploration. Elon had a station designed, built and in space in less than two years. People thought he was crazier than he seemed in the first two decades of 2000. Some thought He might be in a hurry for a reason.""

""His engineers completed the impossible though. They implemented the first robotic repair drone to space. It could supposedly last forever as long it stays in space. Then came the naturalizers. Robots capable of pulling just about any of the top 35 elements that humans used to survive, from just about any object or atmosphere. A company invented food printers, SpaceX quickly bought them. We could now send humans on long journeys without worrying as much for food and O2.""

""SpaceX had also designed a whole new launch system. Elon's 'Hypertube' was not for trains. It was a 200 mile wide circular underground Electromagnetic Space Vehicle Launch system. He could launch almost anything he wanted, and then launch another vehicle within 2 hours. By this time, anyone was an astronaut who wanted to be on, only requirements was a psychological exam and a physical test.""

""Elon's space station was coming together. They started sending humans to live aboard, while their drones did most of the building. This was not 3-8 month stints, but 1-3 years at a time. Artificial gravity was around the corner, and Elon's plan to be on Mars by 2025 had passed a couple a years before. Elon sent droves of robots to Mars as soon as they were ready. Within 3 years they had built a sizable underground colony structure that would supply a small group with necessary life support for 20-30 years.""

""On December 3rd 2034 100 people left Earth for Mars. They stopped at the solar field for an energy refill. Their cargo left weeks before. People were glued to their video outlets. Most people in developed countries watched from the screens on their wrist or in their glasses. There was no big plume of smoke and steam. Now it was just a vessel being flung into space from a mountainside, if you blinked for than once in that few seconds, you most likely missed it.""

""And then the EU broke apart. Australia was first, the aboriginals, stormed the modern society communities. No one knew so many were massing in the scorching Australian desert, but deep underground, a whole ancient society was waiting for the perfect moment to exact their long awaited revenge. When some government snob tried to create a new Australia, the aboriginals started showing up and kinda just wandered the street. For weeks they poured in, placing themselves near important communities and then mass murdered entire groups of politicians and officials before instating their own crude government.""

""By March of 2040 Elon Musk was headed to Mars himself. Mars colonies had grown to more than 50,000. Elon was ready to leave his legacy with his protege. A nobody that shared his passion and his vision, but wasn't an engineer in the slightest."" 

""I had loved space since I was 5. Memorized every jet, airplane, spacecraft ever made. I worked with Elon as a programmer, helping interface with robots. My program was running in every drone controlled by SpaceX and a lot that weren't. I always knew I would change the world, but I never thought it'd be like this."" 

::Static::

""I launched myself up to SpaceX HQ shortly after Elon left, per his instructions. HQ had been LEO since 2036. It was my new home.""

"" Day Zero was July 9th 2049. Elon called me the day before. He said,' John, Move your part of HQ to an orbit that allows full resolution scans of Earth. Steve on Earth has been getting strange readings from Earth's core.'

I did the exact same thing dude and I felt so dumb afterwards.  She was clearly wanting you to put your arm around her.  But I know what you're feeling as in you don't know what to do after that and then after that and so on and so on.  That's how the social anxious guy's mind works.  We don't want to look dumb and we just don't know what to do.  

But don't worry there's nothing wrong with what your experiencing, that anxiety is part of being human.  And hey be thankful for that anxiety. It shows you have some empathy which is a good trait to have.

Ever tried alcohol?  I mean in the right situations of course (bars, parties, chilling out, etc.).  It can help open you up to talk to girls and give you some confidence.  When guys and girls drink alcohol together it can lead to good times.

Anyway, if that doesn't work and your still socially anxious as hell around girls you may need to lose your virginity.  When you turn 18 try going to an ""asian massage parlor"".  They're everywhere in the US (I assume that's where you're from?).  They'll treat you ""very nice"" there and they deal with socially anxious guys a lot.  They totally understand and don't care.  And don't worry they are very discreet in their services and are a massage parlor upfront.  But anyway, going there will give you some experience and confidence so when you do have to do it with someone you care about, you won't feel scared of making a fool of yourself.  Many young people in Europe go about losing it this way.  Nothing shameful about it.

And last, but certainly not least stay the fuck away from medication like SSRIs and anxiety meds.  That shit will mess you up.  SSRIs especially.  Sure, they might take away the anxiety, but they'll also make you not care about ever talking to a girl again because your sex drive and emotions are completely gone.  Along with the risk of suicide they come with, its not worth it trust me.

&gt;__E numbers__ are codes for substances which can be used as [food additives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive) for use within the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)  and [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) (the ""E"" stands for ""Europe"").  They are commonly found on [food labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_label) throughout the European Union.  Safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the [European Food Safety Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority). 

&gt;Having a single unified list for food additives was first agreed upon in 1962 with colours. In 1964, the directives for preservatives were added, 1970 for antioxidants and 1974 for the emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents.

You're trying to argue that Muslims are more radicalised than other religions and less frequently denounce acts of terrorism. 

You can't then just pull statistics on Muslims (btw, statistics only from certain Middle East countries which is totally irrelevant to Muslims in America or Europe) without comparing them to something.

Here's an equivalent example to help you understand, since several explanations have failed to penetrate your skull. Imagine that someone asserted that Muslims in America like chocolate more than Christians and Jews. And then, to prove that point, they grabbed studies showing that 20% of Muslims in certain Middle East countries. 

That's what you're doing, only you're doing it with something far more serious than chocolate. Also, I should point out that even if the numbers backed you (they don't), you're still victim blaming. The enormous number of Muslims who have been victimised because of racism and xenophobia are absolutely, under no circumstances, to blame. They're just not.

Oh, and for people interested in good numbers, [see EstherHarshom's comment above](http://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/2hwabv/what_if_the_islamic_state_had_200_members_in/ckwqfw2).",,3,t1_ckwpu8t,,False,False,t1_ckx706v

I studied at UNC under some wonderful professors in the Classics, history, and archaeology. Religious matters were always discussed in a thoroughly academic and professional manner. As with any good history, any possible personal prejudice or biases in source material were acknowledged and explored. Though no particular class was dedicated to the discussion of Jesus or the particular events of the gospels, the New Testament was a useful source for understanding certain contemporary perspectives.

Of particular interest were the epistles among the bishops of the early church. From those, one had a distinct contemporary Christian perspective on the Roman Empire, its religions (as viewed by adherents from an originally non-Roman perspective) and a view of the persecutions by various emperors against Christianity. One can see reflected in early Christian literature (including the gospels, which were written decades after the crucifixion) the various philosophical currents of the fledgling religion and mentions of specific events in cities throughout the empire. New Testament was the root of the currents of that culture and for European culture for centuries to come.

That doesn't mean you can treat the Bible like a textbook. It's full of conflicting philosophies, disparate accounts of events, and implausible supernatural feats. As a source, it must be treated differently than something like *The Peloponnesian War* by Thucydides. His intention, as he put it, was to create a reliable account of the events of a specific war as they really happened. Not to say Thucydides didn't have his biases, but the the intention of the Bible is to evangelize, or ""spread the good news."" It was also written by many authors, of whom Paul was most influential, yet he never even claimed to have met Yeshua bar Joseph in the flesh.

Valued Advice Giver ( ..)ï¾,False,1426741136,0,1412141052,ckx8mk3,lgbtqbbq,0,0,t3_2hy0is,32,femalefashionadvice,t5_2s8o5,"OK so I just reread what I wrote and realized it's less about ""authenticity"" and more about the brand identity that seems to be common among these ""heritage brands,"" which is one that encompasses Americana, workwear, artfully casual clothing, etc. I think the other comments here already did a great job of tackling what I think about the article in particular, so I'll go on a bit of a tangent.

I feel like the authenticity ""trend"" if you can call it that, is part of a larger cultural force that has definitely had a big impact in the world of fashion, this idea of trying ""too hard."" Basically I think that the heritage/authentic/Americana marketing and brand images help people to feel like they're hitting that middle-of-the-road sweet spot where they are looking fashionable but not like they spent $1000s on their outfits (even if they did.)

I would guess that in part it's a response to a previous decade of excess/overtly glamorous trends (logo bags, ostentatious embellishment, etc) and I think that it's honestly as insidiously exclusive as the ""rich bitch on 5th ave"" look. It takes a shit load of effort to look ""effortless."" The look of an artfully rumpled pair of jeans, workboot, and flannel is no less calculated than a stereotypical blogger outfit of skater skirt, blazer, statement necklace, and heels. 

I think that whole idea is pretty silly. It categorizes ""trying"" as bad, and ""not trying"" as good. Problem is, rich people can look ""effortlessly stylish"" more easily than poor people. Why? Because they can afford exceptionally well-put together items that can be worn as standalone pieces and exude ""stylishness."" Same goes for slender folks. Fashion is, by and large, catered to what looks nice on a slender, tall body. I'm not about to argue the ins and outs of that today, but I don't think anyone could rightfully argue against that. A girl like, say, Kristen Stewart, is going to look more artfully mussed and glamorous in a dirty pair of jeans and boots than someone like America Ferrera. Because we have cultural callbacks to things like Kate Moss as one of the first great ""plain"" models who stood out after the lacquered glamazons of the 80s. That waifish, tousled young thing is going to look cool and vaguely European and thrown-together, but that fat girl...well she just looks sloppy, she should put some effort in for goodness' sake!

The heritage workwear look is, as many have pointed out, a callback to that absurd idea of ""simpler times,"" when your grandpa came home from a hard day at the mill and kissed your salt of the earth sassy grandma and then went and cleaned his gun on the porch under the stars. It's just a fucking image, it's meant to place the modern consumer into an environment that appeals to them. 

The accusation (even implicit) that a certain brand, like Madewell, lacks authenticity for attempting to capture that bygone era image, while not having the heritage cred to ""rightfully"" do it...well that's just hilarious and smacks of exclusivity and snobbery. Nobody can make boots SO AUTHENTIC that it would turn a 23 year old graphic designer into his coal mining grandfather, no matter how hand-stitched or rugged those boots are. The transformative powers of ""authentic"" items of clothing is way overstated I think.

I think the digs at an ""inauthentic"" company reveal a lot about what people value in style. Trying, trying ""too hard,"" not trying enough...these are arbitrary. Yes, you can argue that people look better if they don't ""try too hard"" i.e. they aren't overstyled and overaccessorized. But the appearance of trying too hard doesn't correlate 1-to-1 with actually trying too hard. I think people make value judgments on how much they perceive a person ""tried,"" when putting together their closet or their outfit. I think the heritage/workwear/""authentic"" look is a common way to guard against those judgments, like it's a magic shield to walk around in grubby boots that cost you $400, because you're not one of *those* people who bought yourself $400 heels, you're the girl next door, you wear boots! (full disclosure, I wear expensive boots, and I regularly tell myself I'm super cool, but that's because I have only 2 friends and 1 of them is my parents' cat so I really need to be my own cheerleader, guise) It's always easier to brush off judgments/criticisms if the perceived effort wasn't great. I think about how many times I turned in academic assignments and preemptively told myself/friends ""I didn't even start it until the last minute, I *barely* put in effort,"" secretly hoping to get an A, because that's impressive as shit, but also secretly thinking that if I got a C, nobody would judge, because I didn't do shit, who could blame me! I think there might be a component of that to the disheveled/workwear trend, but I guess I'm veering off the true discussion of authenticity, whoops.",,32,t3_2hy0is,vag,False,False,t1_ckx8mk3

The US doesn't give Saudi any military aid directly.  The US based troops in Saudi to defend against Iraq, but that's different than this problem.  The Saudi's buy their equipment, F15's from the US, Eurofighters from Europe, etc. etc. etc.   

And the Saudi's are using it now.  But this isn't on the Saudi border, saudi arabia might be well off, but it's still not a big country population wise.  They don't have anywhere near the power projection capability that the major  powers do, nor would anyone sane want them to.   They are arming to defend against Iran in the  'gulf' (arabian or persian depending on who you ask), and they have problems in Yemen that they have been involved in as well, and they sent troops to Bahrain, and all of that is the last couple of years. 

&gt;You bring up the point of Iran having to catch up if the Saudi's step it up on IS, well then, why do we even fund Saudi Arabia.

Huh?  Iran is a much larger country than Saudi, both population wise and geographically.  But their oil needs to pass by Saudi arabia, just as much as half of Saudi and almost all Iraqi oil passes by Iran.  They are natural adversaries for a lot of reasons (shia vs Sunni, Monarchy versus theorcratic republic dictatorship, proxmity history etc).  But Saudis and Iranians are on the same side against ISIS, they're just on different sides with Assad.  And that's the problem.  If you radically increase the capabilities of Saudi then the Iranians will want to compensate.  The goal is to get Saudi to the point of being able to defend itself, but not to be too aggressive.  Triggering an arms race between Saudi and Iran does no one any favours, particularly when they are going to be arguing over Iraq and Syria.   Saudi shouldn't be so weak that the US needs to station troops there on a daily basis.  But they shouldn't be so strong that they would be a serious destabilizing influence in the event of a coup or a threat to Iran.  ",,-1,t1_ckx8j8u,,False,False,t1_ckx8qux

Citizens of Baltic countries have discriminated against their Russian populations for decades now. Latvia has a huge stateless population that wasn't allowed to vote, though they pay taxes. These countries were undemocratic to begin with, though they were promoted as democratic to allow them to fit into the EU's geopolitical goals. So from which perspective do we choose to see this conflict from? The oppressed Russian minorities? Or the side we're constantly presented in the media. I would say both. Which is difficult. I hope this results in integration of the Russian and EU economies. Instead of this bullshit that's being pushed through. 

I imagine most right wing Europeans that are anti-immigration, actually have a lot in common with Russians. Obviously Western Europe is wealthier, which affects individuals behavior, but in general the sentiment is likely the same between the two civilizations. Western Europe is being Americanized, against the will of many Europeans. And it sucks to see civilizations and cultures get destroyed for the countries to retain power and hold their rivals back from getting stronger than them (taking in massive immigration to keep their economy afloat and stay more dominant than other potential powers).

I bet Eastern + Western European integration would have resulted in massive economic gains for both Eastern and Western Europe. It would also lead to more security for the European people (to counter the rise of China on the Eurasian continent, and counter American power projection). It seems like a win-win, and all of these conflicts seem to be distractions from the real strategic goals Eastern and Western Europeans should have - which is to fix their internal demographic crisis, maintain defensible geopolitical borders, and secure the energy, food, and raw resources for their economies to develop and compete on an international level. There is a massive European country right next door with so much to offer, and they instead chose the hostile position.

The EU should have opened negotiations with Russia as they encroached on Russia's borders, rather than being hostile to Russia, and the two of them should have used Ukraine as an opportunity to begin merging their economies. The EU took a hostile strategy in refusing to negotiate with Russia while dealing with Ukraine, which probably signaled to Russia their actual intent was hostile. Huge missed opportunity by shitty European leaders with no strategic goals except to maintain their vassalage under American cultural hegemony in the Western world. Completely throwing their own working class, and ethnic kin, under the bus.

I think Ukrainian nationalists ideological stance that Russia shouldn't be dealt with, when they're making deals with the EU, is an ignorant stance. The EU is the opposite of a nationalistic organization. It's an expansionist pro-integration organization, that is anti-nationalist.

It can't be anti-semitism, because the majority of the Israeli's are not Semites. They come from Poland, Russia, Germany, etc. Most of them are not the true ancient people, they are converts from Kazar. The original Jews were black/bronze as were the Christians. The Arabs are the true Semites. Every time Israel commits atrocities against the people of Gaza or steals more land in the West Bank they start talking about the new emergence of anti-Semitism.. it's pure bullshit perpetuated by the Zionist media and government.

Israel has been doing everything it can to lure us into war so they could redraw the map in the middle east with Israel's boarders stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates- the 2 blue lines on their flag represents the 2 rivers with the Star of David in the middle representing Jerusalem their future capital after they finish stealing Palestinian lands. Israel wants the US to destabilize the region so that the Arab governments can't resist.

Since our entrance into the middle east Israel has been expanding the settlements in the west bank inching closer to the Euphrates River in Iraq. The US government has been infiltrated with people of dual Israeli-US citizenship and their primary loyalty is to Israel as well as a new non-Israeli version of Zionists. While in Israel Joe Biden said, ""You don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist"". Mitt Romney's last trip to Israel he said ""Jerusalem is the capital of Israel."", and it will be the capital once Israel achieves their own version of manifest destiny which they call ""Greater Israel"". AIPAC forces everyone in Congress to guarantee Israel's military superiority to its neighbors through financial and military aide donations of total value as much as $30billion/year. 

http://www.dw.de/palestinian-death-toll-rises-above-2000-as-peace-deal-urgently-anticipated/a-17860460 I don't see any of the Israelis weeping for the innocent lives taken in Gaza. Gaza has no military, their tiny little rockets which have only killed a handful of Israelis when compared to IDF missiles killing thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza every year. Israel's treatment of the innocent Palestinian civilians is disgusting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwxSW09PtYw

Netanyahu and the Pro-Israel lobby dragging the US into more wars on religious crusades to support Zionism from European Jews who have no genetic tie to the region. The majority of the Israelis are impostor Semites and are anti-Semitic toward the Arabs (again the truly Semitic people). Apparently they haven't stolen enough land yet to quell their insatiable appetite for other people's property and they need the US to step up to the plate to help them confiscate more so they can accomplish Greater Israel (control the land from the Nile Valley to the Euphrates). Iran is a threat to the Zionist agenda, but its pitiful military is no real threat to the US. US bombs and sanctions during the 1990s killed over 500,000 Iraqis. 9/11 killed 3000 Americans (no comparison).

The Israeli government and Jewish terrorist groups Lehi and Irgun (referred to as the Israeli version of fascist Nazis by Einstein and many others at the time, which are now fully integrated into the IDF) stealing the Palestinian lands and houses and forcing them into exile are the reason for the conflict. What would you say if the Israelis took your house and exiled you to the middle of Iraq?- and you better not protest or else you're a terrorist, then see how you feel. Gaza is a modern Israeli Death Camp and the IDF the modern Nazis. Its is Israel that has been starving the citizens of Gaza with total embargos for years and not the other way around.

The Apartheid State of Israel is at war with Hamas because they don't accept Israel's illegal occupation of the West Bank and the takeover of East Jerusalem as a legitimate claim to the territory. If Israel's claim of the West Bank is fair, then Putin's annexation of Crimea is more legitimate because unlike the West Bank, Crimea actually used to be Russian territory. No other ally spies on the US more than Israel.

The US sent Israel over $120Billion in foreign aid in recent years which they repay us by bribing our politicians to spend teenage American lives to fight their battles for them. The US will eventually go bankrupt and Israel will have all the surrounding Arabs that hate it to deal with. China and Russia will surely come back to the region and Israel can go try to lobby their politicians for aid and protection.

After that, I would recommend looking into Byzantine/Box Chain, Full Persian 6 in 1, and Japanese 6 in 2. These are, in my opinion, the best weaves for a beginner to learn. 

When you are ready to make your own rings, find a welding supply store and buy a pound of 18 gauge aluminum wire. Usually about ten bucks, and it will last for a good long time. Buy or scavenge a variety of mandrels. I recommend old metal or plastic knitting needles, which you should be able to find in abundance at thrift stores. Don't use someone's good needles that they actually intend to use to knit. 

To coil your wire, there are two great methods I have used. Both take practice, but they're worth it. Method 1 is to get a good pair of visegrips, clamp the wire down onto your mandrel, and then spin the visegrips while guiding the wire with your thumb. Method 2 is to use a variable speed drill. Put your mandrel into the chuck, and feed your wire into it too, then use the drill to wind it and guide it with your thumb. Go slowly until you get a feel for it. You can wear gloves if you feel like it, but I don't unless I'm working with really springy wire, like 20ga steel.

I looked around at the little room. The computer on the corner desk displayed an old Huffington post article, telling me that the US had dropped some big ones somewhere in Eastern Europe. Latvia? Ukraine? Maybe Russia. Doesn't fucking matter, really. Last thing I read was how EM shield over the US had finally crumbled and a missile, and then a hundred more, hit the ground. That was when I jumped into my basement and bolted the door shut. Lost internet a couple days later.

""Maybe I'm the only person left alive in America. Or the whole world,"" I mused aloud. I shrugged. People were mostly shitty, anyway. I had told them to start building bunkers, too, but everyone just laughed at me. Well, I bet they feel like shit now. Or they would, if they were still alive. 

It wasn't even that complicated. Thick steel/aluminum/lead paneling held by screws to the walls and ceiling, stores of food, water and beer, magazines, books, some videogames. A little expensive, sure, but you get your money's worth. I also had a friend who humored me and helped me build a makeshift radiation (something something ""Geiger"")  and temperature sensor from parts we found at Radioshack and Amazon. He also installed these little klaxons that would sound if someone was entering my property from any direction. I guess that was a useful idea, having an alarm system. Turned out to be pointless, seeing as the neighborhood was flatter than Kansas right now. Anyway, he was a good guy. Grilled a mean steak. Always down to grab a beer at the local waterhole. 

He's probably radioactive dust right now. Fuck, that's sad.

His cries raised little goosebumps down my arms, and I sat up and stared at him in the semi-darkness. He stared back for a moment, cat eyes glittering green, and then continued batting at the door. I threw a pillow at him and rolled back over. ""There's nothing out there, you mangy cat,"" I grumbled. ""Even a tough old bastard like you wouldn't last a second. It's a dead world we live in right now.""

I regretted the last sentence immediately. Why the fuck woulded I say something like that? Creepy as shit. The shadows around the room suddenly seemed ominous and alive. I groaned and shut my eyes tight, willing myself to sleep. 

Eventually, i dozed off. My dreams were vague and disturbing: flashes of my past life. My friend's face. the guy who sold me my morning bagel. My jackass (ex)boss. A strange ringing sound persisted, and I chased that, frantic to turn it off. But I couldn't find it; I just kept running into shadows of my former life, a life that was wiped off the face of the Earth. Suddenly, I ran into a graveyard. The sound was louder than ever, but I still had no idea where it was coming from. Looking around, I realized the graves were freshly dug. Some of them were still open. I peeked in one and saw an old girlfriend, rotting in a coffin. As I stared in horrified fascination, she suddenly opened her eyelids. The sockets were empty.

I awoke with a yell. My shirt was soaked with sweat and I threw it off. Cat was meowing, but I ignored him as I tried to steady my nerves. Dimly, I began to grow aware of a familiar noise...

&gt;

&gt;The __Devil's coach-horse beetle__, sometimes known as the __Cocktail beetle__  (*Ocypus olens*) is a very common and widespread European [beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle), belonging to the large family of the [rove beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rove_beetle) ([Staphylinidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylinidae)).  It was originally included in the genus *[Staphylinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylinus)* in 1764,  and some authors and biologists still use this classification. The species has also been introduced to the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas) and parts of [Australasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia).

&gt;This black beetle usually shelters during the day under stones, logs or leaf litter. It is most often seen in forests, parks and gardens between April and October.

One of my other favorites concerns an SR-71 flying not fast, but slow (apologies for the length):

As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question Iâm most often asked is âHow fast would that SR-71 fly?â I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. Itâs an interesting question, given the aircraftâs proclivity for speed, but there really isnât one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual âhighâ speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Letâs just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadnât previously seen.

So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, âWhat was the slowest you ever flew in the Blackbird?â This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.

I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 flypast. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.

Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from the 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the fieldâyet, there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. 

Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the flypast. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us, but in the overcast and haze, I couldnât see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point, we werenât really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was), the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. 

Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didnât say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 flypast he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadetâs hats were blown off and the sight of the planform of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of âbreathtakingâ very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat thereâwe hadnât spoken a word since âthe pass.â Finally, Walter looked at me and said, âOne hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?â Trying to find my voice, I stammered, âOne hundred fifty-two.â We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, âDonât ever do that to me again!â And I never did.

A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officerâs Club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 flypast that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, âIt was probably just a routine low approach; theyâre pretty impressive in that plane.â Impressive indeed.

Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. Itâs ironic that people are interested in how slow the worldâs fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, itâs always a good idea to keep that cross-check up...and keep your Mach up, too.

I expected it to be a ""secret"" isolated location, but in reality it is an hour out of Krakow (large city) and in the middle of largest industrial area of Poland.  In WWII the region was a large forced labor operation with 45 satellite camps. Only two locations were alleged to have gas chambers and on the tour the first is now downplayed as a killing site. 

The two gas chambers where 900,000 (number keeps getting revised down) were allegedly killed were located in a large residence area called Auschwitz IIâBirkenau.  

Allegedly trains pulled in right in the middle of this residence camp and people were marched about 500 yards down the middle in full view of the barrack city to the chambers. As I made the walk myself I asked the tour guide how many people in the barracks witnessed the march of death, and he answered ""very few as they were out working"".  

I also asked the guide about human remains, teeth, burial sites and he said the Germans were very through at disposal, so very little has been found. My thought on this: teeth are hard to burn, do the math on 900,000 folks. 

The chambers themselves are now mostly rubble, but were located in plain view next to a soccer field and barracks. The design and location of the ""gassing"" facility could just have easily been a delousing area.

To my eyes on the ground this site seemed like one of the oddest places I could ever imagine to gas, burn and completely dispose of 900,000 people over a year and a half.  I suppose it could be done somewhere in this large industrial region, but in a much more secluded location, away from barracks, recreation fields and using more efficient equipment.  There was even a cooking facility within sight of the chambers. Really?

Also roughly 500,000 of the alleged Birkenau victims were Hungarian Jews brought in during the summer and fall of 1944.  At Auschwitz there is a chart showing Jews in different countries, and Hungary showed an estimated 600,000. This would have been quite the operation considering that the Germans were severely lacking in rolling rail stock at the time.  

There is an account of 75,000 Hungarian Jews marched through Vienna and to Germany in the summer of 1944 to work in critical armaments factories.    So the question begs, walk the workers, but send death targets by rail over the Carpathian mountains to Poland? To make the Auschwitz math work, you have to include the Hungarian cohort and it doesn't add up. 

There is also numerous documentation that tens of thousands able bodied Hungarian Jews were mobilized to build fortifications in eastern Hungary and Slovakia. You can listen to interviews from these people in the Shoah Institute material. One said his Jewish sister was killed in an allied air raid in Budapest. 

This is not to say Jews didn't suffer. Although Auschwitz- Birkenau I barracks looked normal,  Auschwitz II didn't look like any picnic. I was surprised at how exposed it seemed to the elements and I was there on a miserable, cold, rainy summer's day. The stoves in the crowded barracks looked pretty elementary.  In late 1944-1945, conditions throughout the German occupied areas deteriorated and many people in these camps (and outside of the camps) died of diseases and bad conditions.  

I also visited a huge camp cemetery in Theresienstadt in Bohemia, Czech Republic.  There are thousands buried there of all denominations. On the graves about half had the Star of David. The dates were mostly March to June, 1945. The cause of death was an epidemic. People were still dying AFTER the camp was liberated.  

It could be argued that Jews in particular were at the bottom of the list for scarce rations and supplies during that period. Many were taken on long marches and there are reports of reprisals. Many workers in the East also escaped to the advancing Russians. My theory is that many Jews (including Anne Frank) died as conditions in occupied lands fell apart. Even larger numbers of Germans died. The overall conditions in Europe in 1945 is the real story here.

The emaciated bodies one sees in films were typhus victims. Even those spinning the gassing story state that stopped in November, 1944, and acknowledge that almost all gas was used in Poland, not in Germany.  That is fundamental for all historians on this. 

But what is most perplexing is that a conversation like this one in Europe is against the law. People go to jail having it.  History always is revised over time, is part of the process, but apparently not this history. ",,2,t3_2hw7g8,,False,False,t1_ckxa7pl

I agree with JCChurch, that some UU's see's Jesus as the son of God, and some see him as a prophet. My congregation is not Christian but we respect Jesus as a wise and holy man.  And it's Ok that others see him as more elevated than that.  You'll come to realize that a basic tenant of UU is that there are many paths, many journeys to religious truth.  We choose to respect the spiritual journey of others even if they are different from our own. We often have theme to our Sunday service that incorporate other religions-- sometimes we have a guest speaker who is Muslim, or Jewish, or UU from Europe, or Buddhist... We welcome debate and inquiry and diversity. It's not just ""tolerated"" - it's embraced.
  
We call our building that contains the sanctuary where we gather to worship our church.  But we also have a campus of buildings; so we have the Sanctuary building, and our religious education building (library, classroom, meeting rooms), and the administration building (offices) and a building we mostly rent out, and yet one more called ""holly house"" where homeless women reside. All of that campus is referred to as our church. 

We have a weekly worship, but there are activities going on in these buildings every day and every evening of the week.  You can attend class, go to yoga, send your kids to religious education, watch a compelling movie and discuss it with others, join a social justice group planning some activity, work on the landscaping with the grounds crew, join the choir, visit the library.... UUs are known for being very active in many different things.  It's part of how we build community, both with each other and within the larger neighborhoods in which our congregations meet.
And we are committed to service, hence the social justice groups. In my congregation we have 28 social justice groups. Yup, 28. 

We have an informal class that's offered once a quarter that talks about our congregation and Universalist Unitarianism.  I suspect other congregations do something similar.  It's really useful for getting to know UU.

In terms of strength, change in bodybuilders through the years: yes, peptides played a big role but not because of strength but because of its affect on size. I'd be pretty surprised to see even a single journal article suggesting that HGH has an impact on strength. Lean mass -- a bit but not anything to really consider, especially when the person is probably on AAS as well. 

If guys feel they can recover faster or vaguely 'prevent injuries' on HGH and are suggesting that they recover even faster than just on steroids, then that's fine. I can't really argue with you on that. I don't necessarily disagree either but it's probably a shitty feeling to blow out a ligament after you spent $20k over the last couple years on ""injury prevention"" stuff. Was Roger Clemens pitching at his age because of all the HGH he was taking or was the benefit 95% because of the steroids? 

Some of the stuff you mentioned in the beginning about it being proven that it boosts endurance  -- more red blood cells are better, i agree, but this is just a theoretical standpoint and when you measure people, it turns out they don't seem to actually see a difference in endurance. There are lots of studies on this and you can google. If you're just saying that it boosts endurance because of more red blood cells, that doesn't actually hold water. It's just not as effective in practice as what one would hypothesize.   It's not EPO.

HGH is expensive because not every corner of asia/eastern europe is making the stuff in a lab. The HGH market is largely human-grade stuff and then phony garbage.

That's undeniably true, as they are doing so right now.

First published in 1925, it charts a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a prosperous member of London society, as she prepares to throw a party. Writing in her diary during the writing of the book, Woolf explained what she had set out to do: 'I want to give life and death, sanity and insanity. I want to criticize the social system, and to show it at work at its most intense.' 

&gt; Celebrated for its innovative narrative technique and distillation of many of the preoccupations of 1920s Britain, *Mrs Dalloway* is now seen as a landmark of twentieth-century fiction, and one of the finest products of [literary modernism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_modernism).

Wikipedia on [**Virginia Woolf**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf):

&gt; **Adeline Virginia Woolf** (/ËwÊlf/; nÃ©e Stephen; 25 January 1882 â 28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost [modernists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernist_literature) of the twentieth century.

&gt; During the interwar period, Woolf was a significant figure in London literary society and a central figure in the influential [Bloomsbury Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group) of intellectuals. Her most famous works include the novels [*Mrs Dalloway*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Dalloway) (1925), [*To the Lighthouse*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Lighthouse) (1927) and [*Orlando*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando:_A_Biography) (1928), and the book-length essay [*A Room of One's Own*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_of_One%27s_Own) (1929), with its famous dictum, ""A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."" Woolf suffered from severe bouts of mental illness throughout her life, thought to have been the result of what is now termed [bipolar disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder), and committed suicide by drowning in 1941 at the age of 59.

And on [**literary modernism**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_modernism):

&gt; **Literary modernism**, or modernist literature, has its origins in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly in Europe and North America. Some philosophers, like [Georg Lukacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Lukacs), theorized that literary modernism had its origins in the philosophy of [Walter Benjamin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin). Modernism is characterized by a self-conscious break with traditional styles of poetry and verse. Modernists experimented with literary form and expression, adhering to [Ezra Pound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Pound)'s maxim to ""Make it new"". The modernist literary movement was driven by a conscious desire to overturn traditional modes of representation and express the new sensibilities of their time. The horrors of the [First World War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War) saw the prevailing assumptions about society reassessed. Thinkers such as [Sigmund Freud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) and [Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) questioned the rationality of mankind.

In any case, after having played primarily G&amp;K, I decided to buy BNW and play on King for one of the first times ever. I was the Celts. Grabbed Stonehenge early on, had the first pantheon (Obviously) and things generally were pretty swell. However, somehow Enrico Dandolo (The bastard) got a religion before me. Oh well, I got one later.

I did not build any scouts or did any exploring at all. I was more or less isolated to Euro-Asia, with me inhabiting Europe and Venice being in Asia.

I go for science and wonderwhoring (Monument to the Gods + Aristocracy + Awesome forest and hill start = WONDUHS), yet eventually Portugal, residing in Africa, get ahead of me in tech (Around the late medieval era). Simultaneously, my economy is pretty bad and so is my army, because I had little understanding for the value of trade routes. To top it off, Venice buys up Valletta, my most important city-state ally. In short, things aren't going all that well (I'm still second in tech, though).

By this point Brazilia and Indonesia has found me, and we and Portugal form a defensive pact alliance. Venice and I enter a cold war of religion, and I try to taunt him into attacking me because stupid unexperienced me thinks I can liberate Valletta from his control.

War comes, and Enrico has a large army that outtechs mine easily. However, by use of clever defense tactics (And Mohawk Warriors from Valletta who are badasses in forest) I manage to beat him up, and suddenly the Zulus move in from the east and takes Venice. Enrico wants peace, I declare war on the Zulus with Brazil, and I find Venice undefended. I take it with my mini-army, fend off some Zulu Impi using gatling guns, and eventually make peace.

From here, me and my buddies in the Portu-Brazili-Indo-Celtic alliance start steamrolling wars, with me at the front. Venice proves to be the best city ever: It has some really lucrative resources, a few wonders I didn't get, and easy access to Brazilian cities, so my trade and economy booms, allowing for more military (CANNONS!). I declare war on Enrico a second time, burning Budapest after realizing that its impossible to liberate, and then the Zulus attack and I move into their territory and take Nobamba. I liberate the capital of Indonesia from the Zulus after a loooong march through Brazil, use the Oxford University to grab radio, and am finally leading in tech again!

By then, tensions were building between Indonesia and Brazil over the city-state of Kathmandu which Brazil captured. I simultaneously realized Brazil was almost ahead of me in points, due to their pretty high tourism. I said ""Screw the alliance"" and denounced them, declaring war on the second turn. I was outnumbered and my troops were deep in enemy territory, but by the use of newly-researched artillery (Always the gamechanger) I liberate Kathmandu. I then keep defending the city-state until Brazil haven't got more troops to send my way, and conquer Sau Paulo with little effort. By this time, all of my allies forget their friendships with Brazil and declare war on Pedro as well, prolly because both I and Indonesia denounced him.

I make a long and ardous march through the Great Wall-boosted territory of Brazil towards Rio de Janeiro, pillaging everything in my way to keep my soldiers sustained, and for at least ten turns I artilleried' the shit outta the city (Equivalent to at least a decade or two in-game) because it has one heckofalot of defensive buildings. They kept pumping out riflemen and I lost a considerable amount of troops before the city fell. The original invasion army had shruk to a third, but in any case there weren't really many Brazilian units left to take it.

Having chosen order, I kept the lead in science (Workers faculties factory spammage), and with my seven cities I absolutely steamrolled... everything. Two eras ahead of everyone in science, so I researched GDR's before Nanotechnology, I completed all international projects so my culture and tourism boomed (Resulting in becoming influential with four civs), and I wiped out Brazil and Venice and took Assyria's capital for the lols. Even filled out the piety tree late-game to convert everyone to druidism.

In short, because the Zulus exploited Venice killing off their armies fighting me, and then decided to leave their conquered city unattended, I made one heck of a comeback.",,2,t3_2hy3s9,denmark,False,False,t1_ckxb5f4

Prior to the therapy, Mia had told Allen that he was being too physical with Dylan, and looked at her sexually. The therapist had at the time concluded that Woody Allen's behavior was not sexual, but overly intense and exclusive to the other children. However, even if his actions were not sexual at that time, his behavior matches those of sexual abusers who are grooming their victims. (Perion) It's not surprising that he did not act overtly sexual when being closely scrutinized by a therapist. Even after discovering the Soon-Yi relationship, Mia Farrow was cautiously allowing supervised visitation of Woody Allen with Dylan, which doesn't mesh with the theory that she was concocting a convoluted plot against Woody Allen.

You claim that Mia Farrow accused Woody Allen of molesting Dylan immediately after finding out about his relationship with Soon-Yi. This is absolutely not true. Mia Farrow did not report Woody Allen to the police. She did not even instigate the questioning. The original impetus for Mia questioning her daughter was an event that occurred while she was absent. Here is what began the claim in its entirety: 

&gt; ""On August 4, 1992, Mr. Allen travelled to Ms. Farrow's Connecticut vacation home to spend time with his children. Earlier in the day, Casey Pascal had come for a visit with her three young children and their babysitter, Alison Stickland. Ms. Farrow and Ms. Pascal were shopping when Mr. Allen arrived. Those present were Ms. Pascal's three children; Ms. Stickland; Kristie Groteke, a babysitter employed by Ms. Farrow; Sophie Berge, a French tutor for the children; Dylan; and Satchel.

&gt; Ms. Farrow had previously instructed Ms. Groteke that Mr. Allen was not to be left alone with Dylan. For a period of fifteen or twenty minutes during the afternoon, Ms. Groteke was unable to locate Mr. Allen or Dylan. After looking for them in the house, she assumed that they were outside with the others. But neither Ms. Berge nor Ms. Stickland was with Mr. Allen or Dylan. Ms. Groteke made no mention of this to Ms. Farrow on August 4.

&gt; During a different portion of the day, Ms. Stickland went to the television room in search of one of Ms. Pascal's children. She observed Mr. Allen kneeling in front of Dylan with his head on her lap, facing her body. Dylan was sitting on the couch staring vacantly in the direction of a television set.

&gt; After Ms. Farrow returned home, Ms. Berge noticed that Dylan was not wearing anything under her sundress. She told asked Ms. Groteke to put underpants on Dylan.

&gt; Ms. Stickland testified that during the evening of August 4, she told Ms. Pascal, âI had seen something at Miaâs that day that was bothering me.â She revealed what she had seen in the television room. On August 5, Ms. Pascal telephoned Ms. Farrow to tell her what Ms. Stickland had observed. Ms. Farrow testified that after she hung up the telephone, she asked Dylan, who was sitting next to her, ""whether it was true that daddy had his face in her lap yesterday."" Ms. Farrow testified:
Dylan said yes. And then she said that she didn't like it one bit, no, he was breathing into her, into her legs, she said. And that he was holding her around the waist and I said, why didn't you get up and she said she tried to but that he put his hands underneath her and touched her. And she showed me where . . . Her behind.
Because she was already uncomfortable with Mr. Allen's inappropriate behavior toward Dylan and because she believed that her concerns were not being taken seriously enough by Dr. Schultz and Dr. Coates, Ms. Farrow videotaped Dylan's statements. Over the next twenty-four hours, Dylan told Ms. Farrow that she had been with Mr. Allen in the attic and that he had touched her privates with his finger.

&gt; After Dylan's first comments, Ms. Farrow telephoned her attorney for guidance. She was advised to bring Dylan to her pediatrician, which she did immediately. Dylan did not repeat the accusation of sexual abuse during this visit and Ms. Farrow was advised to return with Dylan on the following day. On the trip home, she explained to her mother that she did not like talking about her privates. On August 6, when Ms. Farrow went back to Dr. Kavirajan's office, Dylan repeated that she had told her mother on August 5. A medical examination conducted on August 9 showed no physical evidence of sexual abuse.

&gt; Although Dr. Schultz was vacationing in Europe, Ms. Farrow telephoned her daily for advice. Ms. Farrow also notified Dr. Coates, who was still treating Satchel. She said to Dr. Coates, ""it sounds very convincing to me, doesn't it to you. It is so specific. Let's hope it is her fantasy."" Dr. Coates immediately notified Mr. Allen of the childâs accusation and then contacted the New York City Child Welfare Administration. Seven days later, during a meeting of the lawyers at which settlement discussions were taking place, Mr. Allen began this action for custody.""

The EU paid some money but also wrecked some local businesses as we can no longer protect them with tariffs or anything. We can no longer forbid rich foreigners to buy up agricultural land. We can no longer make laws that treat local businesses preferentially. So overally being in the EU means  the government can no longer protect the country and local businesses from the huge economic power of Western competition.

Once in the EU, our sugar industry had to cut back production to obey EU quotas. Then the rich swine in the West basically bought the quota of our own rich swine who owns these businesses so then they stopped producing and fired the workers and the government could not do a thing!

Here we have about 4 Western owned grocery chains and only 1 local owned.

Overally the country is not becoming any richer or better organized due to it, and there is a certain loss of independence and being exposed to very powerful and rich Western business interests.

Maybe if our own elites are not corrupted swine and actually use and not abuse the EU opportunities it would have worked better. But our original hope was that the EU sort of ""overrides"" our corrupted swine elites and does good in spite of them. Well, they don't, and well, it seems the EU looks out mainly for large Western business interests. The EU, to a large extent, is Tesco, Aldi, Spar, Auchan, Media Markt, Penny Market, Obi, Baumax, Raiffeisen, UniCredit,  and everything else that kills the local businesses and destroys jobs and creates only a handful of low-paid retail jobs.

So my experience is not that positive. The EU pays money, but takes away all the protections. Not sure if a good deal at all.

If I could turn back the clock I would say we should have gotten rich first, more properly: should have really entrenched our businesses, then join the EU.

So basically all I am saying the EU is great if a country who is already roughly equal with the West and has decent elites joins it, but when it is inferior, then the EU kills the local business, and if it is corrupted, then the EU does not or cannot override the local elites so it just pays money in the pockets of the corrupted local elites.",,2,t1_ckwov5c,,False,False,t1_ckxbiii

You may or may not have a point with SCG there, who knows? But this quote... naah

Let's have a look at the prices in Germany, Europe.. I use magickartenmarkt.de as a source, assuming we don't want to buy from scammy sellers, we have:

- Sarkhan 20 â¬

- Rabblemaster 10 â¬

- Fetches 13-16 â¬ (blue vs. non-blue, you get it)

- Knuckleblade 4 â¬

- Sorin 13 â¬

- Siege Rhino 3-4 â¬

So.. while I don't know the exact currency translation rate, I feel like most of these cards are only a bit cheaper here than in the US. $20 for a Rabblemaster may not be 10 â¬, but it's also not ""not even half"".

I'm not debating that different markets like different things, I still think the Western cover is absolute trash.

You can absolutely get a halfway decent bike for 10k for tootling around on (particularly if you go second hand) but forget getting a decent road bike new for 10k. You should be looking at a hybrid. Any new road bike you buy for 10k will be shit. Guaranteed. But you might be able to get a half decent hybrid for that amount.

Those ""shabby"" second hand road bikes for 5k could be crap, or they could be an absolute steal. Impossible to know without seeing them. I have seen very decent secondhand bikes at very good prices, but you have to know what you are looking at. There was a guy in Mae Sot with a load of good stuff, and another one I remember in Chiang Mai.

It might be possible, if you were lucky, to get a classic steel road bike from the 80s/90s in reasonable working condition at the sort of prices you are talking about, that might be your best bet. I've seen decent looking rideable steel bikes like this as low as $50-70 in Cambodia, I know a guy who rode from Phnom Penh to Vientiane to Bangkok on one, so it was solid, and I imagine similar is available here somewhere.

I know of quite a number of good bike shops in Bangkok (particularly Bok Bok and Velo Thailand) but I can't recall anywhere that sold decent second hand bikes, I was never looking for them.

I paid almost 6,000B just to change the shifters on my tourer/road bike recently in Korat, and that was for the cheapest shifters available. The next level up, to match the rest of the group on it would have cost 10,000B. And that was a good price, less than I'd pay in Europe. JUST FOR THE SHIFTERS.

Road bike stuff is expensive, at that price range if going new a hybrid is your best bet. If second hand, it really is difficult to tell if you know nothing about bikes, best test ride it and try to figure out as best as you can if it looks like it will fall apart in a week or not. There are a lot of parts on bikes that can wear (tyres, chains, chainrings, cassettes) and these can be quite expensive if you ended up having to replace all of them.

Catholics are not a minority, they don't need protection. They are the largest, most well funded and deeply established religious organization on Earth. The only reason Catholics got lumped in was because of the French Catholic vs. English Protestant history that claimed so many lives in Europe. Now French is much less closely connected with Catholic and that means that we are offering differing protections to cultural groups people based upon their religious affiliations, which is an unintended consequence of the deal that wasn't considered over a century ago. 


I agree that changing of the foundational documents of Canada should be carefully considered. This would be my agrument. In the very near future, another religious group will overtake Catholics as a percentage of the population. They will have very valid grounds to argue for the right to establish separate school systems, protected within our (understandaby) very hard to change constitution. Then we will have 2 religious indoctrination systems. Then sometime in the future a 3rd religious group will grow in importance and we will have 3 separate indoctrination systems. So your slippery slope argument can also be made in the other direction and is generally the reason why slippery slope arguments are not considered strong arguments.


If we keep Catholic schools, other religious groups will go after the right to educate their children in a system separate from the rest of society.

So I guess, even if it does play a role, then it is possible that kind of mass media is reflecting the elites of Hollywood and New York and not really what happens all over America.

Overally, probably, no. My first bet would be that multiculturalism happened faster than people could get used to it.

&gt;__Section 29__ of the *[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms)* is the section of *Charter* that most specifically addresses rights regarding [denominational schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denominational_school) and [separate schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_school). Section 29 is not the source of these rights but instead reaffirms the pre-existing special rights belonging to [Roman Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic) and [Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant), despite [freedom of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion) and religious [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_equality) under [sections 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_Two_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms) and [15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_Fifteen_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms) of the *Charter*. Such rights may include financial support from the [provincial governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada). In the case *[Mahe v. Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahe_v._Alberta)* (1990), the [Supreme Court of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada) also had to reconcile denominational school rights with [minority language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_language) [educational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Canada) rights under [section 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_Twenty-three_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms) of the *Charter*.

Other factors shown to influence outcome are the age of patient, patient payment exception status, patientattendancepattern and placement of a root filling in the same course of treatment.
 
 
**Endodontically treated teeth**
 
Ploumaki et al 2013 sys rev investigating prosthetic restorations on endodontically treated teeth 6 year follow up:
Success rate single crowns 92%, 79% for FDPs and 66% for abutments for removable prosthesis (based on only one study)
Without post 94% and with a post 92%
Cast post and cores 93% and prefabricated posts 94%
 
Hansen et al 1990 20 year follow up of endo treated teeth with amalgam
Posterior teeth restored with amalgam without cuspal coverage showed that fracture was a significant problem with maxillary bicuspids with MOD restorations showing the lowest survival rates and 2nd max molars showing the most serious fractures resulting in extraction.
 
Hansen et al 1988 showed that MOD composites showed greater fracture resistance than amalgam but only up to 3 years.
 
Fennis et al 2002 showed that crowns significantly improve the success for posterior teeth
 
Stavropoulou 2007 Syst rev reviewed single crowns on endodontically treated teeth and examined the 10 year survival
81% for crowned teeth and 63% for teeth restored with a direct restoration
Fedorowicz 2012 sys rev cochrane found insufficient evidence to support or refute one treatment option over another
 
Aquilino et al 2002 found that endodontically treated teeth without crowns failed at a 6 times greater rate than uncrowned teeth
 
Bolla et al 2006 Cochrane systematic review compared metal and non-metal posts:
In one study, non-metal posts induced fewer failures. High risk of bias. Carbon fibre posts.
 
Ferrari 2000 carried out a retrospective study of fiber posts and found 2% endodontic failure at 4 years for teeth restored with carbon fibre posts and 3% endodontic failure for teeth restored with cast post and core

Single surface amalgam 58%
MOD amalgams 43%
Glass ionomer restorations 38%
 
Burke et al 2012 Class V restorations
60.5% survived 5 years. Glass ionomer was associated with reduced treatment to failure time.
 
 
**Tooth wear**
 
Poyser et al 2007 (2.5yr) and Al-Khayatt et al (7 year) prospective split mouth clinical trial, direct composites lower anterior tooth wear
At 2.5yrs complete failure occurred in 6% of the restorations
At 7 years, survival of the restorations was noted as 85%. 53% of patients experienced survival of all their restorations. For the majority of patients, the restorations offered the patients a high degree of patient satisfaction and an acceptable level ofmaintenance.
 
Gulamali et al 2011 Survival of composite Dahl restorations placed to manage localised anterior tooth wear 10 yr
Medial survival time for the composite restorations was 5.8yrs and 4.75yrs for the replacement restorations
Patient satisfaction high
 
Hemmings 2000
Success rate of 89% at 30 months for the use of direct composites placed at an increased OVD on maxillary anterior teeth
 
Smales et al Compared direct and indirect composites for tooth wear
10 year follow up, survival of 62% for direct and 74.5% for indirect composites
 
Bartlett et al 2006. Posterior composites for tooth wear
28% restorations were lost and 22% fractured over 3 years
They suggested that the use of composites for the restoration of tooth wear in posterior teeth was contraindicated
 
 
 
**Inlays and Onlays**
 
Manhart 2004
Indirect restorations overall did better than direct restorations. Posterior indirect restorations all have annual failure rates less than 2%. However this is based on a poor level of evidence.
 
 
**Vitality following crown and bridge preps**
 
Cheung et al 2005
10 year survival rates of the pulp for crown retainers 84.4% and bridge retainers 70.8%
15 year survival rates of the pulp for crown retainers 81.2% and bridge retainers 66.2%
 
Saunders and Saunders 1998 looking at the prevalence of periapical periodontitis associated with crowned teeth in the Scottish population 19%
 
 
**Caries management**
 
Ricketts et al 2013 systematic review caries management
Stepwise caries removal resulted in a 56% reduction of pulp exposure compared with complete caries removal
Partial caries removal reduced pulp exposure by 77% compared with complete caries removal. No difference in terms of signs and symptoms.

Any small outbreaks such as this one are likely to be contained (although in this case, infection is unlikely to be limited to just this one person).

What worries me is if it spreads to large high-population African countries (e.g. Nigeria, Egypt), and becomes endemic there. A large disease pool in a high populous country with poor healthcare would inevitably mean that the disease would spread to it's neighbours. Nigeria could infect most of the rest of Africa. Egypt could infect large parts of the middle east (particularly the war torn parts).

From either of these areas, the disease could easily jump to India, which wouldn't be able to cope. And India is enormous and has a great deal of contact with the rest of the world. If the disease gets established in India, it would inevitably spread to other high population countries nearby, such as Pakistan, Indonesia and China. At that stage it would be impossible to stop it from going global. The west could not cut itself off, and would face so many individual outbreaks that health services would be overwhelmed.

I'm not saying that will happen. That's a worst case scenario.

If you add that to the de-facto monopoly in telecommunications, the picture is complete.

You have quite good infrastructure. While southern Italy maybe behind western European standards, northern Italy is more than up to standards. Of course there is room for improvment such as lowering price of energy, but that the only way to do that is to build nuclear power.

&gt; Hiring and firing employees is already easy. They only give temporary employment (one year) contracts since basically 15 years.

Hiring and firing of permanent employees is not easy and that is the problem.

* Many bigger companies have big amounts of redundant and ineffective permanent workers. They can't get rid of those and they need to use younger less expensive temporary workers to fill the caps. Essentially older generations are making the younger generations to pay.
* Temporary year long contracts still posses risks. Market situation can change radically quickly thus in worst case scenario you have people doing nothing for the rest of the year.
*  Temporary year long contracts don't buy employee loaylty. If you are employing high valued personel, you need to secure them, you need to have permanent contracts.

I for example have a permanent contract with my employeer. It means that they can't just dismiss me if they don't like my face. However if in case...

* I fail constantly at my work or behave uncostructively, they can start a procedure to fire me: essentially two written warnings that are accepted by me and the union representative to be valid, which after they could fire me with 1 months compensation (have been only a year at current employeer). The compensation can be max 6 months pay with requirement to work the whole time, but that can be only reached if I stay 10 years in the same employer.
* Market situation, production or fiscal conditions change and there are redundant workers, firm can start a procedure to fire employees by initiating co-operation negotiations which after they can fire employees they don't need. Of course they can't start another round of layoffs in the next 6 months, and if they start hiring again, they need to first check availability of workers from people who were fired.

So this is the situation in Finland, and the unfortunate trueth is that our legislation is still too rigid and unflexible for small companies.

&gt;  Banks don't give house loans on such contracts, and if you get sick or pregnant, you are not renewed.

Italian banks requirements to get loans are ridiculously hard thanks to legislation. In here 75% of the value of the appartment/house being bought acts as collateral, 10% can be handled by taking an additional insurance, and the last 15% you need to handle by yourself, for example having your parents give collateral or you having that capital already.

Anyways, your banks and housing markets are another big internal problem that your legislation has created. First of all, there isn't enough new housing being build. Part of the reason being that constructors sell appartment buildins as whole, not as parts. In here we have such thing called as a housing company. When an constructor constructs a new housing complex, they transfer actual owning of the complex to a new company, which issues then stock back to the constructor that allows holder of stocks to live in an appartment. These stocks are then sold to people. In here, most appartment complexes are their own companies which are owned by the actual people living in those appartments. Secondly there isn't enough financing made available to people, the case about your banks having crazy requirements to give new loans.

&gt; Additionally, growing these industries is not easy because growing an industry requires entrepreneur training and networking, something we haven't done for either political or logistic reasons.

When you make starting and running an company easy, anybody with a business idea can do it. You don't need entrepreneur training to be an entrepneur. Most Finnish start-ups have grown from non-business people. Creating a company usually involves people with actual skills: building or creating something.",,1,t1_ckxbrr8,FINL,False,False,t1_ckxc7p0

As for the reason spare tyres have dissapeared from cars in general, in europe it's do with emissions.  A spare tyre is extra mass in the car.  This means the engine has to work harder and thus it produces more emissions.  This in turn can mean that car is more expensive to tax (in the UK vehicles are taxed based on their emissions.  The higher the emissions, the higher the tax.  IF you're below 100g of CO2 per Km then you pay Â£0 tax).

So as a simple solution to reduce weight and therefore emissions manufacturers have removed spare tyres from many vehicles.  Oh and this is also saving them a small fortune.  Thus the spare tyre is listed as an optional extra on many new cars and dealers have to notify customers that having it may impact the tax band their car sits in.

Smarter customers (or better said, smart dealers) are advised to purchase the car without the spare wheel in order to get the lower tax band.  They are then told to purchase the spare wheel separately as the Government can't revise the tax band after the car has been sold new, it's effectively ""locked"".

Some cars, like my own, however have to have the spare wheel specced at the factory.  In my case, it's due to the fact that the car is so small, the spare wheel has to be bolted to the UNDERSIDE of the car.  Good luck getting that out easily!

I think the Germans can certainly be criticised for foisting their inflation phobic, mercantilist agenda onto the rest of Europe.   This has caused terrible damage.

When it comes to dealing with that, it's a question of priorities.

I think it's more important to create the economic conditions that lean away from catastrophic political error such as electing Le Pen as President of France in 2022.

Much of the data I'm compiling suggests there was an origin point in history where many world myths and religions converge. Its based on the Nostratic hypothesis, (a hypothetical language which helps to connect Middle Eastern myths with Indo European traditions). This model would have to take place some time in the Epipaleolithic era (15,000 BCE), where the Indo-European, Altaic and Afroasiatic language converge.

On examining the comparative myths between Mesopotamia and the proto-Indo Europeans, you begin to find many similarities (e.g. the slaying of dragon by a sky god, a decent into the underworld by a love goddess, and the creation of the world from the body of a primordial god). 

In order to reconcile the linguistic differences between these two language groups, some scholars have proposed the Nostratic dialect, which if correct, would place the origins of polytheism in the late Stone Age.

It depends on how long you are going for. If you can plan your route and search out scenic ones, that aren't completely broken, using google maps street view then I believe this is the best method. 

For long tours it won't bother you that you just spent two or three days on the side of a motorway, there's most likely something great somewhere no matter what route you choose but if you are going for a week it will be miserable. 

Anything shorter than three weeks and you should have at least checked out the roads where you are going. It's also nice to put together a little pack of things you might want to see as you could end up missing a whole bunch of cool stuff because you never knew to look.

Income Tax is in place to pay for state run services that every citizen be they rich or poor has an equal right to access. Until the creation of Irish Water that list was to name but a few water services, road services, medical services, primary education services, social services etc... etc...

Now, I have no issue with paying for a service like water, we are after all at odds with the rest of the European Union and their is dreadful waste of water in Irish households. 

That's all well and good, but the primary issue for me is that another state run service meant to be covered by all means of taxation (that's usually never ringfenced) be it income tax, VAT etc is being converted into a semi state quango that is costing the taxpayer more money, not less. 

Yes, water is a finite resource but the problem in the water system isn't  caused by the tax payer. Local and national government had large sums of money available to them to fix this problem in the 'tiger' years but chose to inflate public sector wages and spend generously on roads to the middle of nowhere to name but a few nuggets of waste.

Income TAX, USC, VAT etc isn't going to drop now they've wrangled yet another service out of the hands of the government ready to privatise when they need it. Why? Because overall government misspend hasn't been addressed. Public sector pay is on average still 48% higher than private sector pay. Today they announced they might look at reversing some of those largely irrelevant cut backs they implemented now the good times are rolling again (http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/public-sector-staff-in-line-for-reversal-of-pay-and-pension-cuts-30494594.html) or how about this nugget ""Any Ministers (including the Taoiseach and TÃ¡naiste), Ministers of State and the Attorney General, who are based outside Dublin and have a second home in the capital, are entitled to have water charges deductible as an expense for tax purposes"" from http://www.thejournal.ie/ministers-dual-abode-allowance-irish-water-charges-1699090-Sep2014/.

So if you accept that you have to pay for water charges, that's fine, but at least expect your overall bill of running the bloody country to come down, but that's not going to happen! Once this goes through you'll be sure to see rising prices of education and other services that can be siphoned off.

We don't have sites, we don't have uranium, we don't have places for waste, we don't have the skills (all research was shut down in 1986), we have a highly seismic, highly prone to floods country. 

You have enough sites, for crying out loud, Japanease have enough sites, so should you. In case of uranium, you buy that from the world markets, the French would be eager to supply you. Same too with plants. And at the end of day when storing the waste, you just build a large tunnel deep enough and that is the end of that.

&gt; We could produce tons of solar energy, but the germans prefer to put thousans of solar panels on their roofs that generate close to nothing, instead of saying: hi italians. You have a lot of sun, we buy solar panels, you install them on your roofs, and you give back the energy to us. That's european collaboration. What they are doing is not.

You could not produce solar panels, you and neither Germans are competetive against Chinease producers. Not to mention that the whole deal with solar is just huge waste of money. Without subsidies, nobody in Europe would be installing solar panels.

&gt;  And you think that firing them would solve the issue? Yes, you probably keep the company alive, but now you have plenty of unemployed people.

Is it really better to drive the company to a point where it can't anymore invest into itself and is essentially a zombie, or in a worst case scenario goes bankcrupt? Then you don't have that company anymore and you still have all those people unemployed. No, the better idea is to let companies scale down operations if and when they need to do so. 

&gt; I can guarantee there are plenty of houses that have been built and sit unsold since ten years. The building market is oversaturated.

I doubt that. If there would be enough housing, young Italians would move out from their parents either when they start to study or atleast when they graduate and get their first job. However as that isn't happening, I would think there to be a problem with the amount of housing.

&gt;  Yes, that's like in Denmark and Sweden. They are long term scams. They force you to pay a lot every month, and they are in practice rentals, where suddenly the association decides to redo all the kitchens and you have to shell out other money, Additionally, the apartment is not yours and you can't do anything with it except live in it. That's also why your rental market is fucked up.

No, you are mixing **housing stock companies** to **right to occupy the appartment housing companies**. In **housing stock company** you buy shares of the company that give ownershpi and right to live/handle certain appartment. In **right to occupy the apartment housing companies** you buy just the right to live in an appartment, not ownership of the housing company itself. Most appartments in here are of type **housing stock company**.

For example, my appartment building just turned 54 year old and thus we had a big renovatio: water pipes and plumming; electricity; heating; etc.. systems renewed. The cost of the renovation is 1500e per sqm. Our **housing stock company** takes care of everything including getting approx 1.5 million EUR loan from the bank. After the renovation is over, we the shareholders have a chance to either pay back our share immidiately or in the next 10 years time.

It is really handy way to organize everything, and it really doesn't cost much. My appartment is only 22.5sqm and I pay arround 120e per month as maintenance charge that includes Property tax + Water + Heat + Cleaning of common areas + Other maintenance + Company Burecracy (which is outsourced to a hosting company)

&gt; But you need to be one not to go bankrupt.

&gt; The Kaiser thinks that general war can be avoided. That, if the Austrians strike while all of Europe is enraged over this assassination [...], no one will raise a finger to defend Serbia. (0:57)

True, the Kaiser and many of his associates initially thought that Russia wouldn't intervene in the war and some even thought Austria would back out of a conflict entirely. Though others were absolutely certain it would culminate into a grand war and still urged the Kaiser to sign his blank cheque. 

&gt; But in Austria there's disagreement. The Hungarian part of the Empire initially objects to war. They hope that a peaceful solution might be found. But their voices are alone. (0:34) [...] So at last the Hungarians relented on one condition: [...] that the AH Empire would not annex a foot of Serbian land. (2:00)

The main objection to war came from the Hungarian prime minister IstvÃ¡n Tisza, yes. But not because he was such a friend of Serbia or even a particularly peaceful man. His only worry was that annexation of Serbia into the Empire would increase the already huge Slavic population of the Hungarian half drastically, further weakening the Magyar hegemony. Thus, his objection to a war meant to eradicate a free Serbia's influence up until the moment it was agreed on that subjugation of the Serbs would not lead to a direct increase in Slavic lands.

&gt; Two men, rivals, in the heart of Serbia, in Belgrade [...] are two of the only men farsighted enough to see the clouds gathering on the edge of Europe. They are the ambassador from Austria and the ambassador from Russia to Serbia. [...] So they plan to put aside their differences and meet to perhaps work out a plan for peace. (2:17)

The two did meet that day and Nicholas Hartwig did indeed die of a massive heart attack in the house of Baron von Giesl, leading to assassination rumors.

But while I don't know the extent of their talks that day I doubt that two ambassadors between themselves had the authority and will to sign anything important enough to stop a war. Especially when one of the parties had instructions from Vienna that a war ""had to happen"" and the other side was a man known as ""more Serbian than a Serb"" who had for years propagated pro-confrontational and anti-Habsburg policies with his huge influence on the Serbian government.

&gt; [the words ""Balkan Crisis"" dancing in the background] (4:42)

A small thing but the term ""Balkan crisis"" generally denotes the events from 1875 to 1878. Widespread Christian revolts in the Ottoman Empire that led to a declaration of war by the protector of the Slavs, Russia, together with Serbia, Romania and Montenegro and eventually culminated in an almost complete loss of the Ottoman Balkan and massive land gains for the winning parties and a new Bulgaria.

&gt; Now it's noon. [Russian foreign minister] Sasonov takes lunch with the French and British ambassador. The French ambassador reiterates France's complete support. (5:35)

He might have reiterated it, but the defining moment of the Franco-Russian alliance was PoincarÃ©'s visit in St. Petersburg where he personally confirmed France's complete support in case of war, sometimes called the second blank ceque.

&gt; If they don't work together all the crowns in Europe will fall. And he's right. Within 5 years all the true monarchies in Europe, monarchies where the monarch was the head of state, would collapse. (6:15)

So a true monarch is one who is also head of state? Like... every extant monarchy in Europe?

The four ""true monarchies"" mentioned also weren't that special. Franz Joseph liked to think of himself as an absolutistic ruler but he himself for the most part hadn't been involved with the important internal politics for a long time and even Russia had had to grant a parliament.

&gt; Sasonov utters the words ""if Austria-Hungary swallows Serbia, we will go to war"". (6:57)

This whole story about the ""last chance for peace"" and the German ambassador being uninformed about a vital decision is just utterly wrong. Austria-Hungary might have officially resigned from any claims on Serbian land to add to their Empire but it was no question that the Serbian state was supposed to be cut down severely by gifting large territories to allied Balkan states. A secret plan that had become public due to some blabbermouth in the London embassy and even led to harsh critique by the German chancellor. And the promise hadn't been all that trusted anyway.

I might also add the first one later.

Anyway, I'll copy it here as well. Gotta keep this sub's mean word count up, AskScience is just waiting for us to get lazy to ursurp our position!

&gt; The Kaiser thinks that general war can be avoided. That, if the Austrians strike while all of Europe is enraged over this assassination [...], no one will raise a finger to defend Serbia. (0:57)

True, the Kaiser and many of his associates initially thought that Russia wouldn't intervene in the war and some even thought Austria would back out of a conflict entirely. Though others were absolutely certain it would culminate into a grand war and still urged the Kaiser to sign his blank cheque. 

&gt; But in Austria there's disagreement. The Hungarian part of the Empire initially objects to war. They hope that a peaceful solution might be found. But their voices are alone. (0:34) [...] So at last the Hungarians relented on one condition: [...] that the AH Empire would not annex a foot of Serbian land. (2:00)

The main objection to war came from the Hungarian prime minister IstvÃ¡n Tisza, yes. But not because he was such a friend of Serbia or even a particularly peaceful man. His only worry was that annexation of Serbia into the Empire would increase the already huge Slavic population of the Hungarian half drastically, further weakening the Magyar hegemony. Thus, his objection to a war meant to eradicate a free Serbia's influence up until the moment it was agreed on that subjugation of the Serbs would not lead to a direct increase in Slavic lands.

&gt; Two men, rivals, in the heart of Serbia, in Belgrade [...] are two of the only men farsighted enough to see the clouds gathering on the edge of Europe. They are the ambassador from Austria and the ambassador from Russia to Serbia. [...] So they plan to put aside their differences and meet to perhaps work out a plan for peace. (2:17)

The two did meet that day and Nicholas Hartwig did indeed die of a massive heart attack in the house of Baron von Giesl, leading to assassination rumors.

But while I don't know the extent of their talks that day I doubt that two ambassadors between themselves had the authority and will to sign anything important enough to stop a war. Especially when one of the parties had instructions from Vienna that a war ""had to happen"" and the other side was a man known as ""more Serbian than a Serb"" who had for years propagated pro-confrontational and anti-Habsburg policies with his huge influence on the Serbian government.

&gt; [the words ""Balkan Crisis"" dancing in the background] (4:42)

A small thing but the term ""Balkan crisis"" generally denotes the events from 1875 to 1878. Widespread Christian revolts in the Ottoman Empire that led to a declaration of war by the protector of the Slavs, Russia, together with Serbia, Romania and Montenegro and eventually culminated in an almost complete loss of the Ottoman Balkan and massive land gains for the winning parties and a new Bulgaria.

&gt; Now it's noon. [Russian foreign minister] Sasonov takes lunch with the French and British ambassador. The French ambassador reiterates France's complete support. (5:35)

He might have reiterated it, but the defining moment of the Franco-Russian alliance was PoincarÃ©'s visit in St. Petersburg where he personally confirmed France's complete support in case of war, sometimes called the second blank ceque.

&gt; If they don't work together all the crowns in Europe will fall. And he's right. Within 5 years all the true monarchies in Europe, monarchies where the monarch was the head of state, would collapse. (6:15)

So a true monarch is one who is also head of state? Like... every extant monarchy in Europe?

The four ""true monarchies"" mentioned also weren't that special. Franz Joseph liked to think of himself as an absolutistic ruler but he himself for the most part hadn't been involved with the important internal politics for a long time and even Russia had had to grant a parliament.

&gt; Sasonov utters the words ""if Austria-Hungary swallows Serbia, we will go to war"". (6:57)

This whole story about the ""last chance for peace"" and the German ambassador being uninformed about a vital decision is just utterly wrong. Austria-Hungary might have officially resigned from any claims on Serbian land to add to their Empire but it was no question that the Serbian state was supposed to be cut down severely by gifting large territories to allied Balkan states. A secret plan that had become public due to some blabbermouth in the London embassy and even led to harsh critique by the German chancellor. And the promise hadn't been all that trusted anyway.

Not to mention that ""we have no interest in land gains from this"" was one of the first and loudest things the Austrians told the Tsar.",,3,t1_ckxad9c,europe,False,False,t1_ckxdl0j

The overall narrative is roughly the same. In the past forty years, historians have spent a lot of time fleshing out the entire story -- I haven't seen the World at War since I was a kid, so my memory is hazy, but here are a few things that I think you should keep an eye out for:

1. The emphasis on the West as the driver of the European War. In reality, most of the fighting and dying took place in the East, with Russia deserving far more credit than it got during the Cold War for defeating Hitler.

2. In the Pacific, pay attention to how they frame and and narrate the war. Racism played a far larger role (on all sides) than anyone liked to admit 40 years ago.

3. Pay attention to the 'epic battle' narrative that was once used to describe the Eastern Front. Scholarship now is generally moving toward the view that the East was too big to be won or lost in a single battle.

4. Beware of how Nazification is treated. Though most German soldiers weren't die-hard Nazis, the myth that the Wehrmacht was some noble institution fighting for Germany (rather than the Nazis) is fairly false, especially in the East. By the end of the war, the Wehrmacht was one of the strongest bastions of Nazi support.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib

&gt;Imatinib (INN), **marketed by Novartis as Gleevec** (Canada, South Africa and the USA) or Glivec (Australia, Europe and Latin America), and sometimes referred to by its investigational name STI-571, is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple cancers, most notably Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).[1]


The point of this post was that deregulation has made these medicines unaffordable to common man and in your comment you abuse the government for it, but the fact remains that it isn't going to affect the man who can't afford as anyway he would've gone for the generic â¹1800 medicine instead of â¹8000 one.

Nobody is making the poor man suffer! Generics aren't affected, they are not getting expensive.

Also I fully don't understand the reason, but the Glivec price has got something to do with

Ja det er mega unfair. Det er fordi DONG er en statsejet virksomhed. Det kan godt vÃ¦re de selv kalder sig privatiserede, men det er stadig staten der sidder pÃ¥ aktiemajoriteten. Samme gÃ¸r sig gÃ¦ldende for DSB og sÃ¥ vidt jeg ved ogsÃ¥ Post Danmark og sikkert flere jeg ikke lige kan komme i tanke om. 

Jeg spekulerer nogle gange pÃ¥ om de danske politikere egentlig er bekendt med EU reglerne om offentlig udlicitering. AltsÃ¥ at man ikke mÃ¥ give upartisk statsstÃ¸tte til en konkret virksomhed ,der skal konkurrere med andre private virksomheder om at udfÃ¸re den samme offentligt udliciterede opgave. 

DSB modtager statsstÃ¸tte fra staten til at udfÃ¸re de togdriftsopgaver, som er offentligt udliciteret af BaneDanmark. Det kan godt vÃ¦re de bare kalder det et aktieejerskab med underskud, men nÃ¥r alt kommer til alt, sÃ¥ kan penge gÃ¥ to veje. Ned i kassen, eller op af kassen. DÃ¦kker staten dit underskud hvert Ã¥r, sÃ¥ fÃ¥r du statsstÃ¸tte. LÃ¦ngere er den ikke. Brud pÃ¥ EU-reglerne.

&gt; Nogle gange er efterspÃ¸rgslen der nemlig, men bare ikke incitamentet. Manglende incitament kunne lige sÃ¥ godt vÃ¦re at et firma havde ""monopol"" og tjente gode penge pÃ¥ trods af at kunderne Ã¸nskede sig noget bedre. 

Det er rigtigt nok. Monopol er en frygtelig ting, men skal man vÃ¦lge mellem monopol hos en privat koncern, eller monopol hos staten, sÃ¥ vil jeg nok give dig ret i at staten trods alt er en mere upartisk spiller med mere incitament for at gavne samfundet som helhed frem for at pleje egeninteressen for nogle fÃ¥ aktionÃ¦rer. Har man et konkret marked, hvor det nÃ¦sten er umuligt at etablere en god fri konkurrence, sÃ¥ kan det direkte vÃ¦re fornuftigt at staten overtager det. 
Et fuldstÃ¦ndigt glimrende eksempel pÃ¥ dette er banedrift. Der kan ikke vÃ¦re forskellige rivaliserende baneselskaber der har hvert deres banenetvÃ¦rk og forsÃ¸ger Ã¸delÃ¦gge hinandens mulighed for at trÃ¦kke bane fra x til y, mens de prÃ¸ver at udkonkurrere hinandens geografiske dÃ¦kning, ligger i vejen for hinanden og ikke ville lade hinanden krydse deres linjer osv. Der vil uundgÃ¥eligt opstÃ¥ monopol. Er man fÃ¸rst blevet nr. 1 i at have banenetvÃ¦rk over hele Danmark, sÃ¥ er det marked sgu ligesom lukket. Der synes jeg sÃ¥dan set, det er fuldstÃ¦ndigt fornuftigt at have en statsinstitution som BaneDanmark, i stedet for at have et eller andet rÃ¥ddent privat firma.

I tilfÃ¦ldet med datanetvÃ¦rket, synes jeg ikke den er nÃ¦r sÃ¥ Ã¥benlys, men kan godt se din pointe. Min pointe var, at det ikke som udgangspunkt er godt idÃ© at lade staten gribe ind i den naturlige udvikling. Heller ikke hvis det tilsyneladende er gavnligt.

&gt; Og her er et billigt online LEAN kursurs. Du kan give din mest forhadte DSB medarbejder det i gave :D

Jeg frygter desvÃ¦rre at det er netop incitamentet der er fravÃ¦rende. Ikke adgangen til viden. Kender en der har arbejdet som konsulent for DSBs administration kortvarigt. Vedkommende kan fortÃ¦lle, at de direkte fravÃ¦lger at optimere deres system, hvis det krÃ¦ver at de skal have nogle flere timer i nÃ¦ste uge, eller ikke lige synes de gad at blive til kl 16 hver dag, nÃ¥r de nu var vant til at gÃ¥ hjem kl 14.

One of the advantages of the Human Rights Act is is takes the decision out of politicians hands and allows it to be set elsewhere to ensure that the rights are enshrined even against populist movements.

A British bill of rights (depending on how it is set) just allow a parliament to change them as and when they want (have you seen all the amendments to the US constitution), particularly if a British court goes against them.  The real trouble with this proposal is that we don't know what those rights are.  If they went further than the current set (eg a Berners-Lee privacy right or a right to access to the internet, or whatever), then activists would be happy, but because the Tories haven't set out what would be in it, many are sceptical.

The Tories see it as a way of stopping European Courts misinterpreting our laws, so they would largely be the same rights, but just decided by our courts.  They might even be able to get away with the blanket ban on prisoner voting under the EU law by having our courts decide that it isn't a blanket ban, it is a specific punishment handed down at the same time as a prison sentence (although I doubt it, they'd just remove it from the bill because it would be easier).",,2,t1_ckxean2,,False,False,t1_ckxeiv2

With regard to 2C-B as far as I know there are currently only a couple of good 2C-B powder vendors and only one in stock - gammagoblin. The other is HoS. Unless there are new ones?

MXE seems to be a bit difficult too. Maybe one reputable vendor in stock now - poppermachine. RCsupplier14 back in stock in a week, shouldn't be a problem. Am I missing anyone? Bear in mind it needs to be shipped to the EU and most vendors seem to be US based.

Ketamine? Back in the day it was very clear who were top vendors. As far as I know, that's no longer the case. 0.5g probably ideally, no more than 1g. So help? Not the cheapest substance from what I can tell. Could probably do with advice on the drug itself too - which isomer to get.

With Benzos I need reliable vendors who deliver to the EU and sell quality products. Diazepam and Clonazepam are ones I'm looking at more. Benzos generally seem to be a shady market - Asian pharm and counterfeits. I think TEVA is a good Diazepam brand, think Actavis is supposed to be good too. Just not sure of reliable, cheap vendors who deliver to the EU. Currently might be looking at maligan for Roche clonazepam. Might be looking for some xanax too if I can get a hold of some.

Things don't scale linearly with population.  They scale exponentially.

Let's use Canada.  Canada has 1/10 the population of the US and roughly the same landmass (most of it barren).  The US just requires infinitely more infrastructure to do the same things for it's people that Canada would.

They just aren't comparable.

Swap that to Great Britain, at 60M (1/5 population) and 1/40 landmass, and you see even bigger differences.  

This isn't to say we CAN'T, it's to say there are additional challenges to do it.  We just have more roads, rails, parks, etc.  

More people means we have to administratively sub-divide sooner or things get out of control faster.  Trying to do things at a federal level, just doesn't work with 320M people for a lot of Social Programs. We're just not good at it.

Doing them at the state level makes much more sense.  With 50 states, that 300M~ becomes 6M on average which is much more manageable, and about the size of the average European country, where they have programs like these that work.

Keep in mind that the US (Federal) is very good at things like Defense, and large scale coordination programs.  Things that don't involve individual People.  We're horrible at things that do (Social programs).  It's almost a macro/micro problem.

So in essence, one set of government is just to big to deal with one set of problems, while another set is the right size, but we're not letting them do it.

I haven't experimented much with Gelre, and I think Gelre is in the weakest position to do it (because if Burgundy warns you as Gelre you can't take Utrecht or Friesland, but if playing Utrect or Friesland you can take Gelre).

A good opening strategy would be to ally France, they will help you against Burgundy. Allying the Hansa is usually easy and gives you ridiculous protection because of the endless Hansa mercs they bust out. Allying Cleves, Cologne, or another German minor is a good way to beat other minors. Try to immediately declare war after making a claim on Friesland or Utrecht (easier as Utrecht because of the core in Gelre). Get your territory so you can start making a claim on Burgundy. When France is finished fighting England declare war on Burgundy as soon as France is willing to help you. Until then, declare war on another German minor (MÃ¼nster is good) to gain that territory. 

Once you can declare war on Burgundy, do it. Let France fight your battles and eat up manpower. Your primary goal is to siege up as many territories as possible. French battles will contribute to your warscore, so helping them is not required. Try to get Holland, Breda, and Antwerp (if you can) in the peace deal, don't overextend too much because your AE could kill you. After that try to slowly work your way to LÃ¼beck so you can not make the entire HRE pissed at you.

The biggest limiting factor is AE. Coalitions can be a huge deal before you become powerful, so keep good relations with Austria, Denmark, and the Hansa and ally one.

Try to control both the Antwerp and LÃ¼beck trade nodes. No need to expand much in Europe after doing that, try to pick off minors without raising AE too high. Get Exploration ideas first and try to get to Canada by getting fleet basing rights from Norway. Start colonizing the fuck out of the Chesapeake and St. Lawrence trade nodes to get trade power there. Direct everything to Antwerp. Get Trade ideas for more merchants since you want to form a chain of trade from the Chesapeake to St. Lawrence to Western Europe to Antwerp, with another merchant transferring trade from LÃ¼beck. The goal is to get 60% trade power in each node where you are either transferring or collecting trade.

A critical part of a modern nation is a well-trained, equipped and effective military to protect itself and it's interests. The matter of fact is that history shows and logic dictates that if you are not willing or not able to protect those interests then they will be lost to someone who is.

The obvious example today is Russia. It's in the EU's long-term interests to open up ties with Ukraine; it's a large nation of over 40 million with a large manufacturing industry in the east and a lot of room for economic growth and investment, and on top of this it's got historical ties to Europe, is Christian and is making overtures towards us. Aiding Ukraine and allowing it to apply for the process of incorporation into the EU would show the world that we are unified in our goals and willing to protect our interests, and in particular show a beligerent, economically unstable and politcally jingoistic Russia run on nationalistic rhetoric that it cannot bully it's neighbours simply because it believes them to be in it's sphere of influence.

Now obviously I've made a leap from talking about Germany to talking about the EU, and I want to acknowledge both that they are not the same and that it is not and should not be Germany's burden to police the EU's interests. That being said, a heightened sense of military cohesion between the EU, led by the Big 3 that drive it only help Europe's aims in the long run. The problem with Europe's military software/hardware versus a system like AEGIS is well-known and owing to a lack of cohesion and a uniform military policy, and this is something the evolving EU should seek to address.

And I know German's have a particular hang-up over their military, which honestly surprises me with how universal your sentiment is over the issue. I can't think of another nation in history so cautious about it's future power-projection because of it's actions in the past and that's an admirable trait.

Honestly, because we need EU protection from our politicians. Our politicians have full control over what's going on and can screw around with laws as they see fit. They can skip over stuff they don't like, they can ignore stuff they don't like, and they have the border to protect us from fleeing so easily elsewhere. Not so under the EU. If in the EU, they can't make shitty laws willy-nilly. They also don't have the border to box us in. If they fuck up, they know we can leave at any time.

&gt;We can no longer forbid rich foreigners to buy up agricultural land.

Under current Vucic leadership, we're selling our valuable agricultural land to the Arabs. We're still screwed either way.

&gt;We can no longer make laws that treat local businesses preferentially. 

That would be the point of the EU. Imagine if you wanted to export your product to e.g. Spain, but Spain has imposed preferential treatment for their products... yours simply can't make it. What chance do you have? This is an issue we have in Serbia. Low quality domestic products make it to the shelves, while quality imports are taxed and burdened to the point where it's not feasible to buy them anymore. Some of our companies are such dicks that you can even buy some of their products cheaper in Montenegro, Macedonia, the EU or even Canada than here at home in Serbia! How about that?

Sure, you get much more competition, but you also get a huge EU market to sell your product. If the locals don't want it, surely somebody else in this huge market will?

There are plenty of drawbacks, but it can't be all sunshine and rainbows, unfortunately.

&gt;Overally the country is not becoming any richer or better organized due to it

What history had shown is that the time we had ridiculously little military spending also was the most propserous timespan, and the longest time we have had peace in written history within our borders. 

&gt; That being said, a heightened sense of military cohesion between the EU, led by the Big 3 that drive it only help Europe's aims in the long run.

The problem with that idea is that German interests are not British interests are not French interests (and, for that matter, are not Cypriot interests), and heightened military cohesion would eventually lead to troops fighting wars for other EU countries against their people's best interests. 

Now, how you are going to explain to a population that their sons return in body bags because for some reason someone in Brussles dislikes a people's right to self-determination in one case, but not another one... You will have to make some kind of propaganda narrative, give them a bogeyman...

I now play the game much more reasonably and I'm having the most fun I've ever had in it. The best advice I can give you is to temper your love for the game and savour the time you spend in it. It'll make any-time you're playing that much more enjoyable and it will take that much longer for you to get burnt out.",,1,t3_2hv1ov,,False,False,t1_ckxfw2a

Introducing the Italian Medium Line
Posted on October 1, 2014 by Silentstalker â 49 Comments â

Hello everyone,

one of the first lines to be introduced to the European tree, coming in 2015, will be the Italian medium line. You might think itâs old news, but the line was put together (even roughly) only not so long time ago and everything is still in flux. What is practically decided is the tier 1 and tiers 7-10, even though those are not set in stone. Tiers 2-6 arenât so problematic and there are multiple candidates especially for the low tier slots, but who knows? In any case, this line was discussed on multiple Russian sources, so I donât think Iâll be betraying any secrets if I tell you how the line will basically look.

The main reason why the developers want the Italian medium branch is simply because the lowtier (2-4) vehicles are historical and actually fought the British (and Americans, well, partially) in the war. That of course is one of very few advantages of this setup and the developers are well aware of the issues, that come with it. As for the top tiers, wellâ¦ youâll see.

Tier 1 â Fiat 3000B

f3b

According to the Russian sources, this tank is â as one of the few â pretty much set in stone. It was heavily inspired by the FT-17 (basically an Italian version of that tank). The version in the game will be the one with a 37mm gun (âModel 30â³). According to Yuri Pasholok (or, at least allegedly), this tank will be slow, but it will have very decent firepower in the 37mm gun â there was even an upgrade of the 37mm and that might be its top gun. Hereâs a wiki entry, if you are interested, or you can read an article by Vollketten about it.

One interesting thing is, apparently, this vehicle might serve as a tier 1 for ALL the European branches (despite no other line having anything to do with it). I guess I donât have to tell you how stupid that idea is â weâll just have to see if WG drops it.

Tier 2 â M11/39

m39_color_1

One of the âclassicâ Italian tanks, that actually fought the British in the desert (with mixed results). 11 tons, 37mm hull gun, 30mm armor tops and a 105hp engine â this thing will probably not be the best vehicle ever to hit World of Tanks, but for its tier, itâs solid. Think of it as a tier 2 âLeeâ â a tall(ish) tank with casemate gun and limited traverse. The engine is too weak to be serving even as a medium tank, so I think theyâll upgrade it. You can read an article about it by Vollketten if you are interested.

Tier 3 â M13/40 and M14/41

m13_40_color1

This is one of the few tiers where I am not actually sure, because both candidates are suitable. What I think they will do is mix them together somehow (M14/41 was an improved version of M13/40). Itâs a pretty solid vehicle for tier 3 actually. 14 tons and a 145hp engine (10,35 hp/t) do not promise excellent mobility, but the armor is fine (hull: 30/25/6, turret: 42/30/6 â this is for the early variant, the M14/41 was apparently armored the same) and the gun is of 47mm caliber already, so itâs on par. The tank is not too slow either: 32 km/h. Nevertheless, in real life, by the time it was introduced, it was already largely obsolete and despite some successes on the battlefield, it was phased out after the desert campaign. Pure tier 3 material and also possibly one of the three tanks to be useable for any historical battles.

Tier 4 â M15/42

m15-42_c1

Possibly the ultimate evolution of the previous designs, the M15/42 medium tank was introduced in 1943 and allegedly, 118 were made. By the time of its introduction, it was already quite obsolete. It weighed 15,5 tons, was powered by a 192 hp engine and could reach up to 38 km/h. Its armor wasâ¦ well, adequate for tier 4, but quite lacking for 1943: 42/25/25 hull, 49/25/25 turret. The gun was still a long 47mm one, sufficient to knock out a Sherman, but against modern Soviet designs or the heavier German âcatsâ, it was lacking. A few of these tanks actually fought the German after the armistice, some were confiscated and used by the Germans. As a tier 4 tank, itâs really nothing special, but also not lacking. The mobility will be average, as will the firepower.

Tier 5 â P.26/40

P26-40_tank

Hereâs where the âreal funâ starts â and partially, the problems. The P.26/40 tank was an advanced (for Italy) vehicle, designated as heavy tank (âpesanteâ). I am not really sure how many were made â Iâve seen different sources claiming different things, the likely number is between 60-100 (with some only partially completed). This tank was not used by Italian troops at all â by the time of the production (late 1943), Italy switched sides and pretty much the entire production was seized by the Germans, who used several dozen vehicles in combat against the Americans. For tier 5, the tank is pretty solid â 26,4 tons, a 330 hp engine (though some upgrades were envisioned) and a (relatively short) 75mm gun (L/34) and 50/45/40 armor (60mm front for the turret).

Here, the problem is the designation. As you can see, the vehicle was designated as a âheavyâ tank by the Italians, but with 26 tons, it can hardly be called as such. In this case, I think that instead of looking for something else, the developers will simply designate it as a medium. Furthermore, there were apparently upgrades envisioned for the vehicle (such as more powerful engine or even a 90mm gun), check out Vollkettenâs article for more info. I think this tank might be actually fairly mobile (with upgraded engine) and a general all/rounder (even if the armor is not the strongest).

Tier 6 â P.43

ca_p43_maquette_1

And now, weâre off to paper land. P.43 was again a heavy tank project from 1942/1943, intended as something even better and more powerful in order to compete with the newest Soviet designs and the Panther. The project was scrapped after the Italian armistice in 1943. The vehicle project was veryâ¦ ambitious, so to say. While it was supposed to weigh only 30 tons, it was to have the following armor setup: 100/50/40 (both hull and turret). It was to be powered by a 420hp engine (reaching up to 40 km/h) and it was to be armed with either a 75mm L/34 or even 90mm L/53 gun. That would give it some serious teeth for tier 6 and the mobility and armor would make it quite good. How MUCH realistic it was to keep the vehicle weighing 30 tons while keeping the frontal 100mm armor, thatâs debatable, as a prototype was never built, but in game terms, itâs pretty good. Of course, the designation is a problem again, but â well, see above.

Tier 7 â Pantera

Tier 7 and tier 8 are possibly the most problematic spots of the entire branch and therefore, they are sadly inhabited by fakes and clones. In this case, itâs an Italian version of the Panther (called âPanteraâ in Italian). This vehicle is based on the fact that at some point, the Germans offered the Italians the Panther license production (Ansaldo). This project never went anywhere for historical reasons (war, armistice) and Panther was thus never produced in Italy. Itâs a pure âwhat ifâ, but sadly, thereâs no other candidate. The vehicle would likely be different from the German one either only cosmetically, or by the (again, unhistorical) use of the 90mm L/53 gun. Thereâs no drawing of that for obvious reasons.

Tier 8 â M26 Pershing

This is another pure clone. Basically, itâs the same vehicle as the US M26 Pershing â the Italians used it after the war. As far as I remember, the only changes included removing the bow machinegun and one crewmember and thatâs it. Sadly, itâs pretty much the only candidate for tier 8. There was another one (Panther II), but thatâs more fake than the Panther and I have no idea about the reasoning behind it.

Tier 9 â OTO/MELARA M47 Patton II

m47

This is the American M47 Patton II â but with a 105mm gun (the same as the Leopard) and with a different (not more powerful, just different) engine. If I recall correctly, one of those variants had one crew member less as well, but I am not sure about that. Either way, apart from that, itâs pretty much the usual M47 Patton II. Remember how players asked whether M47 would make it into the game and Wargaming said yes? Well, this is how.

Tier 10 â OTO Leopard

c9EkBxj

This is the tier 10 tank (and pretty much the only candidate). As you might have figured out from the picture, itâs a Leopard 1 clone, just with an autoloader and thatâs that. It was found by Raptor_Fulcrum in some of the archives and published by Yuri Pasholok on his blog. It was never built, was just a proposal.

So, there you have it, the Italian line. Altogether, as far as tanks go, it will be some sort of lighter line, but with so many clones and different style tanks in it, itâs hard to characterize it with a single word. It could be good, it could be a disaster, weâll just have to see.

I don't begrudge you that, but my point still stands.

&gt; The problem with that idea is that German interests are not British interests are not French interests (and, for that matter, are not Cypriot interests), and heightened military cohesion would eventually lead to troops fighting wars for other EU countries against their people's best interests. 

This is why it's important to compromise if we are going to continue with the EU. It's important that we have a military capable of protecting our interests, but one that is used with appreciable nous. Getting there is a tricky path, asbolutely, but it *is* necessary to get there if the EU is going to continue. Obviously military growth should go hand-in-hand with evolve diplomatic measures between member-states (and abroad) and evolving policy initiatives.

&gt; Now, how you are going to explain to a population that their sons return in body bags because for some reason someone in Brussles dislikes a people's right to self-determination in one case, but not another one... You will have to make some kind of propaganda narrative, give them a bogeyman... 

I know, it's a harsh reality. Why should a son of Scotland die because an English Prime Minister tells him to go to war? We should a free man from Wexford die because the ard ri has said so? See, here's my belief, and I think it's one of the EU's strengths; an increasingly educated and contented citizenry will be more understanding of the needs of the supranational body and more willing to enter into the defence of the different parts of it for reasons beyond nationalistic jingoism. As one of the most prosperous and educated parts of the world I think most Europeans understand and will continue to understand the need for unity and protection of all member-states because it's a hallmark of an open enlightened, successful people. 

That's the long-term goal, anyway.

&gt; Go ask the Greeks :P.

Yes, well ...

*ahem*

&gt; You are aware that Germany, in fact, is considered a ""screwdriver-nation""? 

I hadn't actually heard that specific term before but yes, I think we're all aware of Germany's fearsome technological and military potential. That's why the idea of the Big 3 nations is so central to the EU's continued function in my mind; while you can frustrate each other with your policy differences, you also act as an important and frankly reassuring check on each other, for the benefit of the citizens of all the EU.",,1,t1_ckxfolz,IREL,False,False,t1_ckxg50u

Only in that given area, though. Property values are local, not statewide or national. A house in the Philadelphia suburbs won't be any cheaper just because there's plenty of free space 150 miles away in the middle of the state.

&gt;If one country has 4 times the population of another country, but the same land area, it stands to reason that property costs would also be more expensive, no?

Not necessarily. Like I said, the values are local, not statewide or national. The median house cost in the San Francisco area is $1 million, and yet the population density is fairly low in California. It's less dense than Ohio. But just because there's plenty of space hundreds of miles away in the inland area of California or in Nevada doesn't mean that the property values in the Bay Area will be any cheaper. Even though California is less dense than Ohio the average house cost is far higher. It's important to realize that it matters how desirable the locations are. 

&gt;And one of the reasons that the rural areas are so tightly managed is because it is an issue to try to support these populations on limited land.

This is simply not true. Europe has TONS of rural land. It seems like there's more rural areas in Europe than there is near me. European cities tend to have boundaries around them when it's illegal to build new houses. There's no such thing in the US, it's just non-stop suburban sprawl. I can drive from Boston to Washington DC without ever leaving a heavily populated area. It's a giant sprawled out city.

&gt;Big house plus swimming pool plus a few acres plus a bunch of cars"" may be the American Dream, but that is because of the companies that have gotten rich by branding that as The American Dream.

This sounds like a conspiracy theorist mentality. It does not take a company to tell me what I like. Conversely, I believe your government artificially hampers people's choices. 

&gt; I have a family of 4 and we live in a nice apartment, with some great parks right around the corner, and a cool hundred year old swim hall where everybody swims together and socializes. Why in the world would each house on a street need it's own pool?

Whether this would appeal to me or not depends on where I lived. I grew up in New Jersey and it was a shithole. My belongings were constantly stolen, people were violent, and in general they seemed low class in immoral. I certainly WOULD NOT want to share communal places with those people. That's the main reason people want their own things. 

&gt;And you might consider it a bit ""old fashioned"", but part of the ""European Dream"" (if there is a thing) is to be educated and have an idea of art, literature, culture, language, history, etc.

Who is to say what ""educated"" means? Educated in a subject that you personally find appealing? Am I educated? I'm intensely curous and always learning. I was in gifted classes my entire academic life and I work as a senior systems engineer at a datacenter. Is that not educated? I'm well traveled.

&gt;Second thing: I worked for SHC for a short period of time.

Despite how I feel about some things done by the org, I think everyone involved did an amazing job of creating a top tier team. You guys did an amazing job. I never would have believed you had you told me in spring split that SHC was going to invest a lot of money into a coaching infrastructure, and become a team that should have gone to worlds.

&gt;Also the part of better infrastructure highly depends. I know that Acer provides a good infrastructure but I am not sure if MYM can't provide at least the same infrastructure.

I feel like Acer takes care of their players unlike almost any other sponsor. You can see that in starcraft, where Team Acer has a great team, and invest a lot of money into keeping their players happy and in good conditions.

MYM has a...questionable past, and right now, has no SC team, and had to drop their Dota team. The two E-Sports with good infrastructure are SC and LoL, and Dota is getting there. Team Acer has a really good SC infrastructure, I feel like that puts them above MYM.

&gt;Also generally saying things like ""putting a better manager in place"" is a really bold statement especially when you see how much (or not) money such a manager gets. If you want a good manager you need to finance him propperly and still today some eSports organisations still don't get how important management is. You often see top players and bad managers in the same organisation, at least in Europe. In the end what you say might seem true from an outside point of view put as soon as you see behind the curtains your thinking will change

You're right, all I know about the manager is that he used to be involved with MYM, and this is a very questionable decision. They also had questionable coaching decisions in the past (getting rid of LS), but finding a manager that can mesh well with the players, and still manage the team well, is a very hard thing. I imagine he's done a lot of good things, but we only hear about the bad.

Also, and this is a big part. I construct posts like this so that they're obvious speculation. I made sure to post phrases like ""I think"", ""It seems"", etc, in front of the speculations I made, and explained the logic behind them with facts that are pretty common knowledge.

I know I don't have any insider information about this, I occasionally randomly stumble upon some tidbits, but that's rare and basically by accident. The facts I stated are public and common knowledge, I try to make the speculations obvious, but backed up by facts.

Where we do encounter them, they are often pictured as constantly abused and mistreated, which isn't accurate for most of history.

I think that the trick is that you have to avoid the whole ""slavery is bad, mmmm k"" thing and treat slavery in your fantasy world as an accepted, normal way of life (as it would have been, from the furthest back time of Egyptian civilisation, right up to its decline in Anglo-Saxon Britain in the late 11th century).  The slaves should not like being slaves, but once out of slavery, they would be happy to own slaves of their own.  People should sell themselves into slavery when they are in debt, and buy their way out of it.  It's hard for us to separate our modern understanding of human rights from the realities of slavery in the past, and if you study history it's vital not to judge people from 2000 years ago by the standards of a society with a further 2000 years of social advancement.  We know that slavery is bad today, but in a society that wages wars of conquest, things like slavery, sexual violence, the beating of children and so on would be viewed differently.

Slaves in ancient Rome were paid a wage - they could opt to spend it, or they could save it and in time, buy themselves out of slavery. This gave the slave an incitement to work hard, and ten years on, you can afford to buy a new, younger slave with the money your old slave just paid to buy himself free.  In Anglo-Saxon Britain, you couldn't just legally beat your slaves to death, but you got less compensation if someone beat your slave than if they beat your kinsman.

One thing to remember about slaves; they cost you money, and it's a rare person that invests in things for good money and then mistreats them.  A good comparison are horses.  Most horse owners take very good care of their animals, knowing that if they don't, then the horses' resale value will be diminished, and also because they have a natural human empathy.  Some people do mistreat their horses however, but they are looked down on by society (and it is against the law to do so, in some countries).

I'd say this: consider whether the character being a slave is important to the plot.  If it's not, then don't do it.  In a 100k word novel, you really can't afford to have several chapters of character development that doesn't directly serve the plot.  Does he meet an important character there maybe?  Since you say elsewhere that it doesn't lead him to want revenge, then why can't he just naturally be a rough cynical slaughtering fucker by nature?  A period of slavery is probably too important a point of plot for it not to be directly affecting the narrative.",,41,t3_2hzhgb,,False,False,t1_ckxgtkl

**[What he actually said](http://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security/conversation-robert-o-work/p33538)**:

&gt;No, I don't worry about World War III. I think there's two things happening, both with Russia and China. First, they clearly are staking out their position in their near abroads. And this is one of the things that we're going to have to work out over the course of the next several years on what they consider to be areas of their vital interest, and what we have to do is find a means by which to make sure that those desires do not resort to the use of force and would require an overt response militarily from us. We have to work these out and make sure that Russia and China feel secure in their near abroads.

&gt;But both of those countries definitely believe that the current world order, as established over the last 70 years, they would like to change certain aspects of it. So that's going to be a constant point of attention. So at the strategic level, it is, how are we going to work with two very strong powers, regional powers right now? And how will we be able to work out ways in which we engage with each other over time? That's the strategic level.

&gt;Then all of this pressing in the near abroad, those are the things that could lead to miscalculations or accidents, and those are the things that we are urging all sides to continue to talk, continue to look for diplomatic solutions, but always hedging against the fact that we might have to respond militarily to any -- certainly, any engagement against our allies.

**On NATO response to an attack**
&gt;Well, any NATO force that is attacked and is overtly attacked with automatically trigger a response by NATO. Now, one of the things that came out of the NATO summit was a very high-readiness response force that would be able to move very quickly. The European reassurance initiative is another thing where the United States has said we're going to put more forces there than we planned.

&gt;And any attack against a NATO country, yes, I believe the United States will absolutely support that country under our treaty obligations.

**On China and US obligations to Japan**
&gt;Well, the United States has said over and over that we take no position as to whether -- who has the long-term control of islands either in the East China Sea or in the Senkakus. But while the Senkakus are under Japanese control, Article 5 applies, and we would respond if there was an attempt to take the Senkakus, and we would support our Japanese allies.

That did not change or add new rights. What it did is allow you to assert the existing ECHR rights in a UK court. Previously, to exercise your rights, you would have to go to the European Court of Human Rights and present there. It was expensive and the court was overwhelmed.

The HRA made the same rights accessible in the UK which is clearly cheaper and quicker.

If you repealed the HRA, again there would be no change to your rights, just more expense and time in seeking justice.

The Hungarian experience is that protection from politicians is not possible, there are all kinds of shitty laws - although it is true that now that hundreds of thousands of people left, they might start to take notice...  sure the EU is telling OrbÃ¡n that, I don't know, fucking with NGO's is not really cool, but he does not really care and the interesting thing is that the EU seems to always criticize things they find too authoritarian, like controlling the media, but they somehow do not criticize stuff that matters more for locals, namely corruption and economic things like renting out state owned agricultural land to cronies. So precisely those things that affect the direct livelihood of people is something somehow the EU cannot really enforce, while they tend to focus on criticizing things that does not matter so much to people like harassing the political opposition or something. So at any rate the protection does not really seem so helpful now.

I think what you wrote about business sounds more like an economics textbook than reality... the issue is that it is simply not possible to compete against 1) much more capital 2) decades of higher subsidies in agriculture. Even in agriculture, Spanish tomatoes and Danish meat is cheaper because simply there is more money, better technology and competing with that is pretty much hopeless. 

However, the main issue is not even making products, but retail so distributing products, banks, utilities.

You are perfectly right that is very good that if someone has a unique, special new product idea it is good to have a big EU market to sell it but frankly this is a very small part of the economy. Most of the economy is all about the boring old things: eat wheat, heat with electricity, buy bricks for building a house... and it is pretty much so that whoever has more money offers it for cheaper as then the technology is better.

My point is: do not see the economy like some Silicon Valley people making all kinds of great new products. It is the same old boring but necessary food, energy, retail shops, clothes, mortgages... 

I am 36 and it is true that the ""supply"" side is improving a lot, lots of nice restaurants and whatnot: it is the ""demand"" side, like jobs, job security and suchlike decreasing... and what is the weirdest today that clearly the many good new restaurants in Budapest do have customers, so some folks have money, but it is not the normal way like learn a degree, apply for jobs... people who do this are underpaid, yet somehow quite some people seem to be able to get money from other sources.",,1,t1_ckxfgnu,,False,False,t1_ckxh84a

&gt;__RedCard 20-03__, known as __RedCard__ in Europe, is a [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) based on [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer), released in 2002 by [Point of View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_View_(developer\)). The game follows most of the rules of football, but allows for heavy tackles and special moves once the player has charged up a special meter.

&gt;The game, released on the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, allows the player to compete across all the continents (including Antarctica) in a world conquest mode, which in turn unlocks the finals mode (World Cup). Players have to face all the teams in the game, including SWAT, penguins, dolphins, seals and so on, on a variety of fantasy pitches including the South Pole and an aircraft carrier.

&gt;On each continent the player begins against an easy team, and progresses onwards. In North America, players have to face the USA and a SWAT team (both semi-pro), then progress to Asia where they face Saudi Arabia (Amateur).

&gt;[Brian McBride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_McBride) is depicted in the game's American cover art.

It is a buyers market and with the rising unemployement more women turn to this business. You can wonder in how much control they really are, since on review forums it is openly discussed which prostitute offers which service without a condom.

'Well they don't allow gay marriage based on religious beliefs or tradition, which is different to being homophobic.'

or...

""Well, the courts think religious beliefs &gt; equality. That's not homophobic.""

Yes, yes it is. This is why I use the 'race' comparison so frequently, because it usually demonstrates how absurd it is to discriminate or deny equality based on personal or religious beliefs. If it was race instead of sexuality? There would be an uproar, and rightly so.

You also use the argument from tradition? Come on man. I shouldn't even have to address how insane that argument is. Would it be okay to deny black people to marry if it goes against tradition? To deny it to anyone that isn't a Christian? I could rant all day and how poor that ""argument"" is.

Defending ""Because it's tradition, therefore we must stand in opposition to gay rights"", makes you homophobic, yes. Because it's not even an argument. It's shit.

If the European Court prioritised religious freedom (which is odd, because religious people are all too quick to cite religious freedom, when it involves denying the freedom and rights of others) over marriage equality between blacks and whites, I would define them as being racist. Or that it is a racist decision. Just as this is a homophobic one.

""Well, this is anecdotal and otherwise it can be explained by homophobia implies opposition to gay marriage, but **does not require** it to be the other way round. I've never personally met a football fan who wasn't an uneducated drunken troublemaker, for example, but I don't think it's a prerequisite.""

I never said it was a prerequisite. But if you've met a myriad of football fans, and every single one was an uneducated drunken troublemaker, would it be a safe assumption that the next one you meet fits this description too? Sure.

My initial assumption would be that they were intended, as nuclear weapons almost invariably are, as a deterrent â probably quite a compelling one, given China didn't become a nuclear power until the mid- to late 1960s; the DPRK only became one (in a very limited sense) in the last 10 years. There hasn't traditionally been the same estimation of nuclear war as a possibility in the Far East.

But that essay I linked offers a different rationale (emphasis mine):

&gt; The following factors also figured into the U.S. decision to deploy nuclear weapons in South Korea. **First, the U.S. could not totally disregard the possibility of a North Korean invasion of the South taking advantage of the likely chaos and confusion that might follow in the aftermath of Rhee's death.** Rhee was over 80 years old. Accordingly, the logic was that the U.S.F.K. had to arm itself with nuclear weapons in case of such a contingency.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, the types of nuclear weapons the U.S. had planned to deploy in South Korea were 280mm atomic cannons and 762mm Honest John atomic rockets, both of which had been taken off the production line since they were bulky and cumbersome to handle, weighting 86 and 16 metric tons respectively. Plus, there was no NATO border fronting on the Soviet Union within the range of these weapons, rendering them basically obsolete in Europe. **Thus, South Korea was the ""only place in the world"" where the U.S. could secretly deploy soon to be scrapped nuclear weapons and effectively target the Soviet Union.**

The initial deployments seem to have taken place in the heyday of tactical/battlefield nuclear weapons (the 1950s and 1960s), before they went out of strategic fashion.

I suspect the doctrinal underpinning would be much the same as in Europe: for use only in exigent circumstances, as a force multiplier. I don't know for sure, though â though I'm curious now. Going to do some more reading on the subject!",,7,t1_ckxfzap,military,False,False,t1_ckxid6n

This is not a good thing; the purpose of constitutional laws is to limit the power of governments - in practice it places the power of what it is and isn't legal for a government to do into the hands of a judicial system. The independence of a judiciary is a matter for debate, but I trust our own government has less influence on the judiciary in Europe than here in the UK. In this sense, I would argue that their ruling is more likely to be impartial and will interpret the European human rights as it is written.

The other option is that they don't agree with the European convention of human rights, which we have been signed up to since 1950. I beg anyone to actually[ read the damn thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) before going all UKIP Meltdown on it.
It isn't something that can never change, that is set in stone.

Then, we ask if the judges in Strasboug are a) *qualified* and b) *judicially independent*. 

Part a) is important and a legitimate criticism of the court is that the judges do not have a good enough background - this isn't a reason for abandoning the court though I wouldn't argue we should completely scrap magistrate courts because the magistrates are just jumped up ex-headteacher types with a fetish for power, no legal expertise, and involvement in other people's lives; I'd say reform the process for the selection of magistrates (or election). 

Part b, though, is really important. This is the bit I can't get my head around in Cameron/Farage's case because they don't really have an answer. It's reactionary hyperbole to highest degree. In my mind, they are far less vulnerable to interference than the British high court because government has minimal say in the selection of judges. If a judge in the British high court (i.e. a powerful member of the British establishment) makes the *wrong* ruling it will probably hurt their future career or social standing; something a lot less likely to happen in a European court.

This is very complicated since each state varies. Even assuming you get it for 63k thats a 49k price difference. Thats 245,000 miles to break even assuming the Tesla is 0 cents per mile to drive.

&gt; after interviewing several fleet managers in the DMV

Im not really sure what a fleet manager at the DMV does or where their numbers come from.

&gt;2k a year in maintenance

I don't believe a owner of a 2010 carolla would spend that much in maintenance every year. Maybe more luxurious cars or trucks require more. I own a 2001 Honda Accord and have never spent even a 1000 in maintenance over a year. I track every dollar I spend through an excel spreadsheet and this year I still haven't hit that high. I even had break repairs done for 300 dollars.

&gt;chances are something more than just tires/oil/air filters

Tires are a wash and shouldn't be considered in these calculations unless the Tesla has special tires that never need to be replaced.


&gt;The vehicles in these fleets drive roughly 33k miles/year - a little higher than the middle-aged natl avg

I'm not sure what these fleets are or what they do. I assume this is for some sort of business that depends on delivery/transportation. If you drive that much then yes a more fuel efficient vehicle will pay off faster. 33k miles/year is really high. Like I said middle aged men drive the most due to a lot of them commuting. The national average is only 13k. I'm a transportation engineer and I have looked at a lot of traffic studies over the years and nothing comes close to 33k miles a year. Thats 90 miles a day every day of the year.

&gt;The costs in gas are $400-500/month though; things like idling, traffic, and weather makes the figures that an mpg calculator a little higher.

The 35/26 mpg accounts for idling, traffic, and weather. The EPA ratings are actually very conservative. Most cars do better. Look at the the same models ratings in Europe; they are much higher. 

My fiancee's 2010 cobolt (bought it for 9 k used) has fancy displays for mpg. You can look at the the cars average and her's was 34 mpg last time I checked even though she gets 38/29 mpg. The idling and traffic still has it well above 30 mpg.

We rented a 2013 Toyota Carolla for our last vacation and had lots of fancy displays for the MPG. It would display a chart that plotted every minutes average MPG. We set it to record our MPG for the whole trip and we averaged 38 mpg and that was a lot of driving in mountains at steep grades.

&gt;Now, $400/month=$4800x5years=$24,000 (more than the cost of a Corolla) add in the 2k/year in maintenance over 5 years, and you're at $34,000

I have to respectively disagree. I think your numbers are way too high.

So does the Tesla require zero maintenance? Do the batteries or other parts not wear out? Or is it set up that once you buy it they maintain it for life.

Look I think the Tesla is an awesome vehicle and is innovating technology in the right direction. I just don't think it is consumer friendly yet. I really hope they can get the price down into the 30k range so that middle age commuting men can afford them. I'm also pulling for the Elios to his production.

I won't say that Hitler, who was [at least publicly Christian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler), committed religious atrocities because he wasn't motivated (at least primarily) by religion. It's not fair to say that Mao committed atheistic atrocities.

Organized religion, especially churches, also has a long history of being oppressive. Read the bible and every other page there's something along the lines of ""women can't do this"" or ""it's OK to enslave people of a different race."" The Catholic Church is still homophobic (changing, but not quickly enough). Lord knows how many times I hear a slur thrown at me for my own orientation... and don't get me started on Muslim government. I'm all for multiculturalism but I do think that the modern social views held in the US, Western Europe, and Japan (roughly speaking) are more egalitarian than those held in many Eastern and Middle-Eastern cultures.

Religion has done some great things too! I donate to religious charities, sing religious music, and read religious literature despite being irreligious. Religion recently (read: last 200 years) has been a big part of youth education. I don't think it's the worst thing we've invented. I think most of the terrible things done by religion might have happened anyway, because I think most of them are actually geopolitical.

&gt;n March 2005, the federal government adopted Canada's first ever Action Plan Against Racism. The Action Plan represents a call for action in six priority areas: (1) assist victims and groups vulnerable to racism and related forms of discrimination; (2) develop forward-looking approaches to combat racism and embrace diversity; (3) strengthen the role of civil society; (4) strengthen regional and international cooperation; (5) educate children and youth in the fight against racism; and (6) counter hate and bias. In July 2005, Canada signed the Council of Europe's first Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems, as well as hate-motivated threats and insults. At the provincial level, the Ontario Human Rights Commission adopted a new Policy and Guidelines on Racism and Racial Discrimination in June 2005. Although it is not binding on judges or human rights tribunal members it does represent the Commission's current interpretation of the Ontario Human Rights Code.

Despite these progressive efforts, racism remains a deep social problem in Canada as evidenced in a March 2005 survey. About one in six Canadian adults - roughly 4 million people - claim to have been victims of racism. One in 10 respondents said they wouldn't want people from another race as next-door neighbours. A greater number -13 per cent - told pollsters they would never marry or have a relationship with someone from another race.

Muslim Canadians continue to be concerned about the impact of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Security Clearance Forms on their communities. In June 2006, 17 suspected terrorists were arrested, all of them from the Muslim community in the Toronto area. Shortly thereafter, a Toronto mosque was vandalized. Muslim religious leaders across Canada have continued to issue statements to denounce unequivocally terrorism and call on all Canadian Muslims to challenge and confront extremism.

Controversy continues over Canada's policies of multiculturalism in education, law, and social life especially with respect to allowing the application of Sharia law in certain cases involving Muslim citizens.

Canada maintains relatively liberal immigration policies but the debate also continued over possible entry into Canada of immigrants involved in terrorist missions. 

According to Amnesty International's 2007 Report, indigenous women continue to suffer discrimination and violence and no comprehensive national strategy exists to address the problem. The policies and practices of police forces in response to such violence were inconsistent.

Despite calls by the UN Human Rights Committee on Canada in 1990 and 2005 to make every effort to resolve the issue, there is still no progress in resolving the long-standing land dispute with the Lubicon Cree in Alberta.

Amnesty also notes that the approach to child protection for indigenous children continues to be discriminatory in 2007, both in the levels of funding provided and in the disproportionately high levels of indigenous children taken into care.

Although Canada never ratified ILO 169, it greatly supported the drafting and provided a relatively progressive example of policy reform and reconciliation between Government and indigenous nations. Moreover its policy of multiculturalism also stood as a model of diversity. However events during 2007 have called into question full national commitment to these issues.

Terrorism and First Nations

Increased focus on terrorism also threatened the ability of Canada's 612 different First Nations to demand their rights and protest injustices.

Controversy arose in April 2007 following Canadian media reports that the indigenous Mohawk Warriors Society had been included in the Department of National Defence's counter-insurgency draft training manual along with other groups labelled as international security risks.

Assembly of First Nations National Chief Phil Fontaine protested what he described as a move to criminalize the legitimate rights of Canada's indigenous people to obtain redress and demanded immediate removal of any reference to First Nations from the document. Especially since it seeks to associate aboriginal protest groups, with large well-armed radical militia such as the Tamil Tigers, Hezbollah and the Islamic Jihad.

Following the media attention the Canadian government made a special effort to assure indigenous leaders that the references will not appear in the final version of the manual, which recommends the army's use of deception, ambushes and assassination against insurgency groups.

There were renewed efforts by Canada's first nations to continue generating awareness of the socio-economic status of some First Nations communities in the country as highlighted on the June 29th 2007 National Day of Action.

Indigenous areas continue to represent 92 of the bottom 100 communities in the country according to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, As in the rest of the region this minority lags badly on practically every social indicator, including education, health, and employment.

Aboriginal poverty, traditional land rights, control of resource extraction and tourism and discrimination remain among the major issues. Protests and civil disturbances including blockades continued in some Provinces notably in Ontario and Manitoba related to failure of the provincial governments to consult with native groups over sale and use of disputed treaty lands.

In April 2007 the Manitoba provincial government along with First Nations leaders signed the The Wabanong Nakaygum Okimaw accord. It mandates each provincial First Nation create its own lands development plan including decisions on resource extraction, housing and any other development.

Signatories hope to create a UNESCO World Heritage site to preserve and promote one of the last intact parcels of primary boreal forest on the entire North America continent. Along with environmental conservation it is intended to enable aboriginal people to control and gain revenue from traditional lands.

Nevertheless Indigenous groups argue the Manitoba government is failing to fully uphold the agreement regarding consultation and only selectively applying the accord",,0,t1_ckxiuvw,,False,False,t1_ckxj69c

We had steam engines, trains, oil fields, and large factories that were world leaders back in the 1800s. We had Standard Oil, Carnegie Steel, Ford Motor Company etc. It was our existing manufacturing capacity and distribution networks that allowed us to have such high wartime production.

Right, of course.  But then *there was no war anymore*, and everyone was producing at top capacity.  In Europe there was no question where production (if it existed at all) was going to go.  It was going to go to clean up the war.  But in the US, there was a real fear from the industrial sector of ""Who is going to buy things now?  What if people just don't need all the things we are making?""

So .. there was an increased effort to make the people want .. no .. *need* .. what was being sold.  And this come along with developments in printing, graphic arts, arrival of consumer radio and later, film.  (not to mention the new theories of psychology arriving in the 20s) So there was the ""real"" birth of advertising.  And consumerism.  And it was wrapped up in the national identity and patriotism of the time.  ""To be American means to have x, y, and z"".

&gt; I'm looking at what I can afford. 

At that price bracket, and if it shall be a mechanical chronograph your best options are a Sea-Gull 1963 and the Strela (or other 3133-based chronographs).  
Vintage would also be a possibility, especially some vintage Japanese chronographs (Citizen, Seiko) can be had for about that money.

If we're talking quartz, there are endless other possibilities.

&gt; The fact that it works 

Both can in theory have issues with quality management, which means it is important to buy from a good source who will not make a fuss in the event that you receive a dud, or something is wrong in general. Bear that in mind when selecting a seller, and don't automatically jump for the cheapest offer.

http://www.poljot24.de/ operated by Julian Kampmann is the usual recommended source for current-day Strela models. They are repeatedly lauded for customer service on WUS and elsewhere. I have not bought from them personally.

The other option is Juri Levenberg, who has an ebay store under the name [sonnenflasche](http://www.ebay.ca/sch/sonnenflasche/m.html). I have bought two watches from him without problems, but have seen mixed reviews about customer service on WUS. You can always try to ""make an offer"" on ebay and see if you can get a discount.

Both of these are based in Germany, do if you're not in the EU (and something about your username tells me you aren't) make sure try to get EU Tax deducted from your price.

For buying vintage it is doubly important to check the seller, as the usual consumer protection does in general not apply to those. 

&gt;  and looks nice 

That is of course subjective. You have a more options wrt looks with the Strela. Also, both stores I linked above have several models which do not use the ""Strela"" name but case the same movement and often in the same cases.

Soon we'll have total control over it, prison guards and administration being powerless and tired of this french shit. we'd create our own socialized prison system inside your country.

1. Civilize by accumulating RP. Go for Afghanistan first, then Kalat, Makran, and Sindh (they have India cores anyway). If you need more research points, expand into Persia or towards Bukhara and Kokand, but be wary of Russian expansion. Set your NF to intellectuals and max out education.

2. An event should fire early in the game giving GB a free CB for Amritsar. You can't win, so don't bother, just give it up. On the plus side, it gives you a free CB against them later.

3. By the time you civilize you should either be a secondary power or one of the lesser GPs. Once you do build some initial factories. You won't have much of an industrial score at first with low literacy, but it won't be completely nonexistent because, like the rest of India, Sikh starts out with a LOT of pops. Prioritize research and education efficiency techs, and set all your NFs to intellectuals.

4. Focus your expansion towards the Middle East and East African coast to position yourself for the Scramble for Africa. This gives you more tax income, soldier pops, naval power, etc., but more importantly it keeps the British from expanding there.

5. Once you research State &amp; Government (or maybe it's Nationalism &amp; Imperialism?) you should be able to use War of Unification CBs to demand Indian cores from GB. However, if you declare war on the UK directly all its spherelings and allies will attack you and overwhelm you. So what you have to do is is attack a sphereling like Oman or the Trucial States, then GB will join in alone. Once you start winning, you can start tacking on wargoals for Indian cores that the British directly control or get them to release individual puppets which'll be in your sphere.

6. To get the British to withdraw from India completely you have DoW them and occupy all their holdings there until they get 25 war exhaustion. Normally this is really hard since their WE ticks up really slow (unless you blockade/occupy their home provinces, which is... difficult), so you can speed this up by allying France and having them curbstomp the British in Europe. If that fails, just use the Dismantle Nation CB with them right around 1900. Either way, a whole bunch of Indian states will be released and a lot of them will be in your sphere.

7. Any Indian minor that's not in your sphere can be eaten, puppeted, or sphered. Once you have all Indian cores within your sphere you get to form India. The ""crown from the gutter"" event can also fire (it did for me) which vastly simplifies things.

By the time you form India you should be #1 in military, industry, and prestige and nobody should be able to stop you. It's kinda like uniting Germany but harder and with even bigger potential payoffs.",,1,t3_2hyldz,,False,False,t1_ckxjm90

Not really. Wikipedia is missing some key information. The holiday can be traced back about 2,000 years to the Celts of Europe. It was a pagan festival called âSamhainâ that celebrated more or less the honor of the dead and involved the offering of large sacrifices of crops and animals.

Halloween, or the All Hallow's Eve part of it anyway, was a response to the existing holiday that was already celebrated. Originally, religions had a celebration the day after October 31st, and All Hallow's Eve turned into a ""replacement"" of sorts to the existing ""Halloween"" pagan traditions. 

So is Halloween a ""Christian"" holiday? Kind of, but to say that at face value can be very misleading. ",,1,t1_ckwvg6x,AspectofShadow,False,False,t1_ckxjnbb
