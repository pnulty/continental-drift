But in the imperial age, with the advent of gunpowder and heavy siege, castles fall like paper. Obviously from a historical standpoint this makes sense, and I'm okay with it. 

What I'd like to see is a type of super castle, which I've cleverly named ""The Citadel"", which would be an extremely powerful fortification, much like the star-shaped forts of Europe. It would require the same investment as a wonder, and quite some time to build, but would represent the pinnacle of defense for a city. I don't see anyone realistically building an offensive Citadel, but building one in your city would make it very difficult to take.

I imagine it would have an 11 range with arrow fire, a 12 range with bombard cannons mounted on the walls, the ability to produce unique units, trebs, mortar cannons(extremely slooooooow moving anti-siege gunpowder unit requiring packing/unpacking to be used) and barracks units.

This building would still be vulnerable to siege, but only trebuchets, and nothing else. It's armor would make it pretty much impervious to anything else. ",ch6fqvu,3,,circusgame,True,aoe2,False,t5_2sg7u,t1_ch6fqvu,t3_24byak,Blank,0,3,0

Euro/UK-to-US can tend to be more consistent at times, and conversion charts differ by brand/style. I fit better in a 41 euro in Birkenstocks, but a 42/43 in Born, and consistent UK 8 in Doc Martens. In the US, most shoes that use Euro/UK sizing tend to be comfort shoes which tend to be designed to be less constricting and have more stable bases, so it tends to create an impression that Euro/UK sizing is more consistent.

In general, for any conversion chart you find, try +/- one size in the target scale for best results. So in other words, US 11 women's converts to a Eu 42/43, so I try everything from a 41 to a 43, depending on the style.

&gt;* German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday ruled out military intervention in the dispute with Russia over Ukraine and said she was counting on a diplomatic resolution to Europe’s worst crisis since the Cold War ended.

&gt;*  We’re helping Ukraine on a difficult journey and we want to continue having a reasonable partnership with Russia,” she said.

&gt;* No,” said Merkel, whose country has a deeply pacifist streak after those wars.

“I’ll continue working towards a good partnership with Russia,” said Merkel.

“We will not resolve our conflicts in Europe with military means.

Do you have a source that shows religiosity being a factor in the decline of the middle east? A single one?

No colonial goods, nor the enormous capital that came with them. And in the longer term, no industrial revolution which stemmed from them.

The economy stagnates, people fall into grinding poverty. Generations go by and eventually nothing is left except for that which isn't physical. People cling to God because everything else seems fleeting, extremism is born. 

You're condemning a symptom and not the disease. If everyone in the middle east became Atheist tomorrow, the fighting would not stop.

Yes it suits the United States geopolitical goals, but it also aligns with Maidans goals. Eastern and Crimean people where not ""banned from power"" they were legally voted out in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, unlike the illegal annexation of Crimea.

http://www.szechenyibath.com/ in Budapest is cool in winter. Its a big set of different sets of baths. Some warm, some cold, some with minerals etc. Most are indoor but there is a big outdoor one, essentially a warm swimming pool. You set yourself a little circuit and go around and around until good and pruney. For example, sauna -&gt; cold plunge pool -&gt; outside warm pool, repeat. Swimming around in the warm outdoor pool while it snows is wonderful.

If you do got to Budapest make sure to go to ""the house of terror"". It used to be known as ""the house of loyalty"" and is the former headquarters of pro-nazi and then pro-soviet secret police which has been turned into a fantastic museum.

&gt;Since it will be winter, will a lot of our activities need to be planned ahead or pre-booked? Or can we play it by ear?

You can play it by ear. I'm not sure what the price difference would be pre-booking Vs not. We should be over there later this year but we haven't been to Europe for a few years so I'm a little fuzzy on the details. The only time period you will want to be careful with is around the big holidays. Flights, trains etc get busy the world over in the lead up to Christmas. See how you go but be prepared to just hang out somewhere nice for a while if you have trouble getting transport or accommodation for a few days.

In many European cities people offer walking tours, either for a fixed fee or by donation. Try to do as many of them as possible. We've only done one in Munich and in Berlin but they were both awesome (we also did two in Malaysia but you aren't going there). There will often be flyers on the wall in the hostel lobby. You will see a bunch of the city, see a lot of the main attractions plus they will often take you somewhere nice to get fed.

If you have any interest in 20th century history give yourself plenty of time for Germany and get to both Munich (where the nazi party was born) and Berlin (where the nazi party died and where the cold war was focused for many years).

A walking tour of Munich should cover a lot of the Nazi rise to power plus Dachau (the first concentration camp) is just outside Munich. Again, check the lobby of your hostel for a guide. A good guide makes all the difference.

""The Story of Berlin"" is a museum in Berlin that has a functional fallout shelter under it.

t3_24e6zq,,1398906154,1433597733,Quality Contributor,1398913737,0,"There are several interesting points about the Manhattan project that are relevant.

For one, the Manhattan Project courted basically all top tier physics scientists in the US at the time. Because of the diaspora from Nazi occupied Europe and because of America's fairly open immigration policies this meant America had the vast majority of the world's best researchers, including many folks who were born in Europe. This includes such notable scientists as Einstein (who was visiting the US when Hitler came to power and decided not to return), Enrico Fermi (who fled Italy in the 1930s partly because he was married to a Jewish woman), Neils Bohr (who fled Denmark to Sweden and then was flown out of there by the UK), Edward Teller (who fled Hungary due to the rise of Fascism and Communism and eventually ended up in the US), and many more. That difference in talent made a huge difference in the capability of the US/UK to execute on the project successfully, with such a huge depth of the best scientific minds of the era available.

For another, the Manhattan Project pursued every conceivable route to the bomb and ultimately many of them paid off. In terms of design they pursued both the gun assembly and implosion assembly design, and ended up using both. In terms of fissile material they pursued isotopic separation of natural Uranium (enrichment of U-235) via several methods: centrifugation, gaseous diffusion, thermal diffusion, and electromagnetic separation. During the project all of those routes except centrifugation contributed to the effort, with most of the enriched Uranium for bombs coming from a combination of thermal diffusion and electromagnetic separation. They also pursued breeding of fissile isotopes through neutron capture via operation of nuclear reactors. They pursued breeding U-233 from Thorium and Plutonium-239 from Uranium. It was found that the Plutonium breeding option was not only much easier but also that Plutonium was the only breedable isotope suitable for weapons. So they built breeder reactors to produce massive amounts of Plutonium, and that worked too.

Ultimately the Manhattan Project produced 2 separate bomb designs fueled by 2 different fissile isotopes, both of which they fielded in war.

The Manhattan Project was remarkable in that it was an enormously responsive project for a government run effort, and enormously iterative in their approach. The goal was murky and only a possibility when the project was started, and they pursued multiple routes along the way, many of which did not pay off and many of which ran into huge issues that didn't block the project either because they had certified world-class geniuses working on it or because they had so many other routes they could use. For example, when operating the very first nuclear reactors they ran into the problem of Xe-135 poisoning, which causes the reactivity of the reactor to die down substantially as Xe-135 builds up, and then the reactivity comes back up when the Xe-135 decays away with a 9hr half-life. But none of this was known before hand, and it was only because Eugene Wigner (who was born in Hungary and studied in Germany before being recruited by Princeton in the 1930s) surmised correctly about the existence of a fission product that was a major neutron absorber that it became possible to safely control the reactivity of the reactor and keep it producing Plutonium.

Almost any other effort to develop nuclear weapons would have fallen far short of what the Manhattan Project achieved, even if it was well funded. Almost certainly it would have had to contend with a smaller talent pool of scientists. And it likely would have run into roadblocks which took a considerable amount of time to work around. If you are pursuing centrifugation for isotopic separation and you find that it's just too hard to do in the 1940s it will still soak up time while you switch gears to another method, whereas the Manhattan Project was just shotgunning every approach simultaneously, and was able to concentrate efforts on whatever method had the best results.",ch6hbgx,68,,rocketsocks,True,AskHistorians,False,t5_2ssp3,t1_ch6hbgx,t1_ch6afrv,qualitycontributor,0,68,0

I just learned more about benefits for different companies than when I used to be looking for jobs. :) haha. I felt obligated to read every link since you took the time to look and post.

You do realize that over half of United states employees and employers are small business owners with fewer then fifty staff which makes them exempt from fmla?  None of which are on your list.  The one's who say eligible for births and such?   Nearly all and certainly McDonalds (I know for sure) likely follow the letter of the law exactly which exempts any part time staff. This is the same fucked up way they use to avoid doing it for other things too.  It's bullshit.

Also I can only speak about McDonald's...you need to see what ""eligible"" really is.   I know a manager there and it's incredibly rare for many of those to be used or granted.  Think full time employees, minimum time at job, and you often don't get paid, and you're stigmatized by peers and managers ESPECIALLY I  if it is during busy shifts.  You find your hours have permanently for gone to an employee who isn't taking time off.

Also all the tuition in the world doesn't help a part timer who gets nothing or a full timer who spends sixty hours a week between work and work related activities and company who wont accommodate when class's might be which can reduce your hours and make you ineligible.

Never mind that sixty hours plus 48 for sleep already comprises 108 of the 168 hours in a week, before factoring in school, homework, free time, kids, and errands.

  I had it worse at pizza hut, I was management with a fair tuition reimbursement but I had about 70 hours for work only and had to with work every Monday starting no later than four, all day Friday, all day saturday, Sunday I was required to take off unless my numbers were bad and made it impossible to find any class with more than one day a week that I could enroll in.   I was also one of only three people eligible including one junior manager and a full time ten year employee.  At least in his case I worked around the one class he found that related to business that didn't make him lose hours.

In addition only 11percent of Americans at private sector  get paid leave and 16 for government as per the dept of labor statistics.
Even the things supposedly offered or mandated like fmla don't do what they claim or people are financially incapable of using due to our shitty race to the bottom and refusal to even keep wages up with cost of living.  Even a twelve dollar an hour person now makes less then minimum wage person in the sixties.

Next its a much more Eurocentric game, and although CK2 takes place in Europe it has pretty equal opportunities for Muslims, pagans, and now Indians. Now, if you aren't in Europe, it'll be significantly harder if you aren't playing as the Ottomans. You'll have to westernize, deal with new mechanics, and be limited in tech. Next thing would probably be that there are no titles, only the nation as  a whole. You are X nation. You can use Y decision to become Z nation. Even if you form a personal union you don't control the country, you need to wait a while to annex it first, and until then its just a glorified ally. Last huge difference with the administrative aspects is that family isn't important. You can't choose who you marry with (specifically), alliances are separate from marriages, you can't educate your heir, and you only have one child. Forever. Which is annoying. So pray he's good. 
The only big military difference is that CK2 has no naval combat, where as EU4 does. You'll need to choose ship types and assign admirals to man them, as well as designate ships to protect trade and fight pirates. Also, NEVER CROSS A RIVER OR GOD HIMSELF WILL SMITE YOU DOWN. 
And then there's trade, which is a separate matter entirely. Basically assign ships to protect trade nodes, send one merchant to collect at your home node, and use others to push trade there. I suck at trade, to be honest, so maybe someone else could shed some light on it.
And then there's colonization. Send your colonist to X province with 1 or 2 units to protect them. When you get enough colonists in a Colonial Nation zone (I believe 5?) they become there own nation, and anymore colonies you create there will automatically join them. When this happens they will give you troops in the new world, trade power, and tax. If you overtax them or choose crappy governors, they might try to break free.

---

&gt;Contrary to what most people in the West think, manga (both the singular and plural form are the same) have NOTHING to do with pronorgraphy. Some manga are pornographic, but that's just a small percentage of manga.



&gt;Manga, in Japanese, means ""flowing words"" or ""Undisciplined words"". It is an ancient art that has been used for centuries as a form of entertainment. It's basicallt Japanese comic books, which can be easily translated to English. However, just saying manga are comics from Japan is wrong.



&gt;First of all, in the US and in Europe, most comics are addressed to young children between the ages of 9 and 13. That is not the case of manga. There are 6-7 major types of manga, each having its own audience. Kodomo manga is for children. Shonen manga is for boys ages 12-18 , Shoujo manga is for gilrs age 12-18. Josei manga is for adult ladies above the age of 20, mainly working women. Seinen manga is for young men between the ages of 18 and 30, and Hentai manga is pornographic, adult manga.



&gt;As you can see, saying ""comics from Japan"" is wrong. Another difference between manga and Western comics is that each comics volume has its own plot, while manga volumes all follow the same plot. The artwork is VERY different. Manga has its own particular artwork, especially when it comes to human faces, particularly the eyes, chin, nose, mouth, forehead... Manga is also read from RIGHT to LEFT. (Yes, even the English ones).



&gt;In Japan, 40% of all book &amp; magazine sales are manga. That's a huge number, considering the Japanese read A LOT. In 1998, about 3 billion manga volumes were printed in Japan, I'm sure that number is higher now.



&gt;Many manga have been translated to English and are sold everywhere.

Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush) referring in 2001 to such devices as ""Energy Vampires"".  Legislation is being enacted in the EU and a number of U.S. states, to reduce the level of energy wasted by some of these devices. Such initiatives include [standby power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power) and the [One Watt Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Watt_Initiative).

&gt;But others have argued that these inefficient devices are low powered, e.g., devices that are used for small [battery chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger), so even if they have a low efficiency, the amount of energy they waste is less than 1% of household consumption of electric energy. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;Considering the total efficiency of power supplies for small electronic equipment, the older mains-frequency linear transformer-based power supply was found in a 2002 report to have efficiencies from 20–75%, and have considerable energy loss even when powered up but not supplying power. [Switched-mode power supplies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply) (SMPSs) are much more efficient; a good design can be 80–90% efficient, and is also much smaller and lighter. In 2002 most external plug-in ""wall wart"" power adapters commonly used for low-power [consumer electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics) devices were of linear design, as well as supplies built into some equipment.

Just ignore chapters 4, 6, and 13-15 since episode VIII retconned those."" I know it's a matter of opinion, but that just sounds really arbitrary to me.

That's what they just did...

Your second point already happens among the books, when they fill in holes from previous eras.  For example, *Razor's Edge*.  I haven't read it, but I know that events from it are not mentioned in later books, because those events had not been written yet.  It's not really a big deal because the events don't need to be mentioned in other books.  It would go the same with the movies.  I think you're making continuity more complicated than it needs to be.  If it were this complicated they wouldn't be planning on creating so many future movies and novels.  They would do the next trilogy and keep it at that.  As of right now we already know there will be another trilogy, the TV show *Rebels*, more standalone films and additional novels.  That clearly isn't a huge issue to them.  They just don't want to be ""constricted"" by what is currently out there because they will have to work harder.  To me, they're feigning creativity to get out of having to keep stories straight.  Or rather, JJ Abrams, Disney, and company don't want to have to learn about what's already out there in order to keep it straight.  They would rather watch the six movies and be told a few key points from the Clone Wars TV show to make sure they don't contradict anything.  Forget studying details of a pretty awesome universe that has already been created.  Too much work.  Let's cut corners and just make that $$.  I'm sure whatever they come up with will be great, and obviously they aren't just throwing shit on a screen, there will be lots of hard work done to create this new trilogy.  It just irks me that there isn't an effort to incorporate all of the hard work that has already been done in this universe.  It wouldn't be easy, but the stories are straight enough that it wouldn't be that much more difficult.  It would really just be learning about what already exists that would be difficult.

I'm ranting, sorry if what I just wrote was confusing, but I'm tired and I may be in the severe minority of the world who cares about the EU, but it sucks to me that Disney doesn't care about my continued love for their new IP and that they're willing to just toss it out the window.

Winston Churchill, ""The River War,"" excerpt regarding Islam:

""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.[13]",ch6i2pv,1,,Own_Worst_Enemy,True,news,False,t5_2qh3l,t1_ch6i2pv,t3_24byls,,0,1,0

However, I was just discussing what I had read about the modern aversion to the peninsula. Whether I can source much to you about this remains to be seen. I will admit that I was wrong on Jordan, as what I had read indicated that the mandates were a part of a proposed air route across the Middle East. However, Iraq had special potential.

Prior to WWI, the British success in Persia led to the serious speculation about oil in Iraq. The Turks, needing money, brokered via an Armenian named Gulbenkian a concession to Anglo-Persian, Royal Dutch-Shell, and a consortium of German banks to develop oil in Iraq. The oral agreement to the concession was made on the eve of WWI, and money was set to begin exploration - but obviously the war interceded. In the course of the war, the French were granted the German stake in the Turkish Petroleum Company in exchange for giving up their claims on Mosul (which was to have been a part of Syria). After the war, to avoid American interference, the British had their Hashemite king of Iraq grant a new concession, and oil was struck in 1927.

And, regarding Arabian oil, there's a reason that it was American wildcatters who ended up striking it big. It was only a New Zealander who thought that there might be oil in Arabia, look up Frank Holmes. He couldn't find funding to develop his concessions in Europe, but found willing partners in the United States. You can be damn sure that the British would have dominated the oil concessions in the region if they knew what was up. As it was, Gulf Oil got saddled with Anglo-Persian in a 50/50 split for Kuwaiti oil after the British got wise (this was 1933, the year after SOCAL found oil in Saudi Arabia).

Interesting papers, but neither supports your statement that worms ""have twice the protein"" of fish meals

The first, using ""super worm meal"" (Zophobas morio - the larvae of the Darkling Beetle) suggest a lower protein percentage compared to (an extraordinarily high) fish meal for Tilapia

**"" Super worm had lower protein content (42.83%)compared to fish meal (52.64%).""**

And suggestions that the limiting amino acid, and resulting amino acid profile needed adjustment to make it an acceptable feed

**""Generally, the levels of amino acids and fatty acids of SWM demonstrated here were slightly lower than FM""**

**""The results of this study showed that the nutrient content and digestibility of SWM need to be slightly improved in order to be a good alternative feed for red tilapia.""**

The amino acid profile would also impact on the FCR (feed conversion ratio) and although not given in the paper, the other factors mentioned would suggest that the FCR would be lower than a normal pellet fish feed 

Meaning you'd have to produce a lot more super worms (per pound of fish growth) than a pellet feed


If we assume an FCR of 1.5:1, then for your claimed stocking of 30lbs of fish biomass, you would be required to produce 45lbs of super worms for the claimed 30lb of fish weight.

Can your system do so?

The second link concerning the wonderful common earthworm Esienia fetida suggests an protein percentage of 65% (at best), again, no where near your claimed ""twice the protein""

Again, aspects of the limiting amino acid, amino acid profile and FCR apply

**""Adult worms weight is approximately 1.5g and about 50 to 55 days after coming out of the cocoon they are able to reproduce""**

Worms and other insects, like Black soldier Fly have been looked at, and investigated as replacement, or supplementary feeds for decades, and generally abandoned (in a replacement sense) as being not cost, or time efficient compared to pellet feeds

Although protein loaded worm meal feed research in Europe shows some promise

There is also a major question mark as to the nutrient profile of your suggested ""scrap"" feed vermicomposting methodology (not new in anyway, and also definitely not new in an aquaponics sense - see research by Dr Brett Roe in Australia)

Unless you can guarantee the nutrient profile of the ""scraps"" into the system, you can not guarantee sufficient nutrient profile provision for your plant growth (garbage in, garbage out)

Given the high vegetative dietary ability of Tilapia, there is probably just as much validity in feeding vegetative matter directly to your fish, or even using ""greenwater"" algae techniques (again not new)

Given that worms are an integral of media bed aquaponics anyway, and many already utilise vermicomposting and ""worm tea"" nutrient supplmentation, what have you achieved that is ""new""?",ch6i4yb,1,,Aquaponics-Heretic,True,aquaponics,False,t5_2rioe,t1_ch6i4yb,t1_ch63zie,,0,1,0

In English, paprika is a spice made from peppers (both sweet peppers, otherwise known as bell peppers or just red peppers, and chilli peppers). However, in some other European languages paprika is the name for a pepper.

Then it gets more confusing. It turns out that capsicum annuum, which is what those European languages refer to when they say ""paprika"", covers both the sweet peppers and the hot peppers. Some languages have another word for the spice, others don't.

So, in English:  
Paprika = Spice made from dried and ground capsicum annuum.  
Pepper/Bell pepper = Capsicum annuum when mild.  
Chilli = Capsicum annuum when hot.

In other languages:  
Paprika = Spice made from dried and ground capsicum annuum.

Also, if the West Bank and Gaza are no man's land, so why doesn't Israel annex them if it wants them so bad? Why does it build Jew-only colonies? Is it not because Israel is a colonial state?

Jews left Arab countries because that was part of the Zionist plan for in-gathering and with Israel's encouragement.

t3_247mei,,1398908902,1433598315,Il Principino,False,0,"Taking Pirlo out of the picture this season would surely mean the purchase of a defensive link to the mid and that one of our CMs is going to hold back and play as the gap CB. It is unlikely that this will happen in the next season at least, given his high profile and his clear demand for playing time. Plus, if he stays, he's going to stay as the regista, which will take away the attacking initiative of at least one other midfielder in the 4-3-3 when we win the ball.

Also, Barcelona play a 3-4-3 in transitional attack play and almost always use only one of the wingbacks at a time. They are also known to be vulnerable at the back to pace on the counter. 

Our current formation is not static and while the wing-backs do look like they single-handedly cover their lines, they allow for our midfield to stretch out and support them. Throughout this season, our attacking phase involved only one wingback pushing up and supporting while in the defensive phase, corresponding wings are ably supported by Marchisio/Pogba and Vidal. If the ball is won early, they transition into a more compact midfield and one midfielder stays back while the rest push up. This is one of the reasons we move the ball slowly after recovering - to allow the midfield to get back in place.

In a 4-3-3, unless we have a solid defensive midfielder who will pull the line up and make those tackles and simple passes; as well as extremely well positioned fullbacks, we're very vulnerable to a 3-man countering contingent. 

Which brings me to my whole point - The winger/wide forward isn't as critical as the defensive midfielder and the fullbacks. Which prompts me to think that we won't buy Sanchez unless we have Pirlo's position is covered. I wish one of our current crop could do it, but I highly doubt it's effectiveness against faster teams in Europe. 

4-4-2 is being used less and less, yes and it has been found ineffective against certain formations like the Christmas tree and the 4231 blitz. Going by that standard, you could also say that the attacking 4-3-3 is an ineffective formation against teams counter-attacking primarily through the wings or the direct passing types, like Chelsea and Bayern did over the past 3 years. Every formation has its pros and cons, and we don't yet have a squad that can switch between 2 or 3 of them, especially mid game. 
So I'd pick utility and quality (Fausto Rossi/Pardo/Javi Garcia?) first to enable the team to adapt better than to completely transform the shape of the squad. Whichever formation we happen to choose, we need the balance and the right 'meter' in transitions. Conte's problem in the past 2 years has been low quality in versatility (Padoin!!??) and his inability to switch formations mid game.

By that logic, it is fine to steal from anyone who has ever stolen ever, or hit anyone who has ever hit another person. Most people consider it moral to act in a humane manner to all humans (hence the root of the word ""humane""). I'm not sure what moral system you ascribe to, but it is not a common one...

2) The majority of studies have shown the death penalty to have basically no deterrent effect. It is not clear why torturing someone as they are dying will increase the deterrent effect. (Also, it is a absurd speculative leap to claim that deterrence is why we evolved to feel satisfaction from revenge.)

3) If you talk to victim family members, you will get all kinds of different experiences with closure. Some family members experience closure, others report that it just made them feel worse and reopened old wounds. There is no universal experience.

4) Costs include:

* Actual fiscal cost - it is much more expensive than just keeping someone in jail for life. This is because of constitutionally required process and appeals (required in part because we can't take it back if we are wrong). In WA state a death penalty trial and appeals have literally almost bankrupted one of our counties.

* Normalizes violence - it sends the message that in some circumstances it is okay to kill. I don't think this is a good message.

* Risk of executing innocents - we know we have executed innocent people. A recent study found that roughly 1 in every 25 death row inmates is likely innocent.

* Legitimizes the state's power to execute - depending on your political leaning, you might be troubled that we allow our government to decide whether or not to execute its citizens.

* Damages International Relations - there are only a small handful of countries that have the death penalty. We are in a club with North Korea, China, Iran, Syria, and a few others. Other countries look down on the U.S. for maintaining this practice.

* Hurts Extradition - very few countries will extradite to the U.S. if the death penalty is a possible result.

* Hurts Medicine - the reason the inmate died slowly and painfully in this botched execution was that states are having a hard time obtaining the drugs that we had been using for lethal injections. OK used a new (and medically unsound) set of drugs (incidentally the defense actually appealed the decision to use these drugs, and this is exactly what the expert said would happen). The normal lethal injection drugs are made in Europe, and nobody will sell them to the U.S. - they think the death penalty is a reprehensible practice. This is horrible for U.S. doctors, who cannot obtain these drugs either.

There are probably more, but this is too long already...

In the US, both groups were broadly discriminated against once they started immigrating in large numbers.

The natural reaction to those groups was to start to develop pride in their culture and ancestry, while also tending to cluster together in specific regions, communities, and profesions. In the end, successive generations would be taught to be proud of their heritage, and that habit has stuck around even as anti-Irish and anti-Italian sentiment has disappeared.

&gt;__Cage Warriors Fighting Championship__ or __CWFC__ is a [mixed martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) promotion, based in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), which is currently regarded as the biggest MMA organisation in Europe. Cage Warriors was established in 2001 and staged its first [MMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_Martial_Arts) event in London in July, 2002. Today it is breaking more ground for the sport of MMA than perhaps any other promotion, scheduling historic events in places like [Chechnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya), [Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad) and [Beirut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut).

&gt;Many of the biggest stars in MMA have made their names under the Cage Warriors banner, including [Michael Bisping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bisping), [Dan Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hardy) and [Conor McGregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor). CWFC are one of the few top promotions to take their events abroad, travelling throughout countries in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) and the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East).  CWFC staged 26 events across 12 different countries in 2012 and 2013.

But your Diamond comment is out of place. I have currently 2 accounts ( Both Diamond 1 ) and I have played over 2000 games in the jungle for sure.

The fact that your team loses and you keep farming is not a good thing to do.

First of all, if Diamond was that good (he is), he would either take advantage of the ganks the enemy does to clean enemy's jungle or it would be him who counterganks so that the enemy at least doesn't get kills from lanes.

If the enemy has 4 members that are super fed and your team has only 1 ( the jungler ), it's worth nothing at all.

By the way, you are right that Gambit playing good is f*cking beast. But Evilbunz is also right, because Gambit uses to perform well only when the other team lets them (or at least it's how it looks like lately).
They also commit huge mistakes in the Picks/Bans phase that sometimes costs them games, or they simply overcommit for no reason.

Also, Alex ich is a beast, but mostly against the newer ones in LCS. Everytime I saw him playing against the ""big ones"" in EU LCS he wasn't that brilliant, he was just normal (the usual overextend+flash to escape misplay and then the free kill mid.. this is something he does like 80% of the games ), normal farm, not really reactive to the enemy mid laner's roams, and snowball if he had the chance.

Sadly, I can't offer a recommendation, since 100% of the clothing purchases I've made from sellers in Asia went quite badly. At best, I received items that differed significantly from what I ordered. At worst, I received clothing that did not fit as described, and when I followed the vendor's return policy, the vendor dragged the process on for 6 months before finally keeping both the garment and my money. The best advice I can offer is this:

1. Be aware that Asian clothing is often cut to different proportions than European or American clothing. If you're not Asian, you'll have to order sizes larger than usual, and even then garments might not fight properly. (For example, you can have shoulders that fit or sleeves that fit, but not both.)

2. Find a retailer local to your own country if possible. Some Asian vendors have shops in multiple countries. (YesStyle had one in San Francisco for a while.) Even when such a local presence isn't available, Asian clothing is often imported and resold through sites like amazon and ebay.

3. If you decide to order directly from overseas, do your best to make sure the vendor has years of good reviews on sites like resellerratings and ripoffreport, use a credit card that will reimburse you in the event of fraud, and don't delay even a single day if you have to file a complaint or initiate a return.

&gt; Modern liberalism has many faults, the major one is that it is too conservative.

The real problem is in the structure, architecture of society, economy, and politics systems it supports or accepts. Not so much it's position on policies and issues. Because if you get architectural/structural issues wrong, it doesn't matter what policies and outcomes you ostensibly support.

Edit: returning to add more stuff that I didn't have time for earlier. Thanks for your patience.

No. It's you libs adopting the ""vote for lesser of two evils"" strategy. Because this:

Media *says* they're Stormfront. How do you know they're Stormfront? Keep in mind, ""Divide and Rule"" is a key tactic. And for that, their ability to misrepresent who the ""other"" are and what they stand for, is key. And of course, they key organ to be able to do this is the MSM media. 

What do you think French propaganda arms told French soldiers about Germans in WWI? What do you think the German propaganda organs told German soldiers about the French in WWI? What was the result?

&gt; rooting out over half of the population with ""extreme prejudice"" is liberty and justice for all.

There can be no justice or liberty until we exterminate the Nazis.

&gt; I understand that religion and extremism are dying

I'm afraid you do not understand the historical role of religion. And the fact that liberalism is now playing the role that religion used to play.

&gt; as Americans have more access to information and education,

or indoctrination. Remember that the US public education system was set up by business interests, who above all desired obedient, docile workers, and perhaps to socialize the cost of training workers until they could be profitably employed.  Rather odd then that these schools inculcate ""civic duty"" and liberalism in the young, eh?

&gt;  Fear-mongers have used this tactic to gain wealth very successfully throughout history.

Oh and how Democrats and liberal culture warriors fear-monger! If people vote for Ron Paul women become baby factories? Something like that?

&gt; all self identified conservatives are intellectually, morally and patriotically bankrupt.

Speaking of intellectual bankruptcy - what went wrong? You libs elected progressive wet dream Obama, and the result of that was... Koch bros got richer? Wall Street got richer? Wealth distribution got worse?

You guys make Germans look liberal. Some of the shit I saw in Sweden made me think I was in 1960's America fighting for civil rights.

All 5 of them, upon seeing the black guy, ran into a shop and pretended to look around, then waited for him to pass, they ran out while holding their mouths as if they could have been raped.

&gt;It does appear that protein from animal sources is an

until mature adulthood.

additional protein, casein has been shown to provide 
the greatest benefit for increases in protein synthesis

&gt;Aging is associated with reductions in muscle mass and strength, so-called sarcopenia, and is generally characterized using muscle mass index (MMI = FFM (kg)/height (m)2). It is believed that adequate nutrition especially regarding protein intake, can delay this progression and enhance the quality of life of elders

&gt;Our results suggest that protein intake, especially from animal sources, may be associated with a better preservation of MMI.

&gt;Consumption of a meat-containing diet contributed to greater gains in fat-free mass and skeletal muscle mass with RT in older men than did an LOV diet.

[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19678968)

&gt;Finally, animal protein intake (g/d) was the independent predictor of muscle mass index (adjusted r2 0.42). Thus, a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower muscle mass index than is an omnivorous diet at the same protein intake. A good indicator of muscle mass index in women seems to be animal protein intake.

.

&gt;&gt;No, they showed that eating meat as opposed to vegetarianism is mroe conducive to muscle growth. Muscle growth is not a matter of health, the vegetarians with less muscle growth were just as healthy as the omnivores with higher muscle mass.

In the PT Padme does essentially exist because Anakin needs to fall in love with someone. Leia's role in the OT should have been more prominent, and while she had lots of screen time and was put in many leadership roles, as you said, romance is a big thing for her.

Is there anything wrong with Han Solo's character chasing after Leia? I don't think so at all, but then I'd also say that there's nothing wrong with the female leads falling in love. The difference is that Han has to make other choices not related to love for Leia, and that's something we need in a female character. 

I like romance in my Star Wars. It made for some of the best OT moments, and while corny in the PT, the relationship was intriguing. I think it's an important part of Star Wars films, and it suits the fantasy nature of the saga. More important than the EU in my opinion are stories like The Hunger Games, which have proven that female characters faced with hard challenges, while still romantically inclined, can work well. I don't think this really needed proving, it just needed *doing*. And now that it's being done, I think it will work in Star Wars.

As long as you learn about it in school, and understand it, and the problems it caused, that is the best way to move forward.

As for the ""Irish"" treating worse than the ""Black"" Africans, check the dates your using. It comes down to economics, its all economics. Black slaves were more expensive (at the beginning of the slave trade), Irish ""slaves"" who would be freed, at the end of an indentured contract, might as well have been worked to death, because not only was it cheaper to ship them over, but they were there only for a certain amount of time. 

Treatment of blacks in slavery only got worse, as they got cheaper, there is no disputing that. The fact that women were chosen to breed with men, to make taller, stronger slaves, and were whipped/beaten if they tried aborting their baby, to escape the living hell their baby would be born into, is perhaps the most abhorrent of all forms of slavery I have ever heard of. 

Overall though Irish ""slaves"" and indentured servants couldn't have made up more than 1-2% of the total slave population coming to America, the vast majority of whom were Black West Africans, and in the rest of the Americas, I'm pretty sure white Irish slaves make up &lt;.1% of the total amount. Irish slavery does not make any other form of slavery any worse.

As for slavery in the Middle East, it varied. If you were a galley slave, you would work and die in the galley you served in, I don't know anything actually about their life outside of the galley. As for the Janissaries and the Mamlukes, the ability for a poor peasant in the Sudan or Bosnia to become a high ranking Palace official (see Black Eunuch) or bureaucrat in the Ottoman Empire, or Mamluke Egypt (amongst other societies). 

But as I have said elsewhere, ""slavery"", the form of taking personal individual's freedom away, is abhorrent, no matter where or how, even before what fate they had in store for them. But notions of individual liberty and freedoms to do what you want, are very much a post-1945 ideal, which we take all too much for granted. The gritty reality for the vast majority of humans, from the lives of a Black slave to a French farmer in 1870s France (see Peasants into Frenchmen - book), goes to show that throughout history very, very few have been able to choose their own path and destiny; such an ability has only been reserved to very recently in human history, for the vast majority of people.

For traffic-related deaths *per kilometer* it's the same story, but we're ahead of Poland, South Korea, New Zealand, and Austria. On the deaths from vehicle front there's probably some room for improvement but not a whole lot, as judged by what similar countries are able to achieve.

For [alcohol-related deaths](http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/alcohol/by-country/) we're better off than most of Europe. How much can this be improved upon, without up-ending society?

For [cancer deaths](http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/all-cancers/by-country/) we're on par with developed countries. It'd be hard to move the needle further.

For [heart disease](http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/coronary-heart-disease/by-country/) the US is doing pretty well.

For [homicide rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), however, the US is more than double what we see any other developed countries.

Undoubtedly this has something to do with [gun-related homicides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) being at least six times what it is in any comparable country.

The best opportunity for improvement, as measured against our closest peers, is the gun violence rate. Why are we so insistent that we shouldn't do *anything* on this front?

---------------------
**Edit:** I missed your mention of defense gun uses. /r/dgu is anecdotal. The best scientific survey of defensive gun use has some troubling conclusions:

&gt; [Even after excluding many reported firearm victimizations, far more survey respondents report having been threatened or intimidated with a gun than having used a gun to protect themselves. A majority of the reported self defense gun uses were rated as probably illegal by a majority of judges. This was so even under the assumption that the respondent had a permit to own and carry the gun, and that the respondent had described the event honestly.](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263.full.pdf+html)

Their examples of *self-reported* defensive gun uses are telling. This is someone you'd classify as a responsible gun owner who's preventing crime:

&gt; A 62 year old male said that at 6 pm “the police called. My alarm at my business went off so I went there to shut it off. Two men were outside my building, so from my car I shot at the ground near them”. The respondent said the men were trespassing.

With that said....

**I nominate [Gravity's Rainbow](http://www.amazon.com/Gravitys-Rainbow-Penguin-Classics-Edition/dp/0143039946/) by Thomas Pynchon.**

This book was nominated for the 1973 Nebula for best SF novel, though books that are considered ""literary fiction"" are often not categorized as SF, even when they are actually SF. It's a complex book with a lot of themes and a dense, absurdist take on them. I'll post the summary from Goodreads and the Amazon review.

**Goodreads:**
“A screaming comes across the sky. . .” A few months after the Germans’ secret V-2 rocket bombs begin falling on London, British Intelligence discovers that a map of the city pinpointing the sexual conquests of one Lieutenant Tyrone Slothrop, U.S. Army, corresponds identically to a map showing the V-2 impact sites. The implications of this discovery will launch Slothrop on an amazing journey across war-torn Europe, fleeing an international cabal of military-industrial superpowers, in search of the mysterious Rocket 00000, through a wildly comic extravaganza that has been hailed in The New Republic as “the most profound and accomplished American novel since the end of World War II.”


**Amazon:**
Tyrone Slothrop, a GI in London in 1944, has a big problem. Whenever he gets an erection, a Blitz bomb hits. Slothrop gets excited, and then (as Thomas Pynchon puts it in his sinister, insinuatingly sibilant opening sentence), ""a screaming comes across the sky,"" heralding an angel of death, a V-2 rocket. The novel's title, Gravity's Rainbow, refers to the rocket's vapor arc, a cruel dark parody of what God sent Noah to symbolize his promise never to destroy humanity again. History has been a big trick: the plan is to switch from floods to obliterating fire from the sky.

Slothrop's father was an unwitting part of the cosmic doublecross. To provide for the boy's future Harvard education, he took cash from the mad German scientist Laszlo Jamf, who performed Pavlovian experiments on the infant Tyrone. Laszlo invented Imipolex G, a new plastic useful in rocket insulation, and conditioned Tyrone's privates to respond to its presence. Now the grown-up Tyrone helplessly senses the Imipolex G in incoming V-2s, and his military superiors are investigating him. Soon he is on the run from legions of bizarre enemies through the phantasmagoric horrors of Germany.

That's just the Imipolex G tip of the shrieking vehicle that is Pynchon's book. It's pretty much impossible to follow a standard plot; one must have faith that each manic episode is connected with the great plot to blow up the world with the ultimate rocket. There is not one story, but a proliferation of characters (Pirate Prentice, Teddy Bloat, Tantivy Mucker-Maffick, Saure Bummer, and more) and events that tantalize the reader with suggestions of vast patterns only just past our comprehension. You will enjoy Pynchon's cartoon inferno far more if you consult Steven Weisenburger's brief companion to the novel, which sorts out Pynchon's blizzard of references to science, history, high culture, and the lowest of jokes. Rest easy: there really is a simple reason why Kekulé von Stradonitz's dream about a serpent biting its tail (which solved the structure of the benzene molecule) belongs in the same novel as the comic-book-hero Plastic Man.

Pynchon doesn't want you to rest easy with solved mysteries, though. Gravity's Rainbow uses beautiful prose to induce an altered state of consciousness, a buzz. It's a trip, and it will last. --Tim Appelo",ch6lxhz,1,,eurocatisamerican,True,SF_Book_Club,True,t5_2rzkm,t1_ch6lxhz,t3_24f2kg,,0,1,0

When they said they will keep ""parts"" of the EU, I took that to mean major things, like civilizations and backstories on a broad scale, but not individual stuff. It seemed like they were implying that they were wiping the slate clean with all of the known characters. In that vein, it seems likely that maybe we will see a new Jedi Order come up, or someone from the Empire take over and lead those forces, similar to Admiral Thrawn. Things like the Chiss race. 




Stuff like that. Broad things. That makes sense. Seeing a Chiss as a secondary or main character in the new trilogy, or visiting a planet from the EU. Those things make sense. Bringing in any of the ""main"" characters makes zero sense. They have said they are not going with those stories. They are, in fact, deleting ""major"" characters, because no one outside of the book readers consider those characters major. If you find an average Star Wars *movie* fan and ask them who Mara Jade is, or even imply that there are a bunch of Han and Leia kids running around as Jedi, they'll have no idea what you're talking about. Which leads us right round back to my original statement. If they are *not* going with those stories, there is no reason whatsoever to bring in characters with those names, but whose backstories are different. It would just make people more angry. The die hard fans have already been told that their old EU is not canon and that these new movies will do whatever they want. Again, back to my previous post, which is better? A new movie with new characters that hopefully die hard fans can come to enjoy, once they accept the fact that none of those old characters are going to exist on screen, or tease them with names within the movie that are now tied to characters that do not resemble the ones that those people love, and now have a million different ways to point out how that character does not mesh up with what they consider the true character to be? This might happen, but it just seems so unlikely to me. Better the quick and painful separation from the old rather than dragging out a long and brutal bastardization of ""famous"" EU names.

In Europe, LEOs have to deal with dogs just like in the USA. If I am wrong, correct me. Are there dog threats in the United States that are worse than in Europe? The dog in this article, for example, looked like a regular dog to me. The same kind of dog you'd find anywhere over the world. It was not even an especially large dog.

This is an issue that has to do more with police policy and culture. The training is fundamentally different. Isn't one of the mods here from Germany? Ask him how many dogs are shot by police in Germany.

In any case, Americans don't seem to be very happy with the dog issue. OP was afraid that American police were going to kill his/her dog during a traffic stop. That says something to me. I'm not sure I would want to live in a world where I need to be concerned about the police shooting a pet in the back of a car at a traffic stop. And I'd wager many Americans feel the same way.

The EU scene is 100% more professional in every single way than the NA scene. This has been heavily evident since ~2006.

ESEA picks an abnormally long roster lock, an abnormally early date for roster lock and a zero exception rule for invite. All three are completely dumb.

Nobody can see the future. Titan and the rest of the EU scene follow the rules of every single EU tournament, from roster locks to everything else.

The NA scene is so bland, weak and unprofessional (outside of iBP/coL.) that no EU teams coming is a huge blow.

t3_24edge,,1398918370,1433600369,,False,0,"The etymologies are likely unrelated. ""Albania"" (Balkans) is likely named after the the _Albanoi_ (Greek) or _Albani_ (Latin), an Illyrian tribe that lived there. (Although the connection between the _Albanoi_ and present-day Albanians is rather tenuous)

As Freiheit_Fahrenheit's Etymonline entry says, _Albanoi_ in turn may ultimately derive from the non-Indo-European \*alb for 'hill', or the Proto-Indo-European 'albho-' for 'white'. 

As per that source, the name 'Albania' for the Balkan country didn't come around until medieval Latin. So the Caucasian toponym would appear to be older, as the Caucasian _Ἀλβανία_ (Albania) is described in book XI of Strabo's [_Geography_](http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/strabo11.htm). But Strabo and your map also describe the neighboring state of _Ἰβηρία_ (Iberia), which is a toponym also used for Spain (the Iberian peninsula) that _does_ date back to ancient Greek, and has truly Spanish origins (cognate with the name of the _Ebro_ river). 

In both these cases, these were exonyms, not what those people called themselves. In the case of Iberia, they're presumed to have called themselves [something similar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iberia#Name), which was corrupted into this, more familiar name to Greek and Roman ears. The Caucasus gives a good example of how that happens with ""Georgia"" - having starting with a Persian name for them (Gurğ), it was turned into the unrelated-but-similar-and-familiar-sounding 'Georgian'.

Since it's not known what the Caucasian Albanians called themselves in their own language, there's no way of knowing if Caucasian Albania got its name that way. If their name did resemble it, its origin probably _wasn't_ from the Indo-European 'white', as the language there would've more likely been Caucasian or Kartvelian rather than Indo-European.

YOU are the one that is confused about the premier league being brought up. Follow the history of the thread, YOU are the one that mentioned a specific type of owner (very rich individuals) which is what you see in MLS would have to change to accommodate pro/rel, and I used the prem as an example of how you can have rich owners and pro/rel.  That is all. I proved that point of yours wrong, and that the end of that part of your discussion. The fact that you keep bringing up the fact that the prem is not a franchise system is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to YOUR original point that I was responding to.


Yes I am talking about tearing up a series of complex contracts, I don't know when I was not saying this.  If they don't want to participate in an open league, they can get lost.  I very much doubt that will be the case because having a team in an open league is better than not having a team at all.  That is how I am proving you wrong.

You will find mismanagement in both franchise and pro/rel systems. Pro/rel at least allows for the better run teams to rise up.  Teams that are not run well fall down, and then if things continue to get worse, new people come in and clean house.  Its an overall healthy exercise that is good for the league.

Also, just because you allow for pro/rel doesn't mean you cannot also have revenue sharing and something like Financial Fair Play.

What makes you think there wouldn't be new stadiums or youth academies with pro/rel? And I never called for there to be pro/rel right now! You're not listening.  All the pro/rel teams in Europe have youth academies, and their system allows for WAAAAAY more clubs which allows for more kids to get proper training, which allows for better talent for the league and national team.

Why do I want to see pro/rel? Like I said in my very first post. The US is too big NOT to have it.  Its unfair to forever cast certain cities as 2nd class soccer cities, just because they didn't have their shit together in 2010s.  I want more clubs in the US, way more clubs. And clubs have more hope if they can dream of moving up and up the ladder.  They can have a stronger connection with their town.  They would have home grown players.  If you have minor league teams in soccer like you have in baseball, that would be a real shame.  Independent lower division teams in pro/rel Europe seem to have much better prospects than non MLS teams in America.

&gt;Organised [prehistoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric) cultures began developing on Bulgarian lands during the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic) period. Its ancient history saw the presence of the [Thracians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians) and later the [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) and [Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire). The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the [First Bulgarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire) in 681 CE, which dominated most of the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans) and functioned as a cultural hub for [Slavs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs) during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages). With the downfall of the [Second Bulgarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bulgarian_Empire) in 1396, its territories came under [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) rule for nearly five centuries. The [Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%9378\)) led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a single-party [socialist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria) as part of the Soviet-led [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc). In [December 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989) the ruling [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Communist_Party) allowed [multi-party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system) elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) and a market-based economy.

&gt;Bulgaria's population of 7.4 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its [28 provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Bulgaria). Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, [Sofia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia). The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources.

&gt;The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state) parliamentary republic with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO), and the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe); a founding state of the [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe) (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the [UN Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council) three times.

&gt;The ___liberum veto___ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language) for ""the free veto"") was a parliamentary device in the [Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth). It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the [Sejm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejm) (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting ___Nie pozwalam!___ ([Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language): ""I do not allow!""). The rule was in place from the mid-16th to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The principle of *liberum veto* was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power, going against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive ([absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy)).

It destroyed most of Europe, Asia, and the North-western parts of Africa. Around 2024, we got word from Astronomers and Scientists that a cluster of Asteroids were making their way through the universe, at first there was some concern to the public but it eventually died down after NASA came out with an official statement.

*""It has come to our attention that there is some concern about the asteroids hitting Earth. The chances of this occurring are slim, but in the off chance that this does occur, it will most likely be small and land in the ocean. for the next 22 or so months you'll be able to see these asteroids in the sky with the naked eye, it will be a spectacular sight that will likely never happen again. No harm will come to Planet Earth.""*

In 2025(The year I was born), there had been several rumors that small chunks of space rock had hit in various remote and unpopulated areas. NASA or any other Astronomers refused to admit anything. 

in 2026, a majority of the space rocks were gone, but if you were lucky you did get to see a couple stragglers could be seen. 

2027, I had just turned 2, at this point I could walk to some extent. What us survivors now think to be Mid-July is when the disaster took place. A huge asteroid could be seen, NASA said this would pass too, but they were wrong. A lot of skeptical people had fled to Australia, North America, everywhere that wasn't their own country. About 8 hours before this thing hit everyone was in panic, every crime had been committed multiple times, tons of looters everywhere! The dumber people had looted short term items that wouldn't last long, such as Alcohol, money, and drugs, while the smarter people were in the minority looting canned goods, medication, and supplies like guns, just in case we survived. The people that weren't looting things, were the people that were saying their final good-byes to their loved ones, everyone prayed, people that were atheists prayed. We all hoped for some miracle to occur, but it didn't. The asteroid hit earth and destroyed the previously mentioned Europe, Asia and North-western part of Africa.

Fast-forward a bit, and you have what I like to call ""The rise of the territories"", basically every major city had got word via radio that New York had hundreds of territories. When people caught wind of this they decided they'd start up their own. It started, it became a nation-wide trend well what was left of it that is. These ""territories"" consisted of usually a couple of streets boarded up high with make-shift walls. Every territory had their enemies and their allies.

Now fast-forward to now, June 10th 2041. Campaigns had started by the Government to control the population. Fliers had been all over city all of them said the same thing ""Learn how to counteract overpopulation! Come to the capitol building today!""

Rumors spread like wild-fire! The biggest one was they were forcibly killing people that came to the capitol and passing it off as suicide.
No one knew *for sure* but everyone knew something bad was going on. 

In our territory, named *""Fallen Rose""*, some Jackass named Robert, thought it was a good idea to send someone to see what this ""Population control"" was. No one volunteered, so we put everyone's name Fallen Rose into some plastic sack and draw out of there to see who would go.

I eventually found out that this was Robert's idea and knew from that moment I was going to be the one going out, because for whatever reason, Robert hates my guts. So with out hesitation I ran up to front of the crowd where the name was being drawn, I took the sack from the town leader and dumped them on the ground. You could here a quite gasp from the crowd in shock. I shouted ""IT'S RIGGED!"" I picked up a handful of names to my surprise they were just the names of everyone no duplicates. The leader of Fallen Rose was angered, he and the rest of the territory demanded that I go, I really couldn't argue so I went. 

I made my way through the broken city being re-claimed by nature. I was about halfway to the capitol building. I finally calmed my worried self, thoughts had crossed my mind about escaping my fate and going to a nearby ally territory, I knew that would be a problem because any territory would just report back to Fallen Rose telling them I had ran away.

I finally was about a block away from the capitol when I'm startled buy someone shouting ""**RAY**"" I looked around and didn't see anyone so I just thought I was hearing things and kept on moving, then I hear ""**WAIT UP RAY!**"" I finally see a slender figure appear and notice it's the only person in Fallen Rose I actually cared about, my only friend, Riley. We'd been friends ever since we were kids growing up in Fallen Rose. It's really possible that I may have developed a huge crush on her but oh well. We casually talked until we got to the Capitol building. The line was huge and the amount of time we wasted was even bigger.

Everyone in the line was scared to death because of the rumors. I could tell that Riley was scared too, I did my best to stay strong, I tried to show no fear, but i'm pretty sure she knew me well enough to know I was just as scared as her.

What seemed like forever was probably just a couple of minutes, and we were in the building. The inside of the building was nice, it looked like it hadn't been touch by disaster, the line was massive, it led to a door where you could here screams and pleads that stopped mid-sentence. Everyone knew what was happening, but nobody could leave. One guy tried to leave the building but was shot instantly after being warned by a Pistol, it didn't make a sound, it didn't even have a silencer on it, This is Military-Grade Technology at it's finest. I stood there several minutes devising a plan. I turned to Riley to see tears in her eyes, I told her ""Stay put I'll be right back."" I ran to the guard about my size and pleaded with him, I told him that I didn't want my friend to see me killed, after a couple minutes of pleading I knew time was running out, Riley was approaching the door. I pleaded, I begged and he finally broke. He gave me a pistol and he took me to the back and gave me the pistol, I aimed it at my head, put my finger on the trigger and I waited a couple of seconds. With one swift motion I aimed it at the guards head and killed him. I shot him from underneath his helmet, the kind that you couldn't see through. I was shocked, I had killed another person, but I knew it had to be done, it was killed or be killed. I quickly changed into his military gear and put away his well now my pistol. I went back inside Whispered ""Let's go."" into Riley's ear. I let her get in front of me so if someone shot, they'd end up shooting me first. We sprinted through the door and we ran.

Even if you get to review one case, then is the fact that you will never know if whether the bastard was punished or not, no notification, no nothing, the only way to know if your REVIEWED CASES (not reports) did anything at all is to go to the official website and check the Tribunal, and as far as i know you only get to know that in NA and EU, in LAN and LAS you never get to see your reviewed cases, is like you didn't reviewed anything at all.

And last but not least you don't get any reward for doing what most of the community do not, at least in LAN nobody is convinced to review cases, you get nothing for it and is just a waste of time because you can never know if your vote actually counts, you review a case and then is out of existence, at least i have reviewed very few cases there in comparison to NA (in LAN the amount of cases to review are large and have ridiculous amounts of reports) because i get nothing from it, something little would be nice, like a little IP gain or even an honor or something to compensate the fact that my votes apparently do nothing.

So, Russia is forced to tread gingerly in bordering countries, and it is forced to allow NATO to base assets a stones throw away from one of its largest cities. 

And when Russia is preoccupied with Ukraine, NATO's ability to base jets out of Estonia is valuable, and makes it harder for Russia to control the situation.

I agree. But Russia wouldn't have bothered with Crimea if the government in Kiev hadn't collapsed. And if there wasn't a significant pro-Russian population in Crimea, Russia probably probably wouldn't have tried to annex it. There is a degree of opportunism present in both cases.

&gt;

&gt;Burger King created a separate logo for its children's products with the introduction of its Burger King Kid's Club in 1990. The original logo, an inverted triangle with blue text, was used in television and print advertising, signage, toy and meal packaging. Burger King changed this logo several times and introduced several local versions in its international market. In 1996, the company replaced the original logo with one similar to its corporate ""bun halves"" logo, the original Burger King text logo on a single line with the text ""Kids Club"" text under it on two lines.  The most current logo in North America is for its ""Club BK"" program which it introduced in July 2008. 

&gt;Kids' Club logo used w/ The Burger King Kids Club Gang (January 1990 – September 1992) 

&gt;The second generation Kids' Club Logo (October 1992 – 2001) 

&gt;Kids' Club Logo (2001-2005) 

&gt;Big Kids' Club variant logo (2001–2005) 

&gt;BK Crown program logo (2012)

&gt;Kids' Club logo used in Spain (current)

&gt;Starting in the 1970s and running into the 1980s, Burger King's ""Kids' Club"" program gave children coupons for selected products each month, a small toy, and a surprise on the child's birthday. Burger King has been known for its paper crowns, which are sometimes redesigned to match any promotions the restaurant may be running. The original ""Kids' Club"" advertising featured a small, animated King character Called ""Kurger Bing"",  who would travel on a modified [chopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopper_(motorcycle\)) with a [throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne) as the seat, visit a Burger King store and present the children with small gifts. The tag line was *""Burger King: Where kids are King!""*

&gt;The original animated King was soon replaced by the ""Marvelous Magical Burger King,"" a character with a red beard. This king ruled the [Burger King Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King_Kingdom) and performed magic tricks using [sleight-of-hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleight-of-hand) or camera tricks. Other Burger King Kingdom characters included:

&gt;


&gt;* The Duke of Doubt was the King's nemesis, who constantly tried to prove that the King's magic was not real; he always failed, and each commercial that featured him ended with the tag-line, ""No doubt about it, Duke.""

&gt;* The Burger Thing, a large, three-dimensional painting of a hamburger that talked.

&gt;* Sir Shake-A-Lot, a knight who was often physically shaking; he had a craving for Burger King milkshakes and armor made of BK Cups.

&gt;* The Wizard of Fries, a robot that could ""multifry,"" or generate French fries when it was given a sample.

&gt;This campaign paralleled McDonald's [McDonaldland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonaldland) children's commercials, which featured ""[Ronald McDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald),"" ""The Hamburglar,"" and ""Mayor McCheese,"" along with other characters and mascots.

&gt;In 1989, Burger King re-launched its children's meal program as the __Burger King Kids Club__ meal in the US and in New Zealand. The __Burger King Kids Club Gang__, a multi-ethnic group of [fictional characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_characters), were created to promote the Burger King Kids Club meal by providing a group of stylized characters. The members of the gang were:

&gt;


&gt;* Kid Vid, a blond Caucasian male who loved video games, ketamine, and technology; he was the leader of the group.

&gt;* Boomer, a sports loving [Caucasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_American) [tomboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomboy) with red hair tied into a ponytail.

&gt;* I.Q., a male Caucasian [nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd) with ginger hair and freckles who wore red glasses, a green lab coat, and a [pocket protector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_protector).

&gt;* Jaws, a tall African-American male with an insatiable appetite.

&gt;* J.D., a dog and the group's mascot.

&gt;* Lingo, a [multi-lingual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-lingual), [Hispanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic) male who liked art and carried an easel.

&gt;* Snaps, a blonde Caucasian female who always carried her camera.

&gt;* Wheels, a Caucasian [paraplegic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegic) male in a wheelchair.

&gt;In the early 2000s a new female character was added to the group:

&gt;


&gt;* Jazz, an Asian girl who loved music and wore a beret.

&gt;In their birthday month, Burger King ""Kids Club"" members receive an annual mailing that contains games, product information, and a coupon for a free Kids' Meal. Although the BK Kids' Club Gang promotion has been discontinued in the US, the club continues to operate and is the largest club of its kind in North America.The characters can still be seen on playground signs and decorations in some locations. 

&gt;In 2005,  the Kids Club Gang was replaced by the Honbatz characters with a group of characters designed to appeal to the [preteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preteen) market.  Each Honbatz has a distinct personality: the class clown, the brain or the rebel. They have appeared in numerous advertisements and are still used in some European markets and New Zealand. The Honbatz characters are:

&gt;


&gt;* Mixmax, a punk who likes showing off;

&gt;* Thisorthat, a green monster that likes to eat everything but cannot decide where to start;

&gt;* Bonny, a studious character and the only female in the group;

&gt;* Chomp, a large, intimidating, Honbatz who is really a big softie that wants to fit in;

&gt;* the Eeeps, a group of small, red, ketchup-craving creatures.

&gt;In September 2006, Burger King reintroduced an updated version of its 1970's animated king design. This was printed on cups, bags and in non tie-in children's advertising. The redesigned king was portrayed as a sarcastic character who sometimes gets into trouble for his mischief-making adventures.

&gt;On September 12, 2007, Burger King announced that it was joining the [The Council of Better Business Bureaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Business_Bureau) Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative. The program, a voluntary self-regulation program designed to adjust advertising messages aimed at children so that they encourage healthy eating habits and lifestyles.  As part of this new initiative, Burger King stated that it would restrict its advertising aimed at children under 12 that uses third-party licensed characters to Kids Meals that meet its nutrition guidelines, refrain from advertising in elementary schools and refrain from product placement in media primarily aimed at children under 12, promote Kids Meals that meet its nutrition guidelines and promote healthy lifestyles and healthy dietary choices in its advertising.   Several groups, including the [CSPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSPI), lauded the move as guarded good news.

You're awfully generous to yourself for throwing the 'perhaps' in there, though I do believe that it was at the top of your head.

I'm going to skip that next bit because I can't tell what in Volcano's name you're going on about. Especially with the mention of slavery within Africa. Are these negative qualities exclusive to Africa or something?

&gt; Innovation is necessary.

No, innovation is not necessary in perpetuating a society. Innovation, technological or social, can come about under a number of circumstances. They can be external pressures (e.g. Carniero's theorization on social inequality emerging from external coercion—to wit, environmental or social circumscription), serendipitous discovery and voluntary adaptation of that technology, voluntaristic resignation to authority in the case of emerging social complexity (see Clark &amp; Blake's work on aggrandizement or V. Gordon Childe's earlier work on the subject), ... the list goes on. Remove these entirely contingent circumstances or phenomena, and the idea of inevitable or necessary innovation, as you assert, wanes or disappears.

That's all beside the point anyway, as what I was arguing was that using any specific technology found in one society and using it as a measuring stick of advancement is entirely arbitrary. Why you decided to apply this to innovation as a concept remains unclear to me.

&gt;Humans are not different than animals, we compete for the same reasons and for the same resources. We have opted for group survival strategy, and utilize that strategy to procure resources and ensure our survival. Just as ant colonies will conduct attacks on smaller neighboring colonies humans carry out the same actions on one another. But a big difference between us and the ants is that sheer numbers is what works for them, technological advancement is what wins wars for us, procures resources, spreads political influence and ensures the survival of that group. Just ask the Native Americans.

I'll dismiss this both for being the vague, platitudinous drivel that it is. Cite anthropological research or theory if you want your anthropological claims to be taken seriously.

&gt;You have essentially just said the reason it is not significant to contrast sub-saharan Africa to European powers is to avoid the rational mind from coming to the conclusion there may be innate differences amongst different human populations, perhaps explaining the different statuses we hold in society today. Than you challenge me to have the 'gall' to say it. You want that, this way you can attack me on that front instead of within the rational boundaries of this topic.

Ok. I guess I'll give you credit for admitting your racist perspective, albeit in an indirect and roundabout—but nevertheless more apparent—way. Biological factors can affect how human societies function, but these innate differences are insufficient to preclude any one population from developing a civilization, or in explaining current social inequality or geopolitical hegemony. Show me a few peer-reviewed studies from scientific journals or works published by academic institutions supporting your viewpoint (most importantly supporting the idea that scholarship in the humanities and social sciences are insufficient in accounting for these discrepancies^1) if you want me to do anything other than what I've done, which is denounce it as racist babble.

&gt;You build a false premise (Europe advancing quicker, assuming Africa would have developed at all without Europe, is of no significance) to base your argument (We didn't develop differently because of innate differences, but because of environmental factors.)

This is a very simplistic account of what I've said, which leaves quite a bit out. I suggest you read the original comment more carefully, or **ask** me for clarification rather than summarizing my argument for me, and poorly. What I left out from that comment I've included in this one.

1. Though I, again, should point out that the criteria you've vaguely set up to define 'advancement' are largely arbitrary, so I advise you start rethinking this or giving me compelling reasons why I'm incorrect.

 It was a campaign city set in the bad guy clan’s ""legitimate"" opium growing and manufacturing town. There are two major families that are in the town and they are trying to do a lot of political and economic one-ups-men-ship. There is the various other clans influences as almost everyone has some presence in the city. It has a well thought out history with holidays to go along with the history. It has your standard Robin Hood NPC and a good number of gangs that hold influence. There are a multitude of characters other than the Samurai Caste that are involved in the story development, not just shop owners there to sell armor to PC’s. The PC’s come to take over as the federal marshals after one was burned to death and the second had some sort of mental breakdown. The players may be the top lawman but they should know right away that they are not top dog. 

The creators took a lot of time to fill it with written NPCs that have personal motivation outside of “She is loyal to her clan and hates the …” The box set was so well done that I enjoy reading it just for the sake of reading it. You can get a feel for the conversations the NPCs would have when meeting by chance in the market. I recommend it to anyone who wants to write up their own campaign city and demand it to anyone that would think about a far east campaign setting. 

It only had one three part mini arc adventure printed as a “now the player have to run here and talk to” but a good deal of the NPCs came with a story hook/seed built into their back-story. L5R also did a lot of Challenge Focus Strike [that was their more developed story seed format] stuff in the side bars, usually related to the location and or NPCs the chapter is discussing.

Second to that, Gary Gygax had some independent stuff for D20 OGL that was pretty good from what I saw. Lots of nice details on medieval Europe stuff but not NPC driven and not an adventure. More just tips on DIY game worlds. I don’t think that is what you want but I thought I’d throw it out there.

- constituency work drives a lot of what happens at Westminster. I can go see my local MP without an appointment at his surgery and raise any issue I like. Often these issues motivate PQs or debates, we see MPs asking *""can the Minister consider the problem of my constituent, Mr Smith?""* It's very personal. In fact it's brilliant. That really doesn't happen with MEPs. Most of us can't name our MEPs and even if we can they are regional not local. They also don't seem to hold regular surgeries. They don't stand up for specific local problems. (My local MP is currently campaigning for justice with the family of Mrs Cherry Groce who was unlawfully shot by the police).

- public interest and engagement drives democracy. I have a pretty good idea of what is happening in Parliament and can find out very easily. The website is first class. http://www.parliament.uk/ It has its own TV channel http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/bbcparliament/live The EU site is really confusing and I don't understand the process despite being interested in politics. Also some of the most important stuff seems to go through unelected commissioners rather than being debated.

- having two parliamentary democracies is redundant. Most of us don't have time to take more than a cursory interest in one. If we don't pay attention that means that legislation is lobbied by vested interests, people who will make money out of law being passed in certain ways. This is clear in a field like copyright. The publishers spend a lot of money lobbying, Joe Public is only vaguely interested and doesn't lobby. Result - we have copyright law that is against the interests of 99% of us, laws that pretty much everyone has broken on youtube or when taping something for a friend.

- our media reports what is happening in the UK parliament but doesn't really cover what Brussels is doing unless they think it's a scandal of the *EU wants to ban the British biscuit* type. That's not really the EU's fault but it is a problem, part of why Ukip has so much appeal.

- the ECI has failed. Only the Right2Water got through the process sucessfully to be considered and this is what one of the organisers said of the Commission's response. *""The reaction of the European Commission lacks any real ambition to respond appropriately to the expectations of 1.9 million people”* says Jan Willem Goudriaan, vice-president www.right2water.eu. in his press release:  *“I regret that there is no proposal for legislation recognising the human right to water.""* http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/?p=2357",ch6oxc8,1,,Callduron,True,ukpolitics,False,t5_2qhcv,t1_ch6oxc8,t3_24dfot,,0,1,0

Woopdy frigging doo! I've been as well but don't mean I know everything.

All of the above - never listen to anything the people say - we'll do this or we'll do that if you vote us in - bollocks. You just want votes then you will go back on pre-election pledges. They've had numerous chances as well.

UKIP - Farage talks sense, isn't a pushover and is aware of the fact that control of immigration is not racism, unlike the other deluded fools. He's worked in the real world and understands all the crap the working man has to put up with on a day to day basis. EU regs and red tape forcing people to be laid off and yes I've had to lay people off because of it which disgusted me telling someone I could no longer afford them. ITS NOT EASY SEEING SOMEONE CRYING CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE MONEY IS COMING FROM TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY but still you have to do it because of the stupid restrictions forced upon us by the political elite who have no idea how the real world works because they've only ever delved in academia.

Everything Farage says is sense. When people like Cameron, Clegg and Miliband try to use political rhetoric to combat common sense they look like idiots. They're not trained to use common sense but trained to cite academia and to try and pull the wool over our eyes. We're not as stupid as they think. I've got a Masters in Computer Science FFS and now have my own business in the construction industry so the notion I should be 'more educated' and vote for one of the other three parties is nothing short of laughable yet they like to continue to paint us UKIP voters as a group of uneducated chavesque morons who are speaking out because we can't get jobs. Im speaking out because I want to employ people for my company in an area where people are struggling to work yet can't due to stupid costs - you must do this, you must comply with this regulation, you're liable for this cost, then you have people you employ in good faith trying to take you to tribunals just because the system allows them to do so and they do it faking injuries in the same way people fake bumps in cars with insurance claims.

Please tell me how the hell I'm meant to provide people with livelihoods when all of this is happening? When I've got some 18 year old with a clipboard coming on site telling me, who has worked in the industry for years, that I must do this and this and that and whatever and pay this cost to comply with such and such. Some of the regulations are borderline insane. Some of the shit I've challenged and had presented to me has just made me laugh in disbelief at times.

The voters of the other parties can claim its not happening and that we must reform from within but that's not going to happen. Its a utopian dream perpetuated by those who may be extremely academically successful but who've never run a business. I used to vote Labour but now I vote UKIP. The crap the 3 main parties have got us into in this country is nothing short of a disgrace. The three main parties like to tell you we must do this and that but its for their benefit only. The current system is perfectly set up to keep the people on the bottom at the bottom. I find it very hard as a businessman who got a break in life that many don't get to help people out of a working class living and provide them with a better standard of living. 

All these costs put on companies are (1) making it very hard for us to keep going and (2) making it very hard for us to employ staff and offer people livelihoods. I'd love to employ more people but money don't grow on trees and when I need certificate after certificate and I need to pay them for my staff too and background checks on them all so they can work in certain places within the UK then of course that makes it hard.

I'll be voting UKIP. A flat tax and reduction in regulations will make it easier for me to reinvest more money back into my company, employ more staff on higher wages due to more disposable income and therefore hopefully a better workforce who are more motivate due to having a wage they deem is acceptable. I'd take on more apprentices too to grow but not so easy when you got your hands tied. Thanks to all these costs I've almost been put out of business and I've almost had to lay off loads of staff.

That's why I hate the EU and that's why I'm voting UKIP. Sorry for a long arse post but when you're livelihood has almost been sent down the shitter by career politicians who know nothing about the real world you come to resent them and I do. Farage's proposals make perfect sense to me and I'm not rich like those who Topshop or Vodafone and can just ask for a favour from the HMRC either. Give those who earn such another flat tax level. I want to provide and I want to help others earn a decent wage and better themselves and hopefully they'll then be able to save up and move forward themselves like I was fortunate to do. Very hard to do that currently unless you are extremely lucky.

They both believed, however, that violence was an effective medium of achieving their goals. There are also three different ""eras"" of the KKK, the original (Late 1870's) that halted Reconstruction in the South through their effective terror tactics, the New Klan (1920's-60's) which was a response to the rise of Black culture, and the version that directly combated with the Black Panther movement, and the modern Klan (70's-Present) which is more about the advocacy of poor white males and white supremacy in the US, and is considerably less violent, and is more of a political party than a terrorist organization. The original Klan was strictly about the resurgence of Southern power in the US, and targeted Northerners and Blacks with equal impunity in their violent spree of terror across the South, North, and Midwest. They were so effective, they essentially single-handedly halted Reconstruction, and stalled the progress of civil rights for Black Americans, and counted almost 4 million people amongs their official ranks, with an unknown number of additional sympathizers. The New Klan formed in response to the rise of Black culture and success during the 1920's, and while it did not change the core belief in the resurgence of the South, it officially added on the additional belief of white supremacy and racial purity of the Anglo-Saxon race over all other inferior races, nominally Blacks, Asians (Specifically Chinese) Mexicans, and non-Anglo Europeans (Especially the Irish). While these views were considered important in the original Klan, only in the New Klan were they codified into the core doctrine. It too was widely popular, and committed terrorist attacks across the country, recruited poor whites to its cause, and tried its best to stop the Civil Rights movement in the 50's and 60's. While they were originally pro-German in WWII (Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, which was committed by ""Inferior Japs"" allied with Hitler) and definitely shared some of the core Fascist ideology he promoted, they were not, at this point, Neo-Nazis, and would only  devolve into that realm after the Civil Rights movement, turning into the modern, significantly more tame Klan of today, which focuses more on the uplifting of poor whites and the belief of white supremacy rather than Southern resurgence. 

The original Klan was formed by former CSA military generals and officers, and founded by Nathan Forrest, an accomplished general of the CSA. Their original numbers during the Reconstruction era were over 4 million, organized into secret militias trained in guerrilla warfare to fight potential police intervention while they committed their hate crimes against anyone they deemed a threat to their cause. This high level of organization and a military hierarchy carried over into the New Klan, while they broke up into smaller units that still answered to the Grand Dragon. These groups were local, but still followed and carried out the wishes, issues, and directives of the national Klan. The only difference between the individual groups you described were  their names, as they still carried out the will of the Klan leadership. The ""breakdown"" of groups is a common cell tactic used to help evade law enforcement and capitulation. 

I say all this to say that they were highly effective, well organized to the point of military effectiveness (The ""breakdowns"" are a common tactic to combat law enforcement), and also that their ideology was not, in and of itself, violent, but they firmly believed that violence was an effective means of enforcing their ideology.",ch6p8hh,3,,m15wallis,True,TumblrInAction,False,t5_2vizz,t1_ch6p8hh,t1_ch6no3g,,0,3,0

The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.

Just as a preface though I gave a source in the continuation comment, I had trouble finding notes from my class and figured I'd just add on instead of editing the comment, so I apologize for the poor formatting.  I'd written and read a decent bit on the Mayan experience of Spanish colonization in the Yucatan and the Aztec serve as a perfect contrast.  The article I cited definitely suggested that the centralized vs. de-centralized government was the major reason for the different experiences of the conquered peoples and I think it's a pretty valid argument.

I didn't mean to suggest (and I tried to point that out) that this was the ""only"" contribution of the Aztecs at all.  Not by a long shot.  I don't know enough about modern day Mexico to talk about what elements of Aztec culture persist so I discussed something I do know.

But the OP's question was ""What impact did the Aztec Empire have on the modern world?""  In my mind, pointing out things like language, religion, clothing, foods, etc., I find that to be less important than the sort of massive geo-political implications that the Aztec Empire had on Spanish colonization, and by extension, the centuries to follow.

I don't see this as some sort of shameful or reductive characterization of the Aztec Empire and I did not mean it in that way.  The fact that the Aztec Empire was a highly centralized society (relative to other native groups) that relied on subjugating rivals and extracting tribute did expedite Cortes' victory which surely had vast implications for both the Americas and Europe.

I wasn't trying to reduce the entire civilization to a victim a la your Rihanna and Chris Brown analogy.  Its just not something a know a ton about.  I wrote about the stuff I knew.  If you or the OP wants an answer that explores the cultural contributions of Aztec culture there are answers that take that angle and I leave that to them.  I found the question ""What impact did the Aztec Empire have on the modern world?"" to be an interesting one and I think that the broader consequences of the Aztec's demise are the most important.

Anyways, I could continue but I'll stop there.

TL;DR:  I wrote the comment up pretty haphazardly and quickly and it's pretty poorly organized.  I certainly can see how you interpreted my comments to be offensive, dismissive, or ethnocentric.

I want to give you a little bit of perspective. Ill assume you are a US citizen.

Although there are obviously thousands of places where war raged over the centuries in Europe and especially in Germany we tend to have a very different understanding of war sites then you night have. 
In contrast to sites like Gettysburg you wont find any famous battlesite where anyone would use words like heroic, celebrate famous armys vor generals.

War sites in Germany are either places of grief, guilt or generally based on the belief ""Never ever again"" (I assume you refer to WW-sites). Therefore all you will see are either sites that are very gruesome (like Verdun in France, which you can reach via train), sites that not many Germans would even consider to visit without having the feeling to be honoring all the wrong (Like Eagles Nest), or concentration camps (like Dachau).
The question alone seems to be a little awkward for most Germans.

Most other sites are probably very small consisting of a Statue to remember or a museum. I guess most Citys that have been destroyed have one. 

Ps: If you refer to older battles:
Romans vs. Teutons: visit Haltern am See; Kalkriese.
Napoleon fought in Leipzig.

t3_24e62e,,1398929009,1433601788,Moderator | Pre-Columbian Mexico | Aztecs,1398929435,0,"A number of answers here have hit upon some nice points: a corpus of enduring mythology; linguistic diffusion; the entwinement of Americans and Europeans forming a new mestizo identity; the food, oh my yes the food; and the fact that modern Mexico is, at its core, basically built upon the Aztec state (""Mexico"" literally means ""the place of the Mexica"").

I'm going to be pessimistic though, and say that an enduring legacy of the Aztecs is one of racism; scientific, colonial, and casual. When Cuauhtemoc surrendered to the Spanish-Natives forces in August of 1521, he was following a well-trod template of accepting tributary and vassal status to a conqueror -- a state from which the Mexica had risen before. Yet, that surrender had led to another template, which is how indigenous people -- particularly in the America, but elsewhere as well -- have been, and are still, discussed within the framework of history and popular culture.

The weight of mythology behind the defeat of the Mexica (not the ""Aztecs,"" as 1/3 of the Triple Alliance in fact joined with the Spanish and Tlaxcalans) has so impressed itself into popular understandings of the period that it can be hard to sort out what is known and what is simply assumed. Certain tropes emerge, though so often tied in with the following centuries and the histories of other people of the Americas cast back upon the events of 1519-21. Particularly prominent are the ideas that the defeat was the result of Spanish technological superiority or military doctrine, or that it was the result of the superstitions of the Mesoamericans; or that it was somehow the inevitable consequence of ""superior"" civilization meeting a ""primitive"" people.

If that sounds overly dramatic, keep in mind the long pedigree these ideas have. This is Friar Juan de Sepúlveda in his 1547 *Concerning the Just Cause of the War Against the Indians*:

&gt; The Spanish have a perfect right to rule these barbarians of the New World and the adjacent islands, who in prudence, skill, virtues, and humanity are as inferior to the Spanish as children to adults, or women to men; for there exists between the two as great a difference as between savage and cruel races and the most merciful, between the most intemperate [lacking in self-control] and the moderate and temperate, and, I might even say, between apes and men.

""But Sepúlveda  was a well-established asshole,"" you might say, and you'd be right. His sentiments would continue to echo through the centuries though, the idea of the inherent inferiority of Americans growing ever louder. In the 18th Century Buffon and De Pauw would champion the ""degeneracy"" hypothesis of the Americas, wherein the climate and conditions of the continents enervated the population, leaving the men impotent both sexually and mentally, and the women subservient and strangely fertile. As such, the history of Mesoamerica collected by the early Spanish chroniclers could be dismissed as flights of fantasy. An even more definitive rejection of the possibility of a ""civilized"" American comes from Robertson's 1777 *History of America*. While he saw Mesoamerican and Andean people as superior to the other groups in the Americas, he also wrote:

&gt; In their highest state of improvement the power of [Mexicans and Peruvians] was so limited, and their operations [of their minds] so feeble, that they can hardly be considered as having advanced beyond the infancy of civil life.

A note in the first volume even provides what must be the most achingly unironic examples of damning with faint praise:

&gt; The incapacity of the Americans is so remarkable that negroes from all the different provinces of Africa are observed to be more capable of improving by instruction.

These were simply the high-brow justifications for the dominance of Europeans in the Americas, cloaked now in terms of natural science and mental faculties instead of divine providence. Ironically, the earliest of accounts -- those of conquistadors and monks -- place the various Mesoamericans on the most equal footing in dignity and intelligence. Yet, those could be discounted (when not actively suppressed or lost for centuries) as a result of the credulousness of those chroniclers. 

This may seem like nit-picking a bunch of 18th century armchair historians and proto-anthropologists, but the kind of justifications they put forth for the history of the Americas following the collision between the ""Old"" and ""New"" worlds has resonated. It is not so hard to look into popular or general history books from the recent past, or even today, which ascribe, perhaps not so much to the ""degeneracy"" of Americans, but to implicit ideas of passivity and inferiority. That resonance leads to explanations such as the defeat of the Aztec civilization as a result of, as Soustelle put it in 1964, ""its material inadequacy or the rigidity of its mind.""

The defeat of the Mexica in 1521 created a political vacuum that was filled by the Spanish, but it also greater a greater vacuum, one of explanations for an outcome which -- even today -- seems miraculous and ordained. Digging into the history would show the providence to be not so much divine as mired in banal details and circumstances, but that's not particularly sexy or catchy. Instead we have a convenient package of a small group of intrepid and rational Europeans toppling an empire that was as decadent and irrational as it was primitive. It's a template that would be back-applied to any number of conflicts -- international and personal -- in the seceding centuries. What happened in Mexico in 1521 birthed an ur-narrative justifying not only colonialism, but forming a foundation for a pervasively ethnocentric and perversely whiggish interpretation of history, where a particular society cannot simply exist, but must have an impact that needs to be asserted.

Northern Ireland can't progress further until we let go of these identities of Unionist and Nationalist. We are becoming an increasing burden on England and it won't be much longer before they decide they don't want us (with unemployment at 17% and huge fines coming from the EU for missing the 2010 deadline for cleaning the waterways) or that we are not fit to govern ourselves. The south doesn't want and cant afford us either. It's up to us to decide to build our country together, so we can have something to be proud of again. Very few people here Identify as Northern Irish and that needs to change. 

The Unionist and Nationalist parties prey on the worst fears of these cultural identities, to keep getting themselves re-elected no matter how many financial scandals appear. 

New parties are needed that aren't based on, We're Unionist, We're nationalist or we're not them. Parties that see the people and the land as a resource that needs to be cared for and protected equally. The  directors of policy for the DoE and the NIEA would back 100% anyone who attempted to get this started. At the minute the DoE is run by Alex Attwood who has no idea what he is doing. The ministers are allotted their positions in each department of government pretty much randomly. No one in the DoE has any faith in him and we basically tried to stop him making himself look like a fool. His appearance at the Climate Ni conference had the three of us that attended hiding behind our clipboards.

There is an entire generation of people here that don't vote because we have no faith in any of the options.  So it's up to us to widen and promote those options. Instead everyone looks at ""the other side"" and blames everything on them. While corrupt MP's line their own pockets.
Until that happens there will be no growth in NI politics only further stagnation.

Edit: I'll explain how the random allocations of departments work. In the name of fairness no MP has a department for more than a few years. To show no favour to parties, no one from the same party can have the same Department twice. Not every MP is an expert on housing, justice or the environment. This is why the DWP , Housing executive and some other departments appear to be completely inept. They are. 

Also I worked in the climate change department and helped put together the Northern Ireland climate change risk assessment. So if you have any questions about how climate change will affect NI feel free to ask.

Edit2: I've risked this much I may as well risk more. There isn't nearly as much conflict between the main parties as they would have you believe. Power sharing was meant to be a temporary solution until it was no longer needed. Power sharing means the main parties can promise the moon, knowing that when they don't deliver on their policies (and they know from the start that they won't) they can blame the other side and power sharing for this. Not surprising that the policies that don't go through are the ones in the best interests of the people of NI. So they keep up the pretense of conflict (the flag thing was a part of this) so that the need for power sharing is still there.

**Spain** was generally sympathetic to the Germans, but having just come out of a draining Civil War were in no shape to officially join the Axis. However, Spanish port facilities were unofficially made available to U-boats and a volunteer Spanish division - the Division Azul - was formed and sent to help fight Communism on the Eastern Front. 

**Ireland** had nothing really to gain from being involved, and Pro-British sentiment was not exactly high in most of the country.

&gt;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.

I've only ever played as a republic twice, and only used R/CR on a handful of occasions.  I've rarely had to spam diplomats to keep people out of coalitions because I generally aim to find a way of taking land that doesn't rack up a lot of AE.  I've never abused government flipping even once to my knowledge.  I've also only taken religious ideas on maybe two or 3 occasions, and for the missionary strength bonus, the admin point cost isn't worth it in my opinion.  I do nearly always take diplo ideas first, but that also depends on the nation I'm playing.

Railroading implies that you have no choice, but you do.  If you don't like playing the game a certain way, don't play it that way?  Try something different maybe?

There are a lot of ways to expand that don't involve doing what you say you're forced to do, and don't involve racking up much AE at all.  It's called ""Aggressive"" expansion for a reason.  Diplomatically vassalising and annexing a nation over time gives very little AE, as does liberating their conquered lands.  Taking single provinces from different culture groups in different regions gives fairly minimal AE, by the time you make it back to the same area all AE has dissipated, and befriending your smaller neighbours &amp; defending them from outside threats goes a lot way to ensuring they'll not be bothered by you conquering other lands.  Jumping into defensive wars to justify your conquest is a very effective tactic too.

Racking up WE in a large enemy nation and encouraging their own populace to revolt against them is a good way to make lands available for conquest or diplomatic assimilation without irritating your neighbours too.

There are a lot of ways to play EU, some rail-roading is involved to an extent, but only because certain ways of doing things are more effective than others.

&gt;This is old news, but back when Cybergun and Umarex were suing all of the airsoft industry, they were claiming all trade dress for ALL THEIR models. For Cyber that included Kalashnikov (All AK's), FN (all P90, M249, SCAR), Colt (All 1911's and M4's). For Umarex, they were claiming rights on ALL H&amp;K, ALL MP5, USP, G36, MP7, UMP, XM8, etc. Even though their trade dress filing for the XM8 was denied by the Trademark office. 

Do you really understand what they are attempting to do. If you live in the EU and have been a player for more than 5 years, you would see what they did in the past and how they tried to control the **entire market**. That's why only until recently, when these trade marks were overturned, EU market was completely controlled by these 2 companies. And the reason why it's flourishing so much now.

 President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Russia could aim nuclear missiles at Ukraine if its neighbor and former fraternal republic in the Soviet Union joins the NATO alliance and hosts elements of a missile defense system proposed by the Bush administration.

&gt;
In April 2008, a source told Russia's Kommersant newspaper how Putin described Ukraine to George Bush at a NATO meeting in Bucharest: **""You don't understand, George, that Ukraine is not even a state.** What is Ukraine? Part of its territories is Eastern Europe, but the greater part is a gift from us.""

t3_24fj89,,1398935095,1433602267,Moderator | Eastern Woodlands,False,0,"&gt; do you think they actively traded with each other?

Not as far as we can tell now. There's only one definitive Mesoamerican artifact found at a Mississippian site: [a small obsidian tool](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2694879) found at [Spiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Mounds) in eastern Oklahoma. Ancient trade routes, going back well before the Aztecs, connected the American Southwest to central Mexico. There's considerable evidence for goods and ideas travelling back and forth along that route. A prominent example is [Paquimé](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paquime), an ancient city just south of the present day Mexico-New Mexico border, which once served as the gateway between the two regions--it's famous for its mix of Southwestern and Mesoamerican features, as well as the fact that people there used to raise parrots brought up from Central America. 

Spiro likely got that bit of Mesoamerican obsidian from Southwestern trading partners, rather than from Mesoamerica directly. We have much better evidence for pre-Columbian contact between those two regions. Southwestern cotton cloth shows up at Spiro, for example. For whatever reasons, there doesn't appear to have been north-south trade routes crossing Texas (on a related not, the survivors of de Soto's expedition tried to return to Mexico City by crossing Texas but gave up on that route because they couldn't find enough food (or enough granaries to pillage) to sustain themselves on the trip. Cabeza de Vaca, after being shipwrecked on the coast of Texas, got a little further south but also ended up taking [the long way around](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Expedition_Cabeza_de_Vaca_Karte.png) to get back to Mexico City. 

&gt; They shared a lot of Religious and Cultural traits like Human sacrifice and building of structures aligned with the stars.

The role of human sacrifice among the Mississippians and in Mesoamerican cultures was very different. Mississippian sacrifices seem to have been part of their funerary traditions, rather than as offerings to the gods. As for archaeoastronomy, astronomical alignments are a fairly minor topic in Mississippian archaeology, especially compared to their local predecessors, the Hopewell, who seemed to have loved [lunar alignments](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F2WAC-CMv9s/Ue2-jN6LhfI/AAAAAAAACX0/PjJnR6K4jfE/s1600/Newark+lunar+alignments.JPG). Mississippian and Mesoamerican cultures are only distantly related.

&gt; Also, the Iroquois League was formed and existed during this time period as well, do you think there was any connection between all these different Pre-contact American Cultures?

The Haudenosaunee or pre-Haudenosaunee Iroquois (depending on the exact timing of the league's origins) almost certainly had contact with Mississippian cultures. Though their main Pre-Contact trade interests were the Great Lakes and the Hudson (for copper and wampum, respectively), the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers had also been a major trade route for the Haudenosaunee for centuries. Just like Cahokia was situated to take advantage of trade coming down the Mississippi and Missouri, the Mississippian culture at Angel Mound was situated to benefit from the trade coming down from the eastern Great Lakes via the Wabash and the Ohio. Between the Haudenosaunee and Angel Mound were two societies that, while not Mississippians themselves, were influenced by the Mississippians in various ways. In southwestern Ohio were the Fort Ancients (Ancestral Shawnee, but also possible connections with Dhegiha-speaking peoples), who incorporated Mississippian iconography into their religion, but didn't adopt the Mississippian political system. In southwestern Pennsylvania and parts of neighboring states were the Monongahela (who may have been the historic Massawomeck), an apparently Iroquoian-people with a notable fondness for the Mississippian sport of chunkey. They also linked Chesapeake Bay with the Middle Mississippian world via the Potomac River. While the Middle Mississippian polities had ceased to be Mississippians before contact, those trade routes remained in place and brought European goods to their successor polities long before Europeans themselves showed up in the interior.",ch6qspl,9,,Reedstilt,True,AskHistorians,False,t5_2ssp3,t1_ch6qspl,t3_24fj89,moderator,0,9,0

all this is complicated by the pragmatist approach that fascist movements took to get to power, which sometimes contradicted their rhetoric (syndicalism v. corporatism). you really have to look at fascism in its three separate stages; movement, party, state, due to this.

I mean everyone goes to eat out, we all do it, several times a week. We might not all hire a painter, or hire an electrician, or whatever. But one thing every human does here in north america, europe, australia, fuck wherever you are, is eat out.

And the kitchen is a universal shit storm you need to learn to weather. And it teaches you respect for the industry.

I used to be picky with my food, eat well done steaks, etc when I was younger. I am now 5 years in the industry and you know what? Im better for it. I mean first of all I know how to cook, and that's such an important life skill. Knife work, pan use, cooking temps, and so much more.

I mean now I can go to my local grocery store, look at almost any vegetable, fruit, or meat and go ""oh that one looks good""

You learn it after handling hundreds of them over and over during the rush. Not even intentionally. You learn ""oh this celery is gonna go bad in 2 days but oh man this stuff will last a week""

That alone will save you SO MUCH money in the future.

I loved the X-Wing series, both the games and the books of the same name. The game didn't have much of a story, what little it did have ended up being Star-Wars versions of flight-sim staples or participation in historic battles. The same can be said of Battlefront and several others.

The real losses in my book are games like Jedi Academy (I quite liked being a part of the Star Wars story), Dark Forces I and Dark Forces II/Jedi Knight I. Republic Commando had solid gameplay and ended with a cliffhanger I badly want resolved. It's tie-in book series caught my attention with the existential crises faced by the characters. KotOR *almost* goes without saying as one of the biggest losses in terms of game-based EU lore. It was pretty much the only part of the Pre-Phantom-Menace EU that I could get behind.


That said, much of the EU that I disliked is now gone forever, and as far as I'm concerned that's a net positive. As much as I liked certain bits of the EU, much of it struck me as blatant fan service. With so many contributors pumping out content, it began to seem like one in three people in Star Wars was a ""secret"" Jedi Master, despite almost all the Jedi supposedly being dead. At some point, every major character from the films becomes a high-ranking official of their respective faction, becomes a Jedi/Sith (or both at varying points), or outright comes back to life. Darth Vader and the Emperor come back from the dead. Both Luke and the Emperor are cloned at some point. *Extra-galactic* ""aliens"" invade the Star Wars universe and muck everything up with lightsaber-resistant everything. During this period, everyone and their mother starts using lightsabers because... reasons. Eventually, the EU extended *hundreds* of years beyond the end of Episode VI. The New Republic established by the Rebels eventually becomes a new Empire, which spawns separatists who are now the *bad guy rebels*. These morality-swapped gray-area factions cherrypicked from each others' cool and iconic ideas. Everyone had cool new stormtrooper armor, anyone who wanted lightsabers had them, and every third guy had a light*whip* or light*sai* or quad-bladed lightsaber because that is *soooooooo* much cooler than a regular lightsaber. It got to be too much, even for someone who loves Star Wars.

The EU suffered from the same problems as Lucas himself. There's no restraint. The best examples of EU content produced *new* lore, but it all fell within the style and theme of the ""core"" Star Wars mythos. As the ""timeline"" extended further in either direction from Episode IV, the EU got more and more diluted by fanservice and mary sue characters. Giving Wedge Antilles some backstory between movies or immediately after Episode VI is one thing. Trying to explain the Yuuzhan Vong (or the state of the galaxy post-Yuuzhan Vong) to the layman will cause all but the most die-hard fans' eyes to glaze over. If we have to sacrifice KotOR's canon in order to clean up all the Force Unleashed-style nonsense, then so be it. The only thing that pisses me off is that the Clone Wars TV series gets to stay. That series takes a dump all over the Star Wars I know and love, and I have to accept *that* as canon while giving up my beloved X-Wing(s)? That's a tough sell. This new Star Wars content had better be fucking amazing or I'm finally done with Star Wars. Lucasfilm gets *one* shot at selling me on a fresh start or I'm calling it quits for good. At the end of the day, we have *enough* Star Wars even if this new stuff fails. The existing content isn't going anywhere. Should the new movies and games fall flat, I can always *not buy it* and stick with the original films and the bits of EU I liked.

Somehow I doubt the immigrants that want to come here think it's democratic for you to decide they can't because immigration. The simple fact is that if it's so easy for us to tell that immigration is putting a strain on our ability to house, feed, educate, find work for and keep housed our people then that's a fucking burden. Besides, don't you think the party that exposed the EU as contradicting its' own law would be a hero?

&gt;The fact is time and time again the EU council have said that the issue of free movement and settlement within the EU is non-negotiable. 

Link?

&gt;Which is why they along with most other EU countries have strong and growing anti-EU political movements. This is not a issue of the UK vs the EU, its an issue of many people across the whole of Europe vs the EU. 

Actually the worst-hit is most likely Greece what with the Golden Dawn movement. Besides, both Germany AND France both just had elections and neither of those countries got an anti-EU victor, so your point's kind of moot.

&gt;Once you have control over who is coming into the country you can create a sensible building policy in regards to homes and services. 

A policy that doesn't take into account the fact that we clearly don't know who is coming, and so can only deal with the ones already here. We can't build a house in the time it takes someone to travel from the easternmost EU member states to England. It just isn't possible. However, we're at a point population-wise where we don't have the homes for those already here.

This is the equivalent, just so you know, of having prison overflowing with criminals and the solution be to stop sending people to prison.

&gt;No.
&gt;No.

So come on then hopscotch, what's he gonna do about the domestic issues that have arisen in the meantime? Because it sounds like making it harder to get from the EU to the UK (an implicit result of UK seperation) would make things much much harder for people to leave than it is at the moment. Like all the Poles that elected to just fuck off for some reason. Shit, a Home Office report suggested that emigration and immigration in the period up to 2012 (as that's when the report was published) are almost equal: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116025/horr68-report.pdf


So, no. These problems like housing, the NHS, education, finding work, inadequate public services, inadequate roads, these categorically cannot be caused by immigrants because about as many people leave as those that enter. So voting for this asshole won't change a thing because the one thing he claims to be the root of the problem isn't actually the root of the problem. He's saying we can cut off one of the Hydra's heads and claim victory.

&gt;The five-tier system is a start but needs to be better controlled, and it only works if it applies to everyone, not just people outside of the EU. 

Why? The EU-imposed rules are much stricter than our five-tier system. Basically ""get a job within three months or get out"" 

&gt;Great, so we know that next year anywhere from 0 to 450 million people might immigrate to the UK. That's really useful.

I don't see how this answers my point. We know how many people immigrate here from the EU because they don't go through the same systems and processes as those immigrating from outside it. Moreover, those that are from countries NOT in the EU need to work fucking hard to get citizenship. Something an EU resident does not have to concern themselves about.

Se o utilizador quiser uma fonte maior então ele configura o browser.

Ter uma fonte padrão do tamanho X e depois ter alguém a forçar uma fonte de tamanho X + 3pt é um disparate, porque estás a forçar o utilizador a ser confrontado com um tamanho de fonte superior àquele que ele pretende, que não é controlado por ele.

Como o /r/portugal é sobre Portugal, creio que faça todo o sentido que as cores sigam o tema.  Preto e amarelo não é Portugal.  Só por aí, ter usado essas cores foi um erro.

Mesmo assim, as cores da bandeira portuguesa são notoriamente más em termos de visual.  Se tiveres mesmo de seguir um tema relacionado com Portugal então eu sugeria algo mais agradável à vista, como o branco e azul.  

O /r/lisboa também não é ideal no que diz respeito ao design, mas ao menos o esquema de cores que foi adoptado por lá não fere a vista.

 [**Women's suffrage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's%20suffrage): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Women's suffrage__ (also known as __woman suffrage__)  is the [right of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights) to vote and to stand for electoral office. Limited voting rights were gained by women in [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland) and some [western U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States) states in the late 19th century.  National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts to gain voting rights, especially the [International Woman Suffrage Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alliance_of_Women) (1904), and also worked for equal civil rights for women. 

&gt;In 1893, [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), then a self-governing British colony, granted adult women the right to vote and the self-governing British colony of [South Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia) did the same in 1895, the latter also permitting women to stand for office. Australia federated in 1901, and women acquired the right to vote and stand in federal elections from 1902, but discriminatory restrictions against [Aboriginal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians) women (and men) voting in national elections were not completely removed until 1962.   

&gt;The first European country to introduce women's suffrage was the [Grand Duchy of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland), then part of the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire), which elected the world's first female members of parliament in the [1907 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_parliamentary_election,_1907). [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) followed, granting full women's suffrage in 1913. Most European, Asian and African countries did not pass women's suffrage until after [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I). Late adopters were [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) in 1944, [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) in 1946, [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) in 1952,  [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) in 1971,  and [Liechtenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein) in 1984.  In the Americas, by contrast, the nations of North America and most nations in Central and South America passed women's suffrage before the war (see Table below).

&gt;Extended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before [universal suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage) for men; for instance, literate women were granted suffrage before all men received it. The [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the [Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_Against_Women) (1979) identifies it as a basic right. 187 countries are parties to the Convention.

t3_24fp74,,1398939060,1433602536,,False,0,"I don't deny that there might be some truth to the fact that there is a reduction in transmission rates of some stds and HIV. The fact that the circumcised penis undergoes keratinization and that the mucous membranes dry out and becomes tough skin would account for that. Since most STD's and HIV are transferred via bodily fluids sensitive mucous membranes are more likely to absorb said diseases. This has to be acknowledged however, this is not a good argument for a surgical procedure. It should also be noted that an infected man is still just as likely to infect a woman whether he's circumcised or not.

So while we can agree that there is a grain of truth to all this reduced infection risk stuff I think we can all agree that condoms renders pretty much all of these things moot. A condom will have an actual protection rate of 99.9% (or thereabouts), not that this is a ""protection"" rate and not a ""reduced risk"" rate.

The studies on HIV and HPV were conducted in Africa... it fails to mention a country where so I will just go general here and say that the culture over there is vastly different from the ""western"" world. I don't suppose you could to a simple check of percentages during the HIV outbreak in the US and compare it to say Europe.

The bit about prostate cancer is just ludicrous. Correlation and Causation, something that should apparently be taught more to researchers or to those that interpret studies.

Urinary tract infections are way more common among girls, even in countries with uncircumcised boys. I'm trying to find some numbers to compare but my country is not that good at keeping stats lying around the web. And in any case it's treated with antibiotics, I have never heard of any complaints from parents with girls about that treatment.

In the end we have this:

Circumcision may provide a reduced risk of contracting several types of STD's however, condoms and and some common sense work much better for this.

It may provide a reduced risk of UTI's but apparently having a penis is a much greater risk reduction and the infection itself is easily treated.

It does ""protect"" against any foreskin related problems such as phimosis which is in itself incredibly rare. But it only ""protects"" against it in the same way that pulling your teeth out ""protects"" against cavities. You can't hurt what isn't there but you can't benefit from it either.

The biggest one of all then, hygiene, what about that? Well since the foreskin is attached to the glans by a membrane identical to the one that keeps your nails attached to your fingertips. There is really no reason to concern yourself about hygiene issues of a child's penis. You wash the crotch region like any other part of the baby with a mild soap and warm water. When the foreskin naturally separates all that is needed is to daily rinse of the glans with warm water. Additionally to use toilet paper and wipe when you pee (this should be self evident). Smegma is the substance that keeps your penis clean and the ""cheese"" is the byproduct of the cleaning process. It's easy to remove and rinse off, and it's just as prominent in women as it is in men.

What circumcision removes is the right to bodily integrity, the most sensitive part of the penis, and a very functional contributor to the experience of sex from both parties. It removes the protection of the glans and destroys the production of antibacterial, antiviral and antifungual substances to keep it clean. It removes more than twice the amount of nerve endings as the external clitoris, meaning that the loss of sensation would be twice that of a cliterectomy.

Circumcision has no benefits that condoms and warm water cant provide better. Also, an uncircumcised man and choose to have the procedure done as an adult anytime he wants, a circumcised man can not choose to have the procedure undone. This is permanent modification and not the choice of the parents but the choice of the person subject to the procedure.",ch6rdby,6,,Black_caped_man,True,MensRights,False,t5_2qhk3,t1_ch6rdby,t3_24fp74,,0,6,0

I'm not sure about that. Take the EU budget negotiations, in which the UK was part of an 11 strong coalition. In areas such as currency we often pair with Denmark and Sweden, in energy with Poland, in many other things with the Netherlands (that's one/two examples per area. I'm sure there's more countries as well). The major difference is historic. When France initially blocked UK entry part of the reason is the UK had a vision closer to Germany's and more distant from France's. We are still closer to Germany than France in this respect.

Its also interesting to note you say each nation has a different view of what the EU should be (meaning everyone opposes and supports different things), but France only sees fit to question the UK vision.

WTF?  Have you not _read_ the proposal?  It says _nothing_ of the sort.  Specifically:

&gt; The Commission Proposal for a Council Decision on the system of own resources of the European Union of 29 June 201121, as amended on 9 November 201122, set out that part of receipts generated by the FTT shall constitute an own resource for the EU Budget. The GNI-based resource drawn from the participating Member States would be reduced accordingly. http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/com_2013_71_en.pdf


That is, given it's universality, some fraction of it is explicitly the EU share - _and thus the other monies paid to the EU will be reduced_.  This means that the EU's revenue is open to fluctuation in the event some drastic change, rather than it having first dibs on the general taxation pool.  VAT is done in _exactly_ the same way, as the FTT is effectively the same sort of thing as VAT, but on a different sort of entity.

The 'call up' rate on VAT is 0.33% of the total collected (modulo some accountancy adjustments, to allow for things like different zero rated commodities).  I can't find a proposed call up rate for the FTT, but there are notes about it being 'similar' to the VAT rate.

So, most of the work on the FTT is for harmonisation, rather than revenue gathering.  99.7% or so of the income from the tax would be the province of Westminster.

Aloita vaikka [tästä](http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2013/01/31/will-technology-bring-back-the-city-state/). Jatkolukemiseksi suosittelen kirjaa ""The Sovereign Individual"" (W. Rees-Mogg, J. D. Davidson). WSJ:n artikkelissa mainittua Carswellin kirjaa en ole lukenut, mutta se vaikuttaisi jatkavan The Sovereign Individualin teemaa. Kyseinen kirja julkaistiin n. 25 vuotta sitten, ja on osunut ennustuksissaan erittäin oikeaan.

Isot kansallisvaltiot ovat Euroopan historiassa olleet lyhytaikainen poikkeus, kaupunkivaltiot pitkäaikainen sääntö. Kansallisvaltiot syntyivät tarpeesta ylläpitää isoa armeijaa. Tuo tarve on osin kadonnut ja osin teknologia on parantamassa pienten toimijoiden asemaa. Tällä hetkellä Euroopassa kytee Skotlannin, Baskimaan, Katalonian ja Venetsian itsenäistyminen. Belgian kahtiajakoa on jo yritetty. Muita mahdollisia ovat esim. Bosnian jakautuminen 2-3 osaan sekä Transdniestrian itsenäistyminen. Paine on kohti pienempiä yksiköitä.

&gt;EU:ssa on itse asiassa alettu sulkemaan veroparatiiseja.

Esim. suomalaiselle sijoittajalle Belgia tai Hollanti voi olla veroparatiisi. Ei pääomatulojen veroa kummassakaan (vrt. Suomi 30%). Belgia ei tule nostamaan verotustaan, koska Brysselin poliitikot ja virkamiehet tykkäävät eduistaan.

&gt; Eiköhän se bitcoin siten myös pian kielletä

Vertaisverkkoa ei voi pysäyttää, eikä kieltoa valvoa. Valtion pakolle verotuksessa on kryptorahan keksimisen myötä kehittynyt ensimmäistä kertaa uskottava vastavoima.

&gt;__Salo__ is a traditional [Eastern European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe) food consisting of cured slabs of [fatback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatback) (rarely [pork belly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_belly)), with or without skin. The word *salo* is used in [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia), and [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus), but the food is commonly eaten and known under different names in other countries across the region. It is usually [salted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_salt) or brine fermented, hence the names *slonina/slana/szalonna* (*solonýna* in Ukrainian means any kind of [salt-cured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation\)) meat, such as [corned beef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corned_beef)). The Eastern European one is sometimes treated with [paprika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika) or other condiments, while the Southeast European one is often [smoked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking\)).

&gt; There's not one reason to believe that immigrants will integrate more easily if they're forced to learn English, that this would create job or that it's even feasible to use it in society on a wide scale

English is very present in our society, period. And it works to create jobs in lowincome countries who provide outsourced jobs. And no, I can't prove it's beneficial to integration as it's my opinion on the subject but maybe it could be less stigmatizing then the broken dutch which is currently used as a pinpoint to brand people as 'not doing enough effort so gtfo'. And doesn't Europe want to motivate people to move/work around in Europe more? What's the base language that will be used before the local emigrants have learned the local language?

&gt; Dutch is important because it's the language of our society, without which you can't be a full part of it. Everything, from schools, to business to police to courts to taxes to politics to ""toogpraat"" is in Dutch, not in English.

We both have access to the facts, but you're not reasoning critically about them, and you're overlooking (or actively ignoring?) the ones that don't suit you. What were the time spans for the Chechen wars? How many years of fighting took place before they had [a very dubious referendum?](http://www.economist.com/node/1651376) Also, the question of who is supervising/managing the referendum is a crucial one. In Chechnya, it was Russia. In Crimea, it was Russia, acting through the self-appointed gangster PM. In East Ukr, it will probably be Russia by proxy. Funny how Russia gets the results it wants in the referendums it stages. Stalin had a famous adage about that, of which I'm sure you're aware.

&gt; Chechens being forced to register, on pain of losing food aid; and disputes about the size of the electorate. Local people and humanitarian agencies say a census in the republic last October was inflated... Tens of thousands of Russian troops stationed in the region were given a vote.

&gt; Thus few outside the Kremlin regard the referendum as fair. The Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) refused to legitimise the poll by sending formal observers, though the Russians did persuade the OSCE to send a small group of “fact-finders”. Last year, the OSCE closed its mission in Chechnya after the Russian government refused to let it continue monitoring human rights there.

The fact that the referendum results had numbers similar to Crimea, North Korean elections, Iraqi elections under Saddam should tell you quite a bit about this referendum. 

&gt; I think you are blatantly twisting the facts when you say that ""all polls indicated that only about 40% of the locals wanted to join Russia"", plenty of anti-Russian bloggers and Western media have reluctantly admitted that overall majority wanted to leave Ukraine. I do agree with you with regards to the absence of status quo option. 

I'm twisting the facts? I'm merely referencing public polls, which you can find for yourself. Look up the polls from any time before the annexation - a few were done as late as February. You're using a nonsense argument that bloggers (wow, real experts) somehow know more than pollsters who actually gathered information on the question at hand by asking thousands of people in the region, and thus, are supposedly in the position to ""admit"" something. To argue that bloggers can ""admit"" that Crimeans wanted separation implies that bloggers had some privileged information about what Crimeans wanted, which is untrue. The best information about what Crimeans wanted came from the polls that came out at the time, which did not support independence, nor joining Russia. I suggest you stop twisting things to suit your preconceived opinion of the situation, and stop making dubious arguments.

Incidentally, even though Crimeans are forced to get a Russian passport now to access a variety of gov't benefits, these passports have been about as popular as ebola. That tells you quite a bit about public sentiment towards the annexation in the region.

&gt; If people demand referendum they should get it. 

I already addressed this. The question is, what people are demanding a referendum, and under what circumstances?

&gt; Whatever the timing of referendum should be it should definitely take place before general/presidential elections.

Yes, clearly, the most auspicious time for the referendum to take place is under a flood of Russian propaganda, and while the region is occupied by foreign forces and local extremists, both of whom have intimidated the pro-Ukrainians in the region with everything from book burnings to torture, violence, and killings. 

&gt; And just FYI, Russia state media channels have been banned from Ukrainian air for about two months now. Up until very recently (when a local TV station has been ""captured"" two days ago and a single Russian Rossija 24 channel has been enabled) so all the locals have been getting from TV is Ukrainian side. 

FYI, you're either misinformed or you're twisting things to suit your agenda again. Yes, Russian channels have been officially banned. However, that ban has been enforced very sporadically. Some Russian channels have gone off the air in some parts of Donetsk for some period of time. In some regions, separatists have even stormed TV stations and forced them to replace Ukrainian channels with Russian ones.

To understand the effects of Russian propaganda, take a look at opinion polls in the East from Feb and early March, and compare them to opinion polls now. Separatist sentiment has risen. Popular support for federalization (pushed by Russian gov't), which was a non-issue a couple of months ago, is very high. Both independence and federalization have much less support than maintaining the status quo. Separatist leader Pushilin recently traveled to Moscow, and thanked the Kremlin for its support, including, ""informational support"" for a reason.

&gt;  I don’t want to use what is now become a cliche of Russian rhetoric but Kosovo did set a precedent. Serbia lost part of its territory and no one asked Serbs opinion. Wait.. Also nobody asked the opinion of Kosovo, there was no referendum. United Nations have always maintained that the right to self-determination is one of the most important ones.

You seem unhappy about the Kosovo situation because Kosovo separated from Serbia (are you from there?), yet you're promoting separatism in Ukraine. Under current circumstances, meaningful referendums are impossible. Taruta offered a referendum for June, didn't he? Even that's far too early. Things need to get settled, and if there is genuine (not a few thousand extremists and foreigners) massive will for a referendum, that's fine. However, at the moment, these referendums are being used to legitimate foreign and extremist aggression. The separatists will not conduct a fair poll (just look at Crimea), and even if they wanted to, they could not conduct a meaningful one under present circumstances.",ch6rybu,3,,billjarvis,True,worldnews,False,t5_2qh13,t1_ch6rybu,t1_ch65qg6,,0,3,0

Austria is the traditional home of the Holy Roman Empire, which presumably united the dozens of states that make up Germany, plus some other random shit, but really it was a tentative hold at best- something more like if one power ran the EU or the UN, it's still a pretty flimsy rule. Plus the whole Reformation and Thirty Years War happened, where Austria was Catholic but many other Germans were Protestant. So not really the most united empire ever, the Austrians were more like that bitchy aunt who would come over and boss you around when your parents were out. Gradually their association got to be less and less until it was dissolved completely. So now you've got a bunch of petty states and Austria. Because of their past, the rest of Germany doesn't really like or trust Austria. For the time being though Austria is still the big dog and the rest of the Germans just have to deal.

But wait, Prussia comes out of nowhere in North Germany and unites/conquers all of those petty states, plus a few bits off Austria, and declares themselves the German empire. Holy shit! Nobody was expecting that. Well now the rest of Europe is already kind of nervous about German expansion and the balance of power, so instead of swallowing the German part of the Austrian Empire, the Germans become BFFs with the Austrians for complicated reasons. This eventually leads to WWI, which was bad. Then there's WWII, when you have the Nazis, and that resulted in Germany getting chopped up like a stolen Mercedes. Austria became an independent state separate from what would become East and West and then just regular Germany, and even today they retain a certain independent national spirit that is wholly separate from the cultural and national heritage of Germany.

Your spine will work just fine. Doing regular proper bridges makes your neck stronger, so you're less likely to get hurt by a variety of things (including head strikes).

&gt;Your neck is still shorter than your femur regardless, it still displaces you less.

Doesn't matter. You only need an inch.

&gt;This may be true but it is impossible to say at the moment as the UFC is so very insular and full of North American talent to the exclusion of almost everybody else.

They've brought in the top talent from other countries, they did very poorly against sub-top talent from North America. That's because other countries don't have Folkstyle wrestling. The reason they underperform when faced with American fighters is because they have a deficiency in the area Folkstyle excels at while the Americans don't have a comparable deficiency that the non-Americans have a strength in.

&gt;Europe has a lot of judo talent that may shake things up.

The only Judoka who are shaking things up are from America, if they don't train Folkstyle itself, they borrow a lot from it, as De Mars and Pedro do in their instruction. We haven't seen *any* non-American Judoka shake things up.

&gt;Anyway, I could say the same thing about Canadians, you know nothing about wrestling because you're not from the US.

We're next to each other, and both of us cross the border to wrestle with each other as well as to train with each other. Canadians aren't in anyway as sophisticated on the ground as Americans are, but we still know a lot more about it than anywhere else (except maybe Mexico).

&gt;What folkstylists do on the ground is kind of pointless to know however, unless they're winning the ADCC.

ADCC is an invite tournament, not an open one. It's highly regarded because of the payouts, but it isn't as significant as you'd like it to be because it isn't an open tournament.

&gt;If, yes. However the kata gatame part is not 'dead easy'. And won't you be on the wrong side for a crucifix if you have kata gatame locked in?

No, locked in means you have your hands together in position (or hand and arm locked together if your arm length suits that better), you're only on the wrong side if you're in position to finalise it.

&gt;Do folk wrestlers even dominate at NAGA?

They dominate MMA, which is the most important test, especially since that's where striking actually happens.

I grew up in the 80s in a small town. The girls tended to wear more revealing clothing, especially when Madonna was popular, but were still REALLY uptight about sex. For each girl that actually had sex there were 50 guys who wanted sex. Right now, Americans are more open about sex, but are far behind the European sex-positive mentality. 

Dating was very frustrating as the girls expected the guys to do and buy everything and the girls did not reciprocate. They were still stuck in the 1950s. Thus they were not LTR material. Which explains why I didn't date much in high school. 

Yes there were lots of parties in high school. There were drugs, but it was mostly pot. Parties were easier in a small town because we could drive to the middle of the woods and party there with no problems from the police (usually). 

I got a divorce and started dating again. I think someone summed it up a lot when they said ""I'm just too scared to take a risk. I might get hurt."" People seem too scared to even ask someone out, and so they stay single for years and years. 
Sure you have to be ready to date or it won't be fun. But still you don't want to let fear control your life and limit your happiness. **Dare to be happy.**

1) Activate all missile defense systems (and AA, and all that sort of thing). Begin taking out every incoming missile those godless scumbags send out way.

2) Bring two thirds of the Pacific Fleet through the Panama Canal, to join up with the Atlantic Fleet in Northern Brazil.

3) Evacuate civilians from Buenos Aires. Atlas clearly has no consideration for civilian life, we must do what we can to protect them, despite the gargantuan effort required.

4) Send the entire military into defensive positions, ready to hold firm should they land troops on our soil. Empress Thalia, having completed four years of military service shortly before she became empress, has travelled to join up with General Gonzales in northern Bolivia and fight alongside the people.

5) Regrettably, we must initiate a draft, increasing our military to 1% of our population (2,716,000) over the next year. 

6) Fire our own missiles at Atlas forces as they come towards us, and also back to Europe, aiming for military installations- airfields, naval bases and other military forts/ bases. We will also fire EMPs into their advancing fleet/s.

&gt;Besides, both Germany AND France both just had elections and neither of those countries got an anti-EU victor, so your point's kind of moot.

Nobody expects any anti-EU victories in the major economies of Europe, but that doesn't mean there isn't huge support for the idea, and the major parties of Europe will have to start to reflect that eventually. How many conservative voters are anti-EU? how many Labour voters? Not everyone who is against the EU will vote UKIP. 

&gt;A policy that doesn't take into account the fact that we clearly don't know who is coming, and so can only deal with the ones already here. 

Not sure what you are trying to say here, but that is exactly my point. If our policy is, only 50,000 can come each year, and 40,000 will be highly skilled workers, we can have a much better idea of how our population will grow. If we know we already need a million new houses to house the people already here, then we can calculate how many houses we need to build each year in order to meet our needs in a sensible time frame. 

&gt;This is the equivalent, just so you know, of having prison overflowing with criminals and the solution be to stop sending people to prison.


Just so you know, we already do this, by making certain crimes non eligible for prison time, such as the possession of small amounts of drugs. 


&gt;So, no. These problems like housing, the NHS, education, finding work, inadequate public services, inadequate roads, these categorically cannot be caused by immigrants because about as many people leave as those that enter

This is not true. NET migration jumped last year by 30% to 212,000, and has been well above 100,000 for at least the last 5 years. No where near ""about as many people leave as those that enter"". 

And this goes further to prove my point, how do you predict an increase of 30% in one year? and how do you plan for that? do these people not use the roads, schools, the NHS and do they not need houses to live in?


&gt;Why? The EU-imposed rules are much stricter than our five-tier system. Basically ""get a job within three months or get out""

There needs to be restrictions based on our needs as a country, there are already many people in the building trade out of work for example, so there should be a way of limiting those numbers effectively, which there clearly is not at the moment. 

&gt;We know how many people immigrate here from the EU because they don't go through the same systems and processes as those immigrating from outside it.

But we have no control over how many, as I mentioned previously, there can easily be an increase of up to 30% in one year, which is impossible to plan for. A points based system and a general limit on the total, say 50,000 would mean we could plan for how our services will cope with the increases. 

&gt;Because governments can always be trusted to work with logic and ethics.

Not if left to their own devices, but that's why people should get more involved. ",ch6s9z3,1,,Capsulets,True,ukpolitics,False,t5_2qhcv,t1_ch6s9z3,t1_ch6r98v,,0,1,0

&gt; “A lot of it is driven by nothing: A dispute over a girl or a wrong look or a perceived slight.”

This is not really surprising. These kids essentially live in an entirely honour and reputation based society. In many ways they mirror exactly the sort of society you would have seen in historical times in Europe before there was a strong central government enforcing laws or even today in isolated areas where there is no such government.

They act the way they do because it is exactly the 'right' way to act in the circumstances they are in.

Most people living in civilized society will not escalate things to violence over minor perceived slights and disputes, for the simple reason that we don't have to. We live with the knowledge that if there ever is a major conflict we will be able to appeal to the authorities, the police, the courts etc to resolve it.

If you live in a society without authorities that you can trust, you don't have that assurance. You will have to rely on other means to protect yours and yourself.

The best protection in these cases is always a reputation of strength and the willingness to come down hard on anyone who tries to screw you over. If you live in such a society honour and reputation are literally worth more than your life because they are the only thing keeping others from trying to take advantage of yourself and your people. You have to be willing to answer even minor slights with violence or be perceived as weak and risking that people will take advantage of your weakness.

This is not a calculated thing that these people consciously think about this is something running automatically in the background of your brain that has helped your ancestors to survive and prosper since before we discovered fire.

It has been a guiding principle for most of human history. You can see it everywhere, big and small.

The main problem here is that there are entire subcultures in otherwise civilized countries like the US that have absolutely no faith (and with good reason) that there exist an authority or a system that would protect them and fairly judge them in conflicts.

If you don't think you can call the cops when somebody tries to hurt you or steal from you, because you are doing something illegal like drugs or prostitution or because you are poor and or black and think all cops are racists tools of the rich, you will have to find other means to protect yourself and mostly that simply works out as acquiring strength in numbers and a reputation as someone not to be fucked with.

You have to work hard to keep that reputation. Occasionally you have to react to the slightest slight with extreme violence to keep things up.",ch6sbfs,312,,Loki-L,True,news,False,t5_2qh3l,t1_ch6sbfs,t3_24g1ai,,1,312,0

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2616576/Subway-removes-ham-pork-nearly-200-stores-strong-demand-Muslims-eat-Halal-meat.html

&gt; Fast food giant Subway has removed ham and bacon from almost 200 outlets, and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its Muslim customers.
&gt;
&gt; It has confirmed turkey ham and turkey rashers will be used instead in 185 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to halal rules.
&gt;
&gt; The chain, which has around 1,500 outlets across the UK, explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with 'the views of religious communities'.

Or if you don't like the Mail as a source, how about this

http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/04/30/did-subway-really-cut-bacon-and-ham-from-185-stores-due-to-islamic-demand/

&gt; A Subway spokeswoman confirmed to TheBlaze Wednesday that the company has responded over the past few years to an increasingly diverse population by providing halal meats, but declined to comment directly on whether ham and bacon have been removed from the menu at select locations.
&gt;
&gt; “Due to the growing popularity of the Subway chain, with the diverse multicultural population across the U.K. and Ireland, we put a program in place in 2007 to ensure that the population demographic is taken into account when new store openings are considered in order that we meet consumer demand in each location,” the spokeswoman said in a statement.
&gt;
&gt; “All our suppliers comply with EU animal welfare legislation as a minimum and we require suppliers of halal products to adopt the stunning of animals prior to their slaughter. All halal meats are certified by the appropriate halal authorities,” the statement said.
&gt;
&gt; The spokeswoman declined to address whether certain stores display “all meats are halal” signs, saying only that there are signs at select locations letting customers know that meats sold within comply with Islamic standards.
&gt;
&gt; “All halal Subway stores have numerous signs stating that they serve halal food,” she said. “These are situated on the menu panels, nutritional information and in the front window of the store.”
&gt;
&gt; Pressed further about reports that ham and bacon have been removed completely from menus at 185 locations, the spokeswoman did not answer directly.
&gt;
&gt; “It is factually correct to say that the Subway brand have approximately 185 stores that serve halal food in the UK and Ireland,” she said.
&gt;
&gt; She added that the Daily Mail article infers that there has been a “sudden change” in policy over Subway’s handling of the issue, which the company says is “incorrect,” saying that the program has been in place since 2007.
&gt;
&gt; The U.K. Bristol Post reported this week that two specific locations have indeed cut ham and bacon from their menus, serving only halal meats, which staff members at the two locations confirmed to TheBlaze.
&gt;
&gt; The meat practices at the remaining 183 stores were not confirmed.",ch6sbp2,-1,,RabidRaccoon,True,worldnews,False,t5_2qh13,t1_ch6sbp2,t1_ch6s9u2,,0,-1,0

The Fourth Turning describes how the European/American view of history as an endless progression rather than a saecular cycle has led to most of the major world wars, and then shows a perfect correlation of major European/American wars and saecular cycles all the way back to 1488, demonstrating quite clearly that the very hubris of a progress-based view of history is primarily responsible for the vast majority of violence since the dark ages.",ch6sc7u,2,,[deleted],True,islam,False,t5_2qhbp,t1_ch6sc7u,t1_ch6n6il,,0,2,0

I went to work. I was the first in and the last to leave. i did shit jobs and didn't bitch about them. I suffered shitty bosses and asshole co-workers. I avoided those who I could, and I crushed those I couldn't avoid.

I watched my classmates and peers go off to Europe, or wait years to find the ""perfect"" job, or spend their time and resources on all sorts of other things. I watched them get distracted, or entitled, or lazy.

Now they send me their resume's hoping I'll have a position for them. 

OP is worried about fucking around in Europe when people are out of work all over? How many topics in this forum are about ""can't find a job"" or similar? Spare me your downvotes, kids.

I see even the Guardian are now pandering to UKIP, giving them first comment - and a nonsense one at that, I don't imagine Farage (a former ~~banker~~ *trader*) has a clue what the CJEU actually ruled.

For anyone interested in what actually happened, the case is listed as C-209/13, you can search for it [here](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/). The Council Decision the UK Government was throwing money at to try to annul is [Decision 2013/52/EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:022:0011:0012:EN:PDF), and has only two Articles, just saying that the 11 countries *can*, if they want to, set up a financial transaction tax. The UK Government's arguments failed as it was arguing against the possible proposed financial transaction taxes, rather than this Decision which merely says that the 11 countries can set up a financial transaction tax.

First and foremost, as I posted in my mini-update last week, we’re working every day to reduce gold farming and botting, which detract from the gameplay experience for everyone. You may have seen Customer Support GMs in the game over the last week actively banning bots in dungeons. We’re also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to keep the game honest and will continue to do so. Please keep helping us by reporting botting and spamming activity in-game.

We’re also continuing to fix bugs as we find them and as players report them to us. In a world as large as ESO’s, with endless variations of gameplay by players, it is impossible for QA to identify all bugs before launch, but we’re working hard to find and close them quickly. We’ve fixed many quest blockers, especially in zone, NPC guild, and main story quests, but we know there are still others. These affect far fewer players, but they’re annoying when encountered and we will address them. Fixes are getting patched in during our regular weekly updates, and of course Update 1 (see below) will contain many more.

As you may have seen from the patch notes on PTS (Update 1 has been available to our PTS players for a week), the first update contains much more than just Craglorn, our first Adventure Zone. It also contains lots of tweaks and bug fixes above and beyond what we’ve been doing on the live servers. Keep in mind that the PTS patch notes aren’t final—more changes will be made as we continue testing. Here’s a summary of what’s new in Update 1:

Craglorn, the first Adventure Zone, specifically created for groups of Veteran Rank 1 and above characters

Trials, which are 12-player “raid”-type instances for Veteran Rank characters, featuring completion time leaderboards

Death recap: you can now see who killed you and what ability they were using. This is invaluable information in dungeons, PvP, and Craglorn

Underdog bonuses in Cyrodiil—you’ll get more Alliance Points and XP while fighting for an alliance with a lower population in your campaign

Animation tweaks and polish

Combat ability balance changes and fixes

Class ability tweaks and updates

Content bug fixes, especially edge cases where quests could become de-synced

And much, much more—check out the final patch notes when they are posted in the forums

Update 1 will hit the live servers as soon as testing is completed on PTS. Stay tuned for news about the exact date you’ll be able to play it.



ESO REVIEWS

As those who follow ESO closely know, a wide range of reviews have been posted for the game, with scores ranging from 90s to 50s. ESO generates strong emotions in gamers—both positive and negative. While I obviously don’t agree with the more negative articles, the reviews are out there, and we read them to determine if there are legitimate complaints that we should address. We are gratified by the many positive fan comments—the love that those fans express for ESO motivates us to keep working to make this the best MMO ever. Some of the negativity in reviews comes from bugs. As you can see, we’re hard at work addressing them and will keep rolling out fixes. The important thing for you, the community, to know is that we’re looking at ALL the feedback (from critics and from players), we’re addressing any shortcomings, and we’ll continue to do so. This game will get better and better every week.

The true measure of ESO is what players in the game think. We’re starting up several community programs that put you in the spotlight and ask you to submit your builds, guilds, screenshots, and more—the chronicles of your life in Tamriel—for us to share. Games like ESO are very, very large and have enormous breadth, and sometimes you’ll find that watching videos and reading stories by other players about the fun and interesting things they’ve done in-game will lead you in a different direction to try new things. You can find a link to information about some of these programs here. 



COMING IN FUTURE UPDATES

Along with fixing bugs, combatting black market gold farmers, and balance tweaks, we have a long list of features and updates we’re working on that will be coming throughout 2014 and beyond. Here’s a sneak peek at what’s coming up. For most of these, we don’t know yet which update they’ll be in, but they’re under active development right now:

A system that allows grouped players to see each other even when they’re in different phases

A justice system—steal from and kill NPCs and deal with the consequences if you are caught

Migration of European Megaserver to our European datacenter.

Field of View (FOV) adjustment

Armor dyeing and tinting

Two new Veteran Dungeons: Crypt of Hearts and City of Ash

New region of Craglorn with a new Trial (the Serpent)

Increased ability to pick up items in the world

Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood storyline and quests.

Spellcrafting

Horse Racing

Dragonstar Arena—similar  to Trials, but built for a group of four

Improvements to fishing

Crafting system improvements

Improved Looking for Group system  

Better NPC facial animations

Guild functionality updates: guild store interface updates, customizable guild insignias, tabards, and guild ranks, 
and Guild Kiosks—guild stores open to everyone that are available to the highest-bidding guild.

Auto-leveling dungeons that level to your group leader

Awards when you repeat dungeons

Imperial City PvP dungeon

We recognize that some of the launch issues—especially black market botting and spam, de-synced quests, and the disappearing bank slot bug—affected the early gameplay experience of a number of players. Fixing these problems required us to take the megaservers offline, costing players time in the game. In recognition of this experience and to show our gratitude to everyone who supported the launch, we are giving an additional five days of included game time to every ESO player who set up an active account prior to 8pm EDT Thursday May 1st and who are currently enjoying their 30 days of included game time. If you’re eligible to receive the five additional days, a confirmation will be sent to your account’s registered email address. For further details, please visit help.elderscrollsonline.com. This is a small gesture to show our thanks for being part of the ESO community while we work to make this extraordinary game and service even better.

As we end this first month of our journey together, we want to express sincere appreciation to our loyal fans. Be assured that we are working diligently to keep ESO balanced, stable, and fresh for veteran players. We’ve gotten through our launch month well and are heading towards our first update soon. After that, expect many more good things in ESO.  Thank you so much for your support and continued enthusiasm about the game—now I’m off to level my Nightblade.

The species produces very large [polypore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore) [fruit bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiocarp) which are shaped like a [horse's hoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_hoof) and vary in colour from a silvery grey to almost black, though they are normally brown. It grows on the side of various species of tree, which it infects through broken bark, causing [rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus). The species typically continues to live on trees long after they have died, changing from a [parasite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite) to a [decomposer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposer).

Just like when he says he has some admiration for Putin, but certainly can't admire a lot of things, he's suddenly great friends of Putins. Sure.

An pointing out the obvious about fisheries rights in a speech, largely positive and, becomes Salmond threatening the EU.

Is Africa not African because it was invaded and conquered by Europeans?

Do you know what the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus is? It is a nation formed by Turkey when Greece and Cyprus began serious discussion of Greece annexing Cyprus. Turkey and Greece are not and have never been on good terms (considering how Asia Minor was Greek until Turkish migration and takeover). Turkey ans Cyprus were close trading partners so Turkey decided that it would be better to invade them then late the become part of Greece.

They took over the northern part of Cyprus and then were stopped. They decided that they would need some legitimacy for North Cyprus to not be part of the rest of Cyprus (which is largelly of Greek descent) so they allowed Cyprusian citizens to leave and had Turkish soldiers who had taken the part of the islans and were stationed there move their fanilies to the island as well

That was decades ago. Now North Cyprus has a majority Turkish population of people who were born there.

That's not my opinion; That's the nature of statistics.

&gt; The US is not alone.

I didn't say it was. I specifically said there could be other countries that have similar diverse opinions but I'm not familiar with them enough to comment on them. I would think that Russia would be likely to have polar opposite opinions, and should be subdivided, but I simply don't know and don't know if there are already known and easy to define regions as there are in the US.

The huge population of the US being spread out over such a large geographical area definitely makes a single number (for *any* public opinion poll) pretty much meaningless, especially compared to smaller European countries. I mean, the US has THIRTY times more people. Comparing those two just makes no sense. 

I guess if you think you are getting some meaning out of it, then go ahead...But as an American I can tell you without a doubt, you're not. You could say public opinion is X in the Czech Republic and it is much more likely to be an accurate statement than saying public opinion in the US is X. And since the US is so huge, we have polls by state, which we can use to show exactly that. That link about public opinion has the US at 60%, but many states in the south are in the 30-40% range.

Ah, you see, that also gets quite a few people, but the problem with these ""benefits"" are that most of them are myths propagated by the hospitals as there is money to be made in circumcising kids. 

Here, look at it this way. The majority of the world no longer practices circumcision yet the opposite of the supposed benefits (less likely to catch and STI/ cleanliness) are happening in Europe. The United States has some of the highest STD transmission rates in the world, and cleanliness is hardly an issue in a first world country with running water.

t3_23io9l,,1398948006,1433603434,,False,0,"bone meal is a great way to add slow release P to soils  or you can look for fertilizers that  have a good N:P:K mixture . If you use bone meal water it in thoroughly . We would scarify or verti cut the greens . The spread over a very fine topdressing with added bone meal or you can apply the bone meal on it's own  , brush it into the lawn then water in so it soaks down .  little and often is the best  method so  work out what your yearly rate should be (normally on the box) then apply it 3 or 4 doses   (say 1 kg will do your lawn then spread 300g 3 times a year ) This helps prevent burning of any top growth. watering in also makes it sink deeper into your soil encouraging the roots to go down to feed . Also raise your height of cut by a third . Root growth is directly connected to the amount of top growth. 

For a more drastic way to add Bone meal . Hollow core the lawn . gather up the cores and add bone meal to it  at the specified rate then top dress with that brushing it into the holes you made . This opens up the soil to make it easier for the roots to go deeper  , relieves and compaction (so if you have drainage problems it can help with that) and encourages mic-organism to reproduce More oxygen enters the soil structure)  . 

Getting a good balance takes years so don't try doing it all at once . Use sulphate or iron as your fertilizer rather than the instant lawn green stuff . It requires less applications builds up the plant and can be used as an anti moss treatment . 

Think of it as a 3 year project . Try to aim for a DARK green turf rather than a bright green turf . Darker shades show that the plant is putting more energy into producing a more efficient leaf  that is harder wearing than pale green fast growing plant that uses all it's storage of energy to quickly . 

A plant that is stronger is also more disease resistant , Fusarium patch is discouraged with a good balanced feeding regime . On our course we used a 3:12:9 NPK even though we were a links course if we needed to add P . supplement with sequested seaweed as it was a liquid fert that had a 9:3:8 NPK and could be applied as often as need to give a quick boost (maybe 4 times a year or an extra dose 3 weeks before a competition week).   

Peat based top dressings are a good balanced way of improving your soil . normally slightly higher in N than P or K but it is a slow way of releasing N as it breaks down into your soil over a 6 month period . It hold nutrients well  (less loss of nitrogen which is very water soluble and washes out quickly) . 

Your aim is not to just add one thing but to bring a balance to your lawn slowly not to shock it . Rapid changes in Ph or nutrient  content will weaken plants opening up to diseases and environmental damage.      

Maybe it because of being in the EU but UK Golf Clubs tend to use good soil husbandry through more organic means rather than the use concentrates to improve turf  often with a 3 to 5 year plan.

Fischer was correct in that Germany sought to engage other significant empires in a large-scale struggle; that's just a fact. He is also *separately* correct that the conditions in Europe were such that a hugely expansive war was a risk. *However,* he does so in hindsight, and if you look carefully, he explicitly distinguishes between the *possibility* of a Great War and Germany's intent. For him, the risk was poorly calculated. Other historians have summarily dismissed Germany's culpability for all the powers who entered the war entirely of their own volition, and I think that's actually the mainstream opinion.

Second, the classic counterpoint to the Fischer thesis is simply that Germany was in no way unique in bumping shoulders with its imperial neighbors, rhetorically or militarily; under this framework the Great War was an ordinary continental power struggle that got vastly out of hand.

Thirdly, Fischer is very interested in assigning blame because he has a grand narrative of history (of which you should be *extremely* suspicious, no matter whose narrative it is) where Germany was on a monotonic downslope between the Reformation and the Third Reich.

The series is set in 17th-century [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), in which the small fictional town of [Grantville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grantville_(1632_series\)), [West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia), in the year 2000 was [sent to the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) in central Germany in the year 1631, during the [Thirty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War).

&gt;Are there a lot of antibiotic? Yes. Are they necessary? Yes. 

That's a pretty sketchy use of the word 'valid.'  The main use of antibiotics in livestock are as growth promoters.  Antibiotics are mixed with animal feed at sub-therapeutic levels solely to increase growth.  The antibiotics largely pass through the animal unchanged and are left in the excrement.  Sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics cause an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  It's 'valid' only from the viewpoint of the meat producers' profits at the expense of an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth enhancers.  The FDA is only asking meat producers to voluntarily eliminate antibiotic use as growth promoters.  Why?

""Lowering or halting sub-therapeutic antibiotic use in animal production could have serious economic effects on the meat and poultry industry. According to a report released in May 2001 by USDA's Economic Research Service, discontinuing the use of antimicrobial drugs in hog production would initially decrease feed efficiency, raise food costs, reduce production and raise prices to consumers. According to the same report, U.S. hog producers saved about $63 million in feed costs in 1999 due to their use of low levels of sub-therapeutic drugs; they would have suffered an estimated loss of $45.5 million in 1999 if the drug use was banned.""

Over the past several decades worker productivity in the west has steadily improved. However pay and conditions has scarcely changed and in some cases has gotten worse. Capitalists tell us that people who work hard will be rewarded. So why isn't that happening?

The answer lies in supply and demand. With the addition of eastern Europe, China and other developing countries, the supply of labour available in the capitalist marketplace has massively increased, whilst demand hasn't kept up. So huge amounts of production has moved to asia. Companies have made lots of profits from this move and their owners have patted eachother on the back and told eachother how clever they were to make such money and how such cleverness proves they are worth every penny in their bonuses.

According to libertarian pseudo-theory this would all eventually even out - in the short term wages would fall in the west, and rise in the east, but eventually they'd reach some soft of parity and everyone could go back to getting richer together. This is basically what happened when the US developed in the 19th century, and in Japan in the second half of the twentieth. This makes many of the capitalists complacent - they don't care about any short term misery because they figure it will all work out in the end.

However this theory is wrong. It simply cannot work for China, simply because China is far too large. The amount by which world output would have to increase in order to give the people of China an income that's even half of that currently enjoyed by the west is completely unrealistic - there simply isn't enough stuff to go round. The world has already passed peak oil, and China is destroying it's own environment trying to keep up with it's current production. 

The shift of production to the East has created massive trade imbalances, and this in turn has resulted in heavy indebtedness amongst western governments. The people of western countries are a long way from accepting that the logic of capitalism dictates that they need to work harder for less to compete with Asians. 

The situation is currently very unstable. Governments use tactics such as quantitative easing and artificial property booms to try to keep the wheels turning, but these are both temporary measures that don't address the underlying issues. Sweeping issues under the carpet likes this merely allows them to build up further and eventually things are likely to come to a head in some way. Most western politicians seem to have failed to heed the lessons of 2008 - they put it down to a one-off anomaly caused by illegal practices that have now been dealt with. It wasn't - it was merely a harbinger of the worse crises that we are yet to face. Our current economic recovery is a result of political manipulation of the housing market - i.e. the very forces that drove us towards the 2008 collapse, but also the only answer our politicians can come up with to deal with our stagnant economy.

Meanwhile, with everyone worried about how they can produce more and more, wondering how can we increase our manufacturing to keep up with the Chinese etc, an even larger danger is building up in the air we breathe. Climate change is real, and the development of more and more economies is making it's effects both deeper and more inevitable.  

In other words, we're doubly screwed. I'm sorry - but I don't have any easy answers to offer.",ch6u7p4,40,,cathartis,True,ukpolitics,False,t5_2qhcv,t1_ch6u7p4,t3_24g62r,,0,40,0

Some tips I have for playing Pub Matchs on it are:

* At the start of the match, Lights should go for the EU while Heavies should secure the AA. Mediums should provide support for your Lights while collecting.

* As with all Siege maps, once you drop off the EU, get to the AA.

* Heavies should stay in the bunker at AA while securing and heal outside on your side of the bunker so you still stay in the zone. Mediums and Lights should protect the top and flanks.

* Try to collect EU, even if you the ship is launched. That way, once the ship goes down, you can quickly power up a new one.

* Use the tunnels and flank the enemy if they have the AA. Since its on a bridge, many people get the idea that an attack will come from only 1 side, getting behind them will cause a lot of chaos and open it up for re-taking

&gt; thought crime is next.

No, no it's not. The man here committed what is widely-known and well-established as a very racist act. It's illegal under Spanish law, as it is forbidden to ""provoke discrimination, hate or violence against groups or associations due to racist, anti-Semitic reasons"". The Spanish government is not some authoritarian Big Brother.

I see from your flair that you're American, so I'm going to make an assumption or two, and I apologise if I'm wrong. But you're probably thinking that the man's freedom of speech and expression has been violated, or that you don't enjoy freedom of speech/expression in Spain. Well, you do and his hasn't. He has violated Dani Alves' rights by turning up at his place of work and subjecting him to racial abuse. Imagine if it wasn't a millionaire footballer who this happened to, but a black man working a minimum wage job while some idiot throws a banana at him and screams racist abuse. In the eyes of the law, these two cases would be treated the same way.

In any case, no country has absolute right to freedom of speech, the US included. You couldn't shout someone's credit card details out on the street could you? Or if you're a soldier or just someone who knew somehow, you couldn't go about freely telling people access codes in bases or battle plans could you? You can't say you have a bomb at airport security and not face repercussions (IIRC, an Irishman was arrested about 10 years ago for joking that he had a bomb in his bag at an airport in the US). 

Now in the US, hate speech is protected, and fair enough its your country. But its not protected throughout Europe. There are cultural and historical reasons for this difference. Firstly, the most destructive war in human history was fought across mainland Europe, with the defeated side having an ideology centred on racism. Which also culminated in the killing of 6 million people based on race, and millions more on other reasons, among other things. Secondly, political culture throughout Europe is generally more left-leaning than the US. That's not to say we're all communists or socialists, but simply that we welcome government involvement in more areas than necessarily happens in America. We need to effectively combat racism, which remains a significant problem throughout Europe, and it's natural to us that there would be serious repercussions for us. Personally I find it quite condescending the way so many Americans are in here calling it stupid and not even attempting to understand why its happening. As a Spainish fella said elsewhere, it seems strange to me that there is a federal ban on gambling in the US, but I wouldn't question your right to ban it. 

Racism, racist acts and hate speech all have no place in the modern world. They're based on nothing but lies and ignorance, and I'm quite happy that this man will face legal consequences for his disgusting act.

I wouldn't call the cops because somebody brushed against me on the sidewalk and called me a name, I probably would have forgotten the incident a few moments later. In a more honour and reputation based society things would be different, because not punishing such a slight would send the signal that you are weak.

Your biggest protection if there is no one else to protect you is a reputation as someone who will react with extreme violence. By violently beating someone up who brushed against you or who called you a name, you enhance your reputation as someone not to be messed with. And the reputation might be the only thing keeping yourself and your family, tribe, gang or nation safe.

You can even see behaviour on a much larger scale through the lens of such an idea. From tribes and clans who will react to incursion on their territory with extreme violence, to families who lethally feud for generations over a minor issue. Even conflicts on the largest scale fit that pattern: The cold war with its mutually assured destruction was essentially a game of ""If you attack me I will kill all of human civilization"" with leaders actually trying to appear to the other side as just crazy enough to follow through on their threats.

I a world without laws the only thing keeping yourself safe is the promise that your side will retaliate with escalated violence if wronged and occasionally you have to show that you are not making empty threats by hurting someone who crosses you.

Similarly in a world without courts any deal is only worth as much as the honour of the people who agree to it. Honour and keeping your word is important because the are the only thing that allow people to trust you. Depending on how self-sufficient you are the honour of yourself and your family/clan/gang/tribe might be worth much more than the life of a single member.

You eventually end up with societies like the ones the Klingons are a caricature of. People for who their honour and their reputation is everything and who would rather kill and die than be seen as somebody who does not keep his word or follow up on his threats.

With the right (or rather wrong) cultural background you end with things like honour killings like they are common in some parts of the world.

But it doesn't have to be extremes like that.

Even slight variations in how people perceive the importance of honour and involving the government to solve disputes can have an effect on the level of casual violence in a society.

There is more than one right in the constitution.  Just because it took 17 years to get through the appeals (ie right to a trial) doesn't mean that you can ignore the 8th amendment (cruel and unusual punishment).  They are different rights.  That is like saying well you can either protect free speech or the right to bear arms, but not both.

&gt;These are the same legal and medical experts who created this scenario by suing the drug manufacturers out of the big sleep business.

Two responses to this. One, I am unaware of these lawsuits.  Can you provide a link?  My understanding was that a lot of these drugs were manufactured outside the US in countries that believe the death penalty is a human rights violation (i.e. in Europe).  Many of those countries and companies moved to ban or stop export of the drugs for the purpose of lethal injection for political or PR, not fear of lawsuits in the US.  It is similar to the US banning the export of certain technology or weapons systems to Iran or China.

Two, the statement is a non sequitur.  Guess what happens if the state can't, for any reason, get a warrent.  You get off.  Your rights don't get negated just because the state is having a tough time rounding up a jury or buying the right drugs or finding a doctor administer the injection.

The state used untested dosage and mix of drugs, probably from a compounding pharmacy, known to produce less quality controlled drugs.  They also kept the formula and origin of the drugs a secret so outside experts couldn't verify their efficacy.  It sounds like they just didn't care about the 8th amendment, or they cared about killing him so much more that complying with the 8th amendment was an after thought.  I mean look at the guy who is scheduled for the next execution.  They delayed it **two weeks**.  Do you really think that we will know what went wrong in two weeks?

&gt;The US didn't need their help. Another symbolic gesture, furthermore, when they said NO the US said it was going to do it unilaterally.

Because that turned out well.

It's not symbolic at all, in Iraq we sent 46000 men to the US's 150,000.

(Thats a 1/3 the total the US sent and the UK is considerably smaller than the US).

It also denied the US international credibility.

But if Ukraine moves quickly and joins the European Union, and if EU manages to streamline its admission process, then perhaps Russia will think twice before risking upsetting relationship with its biggest gas export market. It is true that Europe is very dependent on Russian energy exports, but the EU is tired of this dependency and looking desperately to diversify its energy sources. One the things mentioned in the this thread is the Nabucco pipeline, although we would have to wait several years at least before it is a viable option. Another thing is green energy sources, since the EU is the most environmentally friendly political organization in the world. There is also a gas liquefaction technology, which will allow gas to be transported over long distances, and Poland should complete its terminal by mid-2014 (more about this can be found in the article by Jarosław Ćwiek-Karpowicz ""Russia's Gas Sector: In Need of Liberalization in the Context of the Shale Gas Revolution and Energy Relations with the EU""). Russia is very much aware that losing Europe's demand, even a fraction of it, would negatively affect its unstable economy. So, if we were dealing with rational actors, I would say that Russia would be very careful. Unfortunately it is impossible to guess what Putin is thinking right now, because it seems that the recent dive of the Russian economy is not worrying him one bit.

The UK is exceptionally capable as well, but just no where near the scope of the Russians... especially without NATO and other key allies that make the English machine go.

You are funny, Power Projection is roughly dependent on AirCraft Carriers, and also on fleet logistics arm.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_carriers_in_service#List_of_countries_by_aircraft_carriers

France and the UK have the second highest power projection capabilities in the world, those will be expanded in 2016 when the British Super Carriers finish construction.

It's a well known fact.

&gt;My point is that to say that England or France is #2 is to ignore the fact that the distance between #2 and #1 is vast.

The UK not England.

I'm not saying the US's military power projection capabilities are not vastly ahead of everyone else, look at that list of aircraft carriers to see how far aswell, and American Super Carriers are very impressive. 

But the MAD principle means conventional warfare is somewhat pointless against. Russia, China, The UK, France.

The US and the EU are allies, but one is not subservient to the other as might have been said of early after WWII years.

Whilst he has been the best of a bad bunch I don't see how that is too his detriment, he would improve the RB slot for the majority of EPL teams. 

Zeki is getting games due to a lack of backup for LB and because Sherwood loves youth (which is a good thing I suppose). Rose has been injured for most of the season and Vertonghen (who has also been injured recently) has made everyone well aware that he hates LB. Opens up the door for Zeki.

**Full text**

Now that I’m on something I can express things in more than 140 characters, I guess I can talk more at length about stuff, personal and work.

So, Starbound:

With most of the team occupied with moving to England, there hasn’t been much to do but follow up on what old work I can and take care of personal stuff during downtime, having recently moved house. Ship upgrades were announced a while ago, and those of you who follow Twitter might have seen updates posted. We hit a minor hurdle in realising the existing Floran and Hylotl ship styles weren’t really feasible to expand and make bigger while still looking good, so both are undergoing a complete redesign. I handled the Floran ships, and used the opportunity to make them resemble more closely what their lore dictates. It’s an extremely tedious process of copying and pasting, filling in gaps, calculating block space, which is why it’s taken so long thus far.

The remaining Hylotl ships are being undertaken by the other artists, but have taken a sort of back seat for now as they get all the moving stuff out the way. From what I know their visa stuff’s done and they’re all due to be there in early May, except bartwe, myself, and Omni. Once everyone’s there and set up, things should be back to normal. The upgrades shouldn’t take long to do - the Floran’s assets are all done, leaving only the Hylotl to do, and then hook them all up.

A lot of people have asked why some of us aren’t going to England with the others - I can’t speak for the others, but for me it’s pretty simple - I’m a British citizen so I can go to the UK whenever I want, but in 2012 I immigrated permanently to the US to be with my partner after an arduous process predating Starbound’s development. After spending so long to get here, I’m not too keen on leaving so soon. We just moved into a place that allowed us to follow one of our lifelong dreams of being able to keep livestock we can make our own food with (which is SO fun, albeit like having a second job), so I’m fully committed to staying here for the indefinite future.

On top of that, it may be seen as unorthodox but after spending 22 years of my life living in Europe, I genuinely prefer life in the US. I won’t go into it any further as it’s pretty much a matter of taste - I just find people here to be much more accommodating and friendly than those in Europe. That said, I do plan on visiting the office in London whenever flight prices permit.

Aside from that, once the ships are done Molly and I are planning to start work on a content pack we feel would add a degree of management and replayability to the game. That’s probably all I can say about it for now!",ch6vep4,2,,Aeisharat,True,starbound,False,t5_2tkp6,t1_ch6vep4,t3_24fwki,,0,2,0

I could write a novel about how misguided and incorrect your interpretation is.




Anyone who modded for DayZ outside of the Official Mod was doing so w/o permission or consent from Dean Hall, which is NOT in any way shape or form acceptable in the Arma modding community. They STOLE his work and then used it for their own personal gains. In the majority of cases, those people simply stole other long time Arma modder's work off of Armaholic and then worked it into DayZ, and called it ""theirs"" or weakly credited at best.





In the VERY few cases (DayZland.eu and then Origins) they were in fact using their own work or assets, they were doing so in order to usurp DayZ and Dean Hall, not help it. VERY few of the mods followed the rules or even bothered to see what they were before they jumped on the bandwagon.




ANY developer who worked on DayZ in ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, should have been VERY clear about the fact that at any moment Dean Hall/BI could simply shut it down. There was never any permission given to anyone to use it, and it was an intellectual property that Dean Hall was actively trying to market, and protect from copy cats.




The fact that none of the big gaming companies swooped in and stole the idea prior to them releasing Alpha is VERY telling IMO. SOE could have shat out a clone, so could EA, so could any major gaming company. Would it be the same? Did they ""get it"" early enough to do so? I don't know... but I know that it was on their radar pretty much ALL the majors were looking at it with a LOT of curiosity. 




On Sahrani, we had the unbelievable good fortune of getting direct licensed assets from BI, and had a very experienced terrain artist as one of the contributors.




I would venture to say, that we added more model assets than any other mod... and we in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM, out produced, or out performed the ""multi million dollar team"" you bring up (Which likely actually had a budget of under 1 mil/year for 2012/2013).




The truth is there is the alpha represents an unbelievable amount of progress from the mod. EVERY character, EVERY piece of clothing, EVERY item, EVERY new enterable house, EVERY new building placement, texture, map detail.... and that's just what you see.




No one has ANY CLUE what is going on, on the server end, or in the exe.... where the majority of development is likely focused.




When you think of it in terms of BI history... They generally take 2-5 years to develop a new platform, A3 for example... which by in large is considered to be totally incomplete at this point. It's essentially at the same stage as DayZ, it has characters, clothing, minimal weapons, and a setting.

&gt;""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property‹either as a child, a wife, or a concubine‹must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. 

Weston's version leaves out this next line:
&gt;Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen; all know how to die; but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. 

Skips to here:
&gt;No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science‹the science against which it had vainly struggled‹the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.""

Don't really think it's relevant that it's from Churchill. Here's another quote from the same book: 
&gt;The qualities of mongrels are rarely admirable, and the mixture of the Arab and negro types has produced a debased and cruel breed, more shocking because they are more intelligent than the primitive savages.

However I think the big difference in land use is a key point in this much discussed topic. If you imagine an area of 30km * 30 km = 900 km^2 would sustain 90 hg people long term.  

If around the year 5500BC in middle Europe 90 neolithics moved into that same area, they'd hardly come in conflict with the hg people. They'd use only 1/1200 of the space (or in your numbers even much less).

I have seen estimations based on burials in early neolithic sites in the near east that 20 persons had 24 long term descendants in the next generation. So in only [3.8 generations](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=90*1.2**x+%3D180) (&lt; 100 years) they would have doubled while the hg people could not expand.
In a matter of a few hundred years the hg people would constitute only a minor percentage of the population.

In the light of these numbers I think we wouln't need additional explanations, because neolithic people would outbreed hunter gatherers in a few 100 years. (sidenote: that too would be an easy explanation for AMHs to replace neanderthals *if* we could pinpoint that AMHs would procreate faster).

I also considered the temptation of a person in one group to join the other one. Reading haplogroup and mt-DNA studies seemed to suggest that more male hg genes, than female hg DNA have survived in later societies (sorry I can't cite references here but someone else might point some out). That would mean that hg *males* were tempted to take a neolithic bride (and staying there) and not (less) vice versa. I would have estimated the opposite before.

That's because none of them will admit that, to be honest, no one can really get anyone to settle on a cause for World War 1. Each of the causes here is probably a contribution. I'll highlight some of the more credible schools of thought.

1. Germany caused it, and the international order helped. This line of reasoning focuses on the blank check that Germany gave to Austria in dealing with the Serbians post-assassination, and the strict mobilization and militarization plans of Germany before the war. This school maintains that Germany was searching for a war it thought it could win despite being surrounded by France and Russia. In 1914 they thought they were powerful enough to win a war they thought was inevitable, and that their position was not going to get any better to eliminate their foes.
2. Serbia, Russia, and Mediterranean problems caused it. This focuses on the state of Serbia on the eve of the war - in that it was fiercely nationalistic and deadset on provoking Austria-Hungary into a large war that would bring the proverbial house down in Europe. This of course was only possible because of their alliance with Russia. This school also focuses on rivalries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, with Russia, Italy, the Ottomans, the British, and the French all vying for dominance.
3. The international order makes everyone to blame. This school says that everyone caused World War 1, simply because the international order was entirely adversarial, and had no system for settling large international disputes cleanly. The strict mobilization plans everyone had in place at the beginning of the war meant that widespread uncertainty would force everyone to mobilize nearly simultaneously, despite no one in particular wanting a large war at the moment
4. Imperialism caused the war, which means Britain, France and Russia were to blame (mostly). This school, which is often emphasized by Marxist historians, puts the war as part of a larger European struggle for dominance not over Europe, but over the entire world. Germany felt left out of the colonial realm, and looked to use the war to gain a more extensive overseas empire. The war was also only possible because of the vast mobilization of imperial resources in support of the various countries.
5. Deep causes more complicated than these listed above. This focuses on more amorphous concepts like 'otherization' and nationalism to look at the reasons the more peaceful international situation of post-Napoleonic Europe gave way to furious infighting. This school focuses on industrialization, alienation, and problems with modernity, in addition to more concrete history such as newspapers, literature, and a variety of other means of communication pulling countries apart.

There are weaknesses to each one of these causal explanations - I would talk more about them but I have to go to class. I think it is important to realize that many historians will take bits and pieces from each where they can - however, we're looking for the most important cause, not just any cause. This means that most (not all) historians will fall into one of these schools as the most important, while incorporating elements from each for a larger argument.

Sources (only a few): *The Sleepwalkers: How Europe went to War in 1914, The Guns of August, Barricades and Borders: Europe 1815-1914, The Proud Tower* - I also used an unpublished text in this that I'm not allowed to source (as it's not finished, but it's pretty good), but it was written by Konrad Jarausch of UNC.",ch6vzga,20,,Clockt0wer,True,history,False,t5_2qh53,t1_ch6vzga,t3_24g45k,,0,20,0

Groceries are expensive, but not unaffordable, and if you're young enough, you could probably live off hot dogs for two weeks (I estimate 30 to be the turning point for no longer being able to live off greasy fast food).

On the flip side, it's an enormously monetarily wasteful organisation (much more so than most national governments) that provides wasteful subsidies (The Common Agricultural Policy is a pile of garbage) while ignoring forms of cash redistribution that might be much more beneficial. I'm totally cool with the EU redistributing taxation money, so long as it's to useful research and promoting small businesses, whereas instead most of the money goes to already rich farmers.

I love the EU, but I think it needs some pretty major reforms. The biggest of which is that any money it spends should be raised by EU-wide taxation of some form, rather than being gathered inequally from member countries. At that point, not only would it engage voters in EU elections (you mean this actually affects my taxation burden, and what that gets spent on!!? :o), but it would legitimise the EU government's ability to perform functions on the basis of representing EU citizens, rather than reacting to the policy of individual EU governments.

The other way that I would be happy to reform the EU would be to scrap the whole idea of the EU government, and maintain the EU-wide treaties that already exist. The majority of the benefits of the EU are from the Trade Zone, free movement, and inter-governmental funding projects (like the European Space Agency and the ITER fusion facility), all of which can be done without the need for a centralised government.

**tl;dr** The EU is great, but I think it either ought to be a fully legitimate federal government that raises its own funding from EU-wide taxation and legislation (meaning voters would actually care about it, and maybe we'd get some EU-wide politics instead of the fractured country-party based mess we have now), **OR**  we should scrap it as a 'government' and just maintain all of the EU-wide policies we have already and leave EU-wide decisions to inter-country politics (which they realistically are already, but we pretend that its our representative MEPs in the EU parliament)",ch6vzpv,5,,Joomes,True,unitedkingdom,False,t5_2qhqb,t1_ch6vzpv,t3_24fx3e,cnty-uk,0,5,0

This is of course not provable yet, with all the doctoring of official statistics going on, but I am fairly sure the future will prove my estimate correct, and by 2030 we'll have well over 35% uneployment, i.e. +30% relative to 2000, and by 2050 we are well on the way to 60% irreversible unemployment.

We'll have new jobs opening up as we move in to the future, but we will lose job opportunities at a faster rate.

Unless we get some kind of mass redistribution or reallocation of resources going on before 2025, I am fairly sure that well before 2035 we'll see the first signs of mass attrition (i.e. premature dying of large numbers of people on account of not having food, medical care, water, security, energy, etc.) in the developed world - specifically US and EU. 

In some places this process of attrition has started, i.e. Greece, Argentinia, Detroit. The process of attrition will double relative to starvation, due to mass violence. If nothing is done by 2050 *at least* 50 million people in the US and another 50 in the EU will have prematurely died. That's comparable statistically to what the former East Bloc lost after the collapse and the end of the cold war. This attrition especially in Russia is still ongoing - much despair fueled alcoholism.

I think given our current process of deconstruction of capitalism, and already massive political corruption in the US this has become pretty much inescapable. I am very worried about the developed world (where mass death will be considerably worse due to climate change, diseases, the loss of antibiotics, peak oil and proliferation of ever more deadly weapons) since whatever happens there translated 1:1 to mass-migrations and criminalization. 

I fully anticipate dying prematurely myself, probably 10-20 years early, somewhere around the late 20s to early 30s. I'll probably starve or die from some untreated complex disease. Almost certainly treatment resistant infection, which will be common then.

I am somewhat of an incendiary/explosives expert. While right now I am the most peaceful person in the worlds but by 2025 I might gradually decide to collect precursors for a very powerful explosive device. If all this goes as bad as I anticipate I may opt to decide to go out with a bang... If society abandons me I will probably aim, somewhere 10-20 years from now, to detonate my sick and enfeebled old body in some government or corporate building. Maybe some rich country club.  

I suggest readers reading this that suffer similar fates due to abandonment at an old age *do the same*.  This degree of ""taking one for the team"" will spur on change - there's little society can do about sick old people blowing themselves up in retaliation for being left to die lonely, sick, hungry and abandoned other than seek rational means of redistribution. 

There's absolutely no way to predict in advance what industries will be left standing, since in remaining industries and business competition will become cutthroat before long. I suppose managing your own investment portfolio in offshore tax havens will become the last vestige of ""work"", somewhere in the second half of the century.

&gt;__Mercantilism__ is an [economic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and practice common in Europe from the 16th to the 18th century that promoted governmental regulation of a nation’s [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy) for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers. It was the economic counterpart of political [absolutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutism_(European_history\)).  It includes a national economic policy aimed at accumulating monetary reserves through a positive [balance of trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade), especially of [finished goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finished_goods). Mercantilism dominated Western European economic policy and discourse from the 16th to late-18th centuries.  Mercantilism was a cause of frequent European wars and also motivated colonial expansion. Mercantilist theory varied in sophistication from one writer to another and evolved over time. High [tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff), especially on manufactured goods, are an almost universal feature of mercantilist policy. Other policies have included:

t3_24gehn,,1398957735,1433605094,,1398982343,0,"Straight from the actual document.  The reasons for the change in forecast.

&gt;  Sony expects to record approximately 30 billion yen in additional expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 
2014 related to exiting the PC business. Since Sony’s announcement on February 6, 2014 that it will exit the PC business, PC sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 and expected PC sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 are underperforming the February expectation. Consequently, Sony expects to record write-downs for excess components in inventory and accrual of expenses to compensate suppliers for unused components ordered for Sony’s spring PC lineup.

&gt; Sony expects to record approximately 25 billion yen in impairment charges mainly related to its overseas 
disc manufacturing business. 
Primarily due to demand for physical media contracting faster than anticipated, mainly in the European 
region, the future profitability of the disc manufacturing business has been revised. Consequently, Sony has 
determined that it does not expect to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to recover the carrying 
amount of long-lived assets, resulting in an expected impairment charge. Primarily due to the reason mentioned above, the fair value of the entire disc manufacturing business also has decreased, resulting in an 
expected impairment of goodwill.

This literally has nothing to do with their gaming division.  This has everything to do with the company restructuring it's other products divisions. Namely:

* Sony is exiting the PC market.  The costs of the exit, underperforming PC sales and the subsequent decrease in  market value of those assets add up to a bigger loss than expected.

* The demand for physical media is shrinking faster than they expected.  As a result there is a change in the market value of the assets related to that business, meaning a bigger loss than they expected.

Lots of people are now making speculations as to decisions and performance of the company.  For a (edit: peek) into how things are working you can view their Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2013 [here.] (http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/investors/Meeting96/96_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf)  That appears to be the most recent.

Later, the offspring of German settlers who in previous centuries had settled in areas of Eastern Europe and Russia came to be regarded as ethnic Germans and as such had the right to German citizenship according to Article 116 of the Basic Law. Because they became citizens immediately upon arrival in Germany, ethnic Germans received much financial and social assistance to ease their integration into society. Housing, vocational training, and many other types of assistance, even language training--because many did not know the language of their forebears--were liberally provided.

With the gradual opening of the Soviet empire in the 1980s, the numbers of ethnic Germans coming to West Germany swelled. In the mid-1980s, about 40,000 came each year. In 1987 the number doubled and in 1988 doubled again. In 1990 nearly 400,000 ethnic Germans came to the Federal Republic. In the 1991-93 period, about 400,000 ethnic Germans settled in Germany.

Focusing this much on simply having winning lanes is what holds Europe back. ,ch6wqa0,2,,Parallel_Octaves,True,leagueoflegends,False,t5_2rfxx,t1_ch6wqa0,t3_24gd8j,41 team,0,2,0

Rather, they just want to pick stuff already created by hard-working authors of the EU that is easy to make their ""new"" stories with.  They don't want to be bothered with smaller details though, that is too much work for the money they will be making.  Apparently.

Many French D1 (I'm only talking about French here, I don't know about if this applies to other countries) stream very often but on many many different Websites such as Millenium or Eclypsia. 

Those 2 companies have many D1 / Challenger streamers. Europeans stream, you just have to look for them. I wish they were all gathered on Twitch or something but some of them seem to prefer Dailymotion since it's a French Website.

Another study found that Americans classified as living in poverty are often in better living conditions that the average middle class family in Western Europe.

""According to a 2011 paper by poverty expert Robert Rector, of the 43.6 million Americans deemed to be below the poverty level by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2009, the majority had adequate shelter, food, clothing and medical care. In addition, the paper stated that those assessed to be below the poverty line in 2011 have a much higher quality of living than those who were identified by the census 40 years ago as being in poverty.[88] Moreover, Swedish libertarian think tank Timbro points out that lower-income households in the U.S. tend to own more appliances and larger houses than many middle-income Western Europeans""",ch6wrkv,21,,enderandrew42,True,todayilearned,False,t5_2qqjc,t1_ch6wrkv,t3_24gdxi,,0,21,0
