,IAmA,6,,"What really made me want to move here was what I saw during the time I spent here while in the army. I like the fact that it is a small, compact country (compared to the US) but that there are so many different towns and cities and regions which are instantly distinguishable from one another. Each area or region has its own culture and way of doing things, in stark comparison to the US which is huge and requires you to travel hundreds of miles before seeing any differences on a similar scale. I also like the fact that it is in the middle of Europe, which is amazing if you appreciate history, culture, and travel. I can get in my car or on a train and travel just a couple of hours in any direction and be in either France, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Czech, Poland, Denmark, Netherlands, etc. In the US it can take a full day just to get to the next state where everything is pretty much the same except for the license plates.

Germans are also, in my opinion, much more informed about what is happening not only in their own country, but also in the world, than most people in the US. I know it may sound like a stereotype of the oblivious American, but there is a lot of truth to it. But for me the biggest positive is the fact that they basically have their opinions and, for the most part, keep them to themselves. It's not at all common here to see people going mental discussing different political parties, or to have people try to force their religion (or lack of it) in everyones face. I have to say, as someone originally from a country where anything to do with politics is almost guaranteed to degenerate into in-your-face name calling and bumper sticker ""logic"", it is very nice.

I don't do anything so unusual when I'm not working. Every once in a while I will take a weekend trip to somewhere like Switzerland, or to some other nearby place.

In a pay for system, there is a larger retention of wealth because people will avoid going to the best institution for them to save money, while it does not matter to the upper class who's parents are paying for them regardless. It allows for the best of us to do their best, rather than the parents who did the best to do the best. 

As for motivation, you can certainly institute penalties on drop outs to incentivize them to push through, although there really is not much of a pattern between drop out rates in pay for countries (the US has about a 50% before degree drop out rate) vs free/almost free countries (Europe has significantly less on average)

Does just being Catholic give one the right to claim they are the rightful heirs of the Italian Peninsula and even the right to challenge native Italians for control of it?

I'm all for native Israeli Jews for having patriotic ties to Israel. They have a right to be proud of their heritage.

Pauvre petit anglais frustré parce qu’il ne peut plus dire «**SPEAK WHITE**» aux français QUI SONT LA MAJORITÉ!!!

Dérouté quel train? Le train des anglais qui s’en mettaient plein les poches et qui ne nous laissaient que des miettes? BON DÉBARRAS! Au moins, quand les anglais ont crissé leur camp (parce que ces intolérants là ne supportaient pas d’être une petite minorité parmi les français), notre niveau de vie a pu augmenter.

Quant au FLQ, sache, mon petit pit, qu’à la fin, c’était une organisation complètement noyautée et téléguidée par la RCMP…

&gt; La xenophobie, la haine, et la rejection de tous sauf LES PURES LAINES qui a fout le camp. Pas les Anglais.

Qu’est-ce qu’on rejette? Le colonialisme anglais, et son assimilation des immigrants pour nous minoriser. Grâce à la loi 101, c’est fini les immigrants qui deviennent anglais. C’est pour ça que les anglais haïssent tellement la loi 101, parce qu’elle stoppe net l’outil principal d’assimilation des français.

&gt; Ni l'Eglise. Y'a eu combien de decenes depuis la revolution tranquille et maintenant? Y'a peu de jobs dans un village mondial pour des cretins qui savent que leur propre Creole et qui refuse, litteralement, le reste de la planete.

On a crissé l’ignorance crasse de notre très sainte merde l’église scatholique romaine dehors, et on l’a remplacée par l’éducation, ce qui permet à Montréal d’être le troisième producteur mondial d’avions au monde, juste derrière les Tas-Unis et l’Europe.

C’est pas ta petite bible de merde à la con qui permettrait de faire ça, hein, espèce de grenouille de bénitier??? On a suivi la bible pendant des siècles, et ça ne nous a donné que de la pauvreté et notre quasi-disparition.

Depuis qu’on a crissé notre très sainte merde l’église scatholique romaine dans la poubelle de l’Histoire, notre niveau de vie a DÉCUPLÉ, et on a commencé à reprendre le contrôle de notre pays!!!

Si on veut sortir du Canada, ce n’est pas pour rejeter la planète, comme tu le dis si stupidement, mais pour pouvoir faire affaire directement avec le monde, sans passer par les neuroses de la politique étrangère des anglais.

Tu ne fais que prouver que tu n’es qu’un autre de ces petits crétins d’anglais qui se vautre béâtement dans son ignorance crasse de ce qui n’est pas anglais.

&gt; La preuve? Les Anglais depensent des milliers de dollars pour que les Quebecois puissent trafficker leurs prodits ailleurs parce qu'il refusent d'apprendre les langues de leurs voisins. 

Ouate de phoque??? Tu es en train de dire que les anglais payent pour le traffic de pot québécois???

&gt; T'est un theorie de conspiracies de cote de ""c'est la faute des Juifs de Westmount"" et a ce point, je quitte la piste.

C’est toi qui parle des juifs qui sont, soit dit en passant, à Côte-Saint-Luc, et pas à Westmount (c’est trop cher pour eux, je crois).

&gt; Ecoute donc ""Quebecois de souche"" de les Cowboys Fringants, et parlez-moi de creole. La seule racisme est d'etre offense qu'on ""accuse"" quelqu'un d'etre lie aux autres peuples. Ce qui est raciste? La doctrine de ""pure laine"".

Ça ne peut pas exister, parce que c’est une doctrine qui n’existe pas du tout. 

C’est impossible un québécois «pure-laine»; nous, les français, sommes le peuple le plus mélangé de la terre. Depuis 10,000 ans, toutes les invasions de l’Europe se sont terminées en France; nous sommes un mélange de tous ces peuples! Et quand nous sommes arrivés ici, nous avons continué avec les indiens. 

###** NOUS NE POUVONS PAS ÊTRE «PURE-LAINES», NOUS AVONS UN DES SANGS LES PLUS MÉLANGÉS DE LA TERRE!!!**

,DebateAChristian,2,,"&gt;Wrong, an African growing up in Europe would be a European. I am talking about culture, not race. This is why I hate the term African American. Unless they have dual citizenship in Africa and American, or are first generation immigrants, they are probably just an American with black skin. A good friend of mine was black, in America, but actually grew up in France. He preferred to be considered black, or a French American.

That's just it, their race does not matter.  Just like gender doesn't either.  There is obvious physiological differences between races and controversial psychological differences.  But those psychological differences are probably due to culture, society and economic status, and not race.  Just apply the logic you have for race and culture to genders and gender roles, and you got it. 

&gt;First off, I am not saying it is necessary, I am simply saying that 2 opposite sex parents are more ideal. Second, not teaching a child about gender roles that society is going to expect them to understand (even if they don't follow to them) is definitely a negative.

I never said don't teach children about society and how it functions.  I said that there is nothing special about being a male that that a mother can't teach a male child.  Unless you think that there should be strict gender roles.

&gt;This sounds like you are arguing that same sex couple would be equivalent if only the world worked in your particular ideal way. Well, the world will never be like your ideal, and another problem is that the majority of people do not ascribe to your ideal.

But children are not disadvantaged, and I would say they are better off, when they are not shoehorn into what people expect of their gender.  If society expected black people to stay poor, would you say that it would be better for them to be raised with the expectation of being poor?

&gt;But then how are your graphs relevant? Both of them are about physical differences. That doesn't mean they are similar psychologically.

I meant the graphs as examples of the distributions of traits, and how it looks when the averages are different but the groups are not so different.  This is how psychology is, you can say women tend to have more of this trait and men have more of that trait, but when it comes to individuals their traits are not good predictors of their gender.  There is too much overlap between genders for there to be much difference.

""The truth is that the main reason prices are higher is that our country is paying the bulk of the costs of developing new treatments. That’s got many Americans angry. The highest prices in the world are now paid by some Americans – seniors on fixed incomes – who have little ability to pay and great needs. I hope we will fix this soon by getting them an overdue Medicare drug benefit. But we also need to do more to address the issue of sharing the global burden of developing new treatments.""


(this is a lie: See here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1261198/)

""This is a real public health problem. The difference in payments for drugs is now translating into differences in spending going into drug R&amp;D, as the price controls discourage the R&amp;D needed to develop new products. In 1990, European pharmaceutical firms spent 75 percent more on R&amp;D than American firms. By 2000, American firms spent over a third more than European firms. Even firms that are technically European are moving their most essential operations to the United States.

And the impact of excessive price controls on R&amp;D is translating into an impact on the development of new products. American manufacturers now account for eight of the top 10 worldwide best-selling medicines. And recent studies show that, on average, new medicines reach patients months earlier in the United States than in Europe. Even as Americans are going the other way to get lower prices on some drugs, Canadians have had to cross the border to the United States to get access to new breakthrough medicines like Gleevec that are not available in Canada in a timely or easy way.

Reducing the needed incentives to develop new medicines through excessive price controls is slowing the process of drug development worldwide. If we continue on our current path of trying harder and harder to shift the costs of developing new medicines to someone else, rather than paying our fair share, everyone’s effort to get a free ride on new drugs will grind the global development of new drugs to a halt.""

,soccer,1,5,"Zero chance. We don't operate in the same stratosphere as the clubs above us and in terms of wages we're already overachieving for what we spend.

I'm not a football historian, but I highly suspect if you go back and look through the years you will find that it's almost unheard of for a team that isn't paying close to the highest wages (relative to its competitors) to win a domestic first division. 

The revenue we generate is minuscule compared to United, and though our historical footprint is probably similar to City's, we lack the investment to keep up with their progress. 

None of this will change next season, Champions League or not. People talk about the added revenue from being in that competition but incentive-based contracts will eat up a very good portion of that money. 

IMO we're just at the very beginning of a phase that Arsenal is probably going to be coming out of soon. We've already made our club more attractive by building a training complex that can compete with the best in Europe, and we're trying to execute an ambitious (and expensive) redevelopment plan that includes a new stadium. Tangible progress has been made on this project for the first time in years, but the actual stadium phase is still years--at best--from realization. 

I think the idea that we ""NEED"" CL football is a bit misleading right now. Until CL football is coupled with added revenue and\or big investment, we aren't going to break through that barrier to compete with those clubs. Lack of CL football is not our current bottleneck; money is, and as I said before the degree to which being in Europe bolsters finance tends to be overstated on this site. I think those who seem to think finishing 3rd or 4th this year would usher in an era of lollipops and unicorns could be in for disappointment. 

That said, long-term I think it's a goal we can strive for. I wouldn't be surprised to see Arsenal challenging for titles again within the next 3-4 years now that the stadium debt is under control and they are starting to reap the benefits of its construction. We could very feasibly be in the same position 7-8 years from now. 

I would like to win a major cup or something within the next few years. I would consider that a major success for a team who has a much smaller wage bill than even Arsenal.

The difference in land area is trivial compared to the gigantic territorial changes that were being made at the same time in Europe (for example, the brutal expulsion of over 10 million Germans from Pomerania, Silesia and East Prussia), but those changes are simply treated as a fait accompli today and not subject to constant revision.

The 1947 settlement should have been voted on by the current residents of the region. The international community and Jews that weren't living there pre-1947 shouldn't really have any say. Furthermore, the international community certainly didn't agree to the armistice borders. The European border changes have no real bearing on the morality of Zionism, unless you're trying to say it has the same morality of the Soviet Union.

In regards to 1918, one of the principles that ended the war was that people have a right to self-determination. This means that it is not for you to decide whether or not a group of people can consider themselves a separate group of people, but their own right.

Finally, Israel is the party that subjects the borders to constant revision by continuing to build settlements on Palestinian land. A reversion to the 1947 or 1967 borders would probably make most Palestinians very happy.

,AskHistorians,9,,"Pre-gunpowder naval battles were, at least in Europe (not too knowledgeable about South and East Asia), primarily boarding and ramming affairs. Captains of opposing vessels would do their best to position their ship so that it could catch an enemy ship in the flank, exposing them to their huge rams, usually made of bronze, which could tear a gaping hole into an enemy vessel, causing it to sink very quickly; this also caused the risk of the attacking ship being dragged down along with its victim if the crew could not detach the vessel quickly or cleanly enough. The ram could also be used to immobilize ships via the destruction of the oars protruding from the sides.

Some weapons systems were present, although I'm not sure how common this was; the Byzantines at least had some sort of apparatus on their ships which allowed them to deploy the Greek fire which shattered the Arab navies at Constantinople. While I doubt that building a trebuchet on the deck of a galley would have been possible, the Romans at least were able to have catapults mounted on their ships by the time of the Empire.

Also used were boarding parties of marines, which would attempt to capture other ships, or defend their own from capture, in the event that ramming was unfeasible or undesirable. This practice was used before the Romans, but the Romans turned it into an art, using specialized grappling hooks and boarding tools to allow them to defeat the Carthaginian navy during the First Punic War. Ships would often include a complement of archers to try and eliminate crew or marines on opposing ships during the battle.

Victory in these battles did not necessarily go to the numerically superior side; Salamis provides an excellent example of the much larger Persian fleet being unable to maneuver during the battle and thus being at the mercy of Greek rammers. Victory almost always went to the side able to move their fleets more efficiently in order to disable or capture as many enemy ships as possible; for this it was also beneficial to have better trained boarding personnel, the superiority of the Roman marines probably providing the decisive edge against Carthage.

Amazingly, this galley-centric warfare persisted in the Mediterranean well into the 16th century, and the Holy League fleet which turned back the Ottomans used tactics that would probably have been not too unfamiliar to those used at Actium!

Would you claim the person to be sexist for number 2 or 4? Or ageist over number 3? If not, then there's no reason to claim it is racist to say number 1! 

From this demonstration it is easy to see that simply including a detail outside of the norm is included simply for better storytelling! Just the same as it could be to include, say, what intersection it was.

When an unnamed character is introduced, the listener automatically identifies that character to be basically like either themselves or like the story teller until more information is given. I would also make the claim that if the teller is male, it is assumed the unnamed character is male as well until identified as otherwise. And in America (and most everywhere in Europe) it is simply statistical to assume that the person is also white.

Thus, the unidentified person is assumed to be a white male, in these cases. Any details showing otherwise can be assumed to be included for storytelling purposes!

Kerry can safely make this argument (trade is good, reducing trade restrictions increases the number of opportunities for trade, which increases successful economic activity) thanks to his relatively low profile.

Free trade agreements aren't admissions of 'wrongness.' The dominant religion of the state disagrees that there's such a thing as truth and falsehood.

,Syria,-3,,"Originally these were the good guys: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coordination_Body_for_Democratic_Change


&gt;The Coordination Committee is largely **based inside Syria**, and was formed in 2011 at a congress in Damascus. It gathers most of the political parties of the National Democratic Rally, formerly Syria's main secular opposition coalition, and few other organizations. It has a generally **secular** membership, although not exclusively so...


This is an article about how they went to Russia and china. Russia and china are NOT apposed to these guys taking over. http://carnegie-mec.org/publications/?fa=48369 


It is true Assad did arrest some of those leaders, but he set them free after a short time.



Assad himself never wanted to be the ruler of Syria. He was an ophthalmologist living in England when his brother killed himself in a one car crash.  The various factions in Syria called him back to the country and foisted this job upon him. Before this, the only State/political thing Assad ever did was bring the Internet to Syria around the year 2000.


Assad assisted the US in the second gulf war (As his dad did in the first). Assad was told that Syria was to fall under the israeli nuclear umbrella and he had to promise to defend israel. He said no thanks. Later he signed a pipeline deal to bring Iranian natural gas to Europe. This directly competed with the pipelines running through Turkey and israel.  http://gulfnews.com/news/region/iran/iran-signs-10-billion-gas-deal-with-syria-iraq-1.842783 (See the date? Do you know how long it takes to work up a contract that intricate?)


So the bankers who own israel told the Saudies to teach their religious nutters that Assad helps the US and it has been 30 years since a bullet was fired from Syria toward israel. And they should fight against that western puppet Assad. These guys are who the corporate owned media call the ""Free Syrian Army"" and want Islamic law. Of coarse, anything that keeps the brown people in the dark ages is A OK. with some people in the west also. 


Russias' Putin thinks it's wonderful to grind down some crazy Chechens/Balkans/islamists that cause trouble on the southern border of Russia and commit occasional bombings. He has dispatched enough hardware and personnel to be sure any NATO attack will be the last NATO attack, at least by those particular assets.

The goal of ""the west"" is to break up the nation of Syria and not be compelled by law to return the Golan Heights to Syria. *(The International Criminal Court is scheduled to get new powers to compel such a thing.)* Keep in mind:

&gt;Internationally recognized as Syrian territory, the Golan Heights has been occupied and administered by Israel since 1967.[1] It was captured during the 1967 Six-Day War,

From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights


And the moment this war ends, israel must give it back.


&gt;though a final peace agreement has yet to be reached. A cease-fire currently stands between Israel and Syria, as well as more recently with Lebanon (since 2006).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict

1/3 of israels water comes from the Syrian Golan. Long before this Assad, Syria, in solidarity with Palestine, said: ""No Palestinians. No water"" and began to divert the water. That was long ago and a different story, but is one of the reasons israel does not want to give it back.

,counterstrike,0,,"1. I wasn't being racist and saying that foreigners are in any way bad at the game. Most of the best professional teams come out of Europe, and I clearly know that. I'm saying that it's hard to win a game without being able to communicate with your team, so I lose when I can't. 
2. I have to set my max ping fairly high because I play with friends that have shitty internet. I don't meet foreigners every game, but when I do, they're usually lagging. 
3. I don't have a problem with people that speak little English or have a heavy accent. MY problem is when they're either ignorant and don't want to tell the rest of the team anything or they don't even know ANY English. Most of the time, one or two words is all the team needs in the way of communication, but those words are very different in Russian or Swedish than English. Of course I'm not bashing on people that don't speak English, I just think that there should be some way for them to have a team that speaks the same language and I would like the same.
4. I don't care if it counts for individual skill because Counter-Strike is a team game and cannot be played by one person. I don't mind carrying my team every few games, but I'm top fragger and such (such because I don't want people telling me that frags aren't all that matter...) ALL THE TIME.

,AskHistorians,7,,"PartiallyRibena touched on it. European empires exported the sport to their colonies along with other aspects of their culture (language, music, food, etc). The fact that it requires nothing more than a ball and 4 sticks makes the sport wildly accessible to even the most poor and remote regions. Whereas American football and baseball require more equipment (and therefore $$) to play ""properly.""

Now as to why it's not popular here in the U.S...it's mostly speculation as hard data on something like this is hard to come by. The primary arguments are: 

1.) We're not dominate in the sport, unlike American football and baseball. In fact we're pretty bad at this sport (though IMO getting better). Because we don't win anything, people don't want to see watch us play. Also, most U.S. soccer fans probably have another nations team they support who is 1. more successful and 2. plays a more ""beautiful"" brand of soccer. USMNT does not play an attractive or interesting game. Not yet.
1.b) The quality of players produced in the U.S. is quite low, with the exception of goalkeepers. There are maybe 4-6 USMNT players playing for ""top-tier"" European teams. Most of our gifted athletes go into other sports like basketball, baseball and Am. football because that's where the big bucks are.
2.) The American domestic league(s) MLS is very young compared to other European leagues. Several European clubs celebrated their centennials within the past decade. Where were the L.A Galaxy 100 years ago? While there were previous leagues before MLS they were poorly managed and went bust (see NASL in the 70's).
3.) This is a controversial point, but I believe it to be valid. Advertising. How many commercial breaks are there in a game of baseball? How many in American football? How many during a game of soccer? Some analysis came out that an average American football game has ~11 minutes of ACTUAL gameplay, the rest being huddles, shots of players, the crowd, and advertisements. Soccer is played in two 45 minute halves with one break in between. Not a lot of time to sell your product. Because there is less time to advertise during a match of soccer the sport hasn't had the financial backing in the states like baseball and football have. Baseball and football started gaining popularity around the same time that televisions became common throughout, which meant the many breaks and slower pace became a chance for advertisers to sell their products, thus the ad companies began buying up ad time during games. How much do you think Budweiser's contract with the MLB and NFL is worth? That's a lot of money for these organizations to re-invest.

,AskHistorians,14,asia,"If I can answer this a little from the language perspective, it *is* reasonable to say that ""Hun"" and ""Xiong"" could be cognates by way of loans, but it's not worth much. In Chinese sources, the two names that come up for the Han-era barbarians to the north are Xiongnu 匈奴 and Xūn Yù 葷粥, the latter being the name used by [Sima Qian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Qian). If an outside group didn't speak a Sinitic language, the Chinese would still use characters to record their endonym. It's not a stretch to say Xiongnu and Xunyu are the same people.

The problem with saying that they're for the Huns based on the same approach is that etymology dictionaries then [say things like this](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Hun):

&gt;*apparently ultimately from Turkic Hun-yü, the name of a tribe (they were known in China as Han or Hiong-nu)*

We know that the Xiongnu aren't the Han.

Between Hun and Xiong, the etymological connection is credible based on reconstructed pronunciations, but it's not enough. The Xiongnu didn't have written language (again according to Sima Qian in *Shiji*), so we don't really have a good way to track the development of their autonym.

Still, the time between when the Chinese were writing about the Xiongnu and when the west was writing about the Huns is pretty problematic.

,algeria,5,,"Give them a gift. Chocolate is typically a good greeting gift (get a fancier brand) and its normally given to close friends or family. An addition, you can give them an American souvenir right before they go home.

I cannot stress enough not to compliment them too much. Algerians believe excessive compliments, especially from new people, result from jealousy and bring bad luck. 

It probably won't be awkward for you to shake their hand. Most Algerians are ok with shaking a woman's hand, but just ask your boyfriend to make sure. I wouldn't recommend kissing them on the cheeks because they could turn out to be VERY awkward if you're not used to it and you do it wrong. 

If they are visiting you at your home or your apartment, they will be EXTREMELY impressed if you have coffee, tea and some cookies (European style) ready. You have to make sure both of them do as little work as possible in your house and think about what they will need before ahead of time so they don't have to ask. If they offer to do something themselves (ex. cooking, cleaning, etc) you have to initially insist to do it for them instead. However, you need to eventually relent if you feel that they really want to do it themselves. 

Algerians value hospitality very highly. In doing this, they will say very positive things about you to their extended family when they go back home. Hospitality differs among Americans and Algerians, so be ready to be a lot more attentive to their needs. Every Algerian would agree that it will be a death sentence for you if they are hungry during their stay. It's customary to make or have too much food when there are guests. It'll be really embarrassing if there's no food left on the table after a meal. 

A bonus in being a good host is that the mother will see that you can help her son out in the house. As kazuma said, Algerian mothers are very attached to their sons and will look at you critically if you show you can't take care of him. She might already assume that you don't know how to run a house since you're American.  

Don't be overwhelmed by my advice. If you follow all these things, you'll make a very good impression.

EDIT: One more SUPER important thing is that you should ask your boyfriend if his parents only eat hallal meat.

,politics,1,,"People have to work really hard to increase their skills. If you don't have access to an education, it will be three or four times as hard. But some people do it. Look at Steve Jobs and Bill gates. They started their own industry that was perfectly suited for them and their skills. Certainly, at least one in a million people can create some new job or new industry and make a lot of money. The odds are very much against people, but some people do it. 

It also depends on where in the world you are. [Some countries are better than others](http://ideas.repec.org/p/iza/izadps/dp1938.html) in terms of social mobility. For example, studies consistently show that the Nordic countries are places where a motivated poor person can advance economically, and break the cycle of poverty..

The US is better than many countries in the Third World, although some Latin American countries have pulled ahead of the US.

Generally, right now Western Europe and Australia are the places with the least social stratification. 

The US is perhaps the fastest **declining** developed country. Its because this country is very focused on hierarchy.

&gt;*""So people who can't afford school are out of luck?""*

If they live in the US, yes, very much so. Statistics would indicate that the opportunities are very slim for them and their children, and *their* children. But, for at least the next 10 or 15 years, people with a fairly modest level of education (a 4 or 6 year degree) should be likely to be able to find some kind of good job somewhere in the world. Maybe Australia or Asia. After that, perhaps on other planets. (But the cost of air and water will make a very large dent in their earnings.)

&gt;*""People who are left behind by the education system or have been born into poverty are stuck in minimum wage earning jobs?""* 

No they aren't. In no more than 15 or 20 years from now, we'll have machines that are almost as smart as people, *so there wont be any of those kinds of jobs at all, anywhere on the planet.*

So, save your money, because in the future, most wealth will be inherited, or from investments. The opportunities that exist today to work and make money wont be available unless somebody has what we would today consider a very advanced level of education. That will be the norm in the workplace. And most businesses wont have large numbers of ""workers"" unless you count computers as workers. Which will at some point be the thing to do, because at some pount around the middle of the century, we'll have company here on this planet, computers that think and FEEL.

Western and American cultures are on top, other cultures are underneath.  If you ask me to find 1685, I would find a zone from left to right, but the year itself doesn't mean much to me.  After that I would have to ask ""where?"".  If you tell me ""Pacific Northwest"", I go to my card for pre-European-contact Pacific Northwest America, which covers a huge range of time (10,000+ BCE to ~1700s) without much detail: Chinook, totem poles, potlatch, art, canoes.  I don't really know much about that period for those people.  If instead you said ""1685 Japan"", I would go down to the Japan row and pick out ""Edo Japan"" as a card.  I would then zoom in, like on an iPhone, and read left to right across the card.  1685 is between two denser areas on the card - 1630s (when the third shogun put into place most of the restrictions) and the 1830s (when there was a famine and a rebellion).  The card itself lets me access what I know about Edo Japan: daimyo, samurai, rice farming, urbanization, Hokusai, etc.  There are little red threads connecting Japan to China, the Netherlands, England, and the USA.  Suppose I follow the thread to the Netherlands.  It lands on a card, ""Dutch East India Company"", that is in roughly the same column but farther up top.  I can zoom out from that card to get to the ""Netherlands 17th century"", or zoom in on the card to access specific decades. If you were to ask me for a period I know a lot about, you might be able to zoom in down to individual years or months or even days.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't forget, ""multiculturalism"" is just a scam designed to split the population into [I'm tripping over the grammar here] masters and servants [""exploited people""], and, accordingly, to make immigrants believe that the French are immigrants, just like the others (as opposed to the true founders of Canada [!!!]), to be assimilated [like the [passive periphrasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_periphrastic#Passive) Latin construction ""Carthago delenda est""] by the English.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep, everyone knows nobody lived around the St. Lawrence [River] before the French...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;""Country"" is a European concept. The Indians [yes, not ""Native Americans""] didn't found a country in the sense we're concerned with here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What's the difference? They were there, they lived, they resided... until a Frenchman pointed there, stuck a cross [as in the Christian, specifically Catholic icon] on a beach and declared the land property of the King of France.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And not once did the French question that the Indians have rights [!], like the English did.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Evidently [false]; these battles were part of a long series of Franco-Iroquois wars which spanned a century, from [the work of?] Champlain until the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701.

During the time period being discussed, various Native tribes were also at war with each other, and in particular the Montaignais were enemies of the Iroquois.

,worldnews,13,," #3 heroin is acetylated morphine, often called heroin base. This is the heroin that is produced mostly in Afghanistan and Pakistan and is found mostly in Europe, Russia, and Africa. #4 heroin is diacetylmorphine HCl. It is a refined version of #3 heroin and is generally found to be more pure in its unadulterated form. They look different and they smell different. #3 heroin is usually darker and forms harder lumps. #4 heroin is lighter colored and is easier to crush into powder. #3 often has a much more pungent odor, like vinegar, although #4 can also have a vinegar smell. The biggest difference is that #4 heroin is easy to dissolve in water. #3 heroin requires a weak acid to dissolve. People typically add a small amount of citric acid powder or lemon juice to #3 to dissolve it so that they can shoot it up. That's why #3 is often called heroin base and #4 is often called heroin salt.

I honestly can't say why Afghani H isn't refined into #4 somewhere along the way.

I just remember him going on about how the Americans will now think they saved the world with their code breaking skills.  The wikipedia quote explains it better than I could....


""The United States' direct participation in World War II commenced in 1941 with Lend-Lease and the Attack on Pearl Harbor, but the history of capturing Enigma machines and breaking their codes had already begun in Europe.

An earlier military Enigma machine had been captured by Polish Intelligence in 1928; the Polish Cipher Bureau broke the Enigma code in 1932 and gave their findings to Britain and France in 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland.[6]

The first capture of a naval Enigma machine and associated cipher keys from a U-boat were made on May 9, 1941 by HMS Bulldog of Britain's Royal Navy, commanded by Captain Joe Baker-Cresswell. The U-boat was U-110. In 1942, the British seized U-559, capturing additional Enigma codebooks. ""The captured codebooks provided vital assistance to the British cryptographers, led by Alan Turing, at the code-breaking hothouse of Bletchley Park, near Milton Keynes.""[6]

The capture, rather than sinking, of U-570 – the only ship to be captured by an aircraft – on 27 August 1941 by a Lockheed Hudson from RAF Coastal Command was important for determining the fighting capacity of U-boats, although her crew destroyed the Enigma and cipher information. The boat was towed to port and commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Graph.

Out of some 15 captures of naval Enigma material during World War II, all but two were by the British – the Royal Canadian Navy captured U-774, and the U.S. Navy seized U-505 in June 1944. By this time the Allies were already reading naval Enigma traffic routinely.

The film caused irritation and anger in Britain. At Prime Minister's Questions, Tony Blair agreed with questioner Brian Jenkins MP that the film was ""an affront"" to British sailors.[3] In response to a letter from Paul Truswell, MP for the Pudsey constituency (which includes Horsforth, a town proud of its connection with HMS Aubretia), U.S. president Bill Clinton wrote assuring that the film's plot was only a work of fiction.[7]

A written acknowledgment does appear on-screen that the Royal Navy captured the first, and subsequently the vast majority, of the naval Enigma devices.[8]

David Balme, the British naval officer who led the boarding party aboard the U-110, called U-571, ""a great film""[8] and said that the movie would not have been financially viable without being Americanized. The film's producers did not agree to his request for a message, making it clear that the film was a work of fiction, but agreed to include a message at the film's end mentioning the Royal Navy's role in the capture of U-110.[7]

In 2006, screenwriter David Ayer admitted that U-571 distorted history and stated that he would not do it again.[9]

Ayer told BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme that he ""did not feel good"" about suggesting Americans, rather than the British, captured the naval Enigma cipher:[9]
“ 	It was a distortion...a mercenary decision...to create this parallel history in order to drive the movie for an American audience. Both my grandparents [sic] were officers in World War II, and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements.""",t1_c9659kr,,False,0,benignlurker,t5_2qh1i,1431714096,t3_1be5af,1,c9659kr,0,1364790770,0,t3_1be5af,False,,True
,Christianity,3,coei,"Judaism came about first. It was the religion of the Israelites. It seems to be at least somewhat related to other contemporary religions in the region, but I don't know a ton about that.

About two millennia ago, Jesus of Nazareth started preaching and gaining followers throughout Israel. Judaism at this time had several competing factions; for a few decades after Jesus's death, many people saw the Jesus Movement (as historians often call it) as just another faction within Judaism. With the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem around 70 CE, it became clear that this was becoming a distinct religion (this is typically when most historians stop calling it the Jesus Movement and start calling it Christianity).

Islam came about approximately six centuries later in the Arabian peninsula. Muhammad came from a polytheistic region, but he started preaching that God (the Abrahamic God, that is) was speaking to him through an angel. He gained a following, and was eventualy called to another city to be an arbitrator for a local ongoing dispute. He eventually became the leader of that city, and continued to gain political power in the region using various means.

Historical conflicts between Jews and Christians stemmed from Jews being minority communities throughout Europe and thus easy scapegoats. Also, there was a widespread belief that Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus.

Most modern conflict between Jews and Muslims stems from the question of who should control the land of Israel.

,AskHistorians,1,,"The short answer is no.

Since this is a homework question, I won't address what makes a civilization a civilization. Instead, let's look at why 'Vikings' is a problematic term. 

Viking Age Scandinavia goes from about the sack of Lindisfarne (790s?) to 1066. We call it the Viking Age because we see a lot of Scandinavians exploring, pillaging, making war, and most of all trading outside of Scandinavia. This is something we don't really see before then. So who was a viking? In a literal sense, it was anyone who parked their ship in a vik and went trading/pillaging/warring. This would mean that the women and farmers who stayed at home weren't vikings. But when we use the term 'viking', we usually mean (Germanic, not Finn or Sami) Scandinavian who lived during the Viking Age, including all the non-vikings. 

So was the Viking Age a civilization? No, it was a historical period. Was Viking Age Scandinavia a civilization? No, it's a region of Europe as it was during that period. Were the vikings a civilization? No, they were just people who parked their ships in viks. Did the germanic people of Viking Age Scandinavia make up a civilization? Well, that's a much better question. And without getting into it too deeply, we do see a move from tribal chiefdoms towards political unification in the form of kingdoms. We also see cities developing. So you really need to look at the criteria for civilization, and see if you can identify one emerging from the people who lived at the time.

,Feminism,8,,"&gt;Eventually, their partners and daughters started inheriting their goods as well, or there would be no female land owners, or queens.

Now you're just denying history.  If nothing else, we know that most cultures passed on property though men (i.e. the origin of the word patriarchy).  You make it sound as though men naturally had all the property and decided to give it to their women.  Most post-agricultural cultures women don't get any property ever.  It goes straight from father to son, even if the wife is still alive.  A queen means the wife of a king, not an inheritor of the property.  That is why Queen Elizabeth I never married, because her husband would have taken the thrown from her.  They only just changed the rules about this in England a few years ago.  Queen Victoria and Elizabeth II's husbands had to stay princes because a King outranked a Queen, but, again, we are talking about the past couple hundred years, definitely not prehistory, and married women in England/USA could only own property towards the end of Victoria's reign.  

You are almost right about the industrial revolution.  There was a huge crackdown on the rights of European women during that time (see witch hunts), but who cares.  There is no system that keeps men in power over women because a few hundred years ago in Europe (never mind the rest of the world) women were only persecuted a bit more than their husbands?  

&gt;In fact, thanks to the necessity for women to participate in the work force

Women were very active in the work force all through the industrial revolution.  Just no one considered it work worth mentioning.  Working class women worked in factories, and middle class women worked out of the home more than previous generations because interest in educating children was rising, and they needed women to teach them, which was a big push towards equality.  It might be more accurate to say that the 17th and 18th centuries and early colonial era's were the ones that were really hard on women.

Just because the middle ages were better for women than the following centuries doesn't mean that they were pro-woman by any stretch, too.  Remember, this is the era that gave birth to the Catholic Church.  ",t1_c965zss,,False,0,mostfavoritesweater,t5_2qr7i,1431713752,t1_c962bsk,8,c965zss,0,1364793212,0,t3_1bdmje,False,,True

There are conservation groups concerned that Diamond's claim will be used as justification for removing indigenous people from their homeland in order for governments and corporations to occupy the land for self-interests.

But as far as Guns, Germs, and Steel goes, the book is well respected in academic circles having been on the New York Times best seller list, and winning a Pulitzer. Jared Diamond is a very insightful and intelligent historian who can really put the breadth of how our history came to be into perspective.

Do not judge the author until you've read his books. GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL is an excellent read about how, ultimately, civilization formed. It describes how and why some peoples developed agriculture and why other peoples remained nomadic. It explains animal domestication, the development of germs, what the requirements are for population growth and for invention (we know that necessity is the mother of invention, but what is necessity's mother?)

What Diamond does is explain why the world developed the way it did. Why the Chinese are Chinese, why and how did the Polynesian spread across the Pacific and into Madagascar, why Africa developed differently in each region, why the Americas formed complex civilization later than Eurasia, why Eurasia was able to develop earlier and faster than any other place on Earth, and ultimately how it came to be that European conquerors and diseases would take over the Americas instead of the opposite.",t1_c966hl2,,False,0,Iamyourbetter,t5_2ssp3,1431713520,t1_c962t07,-2,c966hl2,0,1364795201,1,t3_1be2z1,False,,True

,politics,9,,"&gt;But what on earth is the reason for all the awful anti-Monsanto articles? 

It's not a Reddit thing.  It shows up on the /r/politics subreddit because that subreddit leans left and leans conspiracy theory.  I agree with you that it's really weak objections from really sketchy sources.  There are a couple major elements to the anti-Monsanto stuff that I'm aware of:

* European politics.  [Starting in the late '80s, mad cow disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_cow_disease#Epidemic_in_British_cattle) showed up in Britain.  This resulted in a (probably intentionally inflamed by the non-British European agricultural lobby, which would have the opportunity to lop off competition) panic and ten year ban of imports of British beef to the EU.

    That helped make Europeans extremely twitchy about anything out-of-the-ordinary in their food.  This included a moratorium on GMO food.  The US is a major agricultural center and conducts gobs of agricultural research; this includes US biotech companies like Monsanto.  The US got ticked off that the EU was blocking GMO food, arguing (in my view, probably quite legitimately) that the stuff was well-shown to be safe and that the main interests involved were European agricultural interests who wanted to keep competition out, and arranged to have Europe approve GMO food.  This resulted in the European agricultural industry going on an anti-GMO advertising kick.  There you've got all the makings of a ""big foreign company with lots of money who doesn't care about our health secretly changing our food"" conspiracy theory in the making.

* The New Age left has a whole faction that doesn't like factory farms (ethical reasons), chemicals/pesticides/etc (because chemicals are bad for humans, doncha know) and so forth, and Monsanto is a great poster boy for modern, industrial agriculture.

* Greenpeace takes...strident opposition to certain things.  Nuclear power plants, etc.  They also chose Monsanto to make an issue of.  Greenpeace decided that nuclear power was horrible a generation back and is still churning away, and I doubt that they're going to change their mind on Monsanto.

* Farmers historically don't have IP fees to pay on seed other than maybe the first-generation seed that they buy.  In order to make back money on their engineering work, Monsanto first looked into making second-gen plants sterile, and then simply decided to have a contract.  Imagine being the first person to create, say, a DRMed music player and you get the idea about the kinds of currents that rise up.

* Alex Jones is twitchy about Monsanto.  I don't know why, but I don't think that there's a conspiracy theory that he doesn't like.  This provides a fresh, new entertaining look on Monsanto conspiracy theory from the left-wing variants: the [Obama-Monsanto conspiracy](http://www.infowars.com/meet-monsantos-number-one-lobbyist-barrack-obama/).

Singapore is one of the most restrictive countries on the face of the Earth:

Perhaps you're thinking of the right of *corporations* to trade?  Individuals do not have the same rights as corporations in Singapore, which derives a great deal of its GDP from its location as a trade hub.

Singapore and Hong Kong are both more or less city states which engage almost exclusively in trade and do not produce a great deal of goods. They are too small.

Moreover, Singapore has government-run utilities. They are rich because their location makes them a good place for oil, they have a lot of banking, and that's pretty much enough.

The thing is that a grassroots boycott requires more than just a deserving target. It must have an impact on the country, at least potentially, and it is more appropriate when the country is not already under international sanctions for the same misdeeds denounced by the campaign. Boycotting Zimbabwe or North Korea would be pointless because, on one side, the countries are already under severe international sanctions, and on another one, because it is highly unlikely that anyone in the West will ever cross a Zimbabwean or North Korean product or company to boycott. At the other end the same is true: if the country is too big and powerful, no campaign will ever affect it. China, Russia, or even the US and Europe arguably perpetrate more crimes around the world than the rest of the world combined, but they are the powers that run the world, and grassroots actions like this one would have zero impact.

The example to look at for inspiration is, of course, apartheid South Africa. Was it the worst regime back in the 70s and 80s when boycotts started? Hardly. At the time, the USSR was invading Afghanistan, the US was staging coups and arming death squads all along Latin America, and China was supporting the murderous Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Why South Africa, then? Because it could be done, and because it could have a real impact.

,PoliticalDiscussion,1,,"The reasons for WWII is far more complex than that. A part of it is that after World War I there were two major positions on what to do about Germany. The Americans, led by Woodrow Wilson, took an idealist approach to Germany. They argued that democracy created peace, that Germany should be rehabilitated and accepted into the community if nations, and that international security could be provided through a collective security scheme in the League of Nations. France took the opposite realist approach. They thought that power balances determine whether or not war breaks out. As long as Germany was the major power in Europe then there could never be peace. Since the unification of Germany in the 1800's, it had become too powerful to be successfully balanced through alliances, especially since Britain was becoming isolationist and skeptical of France's intentions. France wanted to break up Germany into pieces, annex part of it, and then demand destructive reparations which would weaken the German economy until it was no longer capable of aggression. 

In my opinion either plan could have worked to avert WWII so long as the international community actually dedicated themselves completely to one strategy. The problem was that neither approach was taken. America and France could not agree one one plan and so instead they compromised. Germany would not be broken up into pieces, only a small territory was annexed by France, and harsh but not devastating reparations were demanded from Germany. All of these actions made Germany angry but not powerless, setting the stage for WWII. 

In addition, France occupied part of Germany to force German industries to give their production to France as part of the reparations. The German government hated this and printed money to send to the workers in the occupied territories in exchange for the workers to not produce anything to give to the French. This caused hyperinflation in Germany which was a major cause of the eventual fall of the Weimar republic.

The other aspect was collective security. Woodrow Wilson believed that if every nation pledged to protect every other nation from aggression then world security could be preserved no matter what the balance of power was in Europe. This belief was very misguided. In the 1930's Japan invaded Manchuria for imperialistic reasons. The League of Nations did nothing. No power was willing to go to war for a cause that didn't directly concern them. This example demonstrated to the Nazis that collective security was toothless and that the great powers in the international community would not engage for the sake of small nations unless their direct security was compromise.

,AskHistorians,2,,"&gt; Particularly the dynasties of China as opposed to those of Rome.

The Roman Empire may have been ruled by an Emperor, but it never really broke free with many of the old aspects of the Republic. Namely, it was not really a true monarchy as we know it - power could pass from father to son, but not necessarily so. It was common practice for Emperors to adopt heirs, select heirs from other relations in their families, choose military generals as their successors, etc, and it was almost equally common for ambitious figures to usurp the position. And this was excepted, because the Emperor, after all, was only first among equals. The Republic bred a society wherein their was constant competition amongst the upper classes for glory, honour, and power, and this was just a continuation of that. You didn't get the job just by being the past guy's son. Ancient China was more akin to a true monarchy (like the European kingdoms) in that familial succession was *very* important - indeed, it was used to justify the position of the Emperor. China had no republican tradition. As such, dynasties lasted longer, but when they collapsed, the whole Chinese Empire would collapse until it could be rebuilt (usually after some sort of warring states period). In Rome, when a dynasty fell, it was replaced - after some sort of civil war, often, but normally nothing akin to the warring states periods of China. An example would be the Julio-Claudian dynasty being replaced by the Flavian dynasty.

It should be worth noting that while Roman dynasties were not as long-lived as their Chinese counterparts, the Roman Empire had an astonishingly long life. If we take the founding of the Empire to be in 27 BC under Augustus and continuing to 1453 with the Fall of Constantinople, that is an astonishingly long run, unparalleled by any other empire.",t1_c96729l,,False,0,eighthgear,t5_2ssp3,1431713249,t1_c961x3p,2,c96729l,0,1364797952,0,t3_1bdue7,False,,True

By and large the policies implemented by governments have almost all been what is prescribed by conventional economics, often designed and implemented by mainstream economists working for government or official banks (Fed, IMF, World Bank, European Central Bank). There are debates and differences, but they amount to a bit more to the left here, or a bit more to the right there. Almost no government in the western world has attempted policies that are *contradictory* to mainstream economics.

''The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has courted growing anti-immigrant opinion in Germany by claiming the country's attempts to create a multicultural society have ""utterly failed"".

Speaking to a meeting of young members of her Christian Democratic Union party, Merkel said the idea of people from different cultural backgrounds living happily ""side by side"" did not work.

It doesn't help your argument by lying or being stupid, in your case I can't tell which. 
 
I don't even eat grains, the cheapest form of calories, and I eat on less than $5/day. I eat 200 to 250g of meat or fish and 300-500g mix of fresh and frozen vegetables daily for approximately 3.5 eu per day. This is an expensive diet. Don't give me this cost of living bullshit either, my cost was basically the same ~10% when I lived in the most expensive city in the world.

My diet:
Smoked salmon, fish fillets, pork chops, chicken breast, turkey breast, Camembert, brie, balkan cheese, broccoli, spinach, eggs, onions, carrots, apples, nutella, peanut butter, butter, olive oil, romaine, cabbage, peppers, mushrooms, and lots of different cheeses and meats as they come on sale.

If I substituted half my diet with rice, bread, or pasta, like many western diets, my cost per day would drop in half. Rice is basically free. Pasta and bread are not that much more. To replace vegetables or meat with gourmet fresh bread daily would still probably reduce cost.

Have you people ever counted? Or are you restricted to eating frozen shit from a box because you 'don't have the time' ? I eat 2/3 of my meals cold, aka without cooking or spending any time whatsoever.

&gt;if you deserve to inherit anything, you deserve to inherit only what your direct ancestors created

If one deserves to inherit what one's direct ancestors created and they deserved to inherit what their ancestors created, and so on... then you have a chain that reaches quite far back.

&gt;you don't get to conflate similar skin tones or shared nationality with actual ancestry

Ideally, like threads in a garment, families sharing similar cultural and genetic backgrounds together weave the fabric of a nation. Where genetic lineage holds a family together shared culture and values, that happen to be shared by European whites, hold white nations of the West together.

&gt;you're very conveniently ignoring all the circumstantial factors which contributed to European success (things like having guns, germs, and steel)

Germs were circumstantial, yes. Guns and steel not to much. Europeans did the work required to develop and refine the technology.

&gt;Denying your inherent right to a privileged life because other white people colonized the globe

Whites wouldn't have been able to colonize the globe if they were already innovative, hard-working people. Colonialization was an expression of the strength of whites rather than the cause of the strength of whites. In the end, whites backed away from colonialism because it didn't bring benefits in proportion to the costs.

&gt;because you're selflessly shouldering the responsibility of carrying forward Western Civilization

That's how it should be, yes. Whites should continue to bring the world great ideas and technology like democracy, separation of church and state, free speech, the printing press, etc. To destroy white nations through multiculturalism, under the guise of helping the ""underprivileged"", will be to destroy the goose that lays the golden eggs. And there is nothing to be gained by forcing white nations to become dysfunctionally multicultural:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE

&gt;It's just not fair that you're so burdened with opportunities and preferential treatment, nobody should have to bear that burden alone.

""Opportunities and preferential treatement"" for whites are primarily within nations built by whites. A white going to Africa or Asian, for example, will find that the dominant ethnicities in those regions have the advantage. This makes sense: if you build it, you own it.

,AskCulinary,22,,"&gt;Over time, since the diet never had dairy as a component, the ability to process lactose became recessive. So that's why many of them are unable to handle dairy, because many generations previous to them never had it before and therefore never developed the enzymes to break it down.

Not really how genes work. It's not use it or lose it when it comes to genetics. A gene does not become recessive, either. It is either recessive or dominant, and will remain so, unless a mutation occurs. (Mutations are random or induced by mutagens. Not having dairy will not induce mutations.)

This might be a better hypothesis that suits what you said better. (Further research has to be done to verify it.) There was no need for digestion of lactose, so individuals without such ability were not selected to die. Eventually, the population became saturated with people without the ability to digest lactose.

That being said, this answer is incorrect. It is not true that Asia is not suited for raising cattles. The Chinese are known to use cattles as a farming aid (e.g. plowing) for a long time, and Japan is not an exception. In fact, the only areas in the world that do not have cattles are areas that are too cold or areas with extreme elevation.

The real reason comes in two parts.

1. The gene responsible for the retainment of lactose digestion is naturally a recessive one. (Infants are all lactose tolerant because mammalian milk *generally* is rich in it. However, the ability weens as the infant advances to adulthood.) The mutation that allowed humans to retain the ability to digest lactose occurred in Northern Europe.
2. Thus, people in Europe can digest lactose, and will utilize the resource as it's beneficial. People in East Asia, however do not have such ability. Hence, even with the dairy products plentiful, they will not use it because it is a hinderance to actually consume it. Thus their diet do not include dairy generally. (Exceptions do exist, exemplified by the Tibetans, Mongolians, and other groups.)",t1_c9685wx,,False,0,[deleted],t5_2t82m,1431712730,t1_c967twv,22,c9685wx,0,1364808371,0,t3_1beruk,1364808554,,True

&gt; Required? Are you kidding me? But I will give you one. Just make sure to ask nicely next time.

There isn't anything rude about saying ""I need a citation to show what you said was actually true before I can even begin to argue against it"".

&gt; ""But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.""--Hebrews 3:13""

When I said citation, what I meant was either an historical example or current statistic of where acceptance of abortion has irrefutably lead to a decline in other morals.

&gt; You may see the widespread callousing and hardening of society's gag reflex as a good thing all you want, but I never will... 

I'll stress this point again: evolution is not necessarily a good thing. I never made any effort to say that society was evolving in a good way, but it's still evolved. Regarding whether or not it's a good thing: moral outrage has always caused us issues. If we had your perfect society where moral outrage just determined everything there would be no rock music, no rap music, no pop music, no techno music, no immigration, no interracial marriage, no civil rights movement or desegregation, no public schools, no minimum wage laws, no child labour laws, no vote for the common man, etc. etc. Everything throughout history that has really advanced us has provoked moral outrage from some. I'm not going to make a call on whether or not the pro-choice movement will be thought of as fondly as the labour movement or civil rights movement (obviously it deals with a much smaller issue). However, it's true to say that moral outrage is neither nothing new, nor a reliable testament against anything.

&gt; To suggest that I should ignore it in the name of ""progress"" is, truly silly and laughable.

Pragmatics, pragmatics. Progress is an arbitrary word - pragmatics is something a little more concrete. If you want to be pragmatic in terms of garnering support and implementing any policies you simply cannot be pro-life. Banning abortion has never solved anything. In fact, it has actually [increased abortion in some areas](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/18/abortion-rates-higher-countries-illegal-study_n_1215045.html).

&gt; You do understand that you just used a euphemism when you referred to the widespread murder of the innocent and defenseless as a ""pro-choice movement?"" Euphemisms may help you justify and condone horrific acts, but I will always call it what it is and see it for what it is: cold blooded murder. And, unlike you, I would never refer to the proscription of murder as a ""[r]estriction on women's reproductive rights."" If you insist on not using the correct terminology, then there is no point in discussing this issue any further.

The reason why I didn't refer to the pro-choice movement as cold blooded murder is because that wouldn't really illustrate my point very well would it? ""More to the point though, no, because cold blooded murder was not something primitive man was especially into, so it's not something we could regress towards."" The reason I used the term pro-choice movement is to address the fact that today support for *child-murder* (as you'd have me call it) derives from a position of feminism, of relieving the bodies of women from the hands of the patriarchy: it's born directly out of the same movement that gave us female suffrage and the equal pay act. Do you think that sounds primitive? Do you think there were cave women protesting in the street burning their animal fur bras? It's the same thing with ""women's reproductive rights"": I wasn't trying to add any sort of decorum to my position by using that word, simply accuracy. I was explaining how *child-murder* is born out of a progressive line of thought regarding liberty, equality, and feminism.

&gt; There are some acts that most of mankind will always deem disgusting, vile, and morally reprehensible, like the murder of the innocent and helpless, incest, cannibalism, etc., and when any given society begins to tolerate and accept such acts, it has regressed and is in a state of moral decline and decay and will begin to fall apart and die from the inside out. Ancient Greece and Rome, in my opinion, are prime examples.

Well, that and imperial overreach. Unless by Rome you mean the Vatican, in which case you might be onto something. You can't really compare two empires of the antiquity to modern civilizations. Especially given that since then hundreds of empires have collapsed for completely different reasons. If were to put your theory to the test: let's suppose we took a western European country with very liberal laws on abortion. Everything else is perfect: they have an integrated multi-cultural society; cheap, renewable, and secure energy; excellent health care; supranational ties economically and politically; and whatever else exists in your dream society, except they have no problem with abortion.

,germany,7,,"&gt; Is Germany too powerful for Europe?

No.

Economically, Germany is currently in a relatively good position, because its' problems forced it to do reforms much earlier than many other European countries. That pendulum may swing back soon as the painful reforms other countries have to go through now pay off, while German politicians (having learned that enacting unpopular reforms makes you unpopular) are hesistant to enact further reforms. (Angela Merkel is a perfect example of this: she doesn't act unless she feels she has no choice - then she makes abrupt decisions and goes back to wait-and-see)

Politically... well, being OK financially and Europe's largest economy does put Germany in a situation where it's expected to be solidaric with others and to act accordingly. But German politicians also have to protect Germany's interests. This puts them in a difficult position, leading to hesistant and sometimes unfortunately ""erratic"" (for lack of a better word) behaviour. This should not be confused with leadership - it's the exact opposite.

German politicians certainly have no interest in ruling over Europe like many seem to think - there's nothing to win except the hatred of others. Germany is *not* a driving force in this situation - it is being driven (much like the rest of Europe).

,europeans,7,,"Great job, guys! A few comments:

If this subreddit is to distinguish itself from /r/europe, this needs to be something stronger than guidelines. These are all brilliant advice on how to use Reddit, but most of it falls within general Rediquette.

I for one am hoping that /r/europeans could take a stronger stance on moderation than /r/europe. I know this is controversial, not least because it requires much more work on part of the moderators, but I think that a set of clear, understandable rules, some of which are already laid out in this document, would be very beneficial.

I'm very happy to see some affirmative action against downvoting brigades. They're a major problem in /r/europe. But at the same time, the downvote button is a means for the community to regulate itself. If it is disabled, the community needs a different way to remove or indicate disapproval of inappropriate or offensive content.

I propose the following ""hard"" rules for moderation, violation of which should cause a ban (perhaps with a three-strike thing):

* No aggressive nationalism. That is, negative accusations and essentialist discrimination of European and non-European nationalities. Lighthearted stabs are fine, but no threats of invasion, references to previous conflicts, or similar bad-faith expressions of animosity.

* No racism. This includes Muslims and Gypsies. Discuss the theological and social problems, but do not stereotype the individuals belonging to those groups or devolve into derogatory name-calling.

* No sexism. Women and men should be treated with equal respect.

* No homophobia (or biphobia, or transphobia). This subreddit should be welcome to all Europeans, regardless of sexuality and gender identity.

Since this subreddit will invariably consist of non-Native English speakers, it might be a good idea to define each bullet point in more detail, providing helpful examples in a FAQ or something, so subscribers can get a feel for the kind of thing that is acceptable and that isn't. We don't want people to feel persecuted for not understanding the subtleties of the English language perfectly, so moderation should be based on a common sense judgment of whether or not the poster was in good or bad faith.",t1_c968lcn,,False,0,simonask,t5_2wb9d,1431712528,t3_1bdq4m,7,c968lcn,0,1364813039,0,t3_1bdq4m,False,,True
,malaysia,1,sabah-round,"I note with great interest that, in your assertion that race is determined solely by genetics, you have failed to explain away some important opposing points I've previously raised:

There exists a concept of ""honorary tribe member"" where a complete outsider is adopted and treated as one of the tribe, and his offspring are automatically treated as members of the tribe.  The closest you've come to saying that this doesn't apply to race is to casually dismiss that ""there is simply no way a Chinese may be recognized as an Indian (or vice versa) both legally, constitutionally or otherwise""... but you never actually explain why.  

The real-world example that I gave of a half-Kadazan half-Chinese child's race being decided depending on what race his father is, and the fact that one with a Kadazan father *can* still be assigned to his Chinese mother's race additionally shows that there is precedent *and* a mechanism for an Indian adoptee of a Chinese family to become recognised as Chinese.  You don't address this either, apparently hoping nobody would notice.

There is also the case of the late Nyonya Tahir who, despite being born Malay and recognised in her IC as Malay, completely and absolutely adopted Chinese culture to the extent that nobody bothered with her actual race and religion until the time came for her to be buried, further showing that there are actual cases *in Malaysia* for people becoming ""adopted"" into a race, and it *does* happen even outside of legally recognised frameworks and laws.  This is probably the easiest for you to attempt to explain away, since I last mentioned Nyonya Tahir's case as an example of someone being considered Malay despite being legally recognised as an apostate... but you didn't talk about this either.

So, if those points I made still stand and directly contradict what you're saying, how can you assert with any conviction that race should be purely genetic?

&gt; By this circular logic

You've made a leap between step 2 (""Bumiputera status gets special rights"") and step 3 (""Chinese cannot be an Indian"").  There's no logical connection between those two steps.  Your circle is broken.

&gt; Bumiputera is never part of the constitution

The races that constitute what we call ""Bumiputra"" are mentioned in the Constitution as ""Malay"" and ""natives of Sabah and Sarawak"".  The fact that the term ""Bumiputra"" is not mentioned in the Constitution is actually irrelevant: as I said, it's just a convenient way to refer to those specified races.

And ""lower interest rates"" is not a Bumi right as defined in the Constitution.  It's something imposed by the government under the NEP and its successor policy the NDP, and thus it can be removed if necessary without falling foul of Article 153.

&gt; Other races is determined by ancestry genetic only.

Really?

The Orang Asli consider themselves to constitute several different tribes, all of which are differentiated from each other by geographical location and culture.

A large portion of Sabahan natives all hail from the same actual genetic grouping, but differentiate themselves into Kadazan, Murut, and so on based solely, again, on cultural differences.

Han Chinese genetic ancestry actually varies significantly - northern Chinese are so distinct from southern Chinese to the extent that the waves of migration across China can be tracked and traced using when northern Chinese gene markers appear in the southern Chinese genome.  But despite that variation, Han Chinese consider themselves to be one race, something that historically came about because they identified themselves as being part of the ""huaxia people"" (ie. ""the people of civilization""), and later as ""the people of the Han dynasty"" after the Han dynasty's prominence became widespread.  You can also see how the Manchurian dynasties also became absorbed into the Chinese racial identity after they started ruling China.  All that points to the Chinese identity being decided not by genetics but by culture.

The Indian diaspora is no different.  Indians can actually be genetically distinguished into several genetic groups, ranging from the Indo-European northerners to the Australoid southerners to the Mongoloid people of the Tibet-Nepal area.  Yet, that huge genetic variation that has led to separate racial identities elsewhere in the world doesn't even come into how Indians have historically divided themselves.  Instead, you get a distinction based on class and caste... something that isn't possible unless ""Indian"" is something largely determined by culture.

The Native Americans distinguish themselves into various tribes that actually share the same genetic ancestry, but again distinguish themselves from each other by traditions and language.  More culturally-decided variation.

I can go on with a lot more examples that prove race isn't solely determined by genetics, not just in Malaysia but all over the world... but is there any point in me doing so if you're just going to conveniently ignore it all?

In fact, why should I go on with this thread at all, especially if you're going to misrepresent what I say anyway?

,europe,5,PORT,"A very decent question, and one which I had to dig around a bit to find! I found most of the answers in Portuguese media, but see bellow for further sources.

The overall idea seems that there is no real difference in terms of actual use; there is a lot of political posturing concerning this policy so most sources are biased one way or the other, but overall the number of hard drug users seems to be little affected by the policy. Now, one must consider that the main opposition to the law was that it would fuel a brutal increase in drug addiction and turn Portugal into a ""drug haven for drug tourists"". This hasn't happened. Additionally health indicators such as HIV infections in drug users have been drastically reduced. Some important social results have been possible, mainly because many hard drug users have little to no family support, are homeless, etc, and the mandatory counselling includes Social Services that can make a difference.

One idea I got though was that decriminalisation by itself is not a magic bullet and that it is mostly concerned with ""damage reduction"" - it is not a prevention measure. It is a heavily politically charged issue and most sources tend to be somewhat biased.

Personally though, one big different I have noticed was perception... Lisbon during the late 80s/90s had some spots that were unbearable, with drug trafficking made in broad daylight, people roaming around looking for a fix, horrible stuff. That being said, and now that most if not all of this places have been reconverted, perhaps the reason things look much better was because people were all sent to city projects and others can't see them :(

While searching around I have found some interesting data by the EMCDDA (coincidentally based in Lisbon). Amidst all the turmoil and ill-will that the current crisis makes manifest I find that these organisations are one of the most visible proofs of the advantages of European integration (for different values of integration, not making a federalist plea!). Hope this provides some additional ""hard numbers"", although I found no information comparing drug usage over a decade or something like that:

 - **The U.S. isn't the only country where soccer wasn't the dominant sport.** Canada and Finland preferred hockey. New Zealand's best athletes went out for rugby. Japan, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and a decent swathe of Central America went out for baseball. Australia's money and time gravitated toward Australian rules football domestically and swimming for international competition. The two largest countries in the world by population, China and India, preferred volleyball and ping-pong (China) and cricket (India). (In fairness to China, this has changed recently -- soccer is probably the most dominant spectator sport there now -- but it doesn't have the wholesale grip on the culture that you'll see in Europe.) Most of Central Asia preferred wrestling. 

This isn't to say that soccer/football *isn't popular* in these nations, because patently it is, particularly during major international competitions like the World Cup. Overall, the trend is also toward a more universal appeal for soccer/football: Australia, NZ, the U.S., Canada, and China have all notably paid much greater attention to soccer over the last two decades. However, other sports are equally or significantly more dominant.

So any discussion where we're asking why the U.S. doesn't ""like"" soccer has to start by acknowledging that the U.S. isn't as unique in this respect as it's typically portrayed. And one of the things you'll notice about the aforementioned list is that a surprising number of former British colonies don't prioritize soccer the way England did. The sport's rules weren't codified until the late 19th century, at which point association football had to compete against all the sports that had already attracted support in the most far-flung British colonies. Moreover, British colonies tended to be settlement rather than exploitation colonies, and were wealthier on average than, say, an African territory sleazed into existence for the benefit of the diamond or gold trade. The capital investment needed for sports like baseball or hockey wasn't an issue for these regions.

 - **Soccer developed and advanced more quickly in Europe due to the proximity and relative availability of international matches.** This is the big one, and something that's typically overlooked even today. Anyone who's seen the political map in Europe knows it's basically Kibbles-N-Bits; you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a national border. Thus, Dutch soccer butted heads with German soccer smashed into Italian soccer fought French soccer clashed with English soccer battled Spanish soccer, and so on and so forth. The sport had the opportunity to advance quickly in Europe due to the relative proximity of international competition and the role that a nation's experience with that inevitably played when it came time for ... well, an international competition. New, effective strategies and techniques quickly spread across the continent. Homegrown soccer that wasn't as effective quickly failed against international sides and was abandoned. 

Not only does the proximity of your competition matter, but the quality does too. As Europe developed more and better techniques for the sport, European sides naturally played an ever-improving series of opponents. It's no mistake that UEFA is the most competitive league in the world. As in every other sport, one of the best ways to improve is to play opponents who are better than you, and then analyze how they did it. This is one of the most important reasons that Australia left the Oceanic conference in 2006, because -- barring New Zealand -- the competition in the OFC is nowhere near as good as it is in the Asian conference. The U.S. has the same problem in that, barring Mexico, CONCACAF doesn't really have any countries that are consistently major players in international football.

There are some analysts who suggest that distance is a major impediment to Brazil's continued success in the sport. While Brazil is the definition of a successful country on the soccer scene, statistically it actually *underperforms* relative to how it should be doing given the national attention to and investment in the sport. The distance from soccer's most innovative and dynamic center, Europe, certainly isn't helping.

 - **Geography continues to play a major role.** [This is a map of soccer's modern confederations](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/World_Map_FIFA2.svg) as drawn up by FIFA, and something's instantly obvious to all those of us who stayed awake through 8th grad geography. UEFA may outwardly appear to be as large and distance-heavy as the confederations in other regions, but no one's under any illusion that most of that territory is actually relevant. When we talk about ""European soccer,"" what we're really talking about is a relatively small area encompassing England, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Road games here are rarely a major trek, and they cover exactly two time zones. The Asian and African football confederations look at this and laugh. Hard. CONCACAF and CONMEBOL aren't much better off.

FIFA regularly fields charges that it is run by a small cadre of Europeans for the benefit of Europeans, and that other confederations were drawn up with the same care and attention that went into the colonial world's borders. Even the most diehard FIFA supporters ( ... all two of them) would admit there's at least a grain of truth to this. Road games in other regions tend to be agonizing slogs, and FIFA was also pretty slow to catch on to the idea that other regions of the world may not have the kind of cooperative and relatively mild weather that much of Europe gets. Summer in Tunisia says hi.

 - **Sexism plays a role.** A sizable portion of the world that asks why the U.S. doesn't like and isn't any good at soccer has very little to say on the subject of the American women's dominance of the sport. (This, incidentally, is one of the few things I despise about /r/soccer -- the blithe assumption on the part of many of its contributors that the women's side of the sport doesn't matter.) Japan, China, Norway, Sweden, Canada, and the U.S. may not have much of a presence in the men's side, but their women's national teams run riot (as do Germany and France, which do have a serious presence in the men's sport). Canada probably has the single best women's player in the world right now in the form of Christine Sinclair. The U.S. has the female version of Didier Drogba in Abby Wambach. Japan plays stellar technical soccer. But as far as most of the world is concerned, these people don't exist.

This is a representative and extremely depressing example: At the 2012 Olympics, the Japanese men's and Japanese women's teams took the same flight to London. The men's side is of middling quality at best and has never made it out of the round of 16 at the World Cup. The women's side won the 2011 women's world cup. [Guess which one flew coach?](http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/japanese-women-fly-coach-to-the-olympics-the-men-go-business-class/)

 - **It's difficult to market the sport in newer regions due to the perception of the role that cheating and FIFA's resistance to technology plays within it.** By which I mean diving. Diving is nowhere near as common as many of soccer's detractors claim it is, but we'd be fools not to admit that it happens, and sometimes it has a serious impact on the outcome of a match. 

It's also extremely difficult to convince FIFA to implement technology that would help stop cheating or referees' mistakes. When the *entire* stadium at a match can see on the jumbotron that a player attempting to sell a nonexistent injury is faking but the ref can't, that's a problem. I don't think it's fair to blame the refs for this, because FIFA is asking the impossible; there's no getting around the fact that cameras are simply better than the human eye. Goal-line technology would have prevented a huge mistake at the 2010 World Cup that [cost England a goal against Germany](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8766423.stm) even though the goalkeeper concerned knew that the ball had gone in. Supposedly it'll be a part of the 2014 WC, but we'll see.

Any low-scoring sport is susceptible to having its outcomes disproportionately affected by cheating or mistakes, and [it's both enraging and heartbreaking to see your side lose a match](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/nov/20/ireland-thierry-henry-fifa-replay) because of it.

Personally I think the ""commercial"" aspect is pretty bullshit, because advertising dollars go where the popularity is and have managed to figure out a funding model no matter what. UEFA has not exactly gone begging for major corporations that want to sponsor it. By contrast, no amount of Madison Avenue witchcraft is going to make an unpopular sport popular, or stop [the decline of a sport's popularity](http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/football-baseball-and-the-evolving-tastes-of-fans/) (e.g., baseball).

,IWantOut,1,,"I translate from Spanish and English into my native Russian (normally, a translator translates into his/her native languages, which pretty much limits job opportunities for me). The thing is, Russian translation market is easy to enter, but the wage is low ($12 per standard page at one of my jobs and $7 at the other, but the texts are rather easy and the amount of work is massive). I had some formal studies (2nd degree in my Russian university), but even at highly competitive western markets a degree is not always necessary - work experience in other area, like IT or oil&amp;gas sometimes is much more valuable for a prospective translator. 

The greatest thing about my timeline is that on my main job I have deadlines every 2-3 weeks and during this time I don't have to contact my employer at all,which gives me so much flexibility. On the other job, I contact my employer on Skype every 2-3 days, but if you're from USA and work in, say, South America, it should be rather easy for you. Due to the salary and the amount of work, I word 3-5 hours every day, so I can't take 3 days off and go backpacking, however, all other options are open for me.

If you have a native editor/proofreader, which is your case, it increases your chances significantly. However, I don't know the real salary conditions in Europe/U.S. - I'd say $0.1 per word, which is $25 per standard page, and while a translator is supposed to do 8 pages per 8-hour working day, I do more - it depends on the topic and how fast you can do the job. It took me almost 2 years to find such job opportunities, and in both cases my previous experience was important - I got 1 job thanks to my IT major and 1 year of work experience in IT.

&gt;Because there's not enough money to cover all the budgeted and completed programs from 2012.

So, obviously the EU has adopted programs that they can not afford. Not to be obtuse, but who is responsible for that? I mean, it is the first thing one should look at - can we do this? 

So, what programs are there, and who miscalculated the costs? 

&gt;The amendmends are about balancing the budget: payments should meet the commitments. Postponing the payments indefinitely does not work.

But that is in no way a guarantee that it will not happen again. Obviously, the EU is good at having programs that they can not pay for. So, what is the EU doing to make sure this does not happen again - that the programs will be covered for by the budget. They haven't even pinpointed what went wrong, so how can they in any way say it will not happen again.

I mean, how will they learn if you can just force countries to pay more for your ill planning? 

&gt;payments should meet the commitments.

That goes for the EU as well, doesn't it? Countries have paid, countries have met *their* commitments. Why can't EU do their part? Perhaps they should cut back on stuff then, not ask their countries to pay for what is the EU's mistake.

The average for her classes is usually an A- or B+, but it's easy to do well.

Take a (European) language class. If you can keep up to date on the material and do all the homework, there's really no way you won't get an A. If you don't know a little French then I'd stay away from taking Spanish or Italian, since the Francophone and French Immersion kids tend to kick a lot of ass at those, since knowing French is so helpful.

As for North America (east of the Rockies specifically), it's a different beast altogether. The major culture centers of Europe are initially along the Mediterranean and therefore has a strong and early need to develop ships that sail between the various cities around the sea.

In North America, the major culture centers are inland, along the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. There are people living on the coasts, of course, but their enemies and trading partners are going to be inland or up and down the coast--not across the sea. Rivers, portages, and overland routes are the major trade routes, and canoes are excellent for such travel. This trade network linked the east coast to the Rockies and the Gulf coast to the Great Lakes.

There are similar situations throughout the New World. Trade is mainly overland or along the Pacific coast. No need to cross a sea to get to your destination so no strong naval impulse (though the Pacific coast interesting because you see a lot of different naval innovations but they don't seem to transmit along the coast well, probably because the trade network is a straight line which cases all sorts of complications). 

The exception to this general rule is the Caribbean, and there's some evidence that trade eventually gets started in this region, linking Cuba and Florida for example, but I'm not terribly familar with the history of that region so hopefully someone else can expand on that.

,europe,1,FINL,"&gt; So, obviously the EU has adopted programs that they can not afford. Not to be obtuse, but who is responsible for that? I mean, it is the first thing one should look at - can we do this? 

The programs are based on budgetary commitments, which on turn are covered by actual payments to the budget. Now the situation is that the payments do not meet the commitments. You could start by looking at the Council and it's decisions during last years (for more information see the link in my previous post).

&gt; But that is in no way a guarantee that it will not happen again.

It isn't. That's why the Parliament has been raising a stink about it regarding the MFF 2014-20 too.

[Long-term EU budget negotiations: EP sets out its stance](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130312IPR06440/html/Long-term-EU-budget-negotiations-EP-sets-out-its-stance)
*The resolution highlights the growing problem of payment shortfalls, which prevent bills being paid and jeopardize EU programmes. Last year's shortfalls meant that several important EU programmes, such as Erasmus, the Research Framework Programme and the Social Fund ran out of funds early in the year.*

*Parliament insists that the issue of unpaid bills from 2012 must be settled before concluding the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) negotiations, as agreed in last year's budget talks. Parliament also wants a political undertaking from the Council that all bills falling due in 2013 will be paid in 2013, so as to avoid ""rolling over"" a deficit into the new MFF. The EU cannot legally run a deficit.*

&gt; Countries have paid, countries have met their commitments.

Well, there's problem. Countries have made commitments but not paid for all those commitments. Now it's 2013, the last year of MFF 2007-13 and budgetary commitments should be met with actual payments.

,AskHistorians,3,religion,"&gt;Can you elaborate on how you feel western -European?

I don't feel Western European, but one thing about identity (that's sadly not emphasized in the current literature--if you guys know places where it is, tell me), is that identity is 1) layered and 2) contextual.  So for example, the same person can feel black in Dallas, like part of the African Diaspora in New York, specifically Nigerian in London, specifically Ibo in Lagos, and have a more specific regional or family identity in Enugu.

I would guess in Switzerland you identify by your Canton, but if you were in, say, German, you might feel more generally Swiss (or at least more part of whichever linguistic group you identify with).  If you come to America, you might be (repeatedly) reminded that you're different not because you're from Bern or wherever, but because you're ""European"".

,politics,1,,"&gt;Neither of these are accurrate comparisons to what it would be like today in the western world.

Why? If you look at the developing world, there are modern western companies engaging in all kinds of activities that would be against the public interest. The only reason these companies do not engage in those activities here is that they're illegal. There are many, but let's just look at one. Coca Cola.

The CSE is an environmental NGO bases in India. When they tested the water Pepsi and Coke were using to produce their sodas they found 30 times the amount of pesticide residue then what is allowed under European Regulation. If coke is using water filled with pesticide in India, why wouldn't they here if they could?

India water officials in Varanasi identified the local Coke plant as the source of groundwater pollution. The plant had been releasing waste water into the surrounding land.

Shifting to South America, Coke has been accused of hiring paramilitary security forces in Colombia to harass and assault workers and union leaders.

Coca Cola is headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. It's not a third world company. Not an 1800's operation. A real, modern, United States based corporation taking advantage of locations with fewer regulations and engaging in activities that directly harm the public interest in those locations. The argument can not be made that Coke just ""didn't know"" because these are exactly the kinds of activities that are illegal in the United State. They engage in those activities not because the public is okay with them, but because it lowers the cost of their operation and they have to the money and power to oppose local regulations that would cost them more. Corporations exist solely to create profit. ethical behavior is not one of requirements of that. It's up to the public and the government to enforce it.

That's just one example. I could go on.

&gt;Why? How do you know?
Let me ask you something: Why does McDonald's sell salads and wraps? And why did they give up ""SuperSize""? We'll see if you understand that very basic and easily explainable example, and then maybe talk about some more complex examples.

McD's sells salads because the public wants to buy salads. I understand the principles of supply and demand. So far our discussion has been respectful. Please keep it that way by not insulting my intelligence. I respect your opinion is different then mine. I'd appreciate the same.

Arguing public demand for a salad is equivalent to the public interest in unpolluted water doesn't really work. I understand your point, if a company were poisoning the local water table with runoff, eventually the customers of that company would stop buying and the company would have to change their practices. However, while that market dynamic is happening the water table is still being poisoned. People's health and environment would be effected, including the health of those who were not originally customers of the company. Clean water is a public interest, the free market should not have a say in it. As an example.

&gt;I agree this is why they exist, I'm not disputing that. I'm disputing both (1) their effectiveness at doing so, and (2) whether their unintended consequences mean they are actually any net benefit.

Here is a point where I think we agree, but for different reasons. If I understand your position, you don't believe they are effective because they interfere with the free market. I don't think they're effective because they're not properly enforced. As a comparison, the guy who found an AT&amp;T security hole on the first generation iPad is going to jail for 41 months on hacking charges. Not a single person from HSBC is going to jail for laundering the money from Mexican drug cartels. Sure they have to pay a hefty fine, but they're allowed to continue business. HSBC made over $20 billion in profits in 2012. Their fine for moving drug money? Less then 10% of that. The difference between the two examples I gave is pretty simple. One is a Corporation committing a crime against the public and one is a member of the public committing a crime against a corporation. Who gets the jail time?

&gt;Because we're only three or four more regulations from fixing poverty and drugs, right?
What regulations would you propose, and what enforcement would you propose? Be specific.

Regulations won't fix poverty. Poverty requires active measures such as food assistance, job training, and other social safety nets, not passive regulation. Like corporations drugs need to be regulated in a way that is in the public interest. Right now I'd argue that prison sentences for drug abusers are not in the public interest. More over the current drug regulation is more in the private interest as more and more prisons across America are becoming privately owned. Some of which having contracts with their States to maintain a level of occupancy in the prison. Drugs don't need more regulation, they need different regulation. Less prison time, more education and rehabilitation.

I'll conclude by saying that a successful economy requires a successful middle class. They're the people that buy the goods and services. Right now the system is set up in a way that requires businesses and their managers to meet their goals of whatever percentage higher profitability over last quarter or feel the wrath of their shareholders. All this does is create an environment where short term gains take priority be damned the consequences. And so the middle class disappears. The bottom 40% of the US only owns 7% of the wealth while the top 20% owns more then 80%. That's not a sustainable economy. So far corporations have taken no steps to correct that trend on their own. I'd argue they've done the opposite and accelerated the effect. A stable economy is in the public interest, the corporations won't do it on their own, who's left? Sadly it's the government. There needs to be regulation to reverse this trend and help build up a strong middle class again or else the economy is going to fail.

Anyways, onto serious discussion... You opened with this ""I agree. This should never happen. This isn't the case though. Let's go back in time a bit, in the early 1900's there was a Jewish minority in Ottoman Palestine, living among Arabs from Egypt, Saudi and Turks who came to look for work and a home there in. Over time there was a bit more land being bought by the Jews, who immigrated to escape prosecution and seek to build a home where some of their brothers deemed relativity safe, and also coincidentally in the place where 2000 years ago Jews came from. (Just ironic.). Arab villages then began to terrorize said villages because they were buying land and building on it, Jews began defending their lands. This escelates till UN has to make a proposal to split the land between them (like children who can't share), which Jews agreed to, Arabs disagreed, (didn't want their land? Huh), then 1948 war everything unfolds, Arabs wanted to kill all the Jews in a War and then claim their land too, doesn't work IDF wins the war, expands their territory as they weren't going to let those who attacked them keep it. Arabs who lived there either fled or left (to wait until another war wipes the Jews into endangerment, and then go back to living again in a land where all Jews were killed), or they stayed, as was offered to most. That's basically the strt of it.""   
      
Prior to Israel's founding, when the zionist settlers turned up, they were seen as invaders from Europe who were making ridiculous claims based on a bunch of religious myths over two thousand years old. The violent reaction you mentioned was to their invasion, high-handed superiority and ridiculoius claims. The zionists and the British were working hand in hand, and thats exactly what the arabs saw, the british occupiers were the ones who endorsed the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Those who migrated ""bought"" land in areas where there was a colonial presence, ie Britain, whiich was intensely anti-arab. These jews would have been seen as colonial settlers. Imagine you are an arab and your family has lived on the land for thousands of years. A bunch of zionists turn up and tell you that your land is theirs, and that God has given them a right to be there. Is that in your view, a migration? Of course there was violence, it was resistance against the imperialist British Empire, so excuse me if I find ""jews began defending their lands"" a ridiculous claim.  
    
""No. That's the point. That's why the jews, who were prosecuted all over the world, and who live far away from where they originate (Judaism is not a religion that converts people forcefully like what we are so used to in Christianity and Islam, so we get direct ancestors, not for example, places like Brazil that were forcefed it with a spoon).""

""The Jews in Israel are Polish, Russian, Ethiopian, Omani, Iraqi, Marrocan, Algerian, Tunisian, Libyan, and oh yeah the leading one is Israeli. You're right, that's where they originate, but they cannot return sadly, other than the Israelis.""   
    
Now I'm going to explain the following statement to you (the one I made earlier that you are so outraged about), this one: ""The jews who live in Israel now all came from Europe on their own free will (as much as the Palestinians who left in refuge did)... You see ""free will"" in this case is a term that you defined as such, and I am simply going by your standard.""   
     
The jews were being persecuted and killed in many parts of Europe, the Palestinians are being persecuted and killed in many parts of what you like to call Israel... So when you say that the Palestinians left ""on their own free will"", then surely that means the jews did the same. Personally I don't believe either group left on their own free will, but if you insist on using that term for the Palestinian refugees, then surely you will accept the same for the jewish ones... Unless of course, you view the Palestinians as less human...    
     
""(As I stated before I really cringe when you say the Jews in Israel all came from Europe, but I explained it above so I won't approach it again like a broken radio.)""   
     
Thats funny because I cringe when you say Jews come from Israel, a country that has existed for 65 years. Lets start taking some examples, how about we start with Netanyahu... Now you can't seriously tell me that he is from Israel can you? The man who's father was Russian and who's grandfather was Lithuanian? Are the Sharons from Israel? Nope, they're also Lithuanian. You see Zionism is a European invention, not a Middle Eastern invention. If I converted to Judaism, does that suddenly make me Israeli? No.

,science,1,,"Uh huh, and that agrees with everything I just said. If you don't restrict to combat deaths, the figure you cited is likely far too low. If you do, it's far too high. 

Why would you restrict it to combat deaths? Because the most people who died in WWII were neither soldiers, nor death camp victims, but collateral damage. Many millions of not-truly-involved died due to starvation, as the war created massive food shortages in much of Europe. Not to mention the world was already in the grips of the great depression at the beginning of the war, and famine was widespread beforehand... 

There's absolutely no way to reasonably estimate this death-toll, IMO, and it doesn't have as much of an impact on the socio-political outcomes of the war. (Because the countries affected were busy repairing damages cause directly by the war, most didn't have the relative luxury of taking full inventory, so to speak. And even if they did, the war was over--why would the Soviet Union, for example, yield to the international community *exactly* how many of their peasants starved? Combat deaths could be directly measured by both sides.

#So that is why I would restrict it to combat deaths. People can decide for themselves whether I'm a complete idiot. Or not.

&gt;I'll bite: how does giving poor people the cures for malaria, dysentery, etc undermine medical progress?

It doesn't. But there's this thing you don't seem to understand called economics; so starting at the beginning. In an economy, supply is an inevitable outcome of demand. Is something can be, and people will pay, it will be. 

The more people willing to pay, the more incentive for firms to create the supply. So we've got these things called commodities--now classically, they're the supply which is demanded. Goods like rice, sugar, gold, cotton--the ye olde trading staples you might have learned from pop culture, or a history class, are commodities, but more broadly a commodity can also be a service or a piece of information. 

So we have a demand for a commodity. What determines if that commodity is produced? The level of demand! The *more people* demand a commodity, the *more incentive* their is for a firm to take upon themselves the cost of producing the commodity, with the goal of profit. 

So supply increase, and people have access to the medication after random Pharma Corp spends the 10,000,000 in R&amp;D. Then they charge capital for the commodity, and the world keeps spinning. The more devastating a disease is, the more likely its eradication will have a demand which incentiveizes firms to produce a treatment. The more people die from something, the harder people will work to cure it.

Over time the supply of the medication increases, so its cost may decrease--but only when its demand also decreases. So long as demand stays constant, even if supply increases, there's no incentive to lower price. Or give away, as may be. (Other than good will, but that's a whole other thing).

Anywho, what I said is that the dead are a necessary cost. They are. Your counter argument is a strawman; ""how does giving poor people the cures for malaria, dysentery, etc undermine medical progress?"" In no way does it undermine further progress, but that doesn't mean that it's going to happen if it's economically infeasible. And even if it did, it wouldn't bring the people who'd died to get us the cure back from the dead.",t1_c96czq1,,False,0,Syphon8,t5_mouw,1431710384,t1_c96cgyj,1,c96czq1,0,1364836297,0,t3_1bey13,False,,True

But, anyhow: Just keep in mind that, if you do go in, you might be able to do small things that make terrible situations slightly less terrible. 

You know much more about what goes on, and I know I have a sentimental, rose-colored view of military life, but I just think that a huge percentage of the guys in the U.S., Canadian, Western European and Israeli armies (and, I'm sure, lots of other armies in mellow countries) are really nice guys who mean extremely well, and that this actually makes a difference.

I'm sure that lots of stupid stuff happens when Israelis are around the West Bank or near Gaza, but I suspect that, a huge percentage of the time, the Israeli soldiers behave extremely well. Palestinians who are angry -- maybe over issues that would cause any of us to be angry, too -- might not be calm enough to see that a lot of Israeli soldiers are operating in a professional way, but, 60 years from now, when things calm down, maybe Palestinians who are children today will be able to look back with mellower eyes.

I just know in my heart that plenty of the Coalition troops in Afghanistan must have been genuinely polite and helpful a lot of the time. Maybe, in 30 years, the stupid violence will face away and what will really matter is memories of the little acts of kindness.

And if someone then posts in rebuttal about all sorts of horrible things that soldiers do on the West Bank, in Afghanistan, etc.: Of course. I'm sure you could give me the URLs for records of thousands of other cases like that, if you had the time. What's horrible is horrible. But maybe little sparks of kindness matter, too.

Some things you guys need to understand:

From NCE (New Chemical Entity) to a marketed drug it takes 15 years and $1 billion USD to develop a drug. These days compounds are created by high throughput screening, allowing thousands of different compounds to be made in a short period of time. Of those thousands of compounds, 1/10,000 compounds make it to market. Of those 1/10,000 drugs that make it to market, only 3/10 drugs will recoup the research and development costs. So yes, drug companies will try to tweak molecules, add a different salt, put a double bond here or there, to try and retain patents longer. These tweaked drugs have to be therapeutically equivalent though. 

To those of you saying ""poor america"", where no one can afford life saving drugs... get real. Fifty-three percent of pharmaceutical research and development in the world takes place in the United States,followed by Japan at number two. Seven of the top 15 pharmaceutical companies are in the U.S., the second closest countries are Switzerland and the UK at 2 each. So the U.S. is important for drug discovery, and without us many of the life saving drugs wouldn't be on the market. In 2010, almost 76% of prescriptions written in the U.S. were for generic drugs. So don't give me the ""It's too expensive"" line. A select few are expensive at any given time and only for a period of time.

Beware with BB though: they have a 346 line that's of lower quality made specifically for their factory stores. If you hit up their clearance section, you should find more of their mainline stuff.

Levi's  is probably more interesting for someone from the UK, as the prices you can get in the US are much more reasonable than in Europe, especially at their factory outlets.

,europe,-1,SWED,"&gt;Ie the executives of national governments decided not to cover commitments with payments.

So, then they should take the responsibilty for that. They are not - they are saying that the nations have to pay for it. That is one way, but there are several other ways too - as in cutting down on other programs etc. There is no law that say the money has to come from the EU member states. Also, the *Council* should be the one who asks for money, not the EU. And, they should each and every one of them go out to their individual nations, explain why they voted like this etc. Also, I would really like to know why the EP went along with it. 

Still, I see absolutely no one in the EU taking responsibility for it. Shame on them!

&gt;&gt;Who, when and how should have foreseen the Council's position? And how should the spending be planned: according to commitments or according to foresight of the position the national executives might take in the future?

What? Are you saying it is impossible for the Council to a) change its position? b) have, as a guide *to only implement programs that they can afford*? 

The spending should be planned as a budget, of course. Sweden has managed to balance it budget for over a decade, as well as myriads of other countries/organisations/states/counties/companies/regions etc. Are you saying it can not be done?That it is impossible for the EU to do what myriads of others are doing just fine. Of course the EU can do it, but they do not want nor do they care to. 

Of course it can be done, the Council however choose to be extremely fiscal irresponsible (something I, and a lot of other people have come to connect with the EU) and *if* they vote on that, they should be bloody sure that they can a motivate it for the fact that the programs are of such extreme importance (which is hard to do when you spend 40 % on CAP) and that the nations agrees to this. Obviously, they have failed on both accounts. 

To me, this is one more reason that the EU is extremely fiscally irresponsible and truly do not even attempt to balance a budget. And, another reason we should give as little as possible, the EU is apparently not even attempting too, they vote for programs that is not covered. Who, apart from extremely fiscally irresponsible people does that?  And, I think we are just going to see more and more of it too. I would be furious if my government did something as irresponsible like this, and I am certainly not going to accept it from the EU (and, we might very well have, I have no idea how the Swedish commissionary voted, but I am sure as hell going to find out).

Cut your list of planned destinations in half. You'll end up wanting to stay in amazing little places you didn't plan on, and you'll feel compelled to leave prematurely if you still have a tonne of cities left on your list.

If you can't find a travel buddy then go alone. Solo traveling is awesome, especially in popular destinations like Europe. You'll meet new friends in your hostels, and it's amazing how well a little loneliness can get you out of your shell.

For money just bring cash and card. Travelers cheques are expensive and essentially useless. Take money out of bank machines in large chunks to minimize bank fees. Also make sure that all of your cash and cards aren't in one place. I've never been robbed while travelling but I've met dozens of people who have, and life is shitty when you're waiting for your new card to come in the mail and you have no money for food.

And finally, the best advice I can give you is to just keep your head on your shoulders. Travelling in Europe is one of the safest places you can be, but situational awareness is still key. Be aware of your surroundings, be careful of who you trust, and trust your instincts.

IT is certainly in great demand, but AFAIK that is mostly the technical part. If you can do this master with no prior knowledge of IT, that part is probably not in this master.

I would say learning German is much more valuable than learning Swedish, which could also be a consideration. If you can learn good German, it may open up more opportunities later on.

On the other hard, in most European countries a bachelor's degree is not really seen as a full degree. That would require you to complete a master's. Even though it is possible to achieve some growth without a degree, it takes more time and if you want/have to switch jobs you're back to square one again.

,confession,-16,,"""The majority of genetic variation is found within populations"" This is one quip I hear a lot and it is also misleading. It depends very specifically on which population you are talking about. There is more genetic variation on the African continent between genetic Halogroups than the rest of the human race, i.e between Europeans and Asian, combined.

In the field of population genetics, it is believed that the distribution of neutral polymorphisms among contemporary humans reflects human demographic history. It has been theorized that humans passed through a population bottleneck before a rapid expansion coinciding with migrations out of Africa leading to an African-Eurasian divergence around 100,000 years ago (ca. 5,000 generations), followed by a European-Asian divergence about 40,000 years ago (ca. 2,000 generations). Richard G. Klein, Nicholas Wade and Spencer Wells, among others, have postulated that modern humans did not leave Africa and successfully colonize the rest of the world until as recently as 60,000 - 50,000 years B.P., pushing back the dates for subsequent population splits as well.

The rapid expansion of a previously small population has two important effects on the distribution of genetic variation. First, the so-called founder effect occurs when founder populations bring only a subset of the genetic variation from their ancestral population. Second, as founders become more geographically separated, the probability that two individuals from different founder populations will mate becomes smaller. The effect of this assortative mating is to reduce gene flow between geographical groups, and to increase the genetic distance between groups. The expansion of humans from Africa affected the distribution of genetic variation in two other ways. First, smaller (founder) populations experience greater genetic drift because of increased fluctuations in neutral polymorphisms. Second, new polymorphisms that arose in one group were less likely to be transmitted to other groups as gene flow was restricted.

Our history as a species also has left genetic signals in regional populations. For example, in addition to having higher levels of genetic diversity, populations in Africa tend to have lower amounts of linkage disequilibrium than do populations outside Africa, partly because of the larger size of human populations in Africa over the course of human history and partly because the number of modern humans who left Africa to colonize the rest of the world appears to have been relatively low.

Humans that migrated out of Africa in particular show great genetic differentiation with the populations that remained. One reason for this may be the interbreeding with indigenous Neanderthal populations that did not occur in Africa. As a result scientist are now saying that 1-4 percent of all European/Asian DNA is in fact determined from the genetic influence of Neanderthals.

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100506-science-neanderthals-humans-mated-interbred-dna-gene/

Humans have relatively low mitochondrial diversity compared to the other great apes, and reports of this are mostly responsible for the belief that humans have low genetic diversity. However, mtDNA makes up just a few millionths of the human genome,[17] and as a single locus, carries little statistical weight.

When allele frequency data are used to estimate genetic diversity within a population, a frequently reported statistic is the average number of alleles per locus (A), but because rare alleles do not contribute much to overall diversity, the most informative statistic is average heterozygosity (H). This is estimated from both the number of alleles and the frequencies at which they occur, and is generally defined as the percentage of individuals in a population that are heterozygous (have two different alleles) at a random locus. In general, genetic diversity is synonymous with mean heterozygosity.

Keeping the preceding caveats in mind, these are qualitative guidelines suggested by Sewall Wright for interpreting FST:

“The range 0 to 0.05 may be considered as indicating little genetic differentiation. The range 0.05 to 0.15 indicates moderate genetic differentiation. The range 0.15 to 0.25 indicates great genetic differentiation. Values of FST above 0.25 indicate very great genetic differentiation.”

Human FST values of 12-15% are typical not just for microsatellites, but also for classical protein polymorphisms,[102] autosomal RFLPs[103] and Alu insertions.[104] Values for mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome are substantially higher.**It would seem, then, that the level of genetic differentiation among human populations is not especially small, and in fact is entirely adequate for race designation, particularly when coupled with consistent morphological differences.**

http://www.goodrumj.com/RFaqHTML.html

Lynn defines races as the genetic clusters or ancestral population groups identified in previous genetic cluster analysis by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues in their 1994 book The History and Geography of Human Genes.

""The differences that exist between the major racial groups are such that races could be called subspecies if we adopted for man a criterion suggested by Mayr (1963) for systematic zoology.""

http://www.workpermit.com/news/2013-03-27/cameron-announces-tough-reforms-to-uk-immigration

OP is not from the UK/EU, so he would need to get a work visa, sponsored by his potential employer. Said employer must advertise the job for 1 month, and show that there's NOBODY from the UK/EU who's able to fulfill that job. After that, they have to do all the necessary paperwork (paying £1500 to be eligible to sponsor, if they have never done so before) and apply for a certificate of sponsorship for him. OP would then apply for the work visa and wait for a few months at least (!) for his application to be processed by the inept UK Borders Agency before he can start work. Provided his application is not rejected.

http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/business-sponsors/points/sponsoringmigrants/employingmigrants/residentlabourmarkettest/

There's a quota of 20000 or so for this (Tier 2) work visa annually, which is often undersubscribed because few employers are willing to go through this trouble of sponsoring a work visa for someone who might or might not be able to actually work in the country. Unless he really has something special to offer. In his case, the chance of him getting the work visa is basically close to nil. The UK is basically almost a closed door to non-EU people, even for those skilled ones in IT.

Now, we know that what England needs is quite the opposite of what Scotland needs. England is swarmed with immigrants, so we have all these moves to bring net migration down. Scotland faces an aging population, and actually needs skilled immigrants to grow its economy. Unfortunately, the same immigration rules apply throughout the UK.

,Bitcoin,8,,"The video and the article obviously don't tell us anything new. This is a quick translation I did of the article (prepare yourself for lots of typos):

**What are Bitcoins?**

Bitcoin is a virtual currency, which you can buy using real money. This sounds special, but it really isn't. If you buy a gift card, or coins at the fair ground, you do pretty much the same. The difference is who supplies the money. Bitcoin isn't the shop keeper or the boss of the fair ground. It isn't a bank or goverment either. It's the participants of Bitcoin itself that manage the currency.

The big advantage is that the currency can be exchanged between the participants without a middle man. And in a period in which people are losing confidence in banks and governments, Bitcoin seems, to some, as an attractive alternative.

**Who is the boss/founder of Bitcoin?**

The Japanese programmer Satoshi Nakamoto has invented Bitcoin, but who he is, or if he even exists, is unclear. He came up with the following concept: not the banks, but the computers of all participants should manage the system and approve transactions. Using these ideas as a starting point, programmers worldwide have begun working on these ideas, and they have created programs to make them happen. These programs are open source, so everyone can contribute.

The system uses heavy cryptography to prevent a too easy way of creating new coins. And: there is a maximum amount of Bitcoins that kan be issued. Thus, scarce is inherent to the system. Some analysts, amongst others analysts from the European Central Bank, have therefore compared Bitcoins to gold.

**Where do the coins come from?**

The coins are calculated. This is called mining. The algorithm used by Bitcoin ensures that when more Bitcoins are created, more computing power is needed to create more. People who help calculate are rewarded by receiving Bitcoins. However, the demand has recently been so high, and the difficulty of the calculations has been so high, that it's now only profitable to mine Bitcoins using special computers. Some are building these on their own and new companies are established every day that sell Bitcoins.

**How do I get Bitcoins?**

There exist numerous markets for the buying and selling of Bitcoins in euro's or dollars. The best known is Mt. Gox in the US. Meanwhile, the trade of Bitcoins has been very active. There´s even a waiting list for newcomers. In The Netherlands, Bitcoisn can be bought at Bitbank or Bitonic.nl [&amp;lt;-- Bitbank actually just links to Bitonic] using iDEAL [&amp;lt;-- the most widely used method of online payment in The Netherlands. You log into your bank account and iDEAL handles the transaction]. The price is less advantageous than in the US. Bitcoins are saved in a digital wallet. It can be stored on your own computer or in the cloud. Read more at Bitcoin.org.

**What's the risk?**

The exchange rate of Bitcoin is very unstable. There is no protection from a digital (stock) exchange crash. Critics argue that there is a gold fever going on, again comparing Bitcoins to gold. Some say that this can only lead to a crash.

In the meantime, more and more governments are asking themselves how to go about dealing with Bitcoin. More regulations are in the vicinity. Finally: hackers. They've already been able to steal hundreds of thousands.",t1_c96ggxq,,False,0,CPnieuws,t5_2s3qj,1431708674,t3_1bg10h,8,c96ggxq,0,1364845028,0,t3_1bg10h,1364881093,,True

* The upper on these is leather, the rest is cork/Birko-flor, etc.

* I can't find this specific color anywhere (these were purchased a few years ago), but I think the leather upper + the Birko-flor will run you somewhere around $100

* Really solid construction. The Birko-flor is worth the extra money, in my opinion. I wore them working at a restaurant/bar, and they were really comfortable to wear for hours on my feet. You can see that there's significant staining from spilling coffee and alcohol on them and then from wearing them to ceramics class (in retrospect I probably should have waterproofed them). I had no problem wearing these for some light hiking/scrambling over rocks either. They break in really nicely to your feet.

See the overall title of this thread... _""My bank accounts got robbed by European Commission. Over 700k is lost... The business is definitely ruined, all Cypriot workers to be fired.""_

Apparently you are claiming that islands in the Mediterranean are not legitimate parts of Europe.

&gt; Your broader point is retarded either way.

I'm still trying to think of a good answer for this one.

&gt; People in Europe are not mad because bankers use fiat currency -- that is your fetish. They are mad about austerity, corruption, etc.

Austerity -- that's where money stolen from some people isn't given to the other people who thought they were going to get the stolen money. Instead, it is given to bankers.

If I was one of the other people hoping to get that stolen money, I would be mad, too.

Of course I would also hate the fact that they are stealing the money out of my bank account in this latest ""haircut"" -- that being the main topic of this thread.

&gt; None of which has anything to do with the fact that gold is a stupid hot topic for young libertarians.

I know that your sort hates gold because it prevents you from stealing their money using inflation, and it prevents you from stealing their money using debt, and it prevents you from stealing their money using haircuts, and it prevents you from stealing their money using austerity, and it prevents you from stealing their money using taxes.

Instead they just own their money, safe and secure, until you come in and directly steal their gold with an executive order, as your type did back in the 30s.

,CrusaderKings,9,byzantium,"It's exactly as TheGuyWithTheEars says. The Game of Thrones book series/tv show is centred around a continent called Westeros but has another continent to its east, Essos, which is essentially equivalent to the European landmass. There's also an equivalent to Africa in the form of the continent of Sothyros.

The GoT mod only features Westeros and fans have been clamouring for the map to be expanded eastwards for as long as the mod's been out. So in a very tongue-in-cheek way, you have this April Fools mod with an all new eastern continent... it's Europe.

The 'new' map is actually pretty interesting. Westeros is placed in such as way that the Stony Steps (an archipelago) in the south east meet the Canary Islands in such a way that they look like one long chain. Iceland is as close to the wildling lands as it is to Norway, so a diligent player definitely has the capacity to expand westward and carve out an Icelandic empire in Westeros. It's made easier by the fact that you can holy war the wildlings, though the game's a bit broken at the moment - both games I've played, the Starks have holy warred for the Wall (held by a Drowned God worshiping Lord Commander at the start).

,unitedkingdom,7,eng-berkshire,"&gt;When you don't spend money you are, in fact, saving them. I can't really see why this is a spin. If you can't understand that ""saving £20bn on healthcare"" isn't the same as ""spending £20bn less on healthcare"" you should go back to school.

I think his point is more that the quality of care diminishes. Of course spending less is saving more no matter what way you look at it, but what is given up in terms of service does not warrant the resources you acquire. I tend to agree with him on this actually.

&gt;I HAVE WRITTEN A BOOK AND I'M 28 SO I HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM MUM AND I'M SMARTER THAN EVERYBODY

That's undue criticism, in my opinion. Whilst Owen Jones does tend to have a pompous air to his writing, I'll give you that, this really isn't the point being made. Holding other media outlets accountable for what he deems a lack of coverage is an important issue he raises, not simply gloating.

&gt;This has been the reality in Norway for a long time. Norway, socialist paradise. I lived there for 26 years and I'm still alive, it must be a miracle. My mom even had private surgery twice and is not even disabled!

Fair enough, I agree with you here. I know nothing about Norway but it seems a fair comparison.

&gt;There are plenty of European countries where the health care system is ""privatised"" to a higher degree than in the UK and they manage quite nicely. I can point you towards the Netherlands, for one.

If you take, admittedly what may be considered quite rudimentary, [comparisons across the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems), the only health systems in nations of comparable size that are considered better, namely Spain and France, have even more comprehensive government spending on healthcare.

Look for flights from Charlotte instead - it's a much bigger airport.  And you could try to fly into say, London, and out of Barcelona, so you wouldn't have to make a full circle.

Many hostels have private rooms now, in case you didn't want to have to use a shared dorm.

And most of Europe has cheap hotels that aren't really much more expensive than hostels when you have 2 people to a room (depending on gender - can your 4 kids share 2 rooms?).  Hostels charge per person, while hotels charge per room.

I would advise that you cut down on travel, and spend more time in each place.  Constant travel is just going to tire you out and your kids out.  I would want a minimum of 3 days per major city.

As far as destinations, London, Paris, and Barcelona would all work fine with kids that age.

But are your kids mature enough to appreciate somewhere like Berlin, where most of the sights are about the Nazis and Communists?  Typical 9 or 11 year olds would not be.

And Amsterdam really doesn't have much that is family friendly, and you would have to keep a close eye on where in the city you take your kids and what they see.

Munich or Salzburg would be okay for kids.  And you might look for places in the Alps where you could all go rafting or hiking, like Interlaken in Switzerland.

You might consider Italy instead of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.  The kids would probably appreciate places like Venice, Pisa, and Rome.

I doubt that the railpass is going to make sense when there are six of you traveling.  This might actually be one situation where renting a car would make sense for at least part of your trip - it would be cheaper than six railpasses.

Anyway.  I was skipping class on the streets with my friends, this girl comes to me and asks: "" Would you like to meet your mom?"" I said no. But she took me to this lady, anyway, that turned out to be my mother.

That year she bought me a ticket to Switzerland and I spent 2 months there. Came back, finished high school, went to college, and 4 years later ( with little to no contact with her again) she asks me to go visit her. The first 2 weeks were hell. She became an evangelic and was all about God and Jesus. I was really pissed of hearing about my bad choices ( tatts, smoking, etctera). And when her husband offered me to buy me a card so I could travel around Europe for a few months by myself, I told him "" Fuck no. I want to go back home"".

I'm not particularly impressed by any book that would attempt to justify any kind of slavery. That the rules of their slavery were different makes zero difference to me.

No. The knowledge was not compiled until hundreds of years later. It isn't unreasonable to think that it took a while for scholarly analysis to find these ""truths"", as that is essentially what the Catholics claim.

&gt;I guess it was more political, but these days there is a massive theological gap between the two, thus it would not be fair to mix up catholics with all christians

It's pathetic that they don't fully support the EITC because it was a GOP creation. Fuck the poor and providing tax credits that are the basis of welfare in Germany and Sweden. You can't admit that the Republicans got a policy right, so lets just push a less effective one.

,Planetside,0,,"Oh you're making me laugh so hard. You obviously dont understand a bit of what i wrote. I never said a thing about the server doing hitdetection. I'm getting a strong feeling that you're not even reading any of my posts properly. There's a huuuuuge difference between ""Collision testing"" and ""registering hits"" on the server. Here i'll outline it for you

Collision testing is when objects are actively being tested for intersections between each other.

Registering hits is when the server registers a hit from the client and deducts health from the player. 

As i've pointed out several times before and something i will point out again. Something you seem to completely ignore. This never happened several months back. This started to happen after GU2. Hit detection was better the first 3 days of release than it was after GU2. And to add on that from one of you'r previous posts. Soltech and Matherson are not even close to comparing to the EU servers simply because we have several times more players and most of our servers have players filled up to the brink. Aka. Queues for every continent on weekends.

And even during early mornings when a continent isn't even half full there's plenty of weird delay going on. 

Also your logic is flawed. 

""BTW, case and point for purely client side hit detection. Ever seen a person walking off into space due to a connection issue on their end or a Sunderer flying off into the air? Ever noticed you can shoot and kill these? If the server was running checks then this wouldn't work.""

You seem to think that the server would completely ignore hitdetection if it's purly server based. That's wrong in so many ways wrong. If a person has lost connection for a couple of seconds or more then the server doesn't go into a fullblown ignoring mode. It keeps the state of the player from the last datapoint for a while until the server deems the player timed out. During that period the player is still mortal. This is standard server behavior with or without client side hit detection.

You'r pretty much the only on in this thread that is trying to justify that it's not happening. Either you're just completely ignoring it in game or you're just a dimwit that has to argue against to make you self feel better.

,history,1,,"One of the key points generally agreed upon is that in the American case, a government was already set up, albeit ultimately under the fist of Gr Br. In France, a complete governmental and socioeconomic overhaul took place. The monarchy was replaced with a series of governments, starting with the National Assembly, the Committee of Public Safety, the National Convention, and Napoleon (loosely - there were actually sub-governments of these main bodies at different times). 

It's also important to note that the American revolution was essentially a colony rebelling for independence, and France was the home country of an empire. Consequences of the French Revolution included revolts in the Caribbean by France's colonies. Slave revolts were numerous. 

The American Revolution was America v. Gr Br and hired mercenaries. France aided America near the end of the war. 

The French Revolution consisted of French revolutionary forces (which included most of the pre-revolutionary army, minus many of the officer corps) versus Britain and coalition of nations attempting to keep Europe monarchical and conservative. Liberal thought was expected to spread like wildfire, and monarchs were quick to put down such ideas.

It's also important to note the XYZ Affair and the fact that America didn't help France in their revolution, because we wanted to remain neutral to save our trade with Great Britain.

According to Marx it was essential that the revolution would occur after capitalism imploded in on itself (like what's happening worldwide now..) - the only countries which have tried 'communism' have missed out of the vital capitalism stages - the stage where the wealth to fund the initial stages of the revolution.

All so called 'communist' countries i.e Russia, China, etc have gone directly from a feudal system -&gt; communist (perhaps why the soviet system became the dictatorships they did)

I think the reason 'the majority' of Americans are far worse off than 'the majority' of Europeans is their insane fear of communism.

Furthermore, if your opponent is a noob and decides to Crunch your Virizion then you get a free chance to sweep right there and its game over. As a result, your team looks solid hopefully you take these guys to VGC sometime. If you want a challenge go up against Japanese VGCers in Japan and see how their judgments are different from North America's or Europe.

3 - Need some context here.  I assume you're talking about Lehi's travels after leaving Jerusalem?  If so, I'd ask you two questions.  1) How could Nephi break a steel bow [or how was this bow used to hunt?], 2) how did steel exist several centuries before it's discovery in this region, and 3) how did Nephi smelt ore, build tools, and then build a boat capable of oceanic travel in less than a year?  Check my post history for a modern example of someone with experience, power tools, and working full time to do it by hand.  (Several years and counting).    And don't get me started on the Jaradite barges - Fresh water, tossing animals around, honey bees surviving in an enclosed and turbulent barge for a year!? 

4 - [**Grafting**](http://www.ilovepecans.org/history.html) was a known technique in the southern USA as early as the mid to late 1700's.   Aside from Joseph and his family being farmers, remember that [the grafting analogy was not unique to the Book of Mormon](http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Topical.show/RTD/cgg/ID/1527/Grafting-Branches-Analogy.htm).   Now sum up all of the considerations such as Joseph's frequent religious excursions, his participation in a religious debate club, his farming experience, and his *possible* inclusion of other's works (Spauding, Cowdrey, Rigdon).  

Having said that, this is one of the stronger arguments in favor of the Book of Mormon.  It's not enough on it's own,  nor is it proof of authenticity; however, I would be remiss not to give it credit.  

5 - **Stylometry** is essentially statistical fortune telling.   It's highly complicated, no one outside of a PHD statistician (or perhaps strong Master's students) who have specifically studied this line of analysis will fully understand the process.   The results of multiple tests have been wildly different in many areas.  

[This does a pretty good job at further explaining the flaws](http://exmormon.org/phorum/read.php?2,266508,266508).  Also note the other comments.  The analysis can be used to paint Rigdon as the author of 35 of the federalist papers (he wasn't even born yet), and the claims as far back as the 1980's have yet to be published in a non-apologetic, peer-reviewed journal.

,MensRights,1,,"yes that is the one I was talking about. They also asked questions in other countries.
 I wish somebody would do a study where they measured things like gender hostility against the rate or violence more generally, I suspect that it is may be causal or correlated. 
  
I've been trying to look for sociological victim studies from Japan and the one in that article is the closest I got.
I would like to see one from Italy for example where as far as I can see there is more of a 'rape culture' than in the us, sketchy evidence I've seen has Italy has Italy within the European average though.

I am not sure that jokes and such really have all that much to do with the rate of violence, humour can be used to normalise things but it can also be a response to violence it, or a way of resolving tension built up from ignoring it.

 I can accept that the shame around sex and the idea that women who have a lot of sex, or who get drunk or wear revealing clothing are ""asking for it"" can make things harder for victims, being treated terribly by the police but I can't see how these attitudes would cause rape if in countries where they are more prevalent there is less rape. So Im stuck with the things that cause rape being some complex interaction between the hostility between genders, the rate of violence(perhaps creating more or less rapists through early childhood experiences), and other factors that I haven't thought about. 

 As far as I can tell though, a lot of rape victims don't think that what was done was a crime, the same as a large number of assault victims who never go to the police for the same reason. 


A lot of current feminist thinking on rape culture seems to be based on a (social norms)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norms_approach] approach, the 'don't rape anyone' posters seem to be designed in the same way that don't drink too much ones are.

,politics,6,,"Sweden, for one, is a father-knows-best communism-done-""right"" state where the status quo is rarely questioned in a serious manner, mostly full of cold, taciturn people who are but nearly completly culturally insular from the rest of the world. The tallest trees are cut down and the brightest stars are encouraged to luster to meet the realm of the ""lagom är bra"" social middle. For all their education, most of it is vocational and those of the arts is watered down by the lack of diversity in their nation. Sure, people like ""scandinavian"" things for the particular fashion in which they are designed, one wonders how much of this can be attributed to the fact that Sweden has a world-class propaganda machine. To the average swede, going to a place like the UK or America is a bit like visiting a third-world country. Swedes maintain the party line by continually acting and trying to convince everyone else that it is the best. 

They say they are liberal, and sure they are, with their modern views on things like gender and homosexual equality, but when the conversation comes to things like marijuana or allowing grocery stores/regular shops to sell alcohol, the consensus is that ""We need to regulate these things heavily to save us from ourselves"". The housing situation, where the rental market is not a free market, and people can spend years in a queueing system reminiscent of soviet times, waiting simply to get a place to live, or perhaps ""only"" 6 months if they are willing to live in an area that Swedish people are basically too afraid to live in. If anyone is considering getting a job or contract in Sweden, make sure to start queueing for a place to sleep at the end of the day.

To consider the morality of the people is not complete without considering their investment in the morality of the elected government, which is treated as their big friendly brother, looking out for everyone... whether they want it or not. If you want to instantly connect with a bunch of Swedes as a foreigner, just extol the virtues of the system. It puts them at ease with that slight nagging feeling at the back of their mind working against what they've spent years since the first went to school being told is necessary. But you'll have to work harder if you're black or eastern european or such, because there's a deep streak of malignant racism that runs at the core of a lot of Swedes, suppressed from an early age because speech on these issues is almost a complete taboo... Most of them don't come across as such just because they've become masters of conforming to the consensual norm. If you ever get them to let their guard down, you'll hear a lot of stuff that is simply over the line if uttered in other nations. Even the most free-minded of these people will still fall prey to this warped view of the world once you get to know them. It's not their fault though, it's what they've been educated to think.

There is a high rate of depression, which is no doubt helped by the extremely long, cold winters and narrow, limited culture... thanks to the strict regulations and general lack of interest. People don't go out on the weekdays, and on the weekends the bars and pubs are filled almost completely with younger folks, of which these places are often the exclusive domains. Sure, the women are pretty, as there's a big emphasis on healthy eating and gyms which is great. However the nightlife is stunted as the crowds you will see are usually self-selected for glamour over simply going out to have a good time, resulting in some of the worst bouncers i've ever seen in my travels (who, by the way, have equivalent powers to police, are ubiquitous, and are well-known for the kind of liberties they take with these powers) and a whole place full of airheads.

The people are generally polite, but distant. There's a strong touch of xenophobia (unless you're a native English speaker, in which case you are considered more of a 'guest' than an immigrant). There's a feedback effect where all the listed ideals are put forth again in parliament as newer members join the ranks and keep up the same non-discussions. It is no wonder that we see Sveriges Democraten, the social democrats, rising to power once more even though it is widely considered to be a rather racist, conversative party. The only true way they can exercise their power to speak out is not amongst their articles and speakers in events, magazines, newspapers and television... but by anonymous ballot.

Some of the worst folks hang around Stureplan, Stockholm. They're called the 'brats' and not only are they the spawn of a sick culture, but the culture itself tends to their whims, feeding back on itself and making the nightlife even more in-bred in one of the most modern yet undeniably least cosmopolitan places i've seen.

Sweden also has an extremely high rate of divorce, also a disproportionately large amount of single parents. So many Swedish males go to Thailand to get their 'fix' and actually take wives and long-term girlfriends there. Check out the tsunami documentaries, most of the footage is from the nordic folks, you can tell because you can hear the speaker commenting behind the camera.

In America, though it's so big it's hard to generalise, the culture is far more diverse, so a lot of things come out of it both good and bad. In general though there is a lot more liberties and free speech... again, both good and bad but that's the price, right?

1.
&gt; Mr Rumsfeld was a non-executive director of ABB, a European engineering giant based in Zurich, when it won a $200m (£125m) contract to provide the design and key components for the reactors.  The current defence secretary sat on the board from 1990 to 2001, earning $190,000 a year. He left to join the Bush administration. The reactor deal was part of President Bill Clinton's policy of persuading the North Korean regime to positively engage with the west.

It was Clinton's policy of engagement that allowed Western companies to work in the North.  Engagement may have been good at the time, but the North has shown its true colors in the recent past.

And may I interest you in another source: http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Rumsfeld_was_on_ABB_board_during_deal_with_North_Korea.html?cid=3176922

&gt; Wolfram Eberhardt, a spokesman for ABB, told swissinfo that Rumsfeld ""was at nearly all the board meetings"" during his decade-long involvement with the company.  However, he declined to indicate whether Rumsfeld was made aware of the nuclear contract with North Korea.  “This is a good question, but I couldn’t comment on that because we never disclose the protocols of the board meetings,” Eberhardt said.  “Maybe this was a discussion point of the board, maybe not.”The ABB contract was a consequence of a 1994 deal between the US and Pyongyang to allow construction of two reactors in exchange for a freeze on the North’s nuclear weapons programme.

Regardless if Rumsfeld had knowledge of ABB building a nuclear reactor for NK, all points back to Clinton's policy of engagement and the 1994 deal.

2.
&gt; The US Government has announced that it will release $95m to North Korea as part of an agreement to replace the Stalinist country's own nuclear programme, which the US suspected was being misused.
Under the 1994 Agreed Framework an international consortium is building two proliferation-proof nuclear reactors and providing fuel oil for North Korea while the reactors are being built.

A proliferation proof nuclear reactor contributes little toward nuclear weapon knowhow.  Do a little bit more research.  Just because you have a nuclear reactor doesn't mean you have the means to build and deploy nuclear weapons.  That's where AQ Khan may have come in...

Nasa is planning a $2.6 billion robotic mission to catch an asteroid in a giant bag and tow it to the Moon as part of a long-term programme that could one day lead to the permanent settlement of humans in space.


The US space agency has included $100 million in its 2014 budget request, due to be announced next week, to start planning the project.


The mission, which is said to have found favour with the White House, would aim to snare a 500-ton asteroid using an unmanned spacecraft, taking four years to get there, 90 days to wrangle the rock and anything between two and six years to haul it into a high orbit around the Moon. There, astronauts could study it, take samples, reap scientific data and test processes for extracting water and metals. Ultimately, scientists hope that the mission will enable asteroids to be mined for the materials necessary to lay the infrastructure for living long-term off Earth.


It would “provide a new capability for human exploration not seen since Apollo. It would be mankind’s first attempt at modifying the heavens to enable the permanent settlement of humans in space,” concluded a feasibility report, produced for the Keck Institute for Space Studies at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), which operates Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.


A 500-ton asteroid of the kind sought may contain up to 100 tons of water, 100 tons of carbon-rich compounds, 90 tons of metals such as iron, nickel and cobalt, and 200 tons of silicates. As close as it sounds to science fiction — or even an April Fool’s joke — the plan has a serious basis and has received input from respected figures. They include experts from Nasa, the European Space Agency, the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, Caltech, the US Naval Postgraduate School, the University of Arizona, the Planetary Society and former astronauts.


The idea of exploiting natural resources from asteroids is not new but it is only now that the necessary technologies for making it a reality are within reach. The spacecraft would launch on an Atlas V rocket then use the Moon’s gravity field to slingshot itself deeper into space en route to its target — a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA), a rock that travels anywhere within 121 million miles (195 million km) of the Sun.


The mission would target an asteroid about seven metres wide and deploy a large bag-like device into which it would swallow the rock. “Multiple ‘draw strings’ would cinch close the opening of the bag,” the feasibility report says. “There would be some impact as the asteroid is captured — although, since the asteroid would be much more massive than the spacecraft, it is perhaps better to think of this as the asteroid capturing the spacecraft.”


President Obama’s declared goal of sending people to an NEA by 2025 is considered overambitious at present funding levels. Sending a robot to fetch one instead, then parking it closer to Earth for crews to visit, would be simpler, cheaper and safer. The mission would also be an important test of technologies that could be used to protect Earth from asteroids such as the one that exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in February.


Major-General Charles Bolden, the head of Nasa, has admitted that the world is at present powerless to defend against such incidents. Asked at a congressional hearing last month what Nasa would do if it discovered an asteroid on a collision course with Earth and just three weeks to do something about it, he replied: “Pray.”


The revelation that Nasa is to seek funding to get started on the early planning of an asteroid retrieval mission comes three months after General Bolden made a cryptic comment to a National Research Council committee on human space flight that hinted at the news. “When the president announced that an asteroid woud be the next destination for Nasa’s human spaceflight programme, he did not say Nasa had to fly all the way to an asteroid,” he said. “What matters is the ability to put humans with an asteroid.”",t1_c96o7om,,False,0,Wicked_Inygma,t5_2qh87,1431705014,t1_c96nrgr,9,c96o7om,0,1364864423,0,t3_1bgz9x,False,,True

**3** Americans are [the most generous people in the world](http://www.cafonline.org/pdf/International%20Comparisons%20of%20Charitable%20Giving.pdf), giving over twice as much of their income to charity as the next most generous nation.

**4** Americans have the [highest rate of secondary education completion](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/high-school-graduation-rate.aspx) out of developed countries:

**5** The US [has the highest education attainment out of any major industrialized nation](http://www.educationalpolicy.org/pdf/Global2005.pdf). (pg 42)

**6** The US dominates in academic performance. So not only does the US get more of its population into higher education, but the education we receive is the best in the world, and results in vastly superior academic performance in all broad subject fields when ranked among world universities.

1. The majority of the younger generation lack cooking skills.  Most people do not even know the basics like how to chop an onion because it was eliminated from school decades ago and housewifery is much lower in American than in Asia.  If you don't know how to cook, then buying things in a box makes a lot more sense.

1. There are much lower numbers of fresh markets in the US compared to Asia or Europe.  Most people buy their food from supermarkets.  In Asia, there is far less regulation and standards for things like health safety which make setting up markets easier and quicker.
1. The minimum wages are far lower in Asia compared to the US.  Its not uncommon for a middle class Asian family to have a servant who can spend their day buying and cooking all the food.  It also means food is cheaper cause farmers can be paid less.  Middle class people in the US don't have servants because the minimum wage makes it prohibitavely expensive.

1. The number of women working (even after birth) is far higher in the USA than Asia.  A working woman without a servant has little time and will buy a box of food rather than making it from scratch.

I think we'll win both those games (I'm clearly biased). Sidenote: we've beaten Fulham on penalties in the League cup and drawn every other game while Jol has been in charge. 

I think we can win at Liverpool and I see us winning at Swansea if they remain in their current slump, though there's every chance they'll pick themselves up over the next few games. United are chasing the record amount of points, apart from that they've got nothing to really play for, if they're unable to get 95 points when they play Chelsea I think we'll win, if not I see us losing.

Cahill's out for roughly two weeks, so he'll probably miss 5 games. I'm not sure about Cole.

,explainlikeimfive,4,,"&gt;we might have never recovered

We would just be a different looking country.  We wouldn't spend so much on the military, we wouldn't have gotten involved in Korea, Vietnam, and the CIA would not have done so much meddling.  We might not have built the Interstate System or gone to the moon.  We might not have nuclear weapons or nuclear power plants, or just not as many as we now have.

We might look more like Brazil, China, or Denmark.  We could be more like a Fascist state (because of the possible success of Nazi Germany) or more isolationist with a better social safety net and fewer large corporations.

My take on it is in the short term social change would have been slower and the economy would have grown slower, too.  The automobile would have remained a toy for the rich.  Most suburban sprawl would never have been built.  Public transport would have been much better, and most city people living in apartments.

In the long term (if there was no war) the world would be a lot more divided into spheres of influence.  Britain, France, and Japan still have their empires.  Europe is controlled mostly by Germany.  Asia is controlled by Japan.  Russia is still the USSR and has it's traditional influence among its neighbors.  America perhaps picks up a few new states in Central America, South American, and the Caribbean... growing to maybe 65 states.  The Monroe Doctrine is the new Manifest Destiny.

So, long story short, recovery is a relative term, we'd be poorer materially, but perhaps better off structurally and socially.",t1_c96oykn,,False,0,absoluteskeptic,t5_2sokd,1431704661,t1_c96fenf,4,c96oykn,0,1364866739,0,t3_1bevul,False,,True

,conspiracy,1,,"This whole ""divide and conquer"" meme is bullshit. We have been told for decades, by the elite, that we must allow everyone into America, even if they are uneducated, or can't speak English, or are a different color and a different religion.

The ruling class of wealthy Jews who own the media and the political process and the banks told us that. They are still telling us that, and working to insure that it keeps happening.

White people recognizing the uniqueness and unique value of their white European heritage is in *response* to this brainwashing by the elite, a reaction against the brainwashing. Whites are starting to fight back, to reclaim their history and their heritage, to value once again their Christian religious roots, which are the moral foundation for Western civilization.

Every other ethnic and racial group has had their pride days and special affirmative action advantages and pride organizations and anti-hate organizations for decades. Only whites have been denied these things. When a white-pride group tries to hold a parade, they get pelted with garbage and threatened with beatings and death.

Now it is changing, and the elite don't like it. So they start up this whole ""divide and conquer"" meme, in the hope of turning whites away from their own people, their own religion, their own heritage as a people.

Now that whites are starting to recognize the value of their own heritage, suddenly we are hearing that it is the evil elite who want to divide us along racial lines. It's a reverse psychology strategy. The elite hope to turn whites away from an appreciation of the value of their own race by making them think that racial division is a plot by the elite.",t1_c96pffx,,False,0,tttt0tttt,t5_2qh4r,1431704441,t3_1bgdpa,1,c96pffx,0,1364868175,0,t3_1bgdpa,False,,True
