c6fqtn3,0,1430031301,"I agree with you with all points but one (or three, depending how you look at it):

* in all languages I know (like English ""to be""), copula is a verb (however this is anecdotal and thus not saying much),
* です is generally agreed upon to be a verb, AFAIK, and
* there is disagreement on whether だ・です is a copula or not.

I might tentatively agree with you if you complained about だ, as it really has no verbal morphology. It acts as an assertion particle for nominal predicates, and has its own て-form. です, however, is (probably) a contraction from であります or でございます (I forget which), and conjugates as if it was a form of である, which itself is composed of the て-form of だ and an existence verb (and ある・ござる most assuredly is a verb, by any standard). And just as だ has the semantics of an assertion particle (and is thus seen as unseemly or too forceful  for women's usage), です can be seen as a politeness verb, or polite assertion verb, which is a bit difficult to grasp coming from European languages - ""a verb with no action or state?!? huh?!?"". (It can even stand alone, not coupling anything, meaning roughly ""that's about it"" or ""well, that's what I think"", can't teally translate it properly. It can even be tacked onto plain verbs when the speaker forgot to polite-ify them, although prescriptive grammars would most likely condemn the practice.) And given how neither is actually required in Japanese leads one to view the proposition that Japanese is a no-copula language like Russian as not entirely unreasonable.

The LDS genealogy page is a goldmine often. (https://familysearch.org/)

Google the names &amp; dates of your relatives. I  have found a lot of information about ancestors that way (including that one was one of the salem witches! another was BFFs with Daniel Boone)... as well as finding lines. Turns out i share an ancestor with George Bush and i found a link to -his- genealogy which had been traced ALL the way back to 80 AD (through nobility and royalty through Europe to Charlemagne and back).

Most counties in the states have a historical page that has some ancestry records.
There are a lot of forums online that you'll find when you search for ancestors names. if you want to keep track of your stuff online without using ancestry, you could try tribalpages.com. That was the first site i ever hosted my tree on.

I'd also print out any records that you get and make a binder. I also found worksheet pages that i fill out for each file i find. I use the Unpuzzling Your Past workbook pages but it looks like it might be out of print now.

If you live near where your ancestors did, also be prepared to go to libraries and government buildings to search through records.

Have you seen the UK or US version of ""Who Do You Think You Are"" or PBS's Tracing Your Roots? (or was it finding?) I think the US ones can be found on hulu or the pbs.org site, they might give you good ideas and inspiration.

Research genealogy in general as well. Spelling was not set in stone back in the day, nicknames that seem totally unrelated (but were normal for) the birth names were used on official documents, old timey handwriting is hard to follow and women were poorly documented, so there is definitely a learning curve.

c6frnu6,0,1430031766,"It's worth keeping in mind that the concept of a state as a ""world power"" in the first place isn't sensible until around the 16th century when sailing ships first enabled a truly global transport and communication network.  Prior to then, there were plenty of tremendously powerful empires which were still relatively contained just because of the limits of overland transport (Egypt or Rome) or because they never made the *economics* of long-distance sail work, despite having the technology (China).  Even after the Europeans figured out sailing around the world, Spain and Portugal just *barely* managed to eke out profitable  empires from that ability.  The British were really the first society to develop the complicated *trading* networks which served to sustain and drive the expansion of global empire.

So it's really just before industrialization starts to take hold that history sees its first true ""world power"" in the British Empire.  At that point in time, about the only African state within spitting distance of being a great power was Egypt, which was still under the thumb of the Ottoman Empire, with most of its wealth being either extracted for the benefit of other powers, or being destroyed in all kinds of petty internal conflicts.  South across the Sahara were all kinds of less-developed states which aren't much competition for the Europeans, but aren't nearly so far behind the technology curve or ridden by incompetence and corruption as modern sub-Saharan African states.  Their politics were roughly on-par with their contemporaries in southeast Asia, maybe slightly more proto-feudal and tribal since they didn't have the experience of being dominated by the meritocratic traditions of China.  They were also significantly less populated, because the land and climate aren't all that favorable to the agriculture needed to sustain really dense populations (and the *Guns, Germs, and Steel* book by Jared Diamond that many have recommended here is a great exploration of that situation).  On the other hand the African states, particularly along the coast, were much *richer* than their Asian counterparts, at least on a per-capita basis, with a much longer and more developed commercial tradition.  East Africa had already been an integrated part of the Indian Ocean economy for centuries, with most trade carried by Arab sailors.

Once the Europeans started plying the west coast of Africa, the societies there took advantage rather quickly.  The slave trade actually enriched a lot of the coastal tribes, and they traded for muskets in particular that enabled them to dominate their peers further in the interior, whom they'd raid for slaves.  Unfortunately, from the perspective of developing a ""world power"" state, this kind of economy was fairly limiting.  The Africans didn't control the *trade*, which was carried on European ships, and only had one commodity to offer, and it was valuable enough to preclude investment and development of the kind of diversified economy which is the foundation for most powerful states.  That kind of phenomenon is closely related to the economic problem called [Dutch Disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease), and which still afflicts a lot of single-commodity economies in Africa (and elsewhere) today.

Actually, something similar developed after the end of the Atlantic slave trade but before the European ""scramble for Africa"" really got underway to conquer the continent.  In the middle of the 19th century, [palm oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_oil#History) was in high demand as an industrial lubricant for the machines building the industrial revolution in Europe, particularly Britain.  This was before the technology to really exploit synthetic petroleum oils had been developed to enable that replacement.  The result was that West African states which produced palm oil became *fantastically* wealthy, with gold reserves and weapons arsenals that put them on similar footings as European nations.  But again, that wealth was based on a single export, not really conducive to the development of a strong economy or prosperous and skilled *population*.  When the value of palm oil declined, and the big European powers decided they needed direct political control of Africa in the late 19th century, they steamrolled most of the states there with very little effort.

In the colonial era, some African *colonies* actually became fairly powerful.  South Africa is probably the poster child for any African state with ambitions of achieving world-class economic success and political influence.  In WW1 the colony conquered about a third of Southern Africa with very little support from Britain, just relying on its own means.  German East Africa (now Tanzania) also did very well, with a very productive and self-sufficient economy, though its relatively tiny population put it a long way from the potential South Africa could get just from sheer size.  In both those cases and others, though, the colonies' success was basically imposed upon the aboriginal populations by European administrators or colonists and their descendants, often employing extreme brutality to enforce their own political programs.

Since decolonization and democratization, politics has been the main thing holding back most African states.  Their governing institutions tend to be corrupt and incompetent, and the same goes for their leaders, who also often rely on military means to secure their rule, rather than genuine popular legitimacy.  Of course, it's only been a few generations since independence for most of those countries, so it's fair to say that their countries are still feeling their way into a fit between the traditions they're most comfortable with and the behaviors that enable successful states.  Once they do find their heads, some of them have potential for greatness even on the world stage.  East Africa is still probably too sparsely populated to play a big international role politically, but they're still sitting on huge economic potential just by being on the Indian Ocean rim.  South Africa has the economic diversity, institutions, and population to make it as a major player if they could just sort out their politics.  West Africa and the Congo Basin have *enormous* potential in resources and population, and not a bad situation for trade, but they're horrendously riven by conflicts among and within states, awful leadership, and a lack of both physical and institutional infrastructure.  The Sahara regions are probably never going to be of much importance on the world stage (not even al-Qaeda openly running half the country is enough to get the rich world to pay much attention to Mali).  Most of North Africa is in roughly the same position as the East coast, there's just not enough people matter, though their petroleum will buy them plenty of attention for some decades to come.  Egypt, lastly, still has *massive* potential for wealth and influence, but it's been held back by self-inflicted.  If the pace of political reform there keeps up, and it doesn't move in similarly crippling directions, Egypt could very quickly regain its leadership of the Arab sphere, and from there parlay its role into serious influence on the world stage.

&gt;What I really meant was Stalin's Russia. I'd say the article is sympathetic towards the Russian people but also in it's mentions of Stalin seems to be picking and choosing what he mentions.

I understand that Stalin was an important figurehead and influential leader, but I as a rule usually try to question the whole ""great man"" idea of history when he's brought up. I think blaming everything negative (or positive, for that matter) on Stalin is a good way to write off these things as products of one person instead of learning lessons of history, analyzing the material conditions, social relations, etc etc which would allow us to actually learn some lessons from failures and successes of past attempts at socialism.

&gt;Yes it was a treaty of non-aggression, you are right, but that treaty included provisions of how to divide up Eastern Europe and Finland between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Part of the reason for the pact was for the Soviet Union to protect itself but it also was a pact which was planning for aggressive occupation of other countries. It isn't as cut and dry as the Soviet Union being a lone white knight fighting back the evil fascist forces, only treating with Germany for it's own protection and it would be naive to believe anything else. I believe the more aggressive elements of the treaty were kept secret at the time.

As far as I know it did include a provisions on how to ""divide up"" these places, specifically into ""spheres of influence"" but I don't think it was as collaborative as you imply. It's not like they performed the attacks in unison, the USSR occupied Poland weeks later etc. Poland was kind of meant to be a buffer as far as I understand it and it's also important to acknowledge the history between Germany, the USSR (and Russian Empire beforehand), and ""Poland"", during WWI, the Revolution, The Russian civil war/foreign invasion, the Polish-Soviet War etc.  It also really is important to acknowledge how the USSR was isolated by the West, with a growing Nazi threat on it's border, when analyzing their actions. 

&gt;Yes you are right that I was wrong but you are also wrong yourself, Nazi Germany forced Czechoslovakia to cede various parts of territory to Germany, Poland and Hungary. That played into Hitler's plan of eastern expansion for obvious reasons and he occupied what remained of Czechoslovakia after the Anschluss but before the invasion of Poland I think. 

The Nazi's forced the Czechs to cede those territories, but the Western powers also [essentially forced the Czechs to capitulate to the Germans in the first place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia#The_Munich_Agreement), or at least didn't really care what the Czechs thought. It's not as though Poland and Hungary protested and demanded they be sovereign states or something either.

I still think it's fair, overall, to say that the Western Powers fear of the communists was a major factor in leading them to appease Hitler again and again, which was itself a major factor in getting them ready to invade Europe. 

If you have some time give the Michael Parenti lecture I linked to a chance, I'd love to hear what you have to say about it. 

&gt;You seem a bit paranoid, I am not someone who is lazy in making up my opinion on history and politics and any errors in what I've said come from failing in my memory (I'm writing from my phone) not my reasoning. 

Well, I just see the most ignorant tripe posted about the Soviets, often unquestioned, all the time on reddit and in real-life situations. Sorry if that led me to be less philosophically generous than I should've been. 


&gt;I read extensively and I'm well aware of the importance of bearing bias in mind when studying history and current events. Just because one piece of media is anti-communist it doesn't mean that other pro-communist media is any better for employing the same tactics.

I agree, but I don't think there is such a thing as ""pure, unbiased history"" either. A lot of people want to think that historians are just communicators of fact who are free of bias themselves, but *everyone*, conscious of it or not, operates under an ideology. Some are worse than others though and I think that the current anti-communist writing (and I mean published books, in some cases peer reviewed) can get away with distortions, inconsistencies, lies etc far easier than a pro-communist one just because their particular bias is the dominant one. I support people like Howard Zinn and Michael Parenti that are open about their political beliefs and try to provide a counter-narrative. In many/most cases these people can't be attacked for lies or falsities but they are heavily criticized for their ""bias"" or ""tone"", while their counterparts on the ""other side"" seem to receive little chastisement for often larger misrepresentations. As a person in the UK and history student I imagine you're familiar with Eric Hobsbawm too, who is a brilliant Marxist historian I'm just starting to get into. It seems even right-wing historians seem to have trouble finding fault with him, beyond personal criticisms. 

Anyway, I don't think it's possible to escape bias, but one can certainly make a very good effort and through counterposed positions a much better understanding of something can develop.

I find it funny that people tend to believe that dying from a nuke blast is somehow worse than other means just because it was the US who used nukes. It should be pointed out that way, way more civilians were killed with conventional weapons in WWII than the combined death toll of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

Brits killed more Germans in firebombings. The Soviets pretty much raped and murdered their whole way through eastern Europe. They killed millions upon millions, including many of their own people.

And let's not forget about the holocaust itself.

What I find funny is that in many circles people act as if using nukes in WWII was the worst thing about the war. Anti-US bias is a big motivation for that absurd position. 

The Japanese themselves don't have the right to be even slightly miffed as a nation considering the wide spread atrocities they committed throughout the Asia-Pacific region. And if they (or the Germans) had attained nukes during WWII they would have used them with far less restraint than the US did.

There was a time at the end of WWII at which time the US could have nuked anyone with impunity. The US could have turned on the Soviets in the blink of an eye and there would never have been a Cold War because the Soviet union would a collection of smoking holes. Could you imagine the Soviets or anyone else using restraint like that? I don't think so.  

Yes, killing civilians is bad but in the context of WWII the US can't be guilted for using nukes, especially because it made an invasion of mainland Japan unnecessary, an invasion that would have killed MILLIONS instead of ~200,000, and most of those deaths would have been civilians, many of whom would have been armed and become part of the Japanese Volunteer Fighting Corps.

It's a different culture in European countries, militaries are smaller. Some concerns are the same, so it makes sense to work together on this. My experience with the military never indicated anything close to what you were describing.

If you want people to get tested, just tell people to get tested. Don't throw around percentages you're not even sure of. Again a cultural thing, but here the men and women get tested extremely regularly, there wouldn't even be a real need to point this out. I didn't even mention this, because you're right, it is USmilitarySO, so this is just on a side note.

The last thing is that you weren't respectful. The topic didn't touch a nerve with me, because cheating isn't something I think too much about within a loving and healthy relationship (as neither of our caring friends do for us). Yes, having time apart can be sexually frustrating, but it's not the kind of sexual frustration that would be easily taken care of with just fucking your buddy from camp. 
What bothers me (and I'm repeating myself here) is how you went about mentioning this. The title of your post: Word of warning for all for all?! Really, for all needed to be doubled? And then going on to talk about how almost every guy (95%) cheats and how it doesn't matter that they are in a relationship, because everyone is horny and fit? You imply so many things here that are so disrespectful. You just pointed out to a group of people who have SO out there right now, that whatever loving thing they do to help out doesn't matter, because their SO is probably cheating anyway. You just made this judgement while not even being in this situation anymore and probably having never gone through this on the home side of it. As I said, if you want to tell people to get tested, tell them that, no need for the whole ""they are horny all the time"". That just makes you sound like a dick and not like someone who really cares, as you claim you do.
  
Also, most people experience that after a while of not having sex, you physically crave it less and for some people there even is a transition period at first when you're back home before sex is like it used to be. It's childish to think that you don't have sex and then for months at a time run around wanting to fuck so badly, you forget about your relationships.

Also, seriously, go check with your wife or girlfriend and ask how she would have felt about someone reminding her that you're probably fucking someone else. Not telling her that she should be smart and have you tested, but someone telling her that 95 out of 100 men are cheating on their partner and you just might be one of them.

1. Avoid Europe unless you're handy or loaded. (And I say this while owning an older Audi, being neither of the previously mentioned... it can be tough!)
2. Don't buy from a dealer. You'll be paying far more for a car that, in a few years, you could very well be upside down in.
3. If you find a car, make it conditional that you will have to take it to a mechanic before you purchase. If they seller isn't cool with that, walk away. There maybe be something they're hiding.
4. Carfax is cheap. Have one done.
5. Check insurance rates before you buy.
6. Search Craigslist constantly.
7. If it seems too good to be true, it is.
8. Buy with your head and bring a friend along to keep you objective. It's easy to get into buying mode and overlook serious issues.
9. Ask for a service history and the paperwork to prove it's been maintained.
10. Don't get a loan unless you absolutely have to.
11. That being said, sometimes it's better to spend a little more if you're able to buy a car in better condition with a service history.

If you're looking for a decent car, you really can't go wrong with a Honda. I've had two and they're fantastic cars. Easy to work on, great gas mileage, relatively cheap parts, hold their value and run forever. 

I'm not an American car guy at all, but to each their own, because they don't hold their values well.

- I originally studied to work in the games industry, and took an english teaching job while I intended to look for a job here.  
- I learned Japanese before coming here on an exchange program.  
- I eventually figured that the games industry is fucked up and I don't want to work in it, but a friend invited me to apply at her company. Worked out well, and I've switched jobs since, working in research now, and it's awesome.  
- I got an offer for another good job back in europe, but frankly, I feel safer, both physically(as in low crime) and financially(the eurozone is fucked, and american employment and immigration laws scare me) here. I have no particular attachment here, but no good reason to leave either. Plus I have a good job.  
- 70% of the landmass here is mountains. There is great mountaineering, rock climbing and skiing/snowboarding within reasonable distance. This is a really beautiful country to live in if you enjoy the outdoors(though the summers are too hot).  
- Honestly, I have my reservations about *some* of the people teaching english here, who don't take their job seriously and are just here to party. , I honestly wish the bad ones would just piss off, because they propagate poor stereotypes with their behavior and are generally douchebags. However most of the other foreign people I have met are good people, tend to be openminded, and try to do their job well, even if that is ""just"" teaching English. Maybe it's just the people I hang with, but a surprisingly large number of people are in fact not even in the english teaching gig, being sent out by their employers, or working in research at universities, or in the IT sector.

Back in late June, a Solar Tornado(we'll call them STs from now on.) was discovered on the surface of the Sun. It was about the size of continental Europe. 

What they believe happens is this: The STs are caused by magnetic fields on the Suns surface. They cause hot hydrogen to on the surface to form these STs, and after a certain point in its life time, the magnetic field snaps back to its original position. This causes all sorts of friction within the tornado, which causes thermal energy to be exchanged. The most energetic particles escape out, into the Corona, giving it its' distinctly high heat.

Replicants are just genetically engineered humans, designed for space combat and military campaigns off planet. They have superior stength, agility, andendurance sure, bu they are still made of flesh and blood. Notice that Pris' prunary function is a pleasure unit under an army subsidiary. I.e. she is an war bride. Other than these small differences Replicants are still essentially human. The red eyes that define replicancy dont even truly define replicant, as Roy Batty and Leon hit up an artificial eye creator on earth-- where replicants are banned anyway-- meaning that humans could likely use these artificial eyes as organ replacements (one of the theoretical benefits to cloning).  The bilogist himself even me ntions that he likely created the nexus six eyes. The one drawback to having an artificial eye is the red glare that appears in certain lighting, however this appears to be shared for all artificial creatures, like the owl.

Everyone always stresses over whether or not Deckard is a replicant, because then the movie shifts your perspective of Deckard as a hero. Though there is that one shot where one of Deckard's eyes appears red, this could have easily just been a transplant of some sort, as replicants do tend to go for the eyes in combat (See Leon fighting Deckard, Roy gouging out his creators eyes in the European cut) . If anything it is Roy we should be looking at. Roy is über-Aryan and represents the intellectual slave trying to find freedom in Blade Runner's society. Though Roy demonstrates his animalistic side when hunting Deckard in the climax of the film, this is more of a minstrel show for Roy. Replicants are genetically engineered to have stronger physical capabilities and with it shorter lifespans because they have to endure the harsher environements of deep space combat. The scene is shot in a particular order of Roy alternating between moments of extreme emotion and humanity, only to be followed by Roy doing inhuman acts, and repeat. My favorite example from this scene is when Roy gives Deckard a ten second head start, counting as slow as possible. Deckard is practically shitting himself as he hears the seconds tick away from his life as he searches for a means of survival, while Roy takes his time saying goodbye to his departed love Pris, hiding his tears and pain from Deckard.

Furthermore, when Roy discusses the possibilities of a cure with his creator, protein chains are mentioned, implying that replicants have DNA. If the chimpanzee, man's closest genetic relative, shares over 98 percent of the same genetic sequences with humans, one would age to assume that replicants, or homo replicatur, have nearly identical genetic make ups to homo sapiens.

Though Deckard only sees the replicants as killing machines, they are merely the next generation of slaves for mankind.

1) About the protests:
This comes from far away. After Franco died (the dictator who ruled the country and who crushed the legitime previous system, the 2nd Republic), the US and Germany managed to put a two parties system, just like the US, with a king above. This was approved by the official communist party (PCE). Because of this move to the social-democracy and other previous actions, the PCPE split and also the GRAPO were formed. GRAPO was a communist armed band that mostly worked during the 70s and the 80s.

Anyway, coming back to the story, the two parties (PP and PSOE) took turns, and they all accepted what came from Europe. First, to achieve the necessary requirements to join EU, they obliged us to dismantle our industries in the North, pretty good docks. Also instead of improve our own agricultural skills, they gave subsidies to the peasants in the South (Andalucía) and forced us to buy foreign food. Of course all of them were credits that we would have to return, with interests...
Then it came the Euro. To join the unique coin, we had to sign Maastritch (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty) What did that mean? Basically to loose the sovereignty of our own currency. The European Central Bank would decide for us... They also modified our constitution so the debts can have MORE PRIORITY than the peoples needs. During the 90s Spain managed to grow basically by constructing thousands of buildings, condos, hotels at the coast (an environmental disaster)... and then the bubble exploded. Spain was totally indebted and unable to grow. Our current unemployment rate is higher than 25% and the economy totally collapsed. 
Here we have to add several proved cases of corruption among our politics, the fact that the king has the lowest popularity ever... and of course the horrible cuts. Mariano Rajoy, the current president, has approved laws that came from Germany to cheapen firigns, increased the taxes, cut the budget on health, education, increased the university fees... while the banks are evicting families and the poverty has risen dramatically.

So we had our ""Indignados"", a precedent to the Occupy movements here, but with that lack of ideology and, in my opinion, too pacifistic. Now the protests are coming back. Fortunately now I'm seeing more Republican flags (3 colors, before Fraco's coup d'etat and with the communists in the government) and other signs that make me recover some hope. The new move is to take the Congress. The protesters have been repressed in a fascist way, I'm sure you all have seen the videos: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD3yp4p8YKA

As Gramsci said repeatedly, the demonstrations should not be spontaneous (without an ideology). We must have a class consciousness, solidarity, joining unions or parties able to provide some discipline.

Its already known that China is going to hit a wall sooner or later due to the 1 child policy.

&gt;Good luck trying to run from someone with a knife as a woman if they are a man and have gotten close enough to pull it out and threaten you with it.

You think a gun will give you a better chance?

&gt;Lafayette Police Lieutenant Brad Bishop says in police training on use of force, officers learn about the ""21-foot rule."" The rule states a person with a knife can cover 21 feet in about 1.5 to 2.5 seconds, being able to stab a victim faster than an officer can get his gun from the holster and shoot it. And that's under ideal circumstances.

http://www.wlfi.com/dpp/news/crime/21-foot-rule-shows-danger-of-knives

Unless you're going to pull that gun on everyone who comes within 21 feet of you... you're better off to leave it in its holster and attempt to gain control of the attackers weapon. Self defence training can help with that. Gets you fit too.

&gt;So they aren't too pussy to violently rape and murder someone, but using a knife crosses the line?

No, they are pussies, not squeamish. They are afraid that a knife won't give them enough of an advantage, not that it would be too messy.

&gt;Damn straight they did.

I'll see your graph and raise you one:

[Homicide Rates](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/America-is-violent-graph.png)

Notice that the 70's had more murders than at any time since? How does that fit your world view?

[Gun Ownership](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/gun-ownership-declining1.png)

Hey look! Less people own guns in the US now than in the 1970's! So fewer people with more guns. That's so much safer!

&gt;Fun fact, Australia always had a lower homicide rate then the US even before your absurd new gun laws.

True, but that's not a good thing. Your gun control laws are only recent as well, and they are far less strict. So why am I not surprised that Australia has less homicides?

But taking it even further:

&gt;The number of murder victims fluctuated slightly from 1993 to 2007, whereas manslaughter remained relatively stable.

&gt;The number of murder victims peaked in 1999, at 344; the number of manslaughter victims peaked in 2002, at 48.

&gt;**The 253 murder and 29 manslaughter victims recorded in 2007 were the lowest annual number yet recorded.**

http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.aspx

They have even less murders now! Who'd have thought?

Just to really rub it in:

&gt;1. Where there are more guns there is more homicide (literature review).

&gt;Our review of the academic literature found that a broad array of evidence indicates that gun availability is a risk factor for homicide, both in the United States and across high-income countries.  Case-control studies, ecological time-series and cross-sectional studies indicate that in homes, cities, states and regions in the US, **where there are more guns, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide.**

..

&gt;Using survey data on rates of household gun ownership, we examined the association between gun availability and homicide across states, 2001-2003. We found that states with higher levels of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm homicide and overall homicide.  **This relationship held for both genders and all age groups, after accounting for rates of aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, urbanization, alcohol consumption, and resource deprivation (e.g., poverty). There was no association between gun prevalence and non-firearm homicide.**

http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/index.html

Oh, I'm sorry, that last one came from Harvard rather than the NRA. It's probably liberal commie hippie bullshit, to you.

&gt;Because defending the most fundamental aspect of human rights that have determined the distribution of power and recognition of other rights is such a crazy idea right?

No, because the idea that no one can have your gun unless they kill you first is utterly fucking insane. That government of yours doesn't give a shit if you are armed to the teeth. A Hellfire missile would deal to you, no problem. The only people who care if a nutjob like that has a gun are his neighbours. They're the ones most likely to be shot with it.

You won't be defending liberty or freedom.. or you would already be on the streets with your guns overthrowing the corporate elites that are fucking up your nation. But as I said only cowards think they *need* a gun for self defence.

I constantly hear American gun owners talking about defending liberty with their guns. Never seen it though. Patriot Act or not.

&gt;I guess he just wanted to be able to defend his life and freedoms, fuck him right?

I've never seen Charlton Heston pull a gun out and defend anything - except in the movies. Even after Waco and Ruby Ridge, the only guy with balls enough to do something about it took the cowardly truck bomb route.

All these militia running around with their army jackets over their beer guts, preparing for the day they have to face their government haven't seen the videos of ""Shock and Awe"". Or maybe they have. Maybe that's why the talk and talk and talk about defending freedom, but meekly comply whenever the government actually comes knocking.

&gt;I'm sorry, is it some sort of collective choice?

Yes. Sane countries don't allow people to walk around with handguns for the same reason they don't let drunks drive.

&gt;Does the local theives guild send you a letter telling you that you will be mugged sometime between 9am and 4pm three business days from now.

Of course not. Does having a gun help? Nope. In fact, you are more likely to kill yourself with that gun than someone else. There are more gun-involved suicides in the US than gun-involved homicides.

However, if you're murdered in the US, you are more likely to have been shot than stabbed, beaten, choked, or any of the other ways to commit murder, *combined*. Guns make murder easy. That's why you have so much of it.

&gt;It is a personal choice the same way carrying a pocket knife, buying fire insurance or wearing a seatbelt is a personal choice.

Not in a sane country, it isn't. I don't even trust half the people around me to use a car safely. Why the fuck would I want them carrying guns as well? That's just fucking nuts.

&gt;Ownership of any of these things does not place other people around you at risk

The science disagrees.

&gt;unless you believe guns can magically lift themselves out of holsters, aim and fire themselves.

No, guns don't kill people - the fucking morons that own them, kill people.

Morons like this guy:

Shall I continue?

&gt;lolno your laws are pointless just like every other prohibitionist law that doesn't rely on special/hard to manufacture ingredients. You have a lower crime rate because the majority of your population is western-European white, educated, and reasonably well paid.

You know nothing about Australia, do you?

In any case, let's look a little closer:

&gt;In recent weeks there have been multiple shootings in Sydney blamed on the gangs.

&gt;Homes have been sprayed with gunshots while children have slept inside, and there have been several related shootings in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland.

No one has died.

But back before the gun control laws when semi-automatic high-powered assault rifles were allowed:

&gt;Clive Small charts the tensions back to the infamous Milperra massacre in 1984, when six bikers were shot dead in a pub car park in Sydney, while a teenage girl was killed in the crossfire.

It's a lot harder to kill six bikers when all you have is a bolt action rifle without a magazine.

&gt;So I'm putting everyone at risk because other people are allowed to carry lumps of metal on their waistbands at their own discretion

No, you're putting everyone at risk because one day you might flip out and shoot someone before you can regain your senses, or you might mistake a kid with Skittles for an evil assailant and kill him in ""self-defence"" or you might accidentally shoot yourself or a bystander by dropping your gun. Or a real criminal might break into your home and steal it. You might even be one of the morons in the video above.

Without some form of gun control, how could I know you aren't one of *those* morons?

&gt;but there is apparently no increased risk to myself.

Actually, as I said, you're more likely to shoot yourself with that gun than anyone else. One day after a particular shitty string of setbacks, you might decide this world is not for you, and punch your own ticket. In fact its about 20% more likely than you ever using it to defend yourself. So yeah, the risk is to you as well. Of course, if you're one of the guys in those videos, no one is safe, not you, not your kids, not your neighbours... no one.

&gt;Can't have it that way you cheeky cunt, either there is a significant risk from everyone carrying guns which puts me at risk as well

The reality of the matter is that creationism and creationists have no desire to be scientific, they just appeal to the public in order to influence policy.

It's like when a research lab working on a really politically controversial theory gives their article to the news media before it passes peer review: right off the bat you know they're not in it for the science. Creationists are like this time ten thousand.

So yes, while there are differences in the philosophy of science between a real actual scientist and a creationist, that doesn't account for the anger or frustration people feel towards them. It's the fact that they drive a politically minded, non-scientific, non-peer review, media hyping, litigious propaganda machine in place of dispassionately seeking truth and fair discourse.

It's the prevailing opinion on reddit because Redditors are famously glib and are tired of arguing the same thing with every creationists that comes to them. Now there are a lot of young students who *are* honestly seeking a resolution to what they've perceived to be a conflict between what their pastor is telling them and what their teacher is telling them. And the behavior of those on reddit doesn't help them approach the situation dispassionately and with a level head: reddit's (justified) anger and frustration only serves to further polarize the students.

_____

The reality of the matter is that there isn't a conflict between a properly phrased perspective of religion and science. How can they conflict? Well, for instance if your religion tells you to believe that humans don't breathe oxygen to survive, they actually breathe argon, then you have a conflict. The religion has dedicated you to a testable prediction, and you can bet your ass some scientist is going to test it.

So here what it comes down to is that certain interpretations of The Old Testament have lead people to believe that the earth was made 10,000 years ago. This is a testable prediction. You can bet your ass some scientists is going to test it. What happened? Well, it tested false. So they retested. False again. In fact, entire fields of science and technology have been built upon the ideas that resulted from it testing false.

Does it take faith to believe the results? Well, it takes some measure of faith to believe all your senses aren't lying to you and that you're not actually in The Matrix. And I'd say that's about the same amount of faith it takes to believe in gravity or evolution.

It takes another step of faith to believe something you have no sense-based evidence for: for example, believing that the first planet humans will inhabit that's not in our solar system will be in the Proxima system. We have no evidence to suggest that's the case and no tests or measurements have ever been taken on such a subject matter. So there are clearly two types of faith here. You can't lean back and say that ""oh, well evolution takes faith to believe too"". It's entirely different. In fact, if someone posed the theory of evolution in 1000 AD, it *would* have taken faith to believe it -- incredible faith. At that time, no one had tested the theory and there was absolutely no evidence for it. Just like there's no evidence now about where the first human colonized e-solar planet will be (if there will ever be one at all for that matter).

(In fact, if someone had posed the Theory of Gravity without Newton's experimental parameters in that same time period, it would have been just as incredible and unsupported. The idea that a feather should fall as quickly as a brick, sans friction? That still amazes me, but the tests confirm it.)

Today, however, there is evidence -- incredible evidence -- supporting evolution and gravity. And perhaps in a few hundred years we'll have some kind of incredible evidence about colonization., but until then I remain agnostic towards colonization and certain about evolution and gravity.

This has become a top destination for many Europeans, Russians and Indians (flight times of 3 to 7hours from those destinations). Not many Americans come here as they have better choices if they are willing to fly for 12h to 16h.

What happened in Dubai in my view: people got carried away when money was rushing into Dubai as property prices could surely only go up and never down and banks provided almost unlimited amount of debt (sounds familiar btw.?). 2008 and 2009 hit them hard (developers, investors and the city itself). A lot of projects are not finished and may never be finished and overall there are still a lot of empty buildings. 

That said, since 2010 the population is growing and you have more influx of westerners (like me). This trend is expected to [continue] (http://www.selectproperty.com/2012/07/merrill-lynch-predict-growth-for-dubai-in-the-coming-years/). I came for the taxes and thought this was just a quick stop, but it turns out it is better than I thought. 

When there are concerns raised about Dubai, many of them are real issues and need to be addressed. I haven't seen one country yet where you could not come up with a list of things that are badly managed (for example, just look at all the debt the western economies are piling up to keep on living a non sustainable lifestyle. Good book on that [here] (http://www.amazon.com/Endgame-Debt-Supercycle-Changes-Everything/dp/1118004574)).

Also, just because you are surrounded by a desert and summers here are very tough, it does not mean the city will auto fail. There are many cities around the world thriving in non pleasant climate conditions.

Overall, I'm just not sure why I always see this anti Dubai stance. I guess it is schadenfreude that their overly ambitious plans did not go as expected. Just my advise: when you see all these negative comments (all Oil money, Dubai is empty, people fleeing, etc.), take note that it often may be disconnected from reality.

c6fwsdm,0,1430034180,"Azubu Blaze, too bad they didn't make it :( 

CLG.eu is the most obvious answer based off their history against M5. In terms of analysis for this match up, Krepo does a phenomenal job of winning bot lane versus the relatively passive auto-attack focused Gosu+Genja preference. Froggen is a phenomenal AP mid who is one of the most mentally collected matchups when playing against Alex Ich, especially in reacting to unseen stuff. I would hope to see Froggen play something with wave clears as I expect heavy 3/4 man pushes, so it's a good thing Froggen is comfortable on wave clear AP mids versus someone like Ryze.

iG &amp; Frost/Sword are also strong likelihoods as they have great map wide presence. Both Korean teams and iG in particular have the super strong 'we will level four dive after switching our 2v1 and 1v2 lanes' sort of forward thinking team-oriented play style that M5 have been picking up easy wins with. It'll be an interesting match up instead of one team making plays and the other team simply reacting.

iG gets bonus points on top of that for being the only other team I've seen other than M5 to run DFG on an AD jungle Yi. That's the sort of quirky interesting play I'm looking forward to :)

If World Elite get to the finals it it's almost certainly going to be because Misaya is light years ahead of Regi in the mid lane. Alex Ich though? I'm not so sure.

I don't see the strength of SK in that match up as they boot camped together. M5's advantage isn't a specific strategy that M5 could pick up on, just experience as a cohesive team: it's a lot easier to adapt to SK's picks than M5's overall playstyle, is what I'm saying.

CLG prime lack the 5-man teamwork / global presence in early/mid game and lane stage. Jiji doesn't have the aggressive early/mid strength and roaming power to shut down the Ich+Diamond+Darien combo. Doublelift &amp; Chauster are without a doubt stronger mechanically than Gosu+Genja, but Gosu+Genja win through game sense which isn't Doublelift's strength. Late game CLG is too solo queue / divey where M5 is more 'protect the tank shredder', so Doublelift rarely reaches his potential especially versus the Kennen+Vlad comps, Darien's Jax, etc. They shut down the squishies and ignore the tanks all too often. I have absolutely no confidence in a jungle Cho'gath versus M5, for example...if it comes down to CLG v M5 and I see jungle Cho get picked up, I'm turning the stream off and going outside.

Diamond is too dominant to let OddOne snowball the game for TSM. Counter ganks and counter jungling will give M5 the advantage over TSM, although TSM are the sort of team who give smiteless leashes and set up good ganks / play mobile to help invades or counterinvades (the sort of thing you want in the 'support jungle' matchup versus the 'carry jungle' Diamondprox), so I may be wrong here.",t3_10r3hr,False,t3_10r3hr,t5_2rfxx,t1_c6fwsdm,True,,01 team,3,0,,charlesviper,1349080813,0,False,leagueoflegends,3,

I agree that personifying the entire nation is pretty problematic, especially when it comes down to saying that what my ancestors did was horrific and outright wrong, even if it they were at the mercy of the political and military climate at the time. Considering that saving face is an important aspect of the Japanese life, that can't really be ruled out either, even though it may seem a bit cheap of me for bringing it up. But I still think people in general has this uneasiness when discussing the past. Because though the guilt may not be openly discussed, it's always something that's seething underneath.

When people of Japan so heavily support pacifism almost angrily, that is a sign that people do recognize the heavy costs of war and how it changes people, even themselves. Maybe it's just hard to really pinpoint the 'blame' or the 'solution' when even everyday people compartmentalized the ugliness of history. Perhaps it may not be too different from many powerful modern nations of today that may have outright committed massacres and unfair 'purchase' of nations like with United States, most European countries, etcetera.

That's because Greece is a crossroad for immigration (most immigrants state that their goal was to reach Scandinavia or Germany.) And of course because our European mates obligated us to sign the ""forward to the country where he came from"" deal. Which means that western countries forward anyone they catch to where they came from. The ball stops in frontier countries like Greece and Italy, because as sure as hell Turkey and Libya will not take back anyone that crossed their borders illegally.

That's why we have a lot of immigration. 

Now on the crime rates. There are zones in Athens that you just don't cross. And no they are not Greeks that make it dangerous, it's the hordes of desperate people. The nazists are also a problem as they will likely cause trouble if you have long hair or you are perceived as leftist or foreigner. 

In any case it is not a Greek problem per se. Even in happier times a small county like Greece could not handle millions of illegal immigrants, not without help from Europe. And since Europe will not pay to keep them out or relocate them it was a matter of time that ghettos and nazis would sprout.

This is a major error of our left parties. Their extreme political correctness blinded them to the fact that we do indeed have an immigration problem, when one out of five people in the country is a paperless desperate stranger. They will refuse to talk about any solution, so what's left is the neonazi pragmatism that resonates with those that have seen their houses lose value to near zero (good luck selling or renting out an apartment in zones like Ag.

If one listens to English speakers from different nations and backgrounds, one finds that some people pronounce the vowel in each syllable differently. This is indicated by a difference in spelling. Incidentally, it is how *I* pronounce it (and I'm not an Anglophile snob, nor a dudette).

One good reason to consider 'colour' to be the correct spelling is primacy - the English spelling was set down before the American English variation appeared (1755 vs. 1828). Although there are inconsistencies in English spelling, it was standardised somewhat earlier.

Another reason is majority - most of the English speaking world uses the original and proper spelling, with the US differing. As with the metric system, the US is in the minority and might do well to catch up with the rest of the world.

A further reason would be history (as Titykaka argues below) - the English spelling was influenced by Old French spelling. Latin root words do end in -or rather than -our, so there are some words in English that properly end in -or, but they usually represent newer concepts (i.e.; those arising during or after the Renaissance). 

Of course, one also has to consider Noah Webster's nationalistic and anti-European bias in his decision to simplify certain spellings. He also rejected grammarian pedantry and the study of classical languages which heavily influence and inform English orthography. 

Oh wait, we're here to have a laugh, right? Perhaps it's the correct spelling simply because OP's Fry pic isn't funny? Because someone is wrong on the Internet? Because if we all listened to Webster, we'd be concerned about wimmen burning their tungs on hot soop?

I am not an ambassador any more than you are. Just because I'm a Muslim doesn't mean I am required to stage peaceful protests to avoid being lumped in with murders. Just like because I'm voting for Obama, doesn't mean I need to stage demonstrations to my fellow idiot Texans about how horrible the Republican party is. It's not my responsibility, and it's ridiculous for anyone to expect me to. What could YOU be protesting right now that you aren't?

There is a misconception perpetuated by by the anti-Muslim camp that because everyday moderate Muslims aren't speaking out against radical Muslims, that we condone their actions.

Two part answer. 1) To add to what I said in the first paragraph, I am not an ambassador, I am a human being, an American, a student; I mind my own business. If I am 'silent' it is not because I condone it, I am 'silent' because it is no more directly related to me than it is to you. It's some shit happening across the world, and we have enough going on in our own lives.

2.) Muslims, moderate Muslims, including myself, DO protest. We DO get noticed. What I'm doing right now, replying to people bashing ALL of Islam as radical, anti-semetic, violence inducing? Replying to comments with my own pacifistic position IS my protest. That is ALL I have the power to do, and I do it because I feel obligated because of all the nutjobs on the internet who have apparently never met a nice Muslim person before. That is my protest. There are other protests by other people. Any time you see a news report about Muslims, anything about Muslims, even on Fox news, there is bound to be some representative from CAIR or some local American mosque saying that Muslims as a whole do not condone these actions. Whenever any atrocity somewhere in the world is committed by Muslims, there ARE Muslims out there speaking out, protesting, trying to get noticed. The problem is, non-Muslims don't care, don't listen, or worst, don't believe the peaceful Muslims, brush it off as trying to spread the Islamization of America or Europe by trying to make nice-nice.

My experience - having seen the contracts between the agency and the client and using that as a negotiating position - the spread isn't as high as that in the UK or Europe. You'd be unlikely to double your money by signing a direct contract. Also remember you need to split the difference with the client.

I.e. if you made £45 through and agency and the agency charges £70, you're looking at (£70+45)/2 for a direct contract. So you're still billing less than a plumber.

Ocular deformities aside, this is just yet another hit-man-on-the-run-from-his-superiors trope minus the usual stylish visuals normally associated with films of this type. Ratanaruang and co-writer, Lyovarin, obviously in thrall to European art house movies such as La Samourai, keep the dramatics to a minimum but the performances are bland (perpetually weedy and charisma-free presence of Chaiyanam being the main offender) rather than cool. Intrusive flash-backs mar what should have been a lean and simple tale and it is only the brief but expertly-handled action scenes that relieve the monotony. While its admirable that the director/writers embrace the values of the genre, they've missed out the most important element of 'noir': atmosphere. Worth a watch but don't expect to be dazzled.

I'll do another explanation, with more detail, because I'm like that.

""European"" is a word in the English langauge. A reasonable definition of it would be: ""someone from Europe (either politically of geographically)"". By that definition, all (resident) inhabitants of the British Isles can reasonably be defined as European. This is the sense of the word you are arguing from, I believe.

But words are slippery things. This word, when used in the British Isles, often carries connotations of ""continental europe - specifically perhaps mediterranean (French, Italian, Spanish)"". The usage I mean would be something like ""And then he kissed you on the cheek? How european"". It also carries connotations of""not-British"".

According to this latter definition, some people (perhaps those whose sense of identity is ""strongly British"") would object to being called European I would say they have a reasonable case for two reasons:
1) they aren't ""european"" in the second meaning of the word I give there
2) I think that people in general should have a right to self-identify. 

And I'll note again in passing that I personally do self-identify as European (and British, and English). I'm just trying to point out in passing that reciting one definition of a word isn't the be-all and end-all of the matter.

tl;dr - words have more than one meaning.

edit: bonus p.s. The word ""european"" I think also carries different connotations when spoken in the U.S. I don't live there, but my guess at the nuance is ""archaic"" (in both the good and bad senses)",t3_10r3ex,False,t1_c6fxdlo,t5_2sumw,t1_c6fxgxm,True,,,6,0,,jbert,1349089495,0,False,britishproblems,6,

OP has poisoned this conversation from the start. **The idea that you can understand pre-revolution Iran from a single picture is preposterous.** What's worse is that the casual reader's image of Iran today is a media-created stereotype. Not a week goes by without a Western leader calling Iran a grave threat. (All while [the United States sponsors jihadist terrorists in Iran](http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-sponsored-covert-war-on-iran-washington-gives-full-approval-to-terrorist-mujahedin-e-khalq-mek/), although Iran has never sponsored terrorism against the United States. I can understand Israel retaliating against Iranian terror with underhanded tactics, but what's America's excuse?) Even Democrats - Clinton, Obama - maintain that the use of nukes against Iran shouldn't be ""taken off the table""...

Was Iran better off in 1978 than it is today? Overall, NO.

**Are women's rights worse today than pre-revolution?** Yes and no.

Brief Google search for Iranian women today: [students](http://developmentalidealism.org/imagery/iran.html), [conference](http://www.3zc.ir/iizc2010.gif). Click for HD [collage](http://kianahayeri.com/) of girls growing up in Iran. Naturally we find any dress codes repugnant, but this isn't Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia.

There are [terrible restrictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Iran) in place, limiting their options in education, careers, and politics. However, [more women attend university than men, reaching 70% in the science and engineering fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Iran). The [gender gap in literacy](http://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/Zahra%20Mila%20Elmi%20Table%201.jpg) has shrunk from 20% in the 1970s to 8% today. The trends aren't slowing - Iran is going coed.

And the picture pre-revolution wasn't pretty at all. The small urban elite had the privilege of dressing themselves. But the majority of the country was rural, illiterate, and highly religious. You think backward villagers needed laws to make them repress women?

**Is Iran better off in terms of healthcare?** Yes.

Life expectancy [grew faster](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=iran+life+expectancy#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) than the world average. Infant mortality and fertility have fallen [slightly faster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plot-of-infant-mortality-and-total-fertility-rates-1950-2050-selected-countries.PNG) than the world average.

**Do Iranians have more political freedom post-revolution?** Yes, but it's still terrible. Dissident assassinations, voter fraud, clerical meddling, and other corruption overshadow the otherwise significant gains in self-governance.

**Is Iran better off economically than before the revolution?** Barely. Iran had [only recently surpassed](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=iran+life+expectancy#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) the GDP per capita of the 1970s. However, read on for the explanation.

**What does it mean to blame the ""Islamic revolution"" for Iran's backwardness?** It means having a shallow and selective view of history. Iran has bigger problems than its Islamic government.

As above, [half of Iran was illiterate](http://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/Zahra%20Mila%20Elmi%20Table%201.jpg) before the revolution. It wasn't a modern nation to begin with.

The economy [shrunk sharply](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=iran+life+expectancy#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=23601600000&amp;tend=370756800000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) several years before the revolution, during the global Stagflation of the 70s. It actually recovered after the revolution.

If you follow the [GDP per capita](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=iran+life+expectancy#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:IRN&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) further, you notice a deep fall in the mid-80s. Why, perhaps it has to do with [Iraq invading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq-Iran_War) Iran out of the blue! Iraq, [massively supported](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_aid_to_combatants_in_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War) by the US, Europe, Saudi Arabia, and the USSR. The help going to Iran was much smaller, and amounted to a desire to [prolong the war to inflict casualties on both sides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq-Iran_War#Foreign_support_to_Iraq_and_Iran). Iraq used chemical weapons against soldiers and civilians.

Not only did this disrupt the Iranian economy, but it radicalized the Islamic Republic. Large-scale war allowed extreme, conservative elements to justify tightening their grip on power and brutalizing dissidents. Together with ever-tightening economic sanctions imposed by the US and the anti-Shia Muslim nations, the Iranian economy has not grown in anything like natural conditions.

Plus, Iran suffers from the [resource curse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse), which discourages industrial growth. Its economy is naturally over-reliant on limited fossil fuel revenues. When your population [almost doubles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iran) and your main resource stays the same, it's hard to increase the standard of living.

Back to your love for the ""**version without political freedom**"".

It's flippant for you, as a Westerner, to pick versions of Iran - the Shah fell too long ago anyway (and for popular, secular reasons, not by accident or conspiracy). And it's especially stupid since the 2009 Green Revolution protests in Iran called first and foremost for **more political freedom**, not secularism or women's rights. (You see, for Iranians the greater problem right now is not the unelected Islamist clerics, but the fake-elected security-apparatus militarists.) Maybe trust them to know what's best for them?

This, as it happens, is something that the person I initially responded to addressed far less than I, given he chose to focus on criticising Europeans for being entitled, whether he meant to or not.

I would have thought most of us are familiar with how VoDs and recording work, but it's more about being able to watch an event live.  Surely you won't deny there's something very special about that, and why shouldn't we discuss whether there's a way to make that possible for as many human beings on the earth as we can?  There's no reason, no matter how much shouting ""entitlement"" may be premised on the hope there is.  Furthermore, if the person to which I initially responded wanted to have a discussion about entitlement, he shouldn't have stereotyped an entire continent of players as the main thrust of his point and instead talked about the issue in general terms, and indeed should probably not have used it as a substitute for addressing the point made in the OP, which is a separate though related issue.

What this thread is all about is whether there's a different set of timings that suits people better all over the world - given we are getting a stream, it's not remotely entitled to want a little bit of dialogue on how to get the timings that best suit everyone.  Indeed, it's just positive practice as a business to keep customers in the loop, whether it's free or not.

c6fymen,0,1430035043,"**On Race**

Races are not a biological definition, races are a social-cultural construct. The traits usually used to define race like hair colour, skin colour, eye colour, height...are not discrete, they do not fall into distinct categories. They lie on a continuum, from very dark to very light, from very short to very tall.

One might say there are populations of humans (Not races!), who for a short time were or are somewhat isolated. Improved transportation means that barriers to gene flow are almost non-exsistant. Even if there are barriers they do not occur over a long enough period of time to truly isolate one population for another. This is because of our long generation time (~25 years), that any gene flow, even just one person migrating, is enough to offset any genetic drift that may cause speciation.

Basically what I am saying is that too many people from any given population are mating with too many other people of different populations so that distinct populations of the human species are not moving in different selective directions. We have no indication morphologically, or physically, or sexually that different populations of the human species are spectating.

""Among humans, race has no taxonomic significance; all people belong to the same hominid subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens. **Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits.** Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete, and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.""

Humans can be categorized into populations but even that is fuzzy because between populations gene flow is high. Very few populations are so isolated that non gene flow exists or exists for long enough that these populations begin to speciate. I am not saying that traits are not found in a higher frequency in one population over another it's just that there are no distinct categories. It is a continuum, there will always be many many people in the middle, who do not fit into any category. 

**On different populations acquiring different skin colours**

* The human species is about 200,000 years old
* We originated in Africa, we were all dark skinned.
* Then populations of [humans migrated out and spread around the globe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans). This took tens of thousands of years, it was a slow process.
* As we moved we acquired new mutations which were beneficial and so were adaptive and then were selected for - those which possessed the mutation were more likely to breed and leave offspring and so those traits, like different skin colours, proliferated.

As population of humans migrated out of Africa and spread out over the globe they encountered:

**1: Different environmental pressures:** Different [skin colours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color) have different advantages and are therefore naturally selected. In places (equatorial regions) where people are exposed to higher concentrations of UV rays, dark skin, which contains more melanin, acts as a natural sunblock. This is advantageous and so it is selected for. However, in places where UV exposure is limited (either seasonally/pole regions), having lighter skin becomes advantageous. You don't need as much melanin and less melanin allows you to produce more vitamin D.

""About 70,000–100,000 years ago some modern humans began to migrate away from the tropics to the north where they were exposed to less intense sunlight, possibly in part due to the need for greater use of clothing to protect against the colder climate. Under these conditions there was less photodestruction of folate and so the evolutionary pressure stopping lighter-skinned gene variants from surviving was reduced. In addition, lighter skin is able to generate more vitamin D than darker skin so it would have represented a health benefit in reduced sunlight if there were limited sources of vitamin D. Hence the leading hypothesis for the evolution of human skin color proposes that:

* From ~1.2 million years ago to less than 100,000 years ago, the ancestors of all people alive were dark-skinned Africans.
* As populations began to migrate, the evolutionary constraint keeping skin dark decreased proportionally to the distance North a population migrated, resulting in a range of skin tones within northern populations.
* At some point, northern populations experienced positive selection for lighter skin due to the increased production of vitamin D from sunlight and the genes for darker skin disappeared from these populations.
The genetic mutations leading to light skin, though different among East Asians and Europeans, suggest the two groups experienced a similar selective pressure due to settlement in northern latitudes."" - From the article on skin colour.

You may also want to read up on [rickets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickets) a disease which is acquired when the body does not get enough vitamin D. This can effect those with darker skin in higher latitudes because they need more sunlight to produce the same amount of vitamin D as a lighter skinned person.

**2: Different cultural pressures:** Physical features like height, weight, eye colour, hair colour, facial features, skin colour etc. can be selected for or against because of sexual selection. If you think someone is attractive you are more likely to mate with them, produce offspring and then pass on those ""attractive"" traits. What is attractive? Well that changes through time and across cultures - what is sexy one day is ugly the next. So these traits will fluctuate over time, but perhaps are better conserved within certain populations. Overtime, populations drift apart and mating within populations is higher then mating between populations - and the traits become either more pronounced and/or more prevalent. The same applies for behaviours as well, they also can be sexually selected for.",t3_10qyij,1349099384,t3_10qyij,t5_2qm4e,t1_c6fymen,True,Primatology | Primate Behavior and Infant Handling,bio,1,0,,Cebus_capucinus,1349098826,0,False,askscience,1,

Me. I have very little empathy and have been known to play the part of asshole when it suited my goals.

&gt;Hitler was a Christian.

Doesn't really matter what he was in this context. I was trying to explain why ""but lenin was a collectivist"" is stupid.

&gt;France would have to leave the EU

France was just a hypothetical. The exact socialist country doesn't matter.

&gt;Everyone can claim it on the internet, with no validation whatsoever.

True, and honestly I don't care if you believe me. I'm just trying to help you understand the tone I'm setting here, and to prevent you from linking to god awful youtube videos in the future.

&gt;People would leave France in search of better life.

You're claiming that your hypothetical capitalist state could out compete a given socialist state? Why hasn't it happened in the past. If the solution to all our governmental woes is really so simple, why hasn't anyone successfully implemented it?

&gt;And I consider it otherwise, I'm guiding you.

It's possible that all my arguments are transparent to you, and you can see me falling down the same path of cognitive bias an misapplied logic as so many others. But I doubt it. If it helps you to believe that then carry on, but please consider it properly. Have you ever had a deeply held belief that turned out to be wrong before? Perhaps a belief in god? The first time always sucks. But you learn not to put any of your ego into these things. If you haven't had a deep seated belief upset before, it's very important that you consider what amount of evidence it would take for you to change your mind. Read some lesswrong or overcoming bias. They’re decent introductory texts. [The level above mine](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ua/the_level_above_mine/) might be a good place to start. At some point during this conversation there will be a little nagging fear, going ""oh fuck, I might be wrong"". Try not to ignore it. Face it, a good portion of the time you're not wrong anyway.

&gt;They don't mention greed in the video.

With all due respect, did you actually watch the video? That's basically what the entire video is about. How money is a very poor motivator when compared to mastery, autonomy, and purpose. In fact, in many cases, it actively inhibits people ability to do things.

&gt; * What is the incentive for people to work in a socialistic society, if the government would take care of them?

Mastery, autonomy, and purpose. But I feel it's important to mention that I'm not arguing in favour of pure socialism, I'm arguing for a government that tries to lower the barriers to entry into a given sector, while also providing lots of social programs like subsidized education and healthcare. At the moment, in the US, you can live off food stamps and welfare. For the most part people still want mastery, autonomy, and purpose. Some give up completely, because in your current system it costs a lot to get an education. There's no path from where they are to mastery. Make it easier for people to do work that satisfies autonomy and purpose by helping them achieve mastery. There's a strong correlation between education and poverty, and it's not because they're all lazy or the like (most of the time anyway). It's because it's very difficult to manage basic survival and have enough money to go to school. You can't be on welfare and go to school. Some people manage to have a job and get an education at the same time, through shear force of will, but it's really fucking hard. Even harder if you're saddled with unexpected medical debt due to your countries lack of socialized health care.

&gt; * How would businesses start, if there were no rich people? Or would there be no businesses?

There is one place in the world that is true socialism (not that I'm encouraging true socialism). The linux kernel. If you were to get a private firm to recreate it, it would cost [$1.3 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#Estimated_cost_to_redevelop). This is all based on volunteered time. For the rest of the red hat linux stack, you're looking at closer to 11 billion. This is all done with volunteers.

But, if you were capitalistic, and you had a social safety net to catch you if you take risks and mess up. And you had the government actively trying to lower the barrier to entry, well I'd wager that you'd get much more economic growth. Presuming the government did it more or less competently.

&gt; * How would you stop evil people from getting into power?

Always a difficult problem, but it's one your system of governance faces as well. I presume you were planning on implementing a well defined constitution to keep your government in check? If you think about it I'd bed you could imagine a few reasons that wouldn't work.

The first step towards keeping ""evil people"" (by the way, to most people your comments about not caring about death probably qualify you as ""evil"") is to get them better educated. Better education means people are more likely to vote in line with what benefits them. There are other tweaks you can make as well. For example, a direct representational democracy allows for small groups to get a voice in a way that regional representational democracies don't. It's easy to silence a minority group by putting them in the same riding as a lot of rich people. More easily understandable law is important as well.

We have also forgotten differences in views on race, that were held in the past about a little over a century ago. I.e. if one appeared white, in the south before the civil war, they were accepted as such, which changed in reaction to post civil war reconstruction polocies.

""Both before and after the American Civil War, many people of mixed ancestry who ""looked white"" and were of mostly white ancestry were legally absorbed into the white majority. State laws established differing standards. For instance, in 1822 Virginia law stated that to be defined as ""mulatto"" (that is, multi-racial), a person had to have at least one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African ancestry.[6] This was a looser definition than the state's 20th-century ""one-drop rule"" under the 1924 Racial Integrity Act. ""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule#Legislation_and_practice

Not many people can name their great grandparents off of their head, or their particular country of origin (irish-american, russian-american etc...) Also since race is less of an issue in self identity it's not even something people often put time and energy into researching. 

Or there has been a large scale war, which results in more intermarriage only because there are less people, and so people have to be less choosy, like you had in England after the plague, the social class of families shifted, so some middle, became part of aristocracy due to a simple shortage of people. In fact it could be due to another plague, perhaps the deadly ""ruprux plague"" mentioned. 

I admit still it's the weakest of my arguments, two out of three ain't bad.

Edit: Also in regards to the ""reprux plague"" it might hit a certain ethnic group harder, like how some Northern European's carry a gene that can help prevent them getting, or how some people how African descent recover easier to malaria.

They attacked the twin towers first to secure their own power base. They needed proof that they can accomplish shit. Osama bin laden would be a poor leader and would lose influence if he didn't have a track record of accomplishments. So, first they attacked so OBL can have a good track record. 

Second, they attacked for the money and the recruits. No one would join or give money to al queada if they couldn't show that they are good at what they do. 

Third, do you honestly think that al Qaeda cares about the way the USA people live? Do you think that they honestly think that we would fear a small orginazation that lives in the shadows? Those people are really smart and calculating. I never heard a press release from OBL demanding I submit to Islam or otherwise Disneyland would be bombed.  If they wanted to change how we live they would first, tell us what they want and then make more threats. 

Finally, the Air Force bases is admittedly nothing on their radar, it is just a rallying cry. If it weren't for the bases, they would use the USA ousting the democratically elected government if Iran in the 50's or any other bits of our foreign intervention of the Middle East for the last 70 years as a rallying cry. 

Why didn't they blow up the towers in Switzerland? Or in Stockholm? They are decadent westerners, probably more so than the USA. Here, at least, we more believe in the same god.

c6fzsee,0,1430035662,"&gt;Tu t'attends à ce qu'ils travaillent pour le perdre? Voyons. Les riches ''font leur part''. Ils paient plus que toi proportionnellement et en absolu.

Eh oui, c'est le principe même de l'impôt progressif. Je le sais, j'ai déjà été taxé à ~40% avant que je ne parte ma propre entreprise. Je faisais partie des ""riches"", et jamais je ne me suis plaint parce que je payais trop d'impôt (il y a plein de façon de faire baisser son revenu imposable).

&gt;Ils engagent du monde et ils consomment beaucoup.

Euh, non. Ce sont les *entreprises* qui engagent du monde, pas les individus avec leur propre argent. As-tu déjà eu ta propre entreprise? Le but est justement de séparer les deux pour ne pas se retrouver financièrement responsable du succès ou de l'échec de la compagnie.

Pour ce qui est de ""consommer beaucoup"", les moins nantis dépensent en fait une plus grande partie de leur salaire que les riches. Bref, si on veut aider l'économie, il faut s'assurer que la classe moyenne ait plus d'argent dans ses poches.

Les riches, en contrepartie, dépensent une moins grande partie de leurs revenus. Ils ont beaucoup plus de chances d'en placer une grande partie, y compris à l'étranger (dans des paradis fiscaux). De plus, ils achètent plus de biens de luxe produits à l'étranger.

Il faut arrêter de répéter les clichés propagés par les riches eux-mêmes...

&gt;Les riches sont des entrepreneurs, des médecins, des professionnels et des cadres

...et c'est pourquoi le PQ veut ramener deux paliers d'impôts, comme ça ceux qui font entre 150,000 et 250,000 ne verrons qu'une légère augmentation.

&gt;Ce qui est apocalyptique, c'est la rétroactivité. Comment peut-on accepter d'imposer une nouvelle taxe à un monsieur/madame tout le monde qui a vendu son chalet ou son char en avril?

La rétroactivité sur les gains de capital (PS ça ne couvre pas un char, en passant - je ne sais pas où tu es allé chercher ça) va être abandonnée, c'est presque certain. De toute façon, ça ne couvrait ni la résidence principale, ni la résidence secondaire, mais cible plutôt ceux qui achètent et vendent des immeubles pour faire la piasse en profitant du très lucratif marché de l'immobilier - bref, ceux qui font de l'argent avec de l'argent.

&gt;Au pire il déclare que son merveilleux plan commence à la date d'élection ou en 2013.

C'est probablement ce qui va arriver pour l'augmentation de la taxe sur les gains de capital. Par contre, j'espère que la rétroactivité sur l'impôt du revenu va demeurer.

&gt;Le riche doit éventuellement se payer! Comment il le fera dépendera de la qualité de son comptable/fiscaliste.

Encore une fois, tu mélanges impôt sur les entreprises et sur les particulier. Ce n'est pas le riche qui se paie, c'est l'entreprise.

&gt;Pourquoi? Parce que le code de taxe créer par le gouvernement est plein de trou. Pourquoi? Parce que le code de taxe créer par le gouvernement vise à protéger ceux qui créent le code de taxe.

Voyons, ça n'a pas de sens ce que tu avance. En quoi le code de taxe protège-t-il celui qui crée le code de taxe? Le code de taxe est là pour s'assurer qu'on a tous accès à des services et que l'État ne se retrouve pas dans le trou. Les impôts des mieux nantis ont été trop baissés au cours des dernières années (la réduction de l'impôt maximale ayant été de loin supérieur à la réduction de l'impôt moyen - bref les riches paient proportionnellement moins d'impôt qu'avant), il suffit seulement de les ramener à un niveau plus équitable.

&gt;Il n'en attirera pas, ça c'est certain.

Encore une fois, c'est faux. C'est l'impôt sur les entreprise qui détermine si une compagnie de l'extérieur va venir s'installer ici, et cet impôt est très compétitif.

&gt;(parce que oui, les hausses de dividendes et de taxe sur le gain en capital touchent tout le monde)

Ben voyons donc...combien d'argent tu as fait en dividendes cette année, mmh? Dans quelle ""bracket"" d'impôt tu te situes, personnellement? Es-tu en train de défendre les riches parce qu'ils te disent que tu devrais les défendre, ou est-ce que c'est parce que tu prévois toi-même être riche un jour et que tu protèges ton futur magot?

Moi, en tant qu'entrepreneur, j'espère bien me retrouver à nouveau dans cette catégorie...et quand j'y serai, ça ne me dérangera pas de payer 3% de plus d'impôts, parce qu'au bout du compte *j'aurai quand même assez d'argent pour vivre très confortablement*.",t3_10qwoc,1349138658,t1_c6fz892,t5_2qhh9,t1_c6fzsee,True,,,8,0,,archiesteel,1349104599,0,False,Quebec,8,

Yes Amsterdam and Paris are outstanding biking cities.   However, for example, you can't recreate them in Houston, TX (where I live) without making some major changes to our local, regional, and national culture.    In Europe, people don't sue local governments.  Europeans have a more communal structure (I've spent years in Europe and always found it fascinating how people found seats in public transportation.  In Europe boarders tend to go for first empty seat.  In the US, boarders tend to go for the first empty bench.  Theres been lots of studies that show similar behavior.)  European cities are much denser.  European climate is much cooler....

That being said, Houston recently implemented a bike share program in our downtown district.  The bikes are nice and they are well placed, but I rarely see them used.   As far as I know, we don't have helmet requirements.

1. that graph is idiotic on so many levels. How does one measure scientific advancement? The answer is simple; you cannot. The graph also ignores Asia and the Middle-East, two regions that were flourishing at the time. 

2. The whole notion of the 'Dark Ages' is retarded and one of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to history. Technological advancement never ceased, although Western Europe did have to 'rediscover' certain things that were lost when the Western Roman Empire collapsed. 

3. The Eastern Roman Empire, by the way, didn't collapse until 1453, almost a thousand years after 476 which is the commonly accepted date for the 'fall of Rome.' (This is a very disputed fact, however.) The Great Schism of 1054 saw the birth of the Orthodox Church, I can assure you that they are Christians as well. That's not even mentioning Arianism and Nestorianism, to name but a few. None of these churches saw eye to eye so the Catholic Church is not special in this regard.

4. Finally, the Catholic Church, for the most part didn't burn people at the stake for promoting the sciences. One could argue that they were very strict when it came to viewpoints that they saw as dangerous to the Church but for the most part they sponsored aspiring scientists so as to better understand 'God's world.'

The stuff you can get in supermarkets may not suit your needs, because its very low dosed.

In Germany there are three ways medications can be labeled. (dietary supplements counting as medication here)

*Freiverkäuflich* - ""free for sale"", thats the stuff you can get at the supermarket around the corner. Far less than everywhere else in europe. Interesting for you: Only low dosed dietary supplements count as those.

*Apothekenpflichtig* - ""pharmacy-bound"" still for sale for everyone, but only available in pharmacies. Here you will find most vitamins and stuff like this, but note that it may have a different name. Try your luck at a pharmacy near you. Try to explain what ingredients you are looking for rather than telling (english/american) product names. They will try to help you and explain regulations and will be able to find what you are looking for. (eg. how it is wrapped and how much) These are most of the medications you will maybe miss in german supermarkets compared to those in the uk.

*Rezeptpflichtig* - ""prescription only"" For these kind of medication, a doctor has to prescribe it. Maybe some of the things you are looking for falls in this category. Then you have to visit a doctor. A normal GP is the best start. He either will prescript it or he will transfer you to a doctor better suited to your problem.

My advice is: Go to a pharmacy and explain to them what you are looking for. As I said above, try to tell them wich ingredients you want, if they can't help with the product names. They will help you and when you are looking for something *rezeptpflichtig*, they will know.

c6g0uz6,0,1430036167,"Elizabeth I and her establishment are primarily responsible for this- from early in her reign into the Seventeenth century Stuarts, several measures were passed (Including a significant limitation on national expenditure on standing armies, in favour of the navy*) which made it possible to raise the living standards in what had been quite a poor, peripheral European country.

Put simply, taxation was lower, beureaucracy was more limited and corruption also low, in an age when prolonged peace brought prosperity. The cottage industries grew out of the massive success on the continent of Britain's cloth and wool; and increasingly, coal. The unencumbered British economy was able to sell these goods at high profits and satisfy labour demands much better than the localised German economy, or over-taxed French. Britain was growing at the right time- from tiny state into larger population and, thanks to Henry VIII's seizure of church land, a huge proportion of land in the hands of the public. 

By the mid-eighteenth century, the time of the Industrial revolution itself, this was what Britain was like- large Private enterprise at sea and at home, which encouraged higher wages from State employees- to match the upward mobility of the working classes. When revenue was needed, it was simply that more money was at that time in the hands of the public, so more money per capita could be raised. Napoleon (following Adam Smith, of all people!) was famous for calling England ""a nation of Shopkeepers"". [This article will help explain some of the economic and political aspects of Englad's economy at the time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_shopkeepers)

Compare China, which was standing on centuries of established tradition, hegemony, and stagnation. The Ming dynasty was followed by the Qing dynasty in a messy transitional period in the Seventeenth century; but actual life for the Han Civil servants and the peasantry resembled a sustained (apart from a few blips) introspective system, built on rigid social heirarchies, conservative policy, and centralised power. The poor people who worked simply did what they'd always done in China, for centuries. They were peasants, like England in the 16th Century.

England's period of democratisation, expansion, low state expenditure and support of private enterprise was what enabled households and villages to start cottage industries in the first place. The Industrial Revolution was principally the result of an empowered and mobile underclass (who eventually shackled themselves to a new system of poverty!) ; but it was this relative wealth of the working classes that facilitated innovation in technology, and growth, feeding the Industrial Revolution.

* standing soldiers can't trade, need paying, supplying and mobilising, and recruiting. They can't profit except by plundering, and they can't fight except on land boundaries. Huge standing armies on the continent exemplified the huge expenditure and aggressive policy needed- right up to the first world war in this fashion. China had this problem too. Its enormous armies were a state-sponsered money pit; facillitating stagnation.

By contrast, a navy can constantly trade, and even privateer. The creation of a full-on global professional Navy allowed England to establish trading companies (see the mention of high levels of England's privatisation) and continually profit from exercises.",t3_10rhfi,False,t3_10rhfi,t5_2ssp3,t1_c6g0uz6,True,,,13,0,,peter_j_,1349108913,0,False,AskHistorians,13,

The mentality that results in one setting fire to one's own city is the same mentality that causes someone to throw their own cell phone across the room upon receiving bad news - frustration, helplessness and attention seeking.  Part of this frustration is certainly self-imposed, since a preponderance of religious fanatics refuse to accept a progressive view of the world - though I would argue that this is at least partially a result of cultural isolation imposed on the Middle East by the West and Russia during the Cold War.  
  
This, in turn creates a feeling of helplessness, because Middle Eastern culture has survived attempted genocide by Europeans, and various forms of occupation by turning inward - and by demonizing the culture that imposed isolation on them in the first place.  Unfortunately, this mindset works pretty well for expelling invaders (which the Arab world has spent most of the past 1000 years doing), but not so well for forming stable and productive communities.  This brings me to my thesis - this rejection of western philosophy as being, by definition, opposed to Muslim philosophy is a *de facto* rejection of the cultural concepts that have fostered global cooperation in the post-WW2 world.  So now, they are caught in a paradox where they want to get rid of the dictators, but they don't want to implement any of the fundamental concepts which guide western governance - like free speech, and religious and gender equality.

Well, it's certainly pretty unique, but for it to be effective, I think you need to include as many religious traditions as you can (although there may be an argument for sticking to more ancient traditions and avoiding major world religions).

Trouble is, this can get out of hand fast, so if you're going to keep it at a fantasy-scale, it may be best to stick with Europe, North Africa, and the Near East, so:

* Norse/Germanic
* Greco-Roman
* Celtic
* Slavic
* Ancient Near East/Pre-Islamic Traditions (Baal, YHWH, Lilith, desert spirits, djinn, etc)
* Egyptian
* Central Asian Shamanistic traditions for an exotic group of some sort.

The big sticking point I see here is that some of the old standby races, particularly elves and dwarves, are already tied into existing mythologies... so yeah. Might be troublesome.

Throw out the ""Great Old Ones,"" though. They just don't fit in a setting predicated on mixing up real world mythologies and traditions.

*Edit:* I'd also advocate against Humans being the sole domain of a single pantheon, though. Set it up that humans rebeled and then went and did their own thing (ala Abrahamic religious traditions).

In an early stage of my book I wrote this about Roosevelt's death and Truman:

""Before we landed on Takabanare, the word came down to us that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the President who most of us had known for all of our lives, had died in Warm Springs, Georgia, of a hemorrhage in his brain, precipitated by the polio that had plagued his life.

It was unfortunate, yet he was there and we are here.  

On Takabanare, there is no Jap radio.  There are still no Japs.  There are only a series of unimportant little villages, under a non-American sky.  Now, you ask Truman what he can do for us, on Takabanare, and we’ll be all ears.""

On Pyle I wrote:

""'Shame about Ernie Pyle, huh?' George said, as he took a cigarette from his pack. 'Guy getting killed like that, after all the shit he’d been through.  Makes ya wonder, huh?  Don’t even know why he was here, when he didn’t have to be.'

     It really was a shame.  It was too bad about Ernie Pyle.  The only newsman to truly earn his stripes in combat was killed on his first jaunt to the Pacific.  We all applauded him coming; and when we found out he was killed, to be honest…some Marines took it harder than the President’s death.  But it was just one of those things.  Ernie probably fired more bullets with a typewriter then some Marines did with a carbine."" 

About Germany surrendering:

""The news came as a shock, because not only did it seem like the war would go on forever—war had been so ingrained in us over the last few years, that sadly enough, we couldn’t imagine ourselves without it—but also, the fact that we were still here, combating the Japanese forces, gave a warless world a chimeric like quality, that seemed to laugh in the face of our current situation.""

     After all, the news didn’t change the position of our lines, or the texture of the mud, the tint of the sky, or the amount of ammunition each of us carried in our pouches.  Nor did it change what we knew was coming—that we’d be making another assault at the Japanese soon, and more Marines would surely die in the process—like PFC. Garner Mott, yesterday, like a few other new Marines (nobody seems to remember their names).

     Still, if there was an end to all of this, the news made it more real, somehow more tangible, less fantastical to the mind—if only for the reason that hope, like death, is a contagion that spreads, for better or worse.""

Native american identity is complicated. We identify so easily with people from African american, east Indians, Europeans so easily and criticize native Americans so frequently because we overlook a lot when we say 'oh, he's half black' or similar. What we ignore is Native Americans, like African people, and many other cultures had a concept of 'adoption' (used to vary the gene pool in small tribes, or as a reconciliation for a child lost during war time) which meant accepting non tribe born members into the tribe, this was often done through theft of babies (or children), and the same thing happens in Africa, so if we were to have an american man, half African american and half white, just because his parents are from Kenya doesn't even mean he's fully 'Kenyan' somewhere down the line his ancestors were likely kidnapped from somewhere else and introduced.

It's ignorant and shameful for people to judge Native Americans based on their percentage or tribal affiliation, the fact is, if the tribe accepts them, then they are a member, blood, lineage, etc really isn't even the deciding factor.

It's very German of them: looking to the future, never the past.  You'll notice that English and Italian motorcycle makers almost all make ""modern classics"", but not BMW.  You can buy a modern Bonneville (with disc brakes and fuel injection), but there's no such thing as a modern R60/2.

The first chapter of David Kiley's ""Getting the Bugs Out"" describes the introduction of the New Beetle.  It was an unpopular project at VW: they didn't think too highly of engineers working on making a retro car.  Engineers should work on the next big thing!  It was even carefully announced at a time and place where they could downplay it, if it looked like it wasn't going to be popular.  (It would have been an electric car prototype, and hey look at these new Jettas and Golfs.)

America loves retro.  England really loves retro.  Italy loves retro.  Even Japan does, to an extent.  Germany doesn't -- they are perennially searching for the antithesis of retro.  And living in an American city where every day I see bicyclists on fixies, and motorcyclists on CB350's, and drivers in VW bugs, I don't think that BMW really understands what it would take to break out of their niche market in America.  It's not just price.

It's great that BMW recognized the problem of traffic volume in city centers, and designed a vehicle to help combat this problem.  This could work great in Europe.  But part of the solution in America has to account for style.

His great-grandfather was even the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church (and Peter's mother came from a prominent Russian aristocratic family).

Now to address your other point. Russian history must be looked through the lens of the Mongol invasion. After having hounds from hell obliterate your entire civilization, you begin to look at things from a different point of view. The Russian people tended to value practical traits and values such as stability and safety. The best Russian rulers were the ones that tended to provide the most stability which is eventually accomplished through the creation of a relatively restrictive society.

But this didn't mean that the rulers just didn't care about their people. They just had bigger fish to fry. For the entire 1500s up until around the 1700s the monarchs had to counter a relatively strong aristocratic base without any merchant base to aid them. Because of this, there was a lot of chaos and brutality not just on the side of the Tsar but also on the side of the aristocrats. When this struggle ends, we get an absolute monarchy without a system of towns and economic centers but with the institution of serfdom (which arises as a result of the need to pay loyal servants of the Tsar with lands that only have worth if people are working on them).

So Russian society ends up socially backwards but to say that none of the rulers cared about them is just not the case. They cared about them by trying to establish a functioning state from nothing.

""WHEN an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM COULD, following a regular DECISION, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly. This would rely on appropriate CONDITIONALITY, including compliance with state aid rules, which should be institution specific, sector-specific or economy-wide and would be formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding.""

""When"", ""could"", ""decision"". This doesn't sound anything like ""Yeah! Let's all bail out Spanish banks with no guarantees!"". Frankly, if Rajoy wanted to see this as a license to kill, it's his problem, not ours.

And regarding the ""legacy problem"", the commenter was kind enough to add this:
The policy problem with including ""legacy"" issues is that EVERY country has those. So what should stop the German government from using the ESM to refinance German Landesbanken, Commerzbank or Hypo Real Estate? The only feasible way to avoid EVERY nation asking for a direct bailout is leaving the refinancing risk with the relevant sovereign - i.e. the ESM only provides the liquidity not available to (some) sovereigns on debt markets, the responsibility stays with the national governments who have a preference to maintain a nationally controlled banking sector.",t3_10r6y7,False,t1_c6fxxtl,t5_2qh4j,t1_c6g4bsr,True,,,0,0,,diehard3,1349121688,0,False,europe,0,

Cum tu ești obișnuit să judeci caracterul oamenilor după modul în care aleg să se exprime, te-ai simțit judecat pentru că așa ți se pare ție firesc. Doar că eu nu judec oamenii după *cum* vorbesc, ci după *ce* vorbesc.

Am evitat vreo dezbatere pentru că din ceea ce ai scris mi s-a părut inutilă - am sesizat acea încăpățânare a omului care și-a stabilit opinia care îl coafează cel mai bine și rămâne imun la orice argumente. Poate că nu e așa. Să încercăm.


&gt; Nu cred că există oameni maturi cărora să li se pară ceva pozitiv când le amesteci cuvintele din vocabularul de bază românesc cu cele englezești.

Nu a spus nimeni că trebuie să fie pozitiv. Pentru că pozitiv nu e singura alternativă la acel ""rău"" din titlul threadului. După părerea mea nu este nimic rău, dar nici bun, ca oamenii să se exprime în engleză în contexte în care nu este necesar s-o facă. E pur și simplu alegerea lor, nu mă deranjează și nu cred că asta mă face un om imatur.

În plus, ai folosit un argument al autorității și nu unul logic: ""oamenii maturi cred asta, deci trebuie să fie adevărat"".

&gt; simplul fapt că îți pui întrebarea dacă limba națională merită sau nu a fi protejată arată că ceva este în neregulă cu societatea noastră, care în ultimii ani a fost manelizată.

Întrebarea era alta: dacă a vorbi numai în română este o ""datorie"", nu dacă limba națională merită protejată. Nu a disputat nimeni că trebuie protejată. Doar că aici nu este cazul, fiindcă limba română nu este amenințată de nimic. Expresiile în engleză nu ne vor distruge limba, în special pentru că cei care le folosesc sunt o minoritate - tineri din mediul urban. Nici moda francofonă din secolul 19 nu ne-a distrus limba și nici romgleza nu o va face.

&gt; Dacă vorbești cu mine și amesteci engleza și româna, să știi că nu mă vei impresiona că îți lipsește în ceea ce privește vocabularul atunci când vorbești sau exprimi idei deloc greu de exprimat în ambele limbi. Îmi dai impresia că nu știi să vorbești românește.

Poate că oamenii nu amestecă engleza și româna pentru a te impresiona pe tine. Uneori așa le vine, în engleză - ceea ce nu e de mirare din moment ce suntem expuși constant la un flux de informații în engleză. Poate unii chiar o fac pentru a epata, nu știu și nici nu pretind că le cunosc motivele tuturor (așa cum îți permiți tu cu atâta lejeritate). Un început ar fi să citești diversele motive pe care le-au expus oamenii aici. Sau consideri că toți mint și de fapt folosesc engleză doar ca să facă pe interesanții?

 Indiferent de motiv, e dreptul lor să se exprime cum vor și este dreptul tău să crezi ce vrei despre asta. De exemplu că spun ""well"" fiindcă nu cunosc cuvântul ""bine"" din română. Serios, nu îți dai seama cât este de ridicolă deducția asta? Despre asta vorbeam când am spus rea-voință. Din nou, dau exemplu thread-ul ăsta: sunt destui utilizatori aici care stăpânesc limba română fără probleme, și totuși uneori aleg să se exprime în engleză. Asta nu ai observat?

&gt; Engleza e limba sărmanului, e limba cu care te descurci cât de cât peste tot

Pentru tine.

&gt; și dacă tu român o dai pe romgleza te faci de râs față de români. 

Depinde de români. Față de mine nu se face de râs decât cine vorbește prostii, indiferent în ce limbă le vorbește.

&gt; Limba română este cu mult mai frumoasă, și nu e singura.

Din nou, nu pentru toată lumea. Iar frumusețea asta are și ea limitele ei - nu mi se pare cu nimic mai melodios ""tare"" sau ""mișto"" decât ""awesome"", sau ""a dracu' vreme"" decât ""fucking weather"" - adică genul de expresii pe care lumea le folosește de obicei în engleză în loc de română.

În concluzie, părerea mea este că nu este datoria nimănui să vorbească română corect, dar ajută :)

Și ca să-ți răspund serios și la asta:

&gt; E elitism la tine când ți se cere să vorbești corect în limba ta maternă?

Nu, nu e elitism, dar e nelalocul lui să mi se *ceară* să vorbesc într-un fel sau altul.

But here is some background which makes this kinda depressing for me personally.

In the recent years a huge cultural inferiority complex developed in Ukraine. The economy is bad, the state is corrupt, social services are collapsing and you can't turn around without hearing something along the lines ""we suck so bad and they are so awesome in Europe/America."" One of the manifestation of this complex is a surge of nationalism and reinterpretation of history with the aim to show that Ukrainian culture and ""nation"" is much older and more important that previously believed. It gets totally ridiculous to the point of people claiming that, off the top of my head, Jesus Christ and Spartacus (why?) were actually Ukrainian. 

People have become obsessed with ethnicity and far more racist. The idea that ethnicity = people = nation = state is universally accepted and leads to various negative side-effects. People fight over whether you are allowed to use Russian for official paperwork and education, for example. There is a sizable of Russian-speaking people of various ethinicities in the large cities (which is my background) and there is ongoing tension between them and Ukrainian speakers. Politicians on both sides exploit and inflame this tension, but are all essentially equally corrupt. 

The woman in a few of the pictures has a picture of Yulia Timoshenko on her tshirt. Timoshenko was the prime minister in the previous administration and Ukraine's first female prime-minister. Which unfortunately I have no good feelings about because she was as corrupt as everyone else and, among other things, used her position for various shenanigans involving natural gas purchasing from Russia. She is currently in jail on related charges but after an outrageously unfair and political trial instigated by her successor.

She also happens to be on the nationalist side of the political spectrum and contributed to the ethnic strife. The fact that these women are making a point that they support her and the fact that they are wearing traditional Ukrainian shirts (which are beautiful, but nobody has dressed like this in a hundred years) makes me feel that they are motivated by nationalism.

I am all for reinterpreting history and there is nothing inherently wrong with using a romanticized version of ancient culture for empowerment and inspiration.

Cobalt Blue (very popular in European style doors)

Red (very popular in EU as well for more modern looks)

Bright Yellow (also pretty trendy now a days. Basically bright solid colors is what is ""in"")

First things first; Give the Tormentor to your Enchantress and if you have even a few hundred thousand gold, upgrade into a 1 handed weapon + source. On EU, you can get a 950 DPS 1H with 100+ Int and a socket (for crit damage) for less than a 100k and a source with reasonable top dmg (200+), 100+ Int and 8 crit is in the same ballpark. Those would have a considerable impact on your DPS right away and that Tormentor is just as well used by your Ench.

Beyond those, you can get a pair of gloves with 100+ Int, vit, Crit chance and 50+ allres for less than 50k and that's would again be a huge upgrade to your blue ones.

When you try to talk about the culture of America, you have to understand that you're talking about a huge place. We have 50 states, each of which is large enough to be its own nation were it in Europe.

Here are some things to consider about my life, to put it in perspective:

* When I went to college, I moved 560km from home. This was generally considered ""not very far.""

* My father now lives 1600km from me. Some years I don't get to see him because of the time and expense of travel.

* He and I had a vacation together recently. I took an airline, but he drove, because it was only 10 hours drive from his home.

* While we were on vacation I went to visit an old friend who lived nearby, because I'm rarely so close that I can get to see him. It was great, he was only 320km away.

* When I visit my father this christmas, I will fly to the nearest airport to his house, and then drive 110km. Or maybe I will visit my aunt first, she's about 175km from the airport... one of the reasons she and my uncle selected that location was because it's so quick and easy to get there from the airport so family can visit more easily.

Does all that give you some perspective about the size of our nation?

Now, given that, consider how much the culture can differ across such a large nation. The distance I moved to go to college would, for you, be like moving to another nation, which would probably speak another language entirely. For me, I had to learn where they put the light switches, what they call an italian sandwich or a frosted cookie or a soda, and what channels my favorite TV shows were on. But, throw in 1000 miles or so and it gets worse. When I visit the american southeast, I find some people still are angry about the US civil war (150 years ago) and resent me for it because I live in the northeast despite that neither I nor any of my ancestors were involved. There's casual everyday racism down there that people in my community are utterly appalled by. I'm gay, I can kiss a boyfriend in public and in my community nobody would care, but the last guy I was dating was from another (neighboring) state and he wouldn't hold hands with me in public because he was concerned about what the neighbors would do. 

So, try not to see the US as one big culture. It's more an awkward mashup of a lot of little cultures, which each have their own problems and features. ",t3_10g39o,False,t3_10g39o,t5_2qh2p,t1_c6g51tm,True,,,1,0,,themcp,1349124205,0,False,atheism,1,

For a comparison, this would mean it has substantially less people than Paris of 1200 AD, which was estimated to have 110,000 people.

Legal immigrants like my self (Iranian) contribute disproportionately positively to society. so don't mix all Muslims into one, there are Arabs and non Arabs, and there is a huge difference in contribution.

Case closed.

In the background, between the Emperor and the Pope is a safe keeping sunlight surrounded by shape: the French republic, Republique Rouge allegory, personification in favor of the Commune. To the left is a Russian grand duke and two Turkish fighting. Behind II. Alexander seems to pound his enthusiasm to fight the Russians against the Turks. Next to it, another massacre scene. The evil has been in retreat over the demon owl wings, accompanied by a beautiful woman, who ironically attracts a young man to himself, leaving his wife and forced her child lying on the ground. The image of the artist statement to say that the destruction of triumph, Kelety, critical contemporary thereof: the future of the republic.

Only four candidates were approved by the Guardian Council, out of the 476** men and women who had applied to seek the presidency of Iran in the 2009 election.""

&gt;""On 1 June, **a campaign office of Ahmadinejad's primary opponent, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, was torched.** The office was located in the city of Qum, in northwest Iran. No group claimed responsibility for the attack. At the same time, it was reported that **an assassination had been attempted against former president Mohammad Khatami by means of a bomb placed on an aircraft he was to board.""**

&gt;""**Mobile phone communications were interrupted in Tehran on election day** and **the BBC has stated that ""heavy electronic jamming"" was being used to halt their broadcasts.** On 23 May 2009, **the Iranian government temporarily blocked access to Facebook across the country.** Gulfnews.com reported that this move was a response to the use of Facebook by candidates running against Ahmadinejad. PC World reported that Mousavi's Facebook page had more than 6,600 supporters. Access was restored by 26 May 2009.""

&gt;""The New York Times quoted **an employee of the Interior Ministry claiming that ""the government had been preparing its fraud for weeks, purging anyone of doubtful loyalty and importing pliable staff members from around the country.""** The New Yorker stated that ""dissident employees of the Interior Ministry... have reportedly issued an open letter"" saying that the election was stolen. The Guardian has also mentioned ""reports of a leaked interior ministry figures allegedly suggesting Mousavi had won"", although the article questioned the credibility of the report."" The Guardian reported on 17 June 2009 that an Iranian news website identified **at least 30 polling sites with turnout over 100% and 200 sites with turnout over 95%.** On 21 June 2009, a spokesman from the Guardian Council (an organ of the Iranian government) stated that the number of votes cast exceeded the number of eligible voters in no more than 50 cities, something the Council argued was a normal phenomenon which had taken place in previous elections as people are not obliged to vote where registered (when they have been born).""

&gt;""According to the Telegraph, on 14 June ""Iran's regime was doing its utmost to choke off the flow of news from its capital."" **Reporters from the Italian public television broadcaster RAI stated that one of its interpreters was beaten with clubs by riot police and the officers then confiscated the cameraman's tapes.** **The Al Arabiya's offices in Tehran were closed on 14 June for a week by Iranian authorities,** who gave no explanation for the decision. Meanwhile, **the director of BBC World Service accused the Iranian Government of jamming its broadcasts** to the country. Peter Horrocks said audiences in Iran, the Middle East and Europe had been affected by an electronic block on satellites used to broadcast the BBC Persian Television signal to Iran, adding: ""It seems to be part of a pattern of behaviour by the Iranian authorities to limit the reporting of the aftermath of the disputed election"". **Al Jazeera English leveled allegations of direct media censorship by the Iranian government, stating that ""some of the newspapers have been given notices to change their editorials or their main headlines"".** **BBC correspondent John Simpson was arrested, his material confiscated, and then released.** **NBC News offices in Tehran were raided, with cameras and other equipment confiscated.** **ABC News reporter Jim Sciutto also has had material taken. People from the German public broadcasters ZDF and ARD have been harassed as well, with men carrying batons and knives reportedly storming the ARD's Tehran office. A BBC corporate official has referred to the network's conflict with the regime as 'electronic warfare'.** On 13 June 2009, when thousands of opposition supporters clashed with the police, Facebook was filtered again. **Some news websites were also blocked by the Iranian authorities. Mobile phone services including text messaging also stopped or became very difficult to use.** Specifically, **all websites affiliated with the BBC were shut off,** as were ones with The Guardian. Associated Press labeled the actions ""ominous measures apparently seeking to undercut liberal voices"". The restrictions were likely intended to prevent Mousavi's supporters from organizing large-scale protests. The protesters used phone calls, e-mails and word of mouth to get around the measures.""

There was even a Godwin's law violation:
&gt;"" It was marked by heated rhetoric between the incumbent and his challengers. Mousavi and two other candidates said Ahmadinejad had lied about the state of the economy, which was suffering from high inflation and a fall in oil revenues from last year's record levels. Ahmadinejad responded by comparing his opponents to Adolf Hitler, adding that they could be jailed for their comments. ""No one has the right to insult the president, and they did it. And this is a crime. The person who insulted the president should be punished, and the punishment is jail... Such insults and accusations against the government are a return to Hitler's methods, to repeat lies and accusations... until everyone believes those lies,"" Ahmadinejad said.""

&gt;Fifth: the Arab governments' invitation to the people of Palestine to flee from it and seek refuge in adjacent Arab countries, after terror had spread among their ranks in the wake of the Deir Yassin event. This mass flight has benefited the Jews and the situation stablized in their favor without effort.... Since 1948 we have been demanding the return of the refugees to their homeland, while it is we who constrained them to leave it. Between the invitation extended to the refugees and the request to the United Nations to decide upon their return, there elapsed only a few months.[13]
&gt;After the war, a few Arab leaders tried to present the Palestinian exodus as a victory by claiming to have planned it. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Said was later quoted as saying: ""We will smash the country with our guns and obliterate every place the Jews shelter in. The Arabs should conduct their wives and children to safe areas until the fighting has died down.""[14]
&gt;The Arab National Committee of Haifa, the Arab leadership in Haifa in 1948, wrote and delivered a report on the flight of roughly 60,000 Arabs from Haifa. The report said, ""[T]he removal of the Arab inhabitants from the town was voluntary and carried out at our request.""[15]
&gt;A Muslim weekly newspaper in Beirut similarly reported, ""Who brought the Palestinians to Lebanon as refugees, suffering now from the malign attitude of newspapers and communal leaders ...? The Arab States [sp], and Lebanon amongst them, did it!""[16]
&gt;Jamal Husseini, the brother of Palestinian military and religious leader Hajj Amin Husseini, wrote to the Syrian UN representative, ""The regular [Arab] armies did not enable the [Arab] inhabitants of [Palestine] to defend themselves, but merely facilitated their escape from Palestine.""[17] Furthermore, Palestinian Arab protesters in the West Bank took to the streets on the occasion of ""the first anniversary of Israel's establishment"" to place blame on ""the Arab states for the creation of the refugee problem.""[18]
&gt;Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian National Authority, writing in 1972 in Falastin el-Thawra, the official journal of the Palestine Liberation Organization, wrote that:
&gt;The Arab armies entered Palestine to protect the Palestinians from the Zionist tyranny but, instead, they abandoned them, forced them to emigrate and to leave their homeland, and threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live in Eastern Europe, as if we were condemned to change places with them: they moved out of their ghettos and we occupied similar ones. The Arab States succeeded in scattering the Palestinian people and in destroying their unity[19][20][21][22]

In addition to what was also written below, I would like to add a few more comments about bonds for people to consider. To clarify, US T-bills are sovereign bonds the same as bonds from other countries, say Germany and the UK.  The biggest difference is that with regard to the Euro, the Fed has the ability to mint currency to ensure that the obligation of repayment is paid in full as per the instrument's requirement.  In Europe, bonds of EU member states do not have this protection because Monetary Financing was successfully banned into the Lisbon Treaty, via a strong interjection from Germany.  The ECB simply cannot print currency and hand it to member states' governments directly to prevent default.  This part of the reason why there is real fear that some states will default on their obligations and why bond yield rates in these countries are so high. Investors of course want compensation for the risk they are carrying that they might not get paid, in the form of strong interest.  This is bad for governments, as they have to pay more out to cover the bonds than many of them can afford. 

The other thing worth mentioning is that just because the Fed can print currency to cover a potential T-bill default does not inherently make them safer than other instruments, as OP implied. It means that the Government will pay them off with currency, but that is as far as it goes. 

Let's look at an example of what I mean.  Currently, the Fed has just began a third round of QE (quantitative easing) by which it is trying to inject money into the economy to stabilise it and encourage positive growth. IIRC, the new program is worth 40bn a month to buy up either former toxic-securities or T-bills so that those assets can be written off the books of the firms holding them. The theory is that by having the Fed take on this debt through a bond buying program, both investor confidence and market growth can return because it will have absorbed the damage done by the Crash.

How this relates to discussion is inflation.  The big downside of QE and what can potentially make bonds less valuable in the long run is inflation. Remember that bonds are fixed interest rate instruments, so they are not inflation proof.  Inflation can be both bad and good for fixed rate instruments, depending on which party we are referring to.  For someone trying to pay off a fixed rate debt, inflation is good.  When inflation raises the value of goods and services as a result of their being more money in the system, the amount needed to pay off a debt stays the same.  Governments try to use this 'inflating away' of debts to potentially deal with debts.  Now for people, it can still be bad if wages don't go up and goods/services are more expensive, but their isn't a corresponding rise in wages to make up for it.  Then they'd in real terms have less money to pay the debt off.

So the point here is about purchasing power parity. If the Fed can't sell off all it's acquisitions to retract the liquidity it injected into the system, then the US will face some severe inflation problems in the near future. The Fed has effectively tripled the supply of money, so future inflation is a very dangerous potential problem.  If it hits in a significant way, say above 10% those T-bills will only drive more inflation as the Fed has to keep printing more money to pay for them, and their yields in real terms will be worth much less.  Further, investors who might be interested in buying them will not be so confident in their safety or smart yields in the value of the dollar drops relative to other currencies.  This is especially true if dollar value problems cause FX problems in China leading to a surge in the value of the yuan relative to the dollar, which would hurt US firms.  Or if the US reaches a 'credit limit' in that investors don't feel that T-bills are a smart bet and don't continue to buy them, which would allow the US to refinance it's debt.  If they move to other currencies like the Swiss Franc, the Euro, or the Pound then those 'safe' T-bills won't be worth the paper their written on. 

This is one reason that threats to keep the debt ceiling static produced a credit downgrade. ",t3_10kfz0,False,t1_c6ehcha,t5_2sokd,t1_c6g6hkk,True,,,2,0,,we_who_love_freedom,1349129462,0,False,explainlikeimfive,2,

But, what this author does not relate, is that the Tanak (Old Testament) does show equality to homosexuality, but it lies within the matrilineal faith, associated with Asherah, followed by Iyzebel (Jezebel), which is an abomination in the eyes and writings of the Deuteronomists and the Priesthood. 

You cant undo gender sexuality hatred by twisting a text to make it say what you wish it said, but you can educate people on the realities of a hatemongering religion and show them a better way than hate. The egalitarian matrilineal systems all showed not only tolerance for the many genders and sexuality, but often favor. While I am an egalitarian, I spent a decade as a Christian and nearly a decade following the Hebraic parent of Christianity, all the while intensively studying and researching the texts, the linguistics, comparative languages and texts of the cultures, the laws, etc., before getting out of those systems altogether.

&gt;We also had control of our own monetary system, Greece does not have that luxury. So, you are correct in that the Greek options are limited.

Our currency did not significantly appreciate or depreciate in those years (w.r.t. the US dollar at least).

I definitely agree that from the point of view of having stability, losing control over your monetary system and bundling your fortune with 20+ countries that have significantly different economies/cultures/histories was a dumb idea.

Haha I had not seen that Joga Bonito -clip until now. That's hilarious.

About the other ""Gods"" of Sweden I have to say that they don't come close to Zlatans status here. Don't get me wrong, everyone in Sweden (well, mostly of the male gender) knows who Forsberg, Näslund, Lundqvist (although he had kind of a Zlatan-status for a while), Sundin, the Sedin-twins, Zetterberg etcetc are. A huge number of kids play hockey over here and all of Sweden hold their breath when the national team plays. But hockey is such a small sport in Europe. It's super popular here in Sweden, Finland, Russia and the smaller countries like Latvia, Estonia (also Norway gets better and better) and NHL is the big dream for kids (including me, well, was anyways). But when it comes to popularity here nothing beats football. _Everyone_ plays football here. It's so simple, all you need is a ball pretty much. The equipment is not even close to as expensive as the ones for hockey or floorball (also a huge sport here, kind of a goofy sport). Every family here have a football in their garage. Also the time-difference is kind of an issue, since most of the NHL-games are played at like 2 am over here. 

So to summarize: Even though football is huge here, we have a really weak scene of international professionals. No other Swedish football-player have ever, or will in a long time, come close to Zlatans success abroad. His life-story is also a big part of his popularity here. He came from pretty much nothing, raised in Rosengård, a part of south Sweden where immigration is a big problem (the closest to 'gang'-area we come in Sweden, where police, ambulance and firemen are often welcomed with rocks and bottles). Well he came from nothing, and became huge. 

Sidenote: I'm a little anxious about talking about Zlatans popularity outside of Sweden. He is the biggest thing we have here, but I have a lack of perspective from other 'unbiased' (the media is all over him also) sources. Maybe they are blowing his greatness out of proportions, but he is without a doubt huge here. I'd say the TV-channels loses about 1/4th of the viewers on a international football-match if Zlatan doesn't play. It's really like a cult, and we don't mind.

Remember a few years back when an upper floor of a mall in South Korea collapsed, crushing a bunch of people?  Turned out the floor was inadequately tied back to the walls.  Or that mall in the Middle East a few months back where there was a fire and a bunch of kids trapped in a child care area died?

I thought on both those occasions it was the typical graft, corruption and incompetence you get in developing nations (although South Korea is arguably now a developed nation).  Folks taking shortcuts through lack of skill or out to make a quick buck.  Same old story, whoop-de-do, what's on MTV?

More recently, however, I've been following the commission of enquiry into the collapse of the [CTV Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Building) during last year's earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 115 people died.  Exactly the same story - incompetent engineer did the initial design, owner of the firm didn't want to know when shortcomings were brought to his attention, guy managing the construction turned out to have stolen someone else's identity and forged his qualifications.  

New Zealand has some pretty strict building regulations with regards to earthquake tolerance and it's got an effective judicial system and one of the lowest levels of corruption in the world.  Still, 115 people died because of incompetence and corruption.

If they were interested in removing the practice of the faith (as opposed to an entire race or ethnic group), the Nazis would have targeted only those Jews who kept the traditions, i.e. the Orthodox Jews and the Conservative and Reform Jews. However, the Nazis deported people who grew up as Christians because they had one Jewish grandparent. It was an issue of genetics, not religious practice. Some people who were deported for having ""Jewish blood"" were unaware that they were Jewish at all as many people were not open about being Jewish at that time in Europe. Atheist Jews and Jews whose parents and grandparents had converted to Christianity were persecuted and murdered in exactly the same way as practising religious Jews. 

But that's still completely irrelevant to my entire point. You are focusing on specific cases. I'm only talking in the broad sense.

&gt; A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort — that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly more common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.

From the page on medical genetics of Jews:

&gt; Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of endogamy, yet they are sizable.

In fact that entire page contains lists of genetic disorders that are highly prevalent among various Jewish ethnicities (not just the Ashkenazim), which are not equally among among Arabs. 

From the wiki on Jewish ethnic divisions:

&gt; Despite the evident diversity displayed by the world's distinctive Jewish populations, both culturally and physically, genetic studies have demonstrated most of these to be genetically related to one another, having ultimately originated from a common ancient Israelite population that underwent geographic branching and subsequent independent evolutions.

Check out the rest of that page. It details the origins of the various ethnic subgroups of Jews. The fact is that for the most part Jewish populations have been historically endogamous, and unlike other religions are not aggressive in conversion. This means that 2 Jews from across the world (say an Ashkenazim in Germany and Yemeni Jew in Yemen) have far more in common genetically than two Muslims across the world (say a Turkish Muslim and an Indonesian Muslim).

Yes but as I mentioned they also supplied the rebels, and many of the rebel ships were built in American shipyards.

&gt;The Doctrine Monroe stated of course that it would protect the Americas from European intervention, but was it really for the sake of freedom?


The Monroe Doctrine is difficult to disassemble and the two men who are most directly involved in its assembly had very different meanings of the Doctrine. Monroe was very concerned with the cause of Latin American Liberty ( and if needed I can provide some letters), whereas JQA was much more concerned with the Russians in the NW and primarily viewed the doctrine as useful for economic means. As time goes on different Presidents and Secretary of States interpret and use the doctrine differently. I however am under the firm belief that Monroe was concerned with the cause of Latin America, however I do agree that ultimately the United States would act in its own best interest, but really couldn't the same be said of every state? Politicians tend to have two motives one is based on ideology and the other on national interests, in almost every case the national interests tend to triumph the ideology.

Edit: I think you are right in that the Monroe Doctrine was in the interest of the United States, but there was also a deep strain of ideology that celebrated the notion of the Old World Vs. the New that played a role as well, this is particularly evident in Henry Clay the so called ""friend of Latin America"".

c6g97sc,0,1430040174,"&gt;I didn't realize dead children were OK as long as it's ""collateral damage"" 

I literally said ""Not saying collateral damage is ok"", please read more carefully next time. Also, I don't have context to say how they died, but I don't believe the children were killed on orders or simply because they're Palestinian, which seems to be your conclusion. 

&gt;I'm not sure why you and many others seem to think Jewish people have a monopoly on suffering. Atrocities a are happening on a daily basis around the world. It doesn't make much sense to ignore them because, in your opinion, something much worse happened before it.

Again, I said absolutely nothing of the kind. Jews do not have a monopoly on suffering, suffering happens every day in every country on this planet. And something much worse did happen before it. You cannot equate the Holocaust and Palestinian struggles, but it would make zero sense to ignore atrocities occurring now. There are obviously problems with the situation in the Palestinian Territories, but it is not from a one sided persecution of the other. The entire problem is based on a lack of trust between the two sides. No ones hands are clean, but it is empirically not one sided. By the way you assume things about me, I can only think that you are projecting pre-conceived notions on the intent of my replies.

&gt;What if I downplayed the Holocaust by mentioning how Stalin killed many more people during the same time frame? Well that would make me an anti-semite, but I digress.

Stalin did kill more of his own people than Nazi's did of theirs and their neighbors. The point of the holocaust was genocide against Jews. If you go by death numbers, there was more collective suffering for the Russian people during Stalin's reign. I wouldn't jump into a conversation about the suffering of Russians and down play it with the holocaust, they are unrelated (with the exception of Stalin shipping Jews to Germany before Hitler betrayed him) and not within the same context. 
The Palestinian struggle for land and Independence pales in comparison to 6 out of every 9 Jews being killed in Europe.
To me, equating the Holocaust with Palestinian struggles is downplaying Holocaust. It. Truly. Is. I will not let any people be systematically executed, and I will not let anyone forget the largest genocide perpetrated by a western nation to be forgotten. I will also, while I am alive and breathing, not allow people to slowly chip away the horror of the Holocaust and relegate it to ""it wasn't so bad"" or ""that was so long ago"".  I didn't jump into a existing conversation about about Palestinian struggles and down play it with the holocaust to belittle Palestinian struggles. I replied a comment that is part of the chipping. You EQUATED, with your comparison pictures, the Holocaust and the Palestinian struggles. You downplayed the Holocaust, and I responded to your context less pictures. 

And that would not make you anti-semetic. Hatred of Jews (actively or passively) makes someone an anti-semite, just like hatred of black people makes one racist or hating Arabs makes one racist. Anti-semite means racist against Jews since the Jewish people are not a ""race"" in the conventional sense. 

&gt;isn't the fact that the people who suffered firsthand from these grievances have seemingly learned nothing from it the most depressing?

Again you portray the Palestinian struggles as a one sided persecution by Israel. This is ABSOLUTELY not correct and you know it. You say that Jews (and therefore Israelis) should have learned...what? More compassion? To treat others the way they want others to treat them? That getting systematically murdered and having hide for your life sucks?

The biggest takeaway by Jews of the systematic murdering of their people, is that people will, and have tried to, exterminate them. That's what Never Forget means. Jews learned that no one is going to stand up for you; you have to protect yourself. And that thought is reinforced  every single time Israel has been attacked, whether it be when the Arab leadership promised to push Israel and its people into the sea in 1948, 1967, and 1973, or whether it comes up in the rhetoric almost every time Hamas speaks. In the back of their minds, every Jew (not Israeli) carries with them the fear of being murdered simply for their heritage, not even their religion. 

From this, you should have learned that Jews don't take kindly to the threat of extinction whether it is sabre-rattling or not. And when Israel stops being attacked or threaten with being attacked, it will stop worrying about security. Also, the Holocaust and Palestinian struggles are not equatable.

c6g9p7b,0,1430040403,"I think everyone's background influences their outlook on life.  There are a few common ways that I think Jewish culture and history has influenced many (if not most) Jews.

For centuries in Europe, Jews were culturally, physically, and economically isolated.  Basically, Jews were legally restricted to living in certain areas (the word ""ghetto"" originally described the Jewish section of Italian cities) and engaging in certain trades.  They were often considered property of the King.  This isolation resulted in a separate Jewish culture that emerged along side of (and was influenced to some extent by) the surrounding culture.  Many of the trades Jews were allowed to practice relied on intellectual work in a time when most of the people in the surrounding culture were farmers.  This, combined with Judaism's emphasis on studying Jewish law and texts, resulted in a high emphasis on education.  Also, Jews were historically oppressed by very conservative governments (like the Russian Czars).  This, combined with high education rates, resulted in a tendency toward left-leaning politics.

I would say that most Jews today, or at least most American Jews, place a very high emphasis on education, tend to support minority rights and individual liberties, and tend to vote Democratic rather than Republican (usually about 75%-25% in favor of Democrats whereas white Christians vote more like 40/45%-55/60% in favor of Republicans).  Also, many comedians are Jewish.  I think this comes from being enough of an ""insider"" to understand the prevailing culture, but enough of an ""outsider"" to see quirks/problems/contradictions in it.

I hope this answered your question.

As far as traveling to another city goes, where are you thinking of going?  In most major American cities and colleges there are large Indian populations, and you can often find significant Bengali populations in particular.  It's very common for people moving to a new country to find a few people from their old country that they connect with and make new friends through them.

I would say if in doubt, go for it!  You can always come back if you don't like it.  And if that happens, at least you'll have a new interesting experience to share with your friends back home.  If it goes well, then you're set.

c6g9sxm,0,1430040451,"Sure, talking specifically about 'insider trading', it's something rather old-fashioned and not worth going to the slammer for. It's usually just idiot individuals with terrible financial managers who get caught doing that, isn't it?

But; given the events of recent years, it seems that a large proportion of the biggest players have found they are able to generate extraordinary profit from practices and schemes that are either already illegal, or haven't yet been explicitly made crimes despite being clearly immoral and dishonest.

I think that most of us prior to 2007 would have dismissed this as conspiracy nonsense; that firms like Goldman Sachs were far too valuable as companies to risk tarnishing them with sleazy behaviour.

Unfortunately, it's now clear that GS and all the others are extremely sleazy in their business practices, and have, in the past 70 years or so, engineered a regulatory framework that is utterly toothless. They don't bother with 'insider trading' because they have developed dozens and dozens of complicated fraudulent schemes to  snare themselves ever-increasing sums no matter where the market goes or who goes broke.

The story of Jefferson County, highlighted by Matt Taibbi last year, shows the kind of institutionalized corruption and ethics-free looting of public treasuries that all the big firms have been involved with in the last decade or more.

There are dozens of similar stories about completely different ways people have been deceived and defrauded by the big firms. The professor who developed the 'Dragon Dictation' system of speech-to-text software built a company worth $400 million(!) and is now near penniless. A European company had offered to buy Dragon Systems and GS engineered the deal. They got their fee, but it turned out the European company was a sham and it folded almost immediately - and GS had recommended to the Professor that he take all his payment in stock. The subsequent trial has showed GS executives to be blithely unconcerned by any harm they have caused, or responsibility to  do any k ind of due diligence on behalf of their client.

The case of the GS dealer and those emails describing their own deals as 'shit' was similarly revealing about the attitude these guys have toward the possibility that they are committing crimes. They really don't care.

Most of this could be fixed trivially by actually putting people in jail,and abolishing those 'pay a fine but admit no guilt' bullshit deals. When companies get to eliminate all culpability just by paying a fine, it reduces criminal behaviour to a pretty simple profitability question, with no room for any kind of moral judgments.

And it's not just cases that were prosecuted by the SEC. Rigging the LIBOR rate is clearly illegal and immoral behaviour. The practice of hiring college dropouts (even high-school dropouts!) to spend 8 hours a day unwittingly committing hundreds of crimes a day by signing thousands of mortgage documents referring to evidence they had never seen. That was an *epidemic* in some of the biggest mortgage brokers in the US.

The whole industry is rife with criminal exploitation of the ignorance of most consumers, as well as entrenched advantages for insiders. It's not the technical definition of 'insider trading', but obviously it's every bit as corrosive to society, probably more so.

Case in point, most of the European Jewish population lived through the Black Death because they had religious traditions that dictated cleanliness and a basic higher level of hygiene than everyone else around them, and this is one of the factors that led to European Antisemitism.

If the population of Medieval Europe had been much cleaner and had practiced better quarantine and separation methods, like they did in Florence where the Black Death was largely mitigated, then it probably wouldn't have been much worse than a various ""Animal"" Flu epidemic.",t3_10rhzg,False,t1_c6g9wuy,t5_2qh61,t1_c6ga8pf,True,,,2,0,,[deleted],1349146077,0,False,WTF,2,

Do you understand the concept of inductive reasoning? It's the basis of Scientific knowledge. 

&gt; Hell, neither of your articles even contains the words ""Israel"" or ""Jew"". 

You can easily do a google search on how eager American zionist Jews have been to spy for CIA and Mossad. Hell, American zionists Jews even have a history of screwing over the US and giving over top secret info to the Mossad. 

And then you have Daniel Peal, some dodgy Zionist Jew (and yeah, he was a devout zionist believer) in the middle of Pakistan while the US was engaged in a mass murderous bombing and invasion campaign next door in Pakistan. Totally, chosen bro. Nothing fishy going on there!


&gt; Hell, after the ridiculous recitation of their little speech they made him give, don't you think they could have extracted any and all real information about his job from Daniel under pain?

Even homicidal Muslim terrorists realize that torture doesn't produce reliable information. There not dumb like zionist jews are. 

&gt; Even his killers didn't think he was CIA and gave no indication they thought he was CIA.

How do you know that? They believed he was an agent of western imperialism and Zionism is a terrible crime however you want to spin it. 

&gt; He was a Jew, and that was enough for them.

Yet if they encountered Noam Chomsky or Norm Finkelstein they wouldn't have been beheaded.  They would have very likely been treated very well. And if they met a Jewish convert to Islam they would have been ecstatic and offered them their sisters for marriage. So clearly, being a Jew has nothing to do with it. Muslims don't have a problem with Jews, they have a problem with the racist European ideology called zionism. Antisemitsm is also a racist western ideology. Muslims didn't commit the Holocast. Your precious western civilization did. You need to stop imposing nazi antisemitic bogeyman everywhere. Get help.

&gt;~~Site~~ Cite your data.

The data behind the chart comes from [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313/5788/765.summary). 

&gt;Beginning in 1985, national samples of U.S. adults have been asked whether the statement, “Human beings, as we know them, developed from earlier species of animals,” is true or false, or whether the respondent is not sure or does not know. We compared the results of these surveys with survey data from nine European countries in 2002, surveys in 32 European countries in 2005, and a national survey in Japan in 2001 (5). Over the past 20 years, the percentage of U.S. adults accepting the idea of evolution has declined from 45% to 40% and the percentage of adults overtly rejecting evolution declined from 48% to 39%. The percentage of adults who were not sure about evolution increased from 7% in 1985 to 21% in 2005. After 20 years of public debate, the public appears to be divided evenly in terms of accepting or rejecting evolution, with about one in five adults still undecided or unaware of the issue. This pattern is consistent with a number of sporadic national newspaper surveys reported in recent years (6–10). 

&gt;The 2005 data from 32 European countries was collected by the European
Commission in its Eurobarometer Survey 63.1, conducted through personal interviews
during the first quarter of 2005. Eurobarometer studies of all member states of the
European Union are conducted twice each year. In recent years, the Eurobarometer has
been expanded to include both the member states and several other nations that are
1
candidates for membership in the EU or are neighboring states that have decided not to
join the EU. A total of 31,390 adults were interviewed in the Eurobarometer 63.1 study.

&gt;The U.S. data for the
years 2004 and 2005 were collected online using samples of approximately 2,000 adults
from a probability-based national panel maintained by Knowledge Networks, Inc. Both
the 2004 and 2005 studies were conducted as a part of an evaluation of two NSF-funded
projects conducted by ScienCentral, Inc. (NSF grants ESI-0201155 and ESI-0206184).
The U.S. Science and Engineering Indicators data are deposited at the Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).

This same ignorance was held by some of the early European Feminists. The International Women’s Suffrage Alliance (British feminists ~1900) came to Egypt in an attempt to “awaken” their “sisters” to their equal rights without realizing there was already a large movement occurring.  The IWSA was perhaps the perfect example of criticism of Western feminism even today—It presumes some sort of equality and sisterhood while at the same time maintaining a, by definition superior, “mentoring role for the Western Feminist.” (Margot Badran)  

And now, here we are a century later having the SAME conversation, proliferating the same stereotypes that take away women's agency!  You'd think we Western/White Feminists would have learned by now.

Sorry, didn't mean for it to come off that way; just kind of annoyed at the overall sentiment of ""record companies are evil, greedy and lazy"" (actually can't really argue that last one since I *am* on Reddit during work) that permeates the internet.  As for source, well, me, since it's what I do, but I'm sure you can find lots of books out there on the subject.

Your link is fairly accurate for the US (and for a lot of European countries), although it completely ignores things like publishing royalties. Artists are paid a higher royalty, get paid an advance in many cases, but are also forced to pay for production, and in many cases, advertising.  Record companies will not pay additional royalties until these costs are recouped.  Management system is such that the artists are the ones hiring managers/lawyers/accountants, so in the end, they make little to no money in actual record royalties, and instead have to make up for it in publishing royalties and live performances.

In Japan, it's completely different.  The artists are usually on the payroll of a larger corporate management firm.  The management and the label split the cost of creating a master recording (production fees), and the artists are paid a minimal royalty.  Why?　Because as is the same with TV tarento, singing or playing an instrument **does not give you copyright** (you do earn some neighboring rights, though).  
However, since all the actual production costs are picked up by the label/management, record royalties accrue from day1 (unless you receive an advance, which again, is not that common) for both artists (performers) and composers.

This means that production and advertising/marketing is mostly out-of-pocket for record labels.  Especially in Japan, where the pop music scene is so dependent on TV and movie tie-ins, this means a lot of resources go into placing the music in the right commercials/movies/dramas.  For many of the new acts, the resulting sales rarely justify the expenses put in.

By 1916, the Germans, Austrians, and Ottoman Turks had seemingly won the war. Russia was in turmoil and about to be swallowed up by communist revolution. France had suffered horrible losses, and Britain was under a German U-boat blockade. **Germany made an offer to Britain to end the war under conditions favorable to Britain.** But the British, and the international Zionists, had one more card to play!

The British government and the Zionist leaders struck a dirty deal. The Zionists were led by Chaim Weizmann, the man who one day become the first President of the State of Israel. The idea was for the Zionists to use their influence to drag the mighty USA into the war on Britain's side, so that Germany and it's Ottoman allies could be crushed. In exchange for helping to bring the USA into the war, the British would reward the Zionists by taking over Palestine from the conquered Ottomans after the war was over. The British had originally wanted to give the Zionists a jewish homeland in an African territory. But the Zionists were fixated on claiming Palestine as their land. Once under British control, the jews of Europe would be allowed to immigrate to Palestine in great numbers. 

Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff, and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson. Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty “Huns”, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous year’s Lusitania “incident”, entered the war on Britain's side under the ridiculous pretext of “making the world safe for democracy”. 

BTW, did you the Zionist bankster and presidential adviser Bernard Baruch increased his personal wealth from $1 million to $200 million during WW I and that he became Chairman of the War Industries Board? You could say he is the Father of the Military Industrial Complex. 

**In the 1920s and 30s, Baruch expressed his concern that the United States needed to be prepared for the possibility of another world war.** He wanted a more powerful version of the War Industries Board, which he saw as the only way to ensure maximum coordination between civilian business and military needs.

c6gbil7,0,1430041259,"I may be a bit late to the party, but I just wanted to put in a counter to pitzips 'get rid of the truck' viewpoint.  I've been doing something very similar to what you're suggesting.  After graduating college I had managed not only to stay out of debt thanks to some very generous scholarships, but working part time through the year and summers had built me up a modest pile of savings, and I got it into my head that the most interesting thing I could do with that money was head to the south (I'm from Boston, went to school near LA) where land prices were lower and try to start a subsistence farm.  I bought an old F150 from a local driveway sealant business and started tacking some modifications on.  I picked up a mattress and built a cab flush camper-shell on the truck bed out of plywood, thinking I'd live out of the back until I found myself an acre or two, and then would pull off the cover and turn it into a farm horse, so to speak.  I got as far as the western carolinas before I remembered just how much I love the road (I had done a bit of traveling on foot in the style suggested by pitzips across Europe when I managed to get a free ride to Cambridge University for a couple terms during college).  So instead of shelling out for a corner of backwoods agriculture I just kept rolling.  I circled around and headed back to New England for a family wedding after a month and change, and worked a bit more on the truck, used the plywood leftovers from the camper shell to build shelving into the back seat (it was a supercab), and rigged up a solar system on the back for about $150, so I could charge a cell phone etc and run my laptop at night, which was important to me as someone who loves writing and hopes to land a modest book deal one of these days.  Currently I'm crawling my way cross-country to spend time with college friends on the west coast but going anywhere is always an opportunity to see everything in between.

Anyways, I'm a bit drunk and I'm sorry to be rambling.  The point is that with a truck with a few modest modifications (mine probably totaled under $300 over several months, but I'm one of the cheapest people you will meet), I've got a complete set up.  I cook on a rocket stove improvised from an old white-gas canister that burns little twigs and things I scrounge up as I go along.  I fish where I can, but mostly eat simple rice and bean dishes, breads, fresh in-season fruits and veggies when on sale or the rarer event that foraging for them yields anything notable. Combine that with a couple pieces of cast-iron cookware and it's a full kitchen and pantry.

When you've got a truck, boondocking is the name of the game.  Sometimes that's as simple as camping out in the backwoods on federal or state land.  It's nice to get out there and be able to spread out without anybody bothering you.  Other times you can stealth it near big box stores or city streets where people park overnight.  Walmart is a name you will hear a lot, and rightfully so, because it is more or less a boondocker's paradise.  Find yourself a supercenter and you've got a massive, sprawling parking lot that is totally underutilized at night, you've got patrolling security that is totally chill with you being there for a few nights, you've got a store with absolutely everything you could need in a pinch open 24-hours, accessible bathrooms, etc.  Between backwoods camping and urban boondocking it's been months since I've spent money on a place to sleep.  My expenses are nothing but gas and food, for the most part.  It comes out to less than I would spend on rent alone for a cheap room in the cheapest corner of the country, and I spend every night in a new town, drifting here and there.  Put yourself out there with nothing to rely on and with nothing to spend and every night is an adventure.  It definitely takes a certain mindset to take pleasure in solving the kinds of problems that crop up living this lifestyle, but I think anyone who would choose to go nomad already fits that description.

My solution for the money problem is mostly don't spend it, and when I need to earn it don't waste time trying to get the job you're most qualified for.  Learn to take care of yourself and work with your hands, if you don't already know how, and more importantly know how to enjoy it, and then there are always little jobs here and there that'll pay you enough to keep you going without any sacrifices made.

So I was wrong with my perceived conclusions of *The Road to Serfdom*, tell me though have Hayek's predictions been that accurate? Western/Northern europe, Japan, S. Korea, Canada, and of course the US all have varying degrees of the welfare state, regulatory agencies, and so on that Hayek warns about in *The Road to Serfdom* (going by the abstract/summary). Can you honestly say citizens living in western democracies are in any meaningful way closer to living under a totalitarian regime today than they were 60 years ago?     

In response to your end portion, you assert that the federal reserve should be private, please give foundation as to how the public good would be better promoted should the federal reserve (or some other hypothetical central bank) were entirely private. 

&gt;I'm writing a thesis on Development and comparative institutions, but I'm not going on about it on reddit anymore. Austrian school is flawed but Keynesianism is wrong.

I'd say the great depression and the late '00 financial crisis show it is quite the opposite (Keynes is flawed, but Hayek is wrong). The federal government and federal reserve response to the crisis by propping up failing institutions, flooding the markets with money, and spending stimulus money really headed off the recession. Obviously we are still dealing with the fallout of the financial crisis, but it is nowhere near as bad as it could be. Which brings me to Europe. On the other hand, Spain, Greece, and Ireland while they (through the ECB and richer Eurozone countries) have propped up their financial institutions, they have also severely reduced government spending. This reduction in government spending has then pushed already weak economies over the edge, now Greece and Spain are in full blown economic depressions with the former having 25% unemployment and something like 50% youth/young adult unemployment. Don't know about you, but ~8% unemployment sounds about three times better than ~25%.

Further I guess to touch on the great depression, in the US when it began largely the federal government and federal reserve response was to do nothing (to which I believe Bernanke apologized a couple of years ago for). The US may have still had a decade of stagnant economic growth, but there is good reason to believe that the federal government federal reserve responded to black tuesday the way they did with the financial crisis, we being calling our current cycle ""the great recession II"" not just ""the great recession.""

c6gcfmc,0,1430041694,"Sorry to interrupt, but there are a few junglers who can actually manage it pretty fine. You probably started playing in Season 1, where the jungle was merciless and unforgiving, however, since Riot claimed this new jungle is so much beginner-friendlier I made a few runs without runes and masteries and there are a lot of junglers who can jungle to some degree even at level 10 without runes. Plus, people really don't go cloth+5 pots anymore, but on low level it makes the jungle a lot more accessible.

For Anonkipz, I would recommend starting with a jungler that has a lot of sustain. That way, he can get some experience in the jungle and concentrate on important things like ganking or map presence instead of desperately trying not to die in the jungle. Warwick would be a good choice, since he has really easy mechanics and is an immovable object in the jungle (I'm thinking he's bound to run into smurfs who have jungle experience, and Warwick will survive without a problem). Another possibility would be trying out Fiddlesticks.

Once you get more experience with Warwick, you can move on to another strong jungle pick who can manage without runes: Phoenix Udyr. 

If you're gonna settle with Mundo, practice in custom games until you get the route done a couple times without dying. For jungle masteries, it's important that you take +Armor and mitigate the Minion damage by using the respective masteries in the Defense tier. It might also be a good idea to take either Veteran's scars or Bladed armor since you've already invested a few points into defense. Both will help you in the jungle significantly, and I believe it is a matter of preference. I personally will take Veteran's Scars since the tankiness usually benefits me more than the additional damage I can deal to minions (although bladed armor really helps if you have trouble with the Wraith camp).

There is one thing to consider, though: If you want to jungle, you will most likely leave someone 1 versus 2 on your level. If that guy doesn't happen to be a friend of yours whom you know is good enough to hold his own against two people, you're probably doing your team a favor by not going into the jungle and helping him not feed instead.

The profile for handguns (these were muzzle loaded, 18th century guns) was as follows:
Proficiency bonus: +2
Damage: 2d8 +10 +dexterity modifier (ouch!)

It seems pretty strong, but since the guns basically replaced encounter powers due to reload times it turned out to be pretty fair in comparison with the other characters.

Since I was running a realistic campaign set in a romanticized 18th century eastern europe, I added a critical damage rule to make combat more deadly. Basically, if a character gets hit for more damage than their CON score in one hit, they take a constitution test with DC = Damage received - CON score. Thus, a moderately hardy character with 13 constitution would take a DC 13 CON test after getting critically hit by a handgun. Failing the test meant falling to 0 hp and basically being out of the fight and in real danger.

Known collectively as the Revolution of 1905, these upheavals transformed the political landscape and set the stage for the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War that followed.  Bloody Sunday also marked an important watershed for Russian graphic artists. With the momentary collapse of censorship, over 300 different satirical magazines were published during the Revolution of 1905, more than had seen the light of day in Russia during the entire nineteenth century. Most of them survived for only a few numbers before the censors caught up. Yet the ouput was impressive all the same. Rushing to fill the expressive void, artists and writers captured the events and personalities of the revolution with biting satire and aesthetic sophistication. While styles and subject matter varied, artists often chose to depict nightmarish scenes of bloodshed and repression, drawing on images of the macabre and the mystical that had already been in vogue in Symbolist circles across Europe at the turn of the century.

There's another emotion associated with art, which is not of the beautiful but of the sublime. What we call monsters can be experienced as sublime. They represent powers too vast for the normal forms of life to contain them. An immense expanse of space is sublime. The Buddhists know how to achieve this effect in situating their temples, which are often up on high hills. For example, some of the temple gardens in Japan are designed so that you will first be experiencing close-in, intimate arrangements. Meanwhile, you're climbing, until suddenly you break past a screen and an expanse of horizon opens out, and somehow, with this diminishment of your own ego, your consciousness expands to an experience of the sublime.

Another mode of the sublime is of prodigious energy, force, and power. I've known a number of people who were in Central Europe during the Anglo-American saturation bombings of their cities -- and several have described this inhuman experience as not only terrible but in a measure sublime.

Couple drinks down, I was pretty buzzed. European guys are certainly hot, and here finally, a place where I can be free and open about who I am, with no repercussions.

So then I headed down to the dark tunnel downstairs and basically saw guys everywhere cruising everyone else. Guys making out in the dark... sucking... fucking everywhere. I went deeper into the tunnel and hands started to come out of the darkness and caress me all over, feeling my package inside those boxer briefs.

Using my amazing sense of touch, I felt this one guy with a twinkish build and huge dick. The faint silhouette of his face was just showing through the dimly lit blacklights along the sides of the tunnel. It was all so alluring and I started kissing his ears, neck... and more. He started whimpering and moaning and that just turns me on so much. I grabbed him and pulled him out of the tunnel and basically there at that entrance I made out with him, and got a good look on his face. 

Oh. My. God. He basically looks like Tom Felton with a sly, mischievous look. This one other guy we have no interest in tried to come in and break our instant chemistry, so I whispered in his ears, ""I don't think he gets the message"". And he replied with this dry, broken English with a sexy Dutch accent, ""I don't think so either"". We looked at each other in the eye and deeply kissed. I felt like I hit the jackpot. We continue to make out while pretty much signaling all the other guys that we don't want another person involved.

But no, we didn't fuck. I went to town on him a couple times, and vice versa, but that was it. And sometimes when I think of it, I realized it was better that way. Before this all happened my whole intention of going to places like those was to have a lot of sex, and reassure myself of just how much of a debauchery can I pull off and no one will ever know stateside. That boosts my ego. Turned out I don't need that reassurance. What I needed was love, and briefly for one night in Europe, I got to feel that. 

After we left the club, I brought the two of us a bottle of red wine (a very nice bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, in fact). It was a chilly April night. We were strolling down a city of dreams, drinking wine from the bottle. We talked about family, about love, about our dreams. I found out his name is Colin, and he's about my age, working towards his dreams of becoming a pilot. For the first time I felt right, and it certainly felt right when we were too drunk to continue walking by the tram tracks from Leidseplein back to Centraal, so we stumbled upon this small bakery at 5 in the morning, eating fresh-made croissant and drinking Orangina, and after that, him snuggling on my lap until sun rises, all inside this small bakery as the first tram strolls by outside.

I never got to ask him for his number, or add him on his Facebook page, and I didn't see him ever again. But this one picture that I took, when he pulled me to this dark alley and passionately made out with me... that picture is something.

It's not either you cheese or you play totally predictably - TSM has shown in recent months they can bring stuff to the table - especially in team comps - which other teams can't deal with. Think about MLG Anaheim - they bring their Kayle/Karthus combo, play it perfectly, they win - if it gets banned out, they get to run a comp which normally gets banned out against them (Vlad/A.N.Other AP/Maokai or something else). If you think about a good team comp that's slightly original, or you outmaneuver your opponents in the picks, and then play a solid game, you will be playing ""standard"" but there's no reason to think you can't win.

My main worry for TSM is that by just scrimming Curse they're just scrimming against an NA style of play which they have totally mastered. To some extent they'll be going in a little blind so they need to be doing some very careful research on everything competing teams have been doing from a month or so ago and further back, before everyone went quiet - but then this is the case for every team except CLG.NA/CLG.EU.

Consolidation by definition reduces competition but the reduction of jobs could be as the result of an increase in efficiency due to so many redundant positions after the companies have merged. One could argue that if the European companies post-merger are much more competitive than their smaller US competitors that ultimately the job losses in the US would have come later anyway due to erosion of market share. Jobs may also return post-merger due to a more competitive US industry.

I'm painting a very broad and simplistic picture here, but these are the sort of things that get passed around as justification. 

&gt;the Northrop chairman (Wes Bush) had only one thing in mind when he took office: boost the stock price and merge with another company

Probably true. But as you know that doesn't necessarily mean that a merger puts the company or US industry in a worse position than before. 

It's like leveraged buyouts, or private equity as its called now. Go in, cut costs and make (in many cases needed) management changes, then add leverage to pay yourself back for the initial investment and retain some ownership to release later.

It's very frustrating for folks in middle management and lower management who honestly care about a company and its future and see senior executives doing these sorts of things for the benefit of themselves and the company's owners.

Jackson had a rough life. He was orphaned by the revolutionary war, during which he was held prisoner by the British. He was starved, beaten, slashed, and contracted smallpox while in captivity.
  
He served major roles in two wars, the first being the war of 1812. He fought on the frontier against tribes backed by the English. Atrocities were committed by both sides. Villages burned, civilians killed and mutilated. Seeing that sort of thing changes a person... ordering it to be done... well, that's a whole other sort of guilty. 
  
Then the first Seminole war started (Jackson invaded florida, then a spanish territory) and the violence started all over again. Jackson found evidence that again, the English, this time joined by the Spanish, were backing the native americans in the area and encouraging them to buck against the US. Jackson came to believe that the US wouldn't be secure  so long as spain and england encouraged the native americans to fight. In his mind, this meant ""get rid of the native americans"".

Lending money means inflation, but it's a source of money you can invest. And; it also means debt will be cheaper. That's why the EU hates inflation because the creditors don't want to be payed less.

But there are non inflationary ways of obtaining money. In the thirties; Nazi Germany was the only country that managed to escape the crisis before the war started. And it did this by ordering massive public works; but instead of paying them, they promised to pay them later. This way, the German minister of economy managed to invest for 10x the money that he had. Which yielded great results.

Another option is to enact a law that temporarily uses the savings of citizens (let's say 25%) to invest in the economy. This could yield some 1000 billion euros in the eurozone.

There is a third option; defaulting and nationalizing economies without indemnification. These options are radical. But the problem is, they will happen in Southern Europe if we continue the current course. There has been a lot of talk of the 'bitter pill' and the 'short pain', but there is no such thing.

By itself, a pretty mediocre ability. But with a 300th spear for 30-50% increased damage and the No Escape passive (Ancient spear crits resets the cooldown), it becomes pretty damn powerful.

[My barb](http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/profile/namtlade-2589/hero/10779007) gets spear crits of 100k+ (130 on elites, ~300k during WotB). Also, if you choose the Harpoon rune you can demolish the large packs of cannon fodder mobs, and with a careful aim spear all 3-4 mobs in a champion pack. 

As long as your crit chance is high enough, and you hit enough mobs, the odds are extremely good that you'll crit at least one of the mobs in the way, which is enough to reset the cooldown and throw your spear again.

Also, as long as they aren't immune to knockbacks they aren't immune to the pull of the spear. And it's damn hilarious to chain-spear a champion pack and drag them around the map.

After Antietam and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation Confederacy chances started to decrease as European powers would not recognize it. Once engaged in a war of attrition the South could not match North resources and the blockade (and their learning curve in the art of war).
Lincoln's main problem was to keep the war ongoing to achieve victory as public opinion in the North would eventually get tired of the casualty list. Most Democrats advocated a negotiated peace.
The real factor in the prolongation of the war was Robert E Lee and his ability to wage war in the East longer than anyone expected, he became an icon and once he was defeated all other Confederate armies still in the field followed suit and surrendered.
There are many factors to consider though as the ACW was a very complex conflict and still today there is no consensus on why it started. Only thing left for you is read about it. Classics are:
The Civil War by Shelby Foote
Battle Cry of Freedom by Mc Pherson
1861 The Civil War awakening by Goddart (recommended as introduction to the causes)
The Army of Northern Virginia by Glatthaar

Now it's all ruined, they are struggling to keep their kids at school and extracurricular activities, like English school, sports and Boy Scouts. Lots of people are sticking to the basics and take their kids out of these schools which in turn causes more unemployment since the people working there stop having any work.

I have a feeling that this is going to escalate around Europe. The cops are getting more and more violent, which makes the people more and more violent, it's only a matter of time before someone goes crazy and starts using hunting guns (which are very common in Spain and Portugal). The situation in Greece is turning into a civil war, the far right is getting huge amounts of support and I'm already expecting a nice dictatorship arising in that country.

The problem with my country is that there is widespread corruption in all levels of politics, every political party is involved in all sorts of shady deals and money laundering. Nobody wants to change anything because they know that themselves are also involved.

This will only get better with another revolution and throwing the politicians in jail or out of the country. This problem is so deeply rooted inside our society that it will only be solved this way.

I fear for a bigger crisis and perhaps widespread war.
