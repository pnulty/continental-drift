Currently usury is understood to mean charging *excessive* interest on money lent but for Christians charging any interest at all was strictly forbidden

Ezekiel 18:13 says:
&gt;Lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.

and Leviticus 25:35-37
&gt;
“If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you. Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.

So Christians were forbidden to lend money for any interest, which is kinda the basis for our **entire** economic system.  However, while both those quotes are from the Torah and apply to Jews as well as Christians, Jews lacked a central authority to dispense punishment for breaking usury laws as Christianity had in the Pope and local Christian magistrates.  Jews thus filled a vital purpose in Christian society and thus there was an impetus to persecute them but not *too* much.

Finally, this eye popping fact I just read from the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans_and_interest_in_Judaism#In_Christianity)

&gt;in many European countries, medieval civil law also allowed the monarchs to inherit all remaining income and property that had been acquired by usury upon the death of the Jewish usurer involved.[1] Medieval European monarchs thus supported the Jews and suppressed any attempts to convert them to Christianity since it would deprive the monarch of potential income;[1] in England and France, the monarchs demanded compensation from the church for every Jew who was converted, and, until 1281, the English monarch had the legal right to claim half the property of any Jew that converted to Christianity.",True,,cd43ghs,9,False,False,t5_2ssp3,9,

Another recomendation for Mikrotik. I haven't used them myself, however co-workers and a handfull of customers in two datacenters I've worked at over the past 7 years have used Mikrotik successfully.

I've had good luck with supermicro, but it may be cheaper to go even lower end, or complete whitebox.

In my experience 0-500 employees is very vague. Will you be hosting anything from this location? VPN tunnels to other sites required? Is this an IT shop that'll use lots of BW, or is it more like a lawyer or real estate office with some emails used, some Customer Relationship Management software and very light web traffic? How many agents for the Asterisk server? You'll also want to know what kind of bridging/conference calling they'll need. I would recomend a lower end mikrotik perhaps and then focus on a small 1U server with RAID1 HDDs (that is so that if a disk fails, you stay online.) SSDs are good for high IO but aren't actually reliable in the long run. A VOIP system like Asterisk is closer to a set it and forget it. That is once it's in production, the base configuration rarely changes. There may be user agents (employees) added/removed once in a while, but the main operations will remain the same.

i liken it like this. for hundreds of years britain has been immigratin' itselves into these countries, putting in british systems, and encourage the idea that the british way of life is the best in the world... through total abject repression of the colonies, their own native educations systems, and economic/trade manipulations.

so all these commonwwealth colonials are doing is going home to mama and papa ~~bear~~ fox for a bit of the sweet ~~potato~~ shepherds pie that was ripped from their fertile countries minerals, materials, and manpower for all those hundreds of years. 

its absolutely chickens coming home to roost.

i think what with the education system the way it is [super heavy emphasis on ww1 onwards, with a bit of civil rights and soviets thrown in] and a laughably bad history of britain [sure we learn very early about tudors and stuarts. but what about all that ugly shit. the violent wars in tibet, the concentration camps for the boers in south africa, the opium wars] hell thats just a part of the formation of our national prominence and identity as anything else. 

we are [were] at the top of a ladder for many reasons and one of them is exploitation. i think it would be reasonable to have a better discussion of all of these issues.

the sooner the warts and all history is embraced and taught, the easier it'll be to actually have some realistically founded civic pride [you cant have civic pride unless you  really know something of your country] as well as a fostering and welcoming atmosphere to different cultures.

The UK is one of the most self hating yet most multicultured places on earth. And i say this as an englishman. 

We hate europe but they dont hate us. We have problems with the US but need that special relationship. if our nation was diagnosed with an ailment it would be extreme borderline personality disorder, self hating narcisissm, a simmering undisplaced anger, coupled with vast gelatinous seas of apathy and occasional drunkenpissing on memorials

Just about the only country people can unanimously agree on we like is Australia [except for during the cricket and rugby] and that place was made into a huge fucking prison death island for all the people we didnt want here.

it amazes me how self hating the british are of their best traits [multiculturalism, accepting of people regardless of sexual identity, being a hub for the world in commerce, etc] and how weirdly proud they are for their worst traits [anti-europeanism promoted as sovereignty issues, arguments over petty fucking things,the heavily blindspot laden  history of the british empire]

Well, that's what they did for this fiscal year :-P AMERICA Competes Act of 2007 was enacted under the Bush administration. The last years of the Bush administration and the first year of the Obama administration saw a huge increase in science funding. Again, given that big business thinks publicly funded basic research is good and the strength of their lobby, the Republicans don't have the stomach to actually directly cut the NSF, NIH, DARPA, DoD SC, etc.

It's not all doom and gloom; funding is back to 2008 levels. In effect, funding levels will simply be stagnant. It's not like we're shredding our science establishment. Public funding for science has always fluctuated; it's not like the huge sudden mid-year cut for FY2013 was terribly exceptional.

Anyways, that's just my two cents. This is just my opinion from following news related to science funding and looking up stats about historical funding levels and views on big science. Maybe on the ground, things have gotten more difficult in some parts of academia; but in any case, I think if you step back, we're nowhere near the end of American prestige in science. I mean, China's basic research budget is $5bn compared to the US's $15bn! The EU spends about $4bn per country on average.

By far the best leagues in Europe are the Spanish, Greek and Russian league. Yet in that list Spain is fifth, Russia isn't in the top 10 and Greece doesn't have a single player. But countries like France or Australia who basically don't have a league send the most players.

In fact the best European players don't have as much incentive to play in the NBA anymore. They get paid more, play fewer games, don't have to deal with gruelling NBA road trips and get more sponsorship opportunities in their home country. Only superstars like the Gasol brothers who can make fortunes or mediocre players like Victor Claver who want to enjoy the power of the NBA Players Association in dictating salaries go to the NBA nowadays. Solid players like Navarro and Fernández who have shown they can handle themselves in the NBA came back to Europe within a few seasons.

I don't see how that is relevant. Only 45% of minutes were played by players playing in the NBA and they gave them a very close match. If all NBA Spanish players were injured but Spain won surely that would prove something? 

For what it's worth, Ricky Rubio isn't actually that important to the Spanish team, he's the kind of player who is much more suited to play in the NBA than in Europe.

I obviously wasn't claiming that the top NBA players would struggle in Europe, but that some decent players who would even be starters in the weaker NBA teams would.

&gt;What I mean is that the Euroleague is turning into a development league for NBA is that NBA teams are starting to draft more and more European or other foreign players and a lot of these players don't go through colleges like U.S players but go to European teams where they develop before going to the NBA.

Actually fewer and fewer of the best European players are nowadays going into the NBA nowadays, it's a better life for them to stay in the European giants.

I also think it's unfair to say that European leagues are a development league for the NBA based on the fact that American players play in Europe to skip college.

Sex is as big of a part of pop culture here as it is in western cultures, even if you count out porn. 
Just look at the mag stand at the conbini, 1/3 to 1/2 of it is girls in bikini's on the covers (even the non-strait-up-porn ones).
Or pretty much any pop-girl band video. 

Sure they might be light on the actual sex-scenes in movies but I wouldn't count that as evidence of being stuck up and prude. Everyone has their lines of taste; much of Europe thinks nothing of showing tits, even in ads, yet we don't say that countries that don't are sexually repressed? 
We don't show full on penetration in our films but that doesn't make us prudish?

But ironically, your scenario is more real than you think. Police officers do run into people's homes, only we use a botnet of drones to do it. They're not there to shoot you, but because your home makes a good vantage point for them to shoot somebody else and get away with it, with no trace or oversight, or even you knowing they were there. It's sanctioned and implemented on a massive, automated scale, with little or no human intervention.

As explained by Jacob Appelbaum to the EU parliament, they hijack people's home routers, to use them as redirection points geographically close to a target (thus adding minimal lag onto a man-in-the-middle attack). So the exploit that infects a target's browser is served up by one of their neighbour's linksys routers that's been hijacked (for example).

They can do this, because having strong locks on our electronic devices is not something we consider important as a society. Your lack of security is used to argue that you're made more secure. It's idiotic, because it leaves you vulnerable to anyone, not just Daddy Government who supposedly has your best interests at heart. We know e.g. that China broke into Google's FISA system, and thus knew whom the US Government was targeting for intel.

The dichotomy of security vs privacy is false, because security is a function of having privacy. The internet we have today is one where vulnerabilities are left open, and the default is not to encrypt. The average web service is trivially MITMable, and the main mechanism we have against that, SSL, is based on a dubious hierarchy of trust. Your phone conversations or texts are not end-to-end encrypted, and keys are retained elsewhere.

But identity is not an absolute. It is far more valuable to know e.g. that you are talking to the same person as last time, than to have absolute confirmation of a new person's identity. This is how reddit works. For a business, what is more important: having a customer's ID, or, knowing that their method of payment is valid and being able to remember it for future transactions? So sure, let governments issue digital IDs, to be used when interacting with their services. But let banks do it too, let companies vouch for their customers, and let users create pseudonymous identities to be signed in a P2P fashion. There is a reason Facebook Connect became the biggest ID system on the planet.

The problem is that we have the UI entirely backwards. We create accounts on services, rather than having services register themselves in our accounts. The default model is that you have to trust them, rather than they have to trust you. Reversing this is not impossible.

What the NSA leaks have shown is furthermore that the vast majority of dragnet spying is not in fact against suspected terrorists, but that terrorists are included as targets merely by accident. Guilt by association is used to find dirt on people, and then a legitimate case is reverse-engineered around the illicitly obtained evidence to use as legal leverage.

Plus I can understand why somebody would hate Memphis especially when they lived in Barcelona. Also I'm not sure but the NBA has rules around how much a rookie can be paid and Navarro would've been considered a rookie which would result in a paycut. Its one of the reasons that has been keeping Mirotic with Madrid is that he is making more money than he would make if he went to they Bulls. The NBA is going to have the same problem that most likely prevented European soccer to become popular in the U.S and that is no one in the U.S can really watch it unless they are committed to watch it. Most of the games are going to be at a time where few people can watch it.

History focuses on major, world-changing events. US history tends to focus on the history of white Europeans, especially the English, French, and Germans. That history isn't very flattering. They were often aggressive, believed in a religion which gave them a god-given right, if not a flat out commandment, that they were superior and were to bring others to the light by any means necessary, and were extremely tribal.

At the same time, I never learned about attacks against white Europeans. The white slave trade in Arab countries, or the oppression of the Scottish and Irish by the English, for example. I only learned about the triumphs and failings of white Europeans and their descendants.

I don't think this is necessarily a conspiracy, like ""all white people are evil"" or anything. I just think that due to how history is taught, the books that are mandated, how teachers are taught to teach, encourages a view of white men as both villain and savior. White men enslaved Africans for their own gain, but white men also freed those slaves and now their children and their children's children have a better life as a result. White men oppressed, murdered, enslaved, and nearly wiped out the natives, but now we ""protect"" them and honor them as the great wise men and women they were. We try to repair the damage done by our forefathers.

I don't agree however that anyone has shown a preponderance of primary evidence.

I postulate that this is because of the intent of the mistranslation, which was to allow for the prosecution of individuals the people in charge wished to be rid of, for whatever reason. This is purely conjecture, but I am not the first to ponder the veracity of this musing.

As for modernly scholarly consensus, I also could find nothing of the sort and the likes of Cardinal Wolsey, Johanas Weirius in the other camp, not exactly small players. Additionally appeal to authority does not strengthen the case one iota. 

Rather I think this is primarily the adoption of the KJV of the bible by the Church of England / protestant church historically, and later it's foray into the colonies set the stage for the adoption of a common translation, namely the one used today. I don't think there is any real consensus other than perhaps popularity, conservative tradition, and a sense of the familiar. 

Additionally during the time this was written the use of ""magic"" was quite common, by clergy, king and commoner. As such I think it would be quite odd that this would be a decree against the users of ""magic"".

 Solomon, King on Isreal and son of David, would have been implicated by this passage, as such I would be willing to allow for the Hebrew ""M'khashepah"" which is often seen as well. Which, as you probably already know, roughly means ""caster of harmful spells"". As such, this is  at best a provision against ""evil"" magic users.

Second the term ""witch"" in this context is probably an anachronism, as the first ""witches "" seem to have risen in Greece probably a few hundred years *after* this was written. At best it would be an evil sorcerer.

If you read Cardinal Wosleys treaty on this during his time it was often used to refer to things the church frowned on at that time such as ""idolatry, sedition and other delusive practices"".  

This pretty much wraps up my feelings, that this is a passage used to justify punishment for behavior the church, at the given time, feels is sinful (?), threatening (?). Therefor the translation of the KJV did this intentionally due to the anti-witchcraft sentiment in Europe at this time.

It fits far to neatly, and I am by no means the first, nor last, in a long line of people to point this out, clergy, scholar and commoner.",True,,cd47q42,0,1383277535,False,t5_2qh33,0,

Not any more significant or powerful than any one male role. You can keep repeating this over and over but it isn't made more true. For every one female character who is actually named there is 100 more male characters with prominence, even lesser known and acknowledged ones.

&gt; he's simply not writing in a style that promotes deeply fleshed out characters

Bullshit. I got plenty of depth on Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo, Bilbo, Thorin, Gollum/Smegul, the Witchking and just about every other prominent male character, compared to Galadriel, Eowyn, or any other fraction of a percent of female characters you can pull out, from the Hobbit and LOTR books.

&gt; which can be found in Unfinished Tales) if you want to see how Tolkien fares at really developing a female character.

You mean the cliff notes compared to the Hobbit/LOTR that PJ had to use just to stretch the story of the Hobbit? Yeah I've seen the same summary before; more stereotypical, romanticized leads. I've got a few Disney movies if you're really into that kind of heroin.

&gt; Also consider Tolkien's setting and influences: He's basing his mythology off of those past - which are, surprise surprise, male dominated. He's also not a late 20th/early 21st century author raised in a setting of pushing social diversity. The man was born in 1892, and his writing is rather conservative (though not extremely so). To expect him to include a large cast of female characters is an unfair and unwarranted. 

Holy shit misogynistic Tolkien fanboys.....that's exactly what I said; he was a man of his time. We're in a time now where people are more open minded. You're the one saying Tolkien was very progressive at his age, and then you turn around and use the tired excuse of ""he was a product of his time"" to illustrate his lack of care towards non-whites and females.

You don't get to have it both ways, sorry. If you can't accept flaws in an author you're not going to be taken seriously.

&gt; Tolkien wrote little of anything concerning Dwarves. The point is moot. His stories are elven and hobbito-centric, and for whatever reason dwarven women aren't encountered by those peoples. From what little we know, it sounds like dwarven women actually have quite a bit of power and influence in their society.

So much power that one single prominent one could not be at all featured? So much power that when ANY reference came up about governing/ruling the land and existing for hundred's of years as lords and kings, not ONE mention? If the Dwarves get little mention by your reasoning, female Dwarves have practically zero mention. And that is worst, whether you admit it or not. Given all the information on Erebor/Moria/etc., that's also rpetty bullshit. You can't have several massive dwarven cities detailed and there just happen to be zero dwarven women who can get a single mention.

&gt; Welcome to Western history and mythology. 

Yeah women never held historical positions of power or influence in the West. Lol what is history?
 
&gt; Tolkien was writing a mythology suitable for Early Middle Ages-Britain. There weren't exactly lots of people of African and Asiatic descent running around the Isles in 500 CE.

Historians call bullshit. The myth of the homogenous all-white Euro Saxans, and going back further, all white European Romans and Greeks has been thoroughly debunked. They drew conscripts from all over North Africa who served in the same ranks. The Mediterranean itself was full of people of mixed races and ethnicities. So once again, Tolkien fanboys and their white washed, outdated versions of history are pretty much the only ones left in your own corner.

&gt; Also, there were many white skinned people who served Sauron, usually in far more evil ways than those of darker skin tone

""There's some evil white people, so having all black people as evil with literally not a single non-white hero cancels things out nicely!""

&gt; 'The treatment of colour nearly always horrifies anyone going out from Britain, &amp; not only in South Africa. Unfort. not many retain that generous sentiment for long.'

Doesn't mean he wasn't prejudice. [Even when you Tolkien fanboys go to great lengths to make these excuses,](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Racism_in_Tolkien%27s_Works) it comes out that yes, he was more than a bit fixated on stereotypical white euocentric and homogenized thinking. You don't get to use the ""product of your time"" excuse, and then follow it up by outwardly denying he was racist in any way.

&gt; tl;dr: If you're going to discuss issues of race and sex regarding Tolkien's mythology, it's best to be very familiar with it before doing so.

Clearly it's best I not be too familiar, lest I false into fantasy and grab hold of ignorance of real history and real culture and real society and become a racist Tolkien thumper.

I've read the books and I've seen the movies. Peter Jackson has made more fleshed out female characters and went beyond Tolkien's own work in less than 10 hours of film than Tolkien did in 4 books.

Well i have been to several parts of Thailand, among those places like Koh Samui, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Hua Hin and Pattaya. Most of the time i have been hanging out with young people (i am 24 myself), both farang and thai people. I have never encountered drugs here in any occasion. Closest would have to be some arabian tourists i think was smoking some marijuana at a bungalow in Koh Samui. When i try to talk to young thai people about drugs they seem to have no knowledge about it at all. In europe on the other hand, from my own experience, i would say access to drugs are 100 times easier. It's as i would guess in the states, completely normal to pass around marijuana (and other substances) at parties, especially in student groups. I was amazed by the absence of drugs in Thailand. And that would definitely not bee one of my main concerns about going to Thailand.

The reason is that nearly every nation on earth carries significant national debt (no, I'm not a crackpot, hang with me a sec). This debt is based on every *other* nation's belief that the nation will be able to service the debt -- not necessarily pay it all off -- in the future. The degree to which other countries believes that largely determines the interest rate at which a country can borrow, which in turn has a huge effect on its current economy and prospects.

The thing is, in any long-term view, the ability for a nation to service its national debt depends on it having a sufficiently productive economy. This depends on having a sufficiently educated *and numerous* workforce. 

So just recently in Japan, for the first time the sales of [diapers for infants fell below that of diapers for the elderly](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex). Japan is well below its replacement rate, meaning its population is aging and shrinking. This is also happening in many European countries, as the map above shows. The US is basically holding steady, and most countries in Africa... well, if the world won't come to Africa, Africa will come to the rest of the world.

So: if some of the major economies of the world -- the EU, Japan, Russia -- can't continue over the coming decades to remain as productive as they have been, simply because they don't have sufficient population, and if the US and China are more or less holding steady (for now; China is also about to go over the top of the curve into an aging population), and if Africa and India are growing... what do you think this might mean for the global economic balance? 

At minimum it seems there's a lot of dislocation coming our way, to a degree that I don't think we've seen since the post-Black Death period in Europe. It won't be here tomorrow, but these population trends take decades to reverse.

I use a prepaid VISA card to pay for FFXIV. 
http://vpc.lifecard.co.jp/.

The process is kinda simple, but a bit long, so bear with me. 

1) Go to a konbini (almost all of them will do, stick to the big names Lawson, SevenEleven, Family Mart, Ministop to be sure). There is usually a machine there that lets you do all kinds of financial stuff. 

At the bottom of this page, http://vpc.lifecard.co.jp/buy/index.html , it has a step by step guide of what buttons you have to press of each of the machines to get what you want, with pictures and everything. Even if you don't speak any Japanese, it is simple.

2)The machine will print a receipt for the amount of yen that you want (3000, 5000 or 10000) and you take that to the cashier. 
You pay the amount (+200 service costs) and you will get a paper with a very long code.

3)At home, you make a new account at the vpreca website (here: https://vpcssl.lifecard.co.jp/entry/preentry/start.do).
After that is finished, you can log in, and add funds to the card using the long code you got from the konbini.
You get a virtual cc that looks just like a real one, with expiration date and security code and everything.

4)At the Mog Station, you just enter the information, using the regular VISA credit card option. You only have to do this once. Every pay period, SE will just automatically deduct an amount from your vpreca, just make sure you have enough funds on it. You can buy new funds at any time at a konbini and use that to add funds to your card. 

This has worked great for me so far, and the amount SE deducts is almost on par with the daily currency exchange rate. I could not detect any commission loss or whatever. Just the 200 yen when you buy the funds at the konbini.

The earliest stumbling block that Nigerian historians run across is defining what is or is not ""Igbo"" in the period before 1900. In each of the secondary sources I have consulted, the consensus is that in communities on the border between Igbo and neighboring groups, intermarriage, trade, and shared customs developed to the extent that there developed a distinct ""borderland culture"" where you could have a synthesized Igbo-Ibibo language, or a synthesized Igbo-Edo style of dress.  There was not a centralized Igbo state, but rather each village interacted with their neighbors through connections of kin relationships. (for convenience, I will use the term ""Igbo people"" as a shorthand, but keep in mind the flaws of this terminology)

Another factor that is broadly agreed upon is that the worldview in Igbo or Igbo-Ibibo, Igbo-Edo etc border villages was very parochial. Certainly, there was some down-the-line trade that brought products like Kola nuts or palm oil from the Niger Delta north to the Sudanic states, or brought northern slaves to Igbo territory. But, the agricultural lifestyle of the Igbo, and the relative plenty of the region they lived in meant little demand for outside trade goods other than slaves. 

So, initially these statements would seem to indicate a finding of ""they might not have thought much about anyone beyond their immediate neighbors.""

However, their customs with regards to slaves placed an emphasis on integration into Igbo culture. Slaves from outside of Igbo lineages that did learn to speak the language, and learned to adopt Igbo customs and married into Igbo families were much more likely to see social advancement, or at least their descendants were able to advance socially. So, that would lend some credence to a theory that when in contact with peoples of a visibly different culture, Igbo peoples desired ""foreigners"" adopt Igbo culture. 

**On the other hand**

We should examine the possibility that Equiano's views were shaped by his experiences as a slave in the Americas. That his attitude of Igbo superiority over inland neighbors was learned.

Let's look at the case of the Liberia settlements. When freedmen from the United States established a state in Africa, they proceeded to establish churches and schools for the ""education"" of local peoples adjacent to the freedmen's settlements. Additionally, an army was established to keep local communities in line, and local ethnic groups were utilized as a labor force. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the experience of indigenous peoples in Liberia did not differ immensely from the experiences of indigenous peoples in the various European colonies. 

Thus, my point would be that a *possibility* is that Equiano's views on Igbo neighbors of the interior might have been shaped by an internalization of attitudes learned as a slave in the Americas. Importantly, this need not be incompatible with the idea that he genuinely was African. 

Sorry, this answer is not very definitive, and I have speculated perhaps more than I should have.

More socialist can mean a lot of things.  I think people need to stop focusing on 5 words he said when pressed to name a replacement system.  But if we must, socialism doesn't mean just Stalinism or Marxism.  It has evolved over the years and is in good use in much of Europe.  Some countries haven't found the right mix but it's always balanced with capitalist principles as well.

You see that he doesn't call for the dissolution of corporations.  Just heavier taxation.  Taxation isn't the only solution to redistribution of wealth, which if you look at the wealth disparity, needs to happen.  Taxation can be a cudgel which you use to convince corporations to raise wages, benefits and pensions.  You can simultaneously use incentives such as much lower taxation if you pay your workers a living wage such that they aren't in need of any government welfare.  

What I think is possible is to find the right balance of punishing taxes for those who horde the wealth, with generous tax cuts if they keep all their workers off any form of government assistance.  Then you reduce government spending on all of those workers.

Everyone then has more money and is paying income taxes which we can use for government funded higher education and technical schools, infrastructure and research and development.  Those things will all make our life better.  

You don't replace capitalism, you enhance it and control negative characteristics of human nature like greed and tribalism.  Democratically.

The most basic and common explanation is that the outnumbered Spanish led a cavalry charge against the leader of the Aztec forces, killing him and throwing those forces into disarray. While this explanation is basically correct, it's not exactly satisfying, so let's go deeper.

**Why Are We Here?**

The Battle of Otumba^1 was actually a follow-up to *La Noche Triste*, which itself was precipitated by the Toxcatl Massacre, which may not have even happened had Panfilo Narvaez not shown up. Narvaez had been sent by the Governor of Cuba -- a political rival of Cortes -- to haul Cortes back to Cuba for violating the charter for his original mission to the mainland, which had been to rescue some previously stranded Spaniards and maybe do a bit of light trading with the locals. At this point (Spring 1520), Cortes had completed his rescue mission almost a year ago and had done more than a little trading. One of the rescued Spanish, by the way, was Geronimo Aguilar, who had spent so much time among the Maya who had captured him that he had gone native enough that, when offered European foods, he ate only a little since “after so much time he was accustomed to the food of the Indians, and his stomach would regard Christian food as foreign.”^2 Also, he learned Mayan, which came in handy when Cortes was later gifted a slave who could speak both Mayan and Nahuatl, La Malinche, thus setting off the crazy game of telephone that was the Spanish Conquest and its various chronicles. But I digress.

Cortes, who had until that point been safely ensconced in Tenochtitlan extorting wealth via the *Tlatoani* Motecuhzoma Xocoyotl, rushed with a body of troops to the Gulf Coast to meet Narvaez. Although he quickly bested Narvaez and convinced most of the troops sent to arrest him to instead join him, the man he had left in charge back in Tenochtitlan, Pedro de Alvarado, had already committed a major faux pas. During *Toxcatl*, one of the most major religious festivals of the Aztecs, Alvarado launched a full on attack on the unarmed crowd, or, as Diaz del Castillo puts it, ""he had, without any provocation, sallied out with the whole of his troops, and fallen unawares upon their chiefs and caziques while they were celebrating a feast in honour of their gods Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipuca, Alvarado himself having previously given his consent to the celebration of that feast. Many of their chief personages had been killed and wounded...."" 

The Toxcatl Massacre not only resulted in the deaths of many elite and experienced political, religious, and military leaders (one in the same, amongst the Aztecs), but finally turned the city of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish. Cortes returned to find his troops besieged within their palace quarters.

Seeking to defuse the situation, Cortes convinced Motecuhzoma to publicly address the besieging forces. Monty was, at that point, already a lame duck, the elites of Tenochtitlan having already elected (or were planning to elect, the timeline is a little fuzzy) a new *tlatoani*, Cuitlahuac. According to the Spanish sources, Motecuhzoma was struck with sling stones and arrows, dying shortly afterwards. According to native sources, the Spanish, seeing he was no longer in charge, murdered him.

Still besieged, Cortes decided to sneak out of Tenochtitlan at night. The plan was to [flee back to their allies in Tlaxcala](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Ruta_de_escape_de_los_espa%C3%B1oles_hacia_Tlaxcala.svg). Understandably though, creeping over 1000 Spanish Conquistadors, with horses, and several thousand Tlaxcalan infantry out of one of the world's largest cities and across exposed causeways was perhaps less than an ideal plan. The ""Night of Sorrows"" that followed saw thousands of Tlaxcalans and hundreds of Spanish killed, some of the Spanish drowning in the lake, weighed down by their armor and the riches they were trying to smuggle out. The Spanish were then harassed along their escape route. To quote Diaz del Castillo again:

&gt; For memory's sake, I must here note down that we marched into Mexico on the 24th of June, 1520, to Alvarado's assistance, with an army of nearly 1400 men, among which there were seventy-nine horse, eighty crossbow-men, and a like number of musketeers, with above 2000 Tlascallan troops, and a fine park of artillery. On the 10th of July following we commenced our retreat, and on the 14th we fought the battle of Otumpan. I must now likewise recount the loss we sustained in that time. In five days, including the battle of Otumpan, we lost in killed, and those who were taken prisoners, above 870 of our troops, and above 1200 Tlascallans; to which must be added 72 men and five Spanish females, all of Narvaez's division, whom the Mexicans put to death in Tustepec.

That quote brings us to the next big question:

**How Many Soldiers Were Actually There?**

One core problem with the Battle of Otumba is that numbers for either side are not so much fuzzy as opaque. Diaz del Castillo's enumeration of the Spanish troops is probably close to correct. Notice the conditionals regarding the Tlaxcalan numbers though. In both troops numbers and casualties there are ""above"" 2000 and 1200, respectively. That a number is mentioned at all is somewhat remarkable, given the tendency for both Diaz del Castillo and Cortes to -- when they even acknowledge the presence of the native allies -- to speak of their numbers in such vague terms that they might as well be saying ""we had [alot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Alot) of allies.""

Clavigero, writing in the 18th Century^3 and synthesizing accounts known at that time, posited that there may have been 7000 or so Tlaxcalans with Cortes in Tenochtitlan, and slightly less than half that number at Otumba. Regardless, it is generally accepted that there were several hundred Spanish, a few dozen mounted, along with a few thousand Tlaxcalans. This does not take into account any support they may have picked up along the way from the rebellious towns who were supplying them as retreated from Tenochtitlan.

For the Aztec numbers, there is even less information. Clavigero has a comment on the incredibly high Aztec troop numbers who were purportedly gathered for the battle, noting that “Some historians make this army consist of 200K men, a number computed solely by the eye, and probably increased by [Spanish/Tlaxcalan] fears.” The truth of the matter is that we don't actually know how many Aztec troops were at Otumba, or even if it was a properly an ""Aztec"" army (i.e., one composed not just of Mexica, but also soldiera from the other two members of the Aztec Triple Alliance: the Tepanecs and Acolhua). Duran^4, for instance, suggests that the Mexica's allies received the order to raise their armies, but recieved word of the defeat at Otumba ""just when they were about to leave for the battle,"" which is awfully convenient. There's another theory about the Acolhua that we'll touch in a bit. The one point of agreement is that the Spanish and Tlaxcalans were unmistakably outnumbered

Hassig^5 ,however, militates against the larger estimates of native troops opposing the combined Tlaxcalan-Spanish forces. He notes that mustering the truly massive Aztec armies took time, as the troops had to congregate from the various polities throughout the Valley of Mexico. Further, this was all taking place in late June/early July -- the height of the agricultural season. Manpower reserves thus would have been limited due to the large numbers of men required for a different sort of field work. Finally, he points out that the political turmoil inherent with the ascension of new *tlatoani* meant previous allies might be reluctant to leap to aid (as suggested by Duran) and Cuitlahuac might have opted to remain in Tenochtitlan to bolster his political position before heading out on campaign. Indeed, multiple sources report that is just what he did.

With Cuitlahuac back in Tenochtitlan, who then was leading the Mexica troops? Camargo^6 only says they were led by ""*Cihuacatzin*, which is not a name. The ""-tzin"" suffix indicates nobility and the *Cihuacoatl* is the head priest and a kind of prime minister. Digging deeper finds references to a ""Matlatzincatl"" who is recorded as a son of previous *tlatoani* Axayacatl and a brother to Cuitlahuac^7 but is not otherwise mentioned. So there was an indeterminate number of Mexica troops led by a brother of the new ruler holding a position which had been primarily focused on religious and domestic matter (at least since Tlacaelel was young). Recall now that the main victims of the Toxcatl Massacre were the elites of Mexica society.

- with French there is volumes of literature, from The Song of Roland to the work of post structuralist philosophers, there is French cuisine and all it's intricacies, and there is the contributions to the anglosphere thanks to the Norman influence.

- in Italian it's similar - most Americans are familiar with the bastardized dishes of ravioli, tortalini, linguine, Alfredo sauces as well as espresso and lattes, we also know of The Barber of Seville and other Italian operas.

- English itself imbues a lot of power through language into Western culture: ""There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."" The concepts of ""white man's burden,"" the language of the Constitution of the US, phrases like ""we hold these truths to be self evident,"" all weave a sense of collective consciousness in the English speaking world about who we are and how we think. It's the same with other languages - it helps you understand part of your collective identity. ""I do all that may become a man,"" ""with liberty and justice for all.""

- and in Welsh (as with any other language) it's no different. You have the Gorseddau and Bardic traditions, as well as the names and histories of places that go back centuries. You have the Mabinogion rooted in the past and places like Capel Celyn that were destroyed, partially because of the apathy about language and culture but also because of people who deliberately tried to stamp out that culture through punishing Welsh speakers.

In Australia children were abducted from their aborigine families and forcibly reeducated. In New Zealand there was a big issue with a near death blow to Maori culture (IIRC).

I would like to see a Reefs Unlimited.  Reefers protecting reefs because if there are no reefs, there will be no coral and no fish for our tanks.  While there are plenty of organizations trying to use better collection practices, what needs to be done is for reefers to have an organization to pressure their local and regional governments into adopting some sort of certification to insure ethical collection and fair pricing for collectors in order to import.  If the US suddenly said that you had to have and maintain X certification to import reef livestock into the US then you would very quickly see the collection practices change!  Canada and Europe as well!  Aquarium collection and market forces could be a powerful ally as you will seldom find a reefer who isn't very protective of the oceans and well aware of the crisis in them.

There's SEVERAL avenues to go here...all possible to automatize, but each with their own eases and hurdles in doing so.  And forgive me if I miss one, but they are:

 - Factorization  - I don't know much about this one, other than with great patience and time investiment, it's possible to tripple your ores.

 - Thermal Expansion - Pulverizer and Power Furnace - uses Buildcraft MJs...can double your ores with chances for bonus metals

 - Industrialcraft 2 - Macerator and Electric Furnace - uses IC2 Power (EU)...can only double your ores.

 - Tinkerer's Construct - Smeltery - uses a Lava for power.  Can easily double your ores, and turn them into either ingots or blocks.

After (or while) you get Ore processing set up and automated, you need to think about where to put everything.  There's a few options here, depending on what you want to do:

 - Applied Energistics - store everything as data on disks.  Most compact, but requires power to access.  Comes with lots of aides to automation and auto-crafting.  My favorite.

 - Factorization - Barrels can store A LOT of a single type of item.  You can sort manually, or eventually get a router to auto-fill a wall or room of barrels, creating a storting system of sorts.

 - Iron Chests  - Nothing like the basic Iron Chests mods to get you started.

 - MFR - iirc, MFR has a storage unit like barrel that stores massive quantities of a single item.

 - Mix and match multiple storage systems to get the ideal system you want.  AE can play very nicely with other mod's storage containers.

'Back in the day' PSTN/POTS were synonymous, but currently POTS is really relegated to the 'last mile' connection (where currently, 'last mile' may refer to the 50 feet of cable from your Vonage or Comcast analog telephone adapter, if you even have one of those). 

20 years ago (man, i'm old) POTS would be the service that piss off my parents by staying up until 2AM by dialing up to a BBS or ISP with an analog [modem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56_kbit/s_modem); you could depend on all of the path to be analog and thus keeping your speed limited to 33.6kbps (v.34). With the adoption of digital circuits at the carrier (both (channel associated signaling)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel-associated_signaling] and [common channel signaling: ISDN and SS7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-channel_signaling)) and adoption of these same digital circuits on the ISP-side, your crappy modem at home started to be able to support 56k (and only 56k max, and only in the downstream path due to [Shannon's Law](http://osix.net/modules/article/?id=210) *and this relied on only 1 digital-analog conversion in the path.* 

[ISDN](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network) was supposed to be the 'broadband for the masses,' in the 90s, specifically the BRI version, which was basically a 'double-barreled circuit,' providing 2 x 64kbps channels and one signaling channel. With the right type of terminal/phone, you could have 2 audio calls going on, simultaneously, or 1 audio call and 1 data call, or 2 data calls going to your ISP, 'bundled' together to form a 128k connection. Fast, eh? BRIs were very popular in Europe, but you just didn't see it get deployed much in the States - I suspect it's because Bell invested too heavily in shitty analog channel banks to maximize profit and couldn't roll out anything like ISDN without charging an arm &amp; a leg. Anyhow, ISDN is important to consider because I think it's when POTS/PSTN started to mean different things; POTS is inherently analog, whereas the 'D' in ISDN stands for digital. ISDN is still widely deployed (and still rolled out to businesses, to this day) but its importance is diminished as we move to a common communications protocol, namely IP, over which we send emails, use videoconferencing and yes, even call to the PSTN with (think Vonage or Skype). 

TL;DR - In the beginning, PSTN/POTS probably meant the same thing. POTS now is analogous to DSL, which is a last mile technology to get you connected to the greater Internet of Things(tm). In fact, DSL uses the same old POTS copper that you probably no longer use. ",True,,cd49ud1,3,False,False,t5_2qkaf,3,CCNA CCDA

I believe the origins of this stupid situation go back to the Porfirio Díaz's times in which a lot of europeans and european's descendants owned huge tracts of land and controlled most of the national industries. So their fair skinned anglo-look-alike mexican children were actually high class.

The nifty thing about tunics is that, really, they didn't change very much for a couple of centuries. Of course there were a few variations, but from roughly the 4th-5th centuries up through the 13th-14th centuries, throughout most of Western &amp; Northern Europe they tended to follow a similar pattern. There were of course some regional variations and such, and one's wealth would dictate what one wore (the more money you had, the more you could spend on more complex patterns and decorations) but the generic pattern of rectangle + arms remained. 

If you're not particularly handy with sewing, I would suggest contacting [Linen Garb](http://www.linengarb.com/) about a quote. I *think* the guy that runs it goes by Aldric, but don't quote me on that: anyway, they make good garments for a very reasonable price, and I know that in the recent past they were planning on working on some Coptic-style tunics: but since I tend to do most of my own sewing I don't keep too up-to-date.  

If you're up to the challenge of sewing your own, either that pattern in the earlier link (where the tunic is made from one piece of fabric) or [this pattern](http://handakas.nvg.org.au/docs/tunic_workshop.pdf) that I used on a few pieces will work as a pretty generic tunic pattern, though depending on how historical you want to be that 7-piece tunic pattern is a little later. Get some cheap fabric to test first, though: especially if you'll be performing, you want to make sure you really perfect the pattern so you can still move properly. The problem is going to come in decoration: embroidery tends to be pretty advanced for someone who doesn't regularly do costuming as a hobby, though something like printing or silkscreening may work, but I've never really looked into them.

Most everyone, at one point or another, whether passing or not, has thought about suicide. And, I highly doubt there is anyone who can legitimately say they never have. If there are, I'd sincerely doubt their honesty. I constantly think about suicide and I have a Master's in Psychology - how's that for irony?! 

Are you currently in school? If you are go to the counselor or school psychologist - they will not tell your parents ANYTHING unless they believe you are a risk to yourself or others - Seriously, they (school psychologists at least) can lose their license if they do. The doctor-patient confidentiality is taken VERY seriously. They will not tell anyone unless they have a reason to believe you will harm yourself or someone else (public school psychologists may be allowed to inform parents if they know that you have harmed yourself, but other psychologists are not [I'm not 100% sure on the differences between the specific rules for these two types]). For that point, I would suggest a school psychologist (counselor rules are a lot more lax and I had mine contact my parents when I was confronted about cutting myself). What's more - all of the services they provide are free and covered in your taxes or tuition if you're in college. If you are in college - All college's have a psychologist for these purposes. Again, they are free and will hold your privacy above all else (failing the threat to self/other rule). Again, they are free. If you're in college, there should be a ""nurse"" area where students can go if they're not feeling well, etc. They should be able to point you in the right direction, or failing that any professor should be more than willing to help. 

Even if you do want outside therapy and you can't see someone without your parent's seeing a statement or something, it shouldn't matter. If you feel that they wouldn't believe you, maybe seeing that you, personally felt the need to see someone would make them realize that the situation is more serious then they thought, and that they should get behind you. This was the case with my parents. When I initially told them I was depressed, they brushed it off and ignored it. The second I informed them I was seeing the school psychologist about it, they then got me outside assistance in order to further help. 

You say that you want to get better, but you're afraid of the fallout... what in particular are you afraid of? I've had a lot of experience with depression and suicidal thoughts. I've been hospitalized for being suicidal, and I can tell you the fallout of everything that I went through was considerably less severe than I thought it would be initially. It is also important to keep in mind that sometimes things need to get worse before they get better. Case in point - being hospitalized for being suicidal was my lowest point - once I realized that people did seem to care about me, everything got better (albeit it only lasted for about a year). Even now, while I constantly think of depression and suicide, I rarely have the compulsion to act on it. 

If you are 100% dead against seeing someone, but still want someone to talk to, I'd highly recommend the Samaritans. They are a 100% free service that I utilized when I couldn't cope well. They are based in Europe (but all English speaking), so there may be some grammatical/spelling differences if you're in the States. You can email them any time at jo@samaritans.org. How it works is that every day someone (new) will read your email, and respond to you. They all use the name ""jo"" I guess to prevent identifying anyone, which is reasonable. They are great if you just want someone to vent to. They will not contact anyone even if you flat out tell them you will kill yourself in 5 minutes (unless you specifically tell them to). Likewise, your privacy is held above all else. They will listen to you, give you suggestions, thoughts, and other ways of looking at things, but that's about it. As I said, they are great if you want someone who will listen to you in a non-judgmental way. Here is their website if you'd like more information: http://www.samaritans.org/.

Technically, having them in any army is not very historical just because they were only used for bodyguard work for Generals of the utmost importance; maybe a more accurate assumption would be to say only for emperors/or your faction leader (Except in late Roman Empire they were disbanded because they ended up killing alot of Emperors just because they didn't like them; In fact, even though they were the ""official"" bodyguards of the Empire, some emperors preferred to recruit germanic/barbarian/foreign elite troops so they wouldn't have any personal or political connections and so could be trusted more). This is a game, though, so one for each army isn't that bad, but only for protection.

One thing you should note, the units ""First Cohort"" and ""Eagle Cohort"" weren't any different really in actual Roman armies, each piece of the formation was named ""First, second, third etc etc"", in game its for different abilities but in reality first, second, third, fourth and fifth were typically the most experienced and they were in the back. I say use the Eagle Cohort only in Europe and Britain because that is the standard they used for that area, not too sure. To put it into the game's perspective, each unit of legionaires would be a ""cohort"" and together all those cohorts would make up the legion. They were just numbered based on experience, I believe.

For reference:

- ALWAYS have a calvary General, however I have Generals who's sole purpose to travel around to each settlement for protection so I keep them Infantry just because they won't ever see any field action. (I have one stationed in Rome to protect the capital and surrounding area, all armored legionaires.)

- 2-4 cav units, most of them should be Aux cav, maybe 1-2 units of pure blood Roman cav.

- 4-6 ranged skirmishers, skirmishers were a big part of how Romans did warfare so to be historically accurate you will have to have some of these units. (I guess you could switch them for siege weapons if you want just because 20 units is pretty restrictive, but as far as I know Romans only used siege weapons in .. well ... sieges.

One thing to add, remember that there really wasn't any standard Roman setup. Yes, they had the legionaries and the skirmishers but other than that, it really all depended on the situation and the location, so play around.

For formations, always deploy in a checkerboard formation, its what the Romans favored BUT also deploy tactically. What I mean by this is that if checkerboard formation wouldn't work for the particular battle, adapt, every good general knows this and so did the Romans.

Here are some common ones: http://romanmilitary.net/strategy/legform/

Keep your most experienced  troops in the middle and in the back if you have reserve lines, ROMAN TROOPS ALWAYS IN THE CENTER. Aux troops always on the left and right of the Roman center, regardless of what they were, calvary always on the flanks. 

A note for skirmishers, the Romans would always rush their skirmishers in front to harass opposing skirmishers or the bulk of the enemy army if they had none. They would then pull them back behind the lines and either sit them in reserve or use them on the flanks with the other aux. 

Now, I'm no expert but from what I've gathered this was pretty much it, if anyone can correct me then feel free.  It really is fun to try to reenact Roman armies in-game, it adds quite a dynamic to it. ",True,,cd4asb3,9,1383318577,False,t5_2rq9c,9,

But to do just and only this is idiotic.

 Nobody would deny that there is something rotten with the political and regulatory environments of Southern and Eastern European countries. Germany managed to gain an advantage in the past 70 years, starting from roughly the same level as everyone else, war torn. Throw in the cost of unification and the advantage shouldn't be that great, but it is. And it did what everyone else was doing, protected its internal market and allowed it to grow to export. It just did it better, consistently. This sort of deficit in decision making has to be addressed. Italy and Spain shouldn't be the political midgets that they currently are on the European Stage, but they are.  

Secondly, there is a problem which is clear yet no one seems to address it. Northern Africa and the Levant are our nearest non-European Markets that Southern and Eastern Europe are in a position to tap, and their dirt poor. They are also unstable. This should be addressed, but the current ideas are either to ignore them completely or invade them. There is an intellectual bankruptcy in how best to deal with this region, and an unwillingness to see their prosperity linked to our own, and that hurts all of us.

Simply put, this call to blame the Germans misses the problem. We're all thinking too bloody small. For half a decade the politicos have been fucking around with deals while all the markets wanted was some symbolic assurance that the Eurozone won't blow up and they can continue business as usual. Now we're asking for state welfare while the well-to-do countries are being hesitant, and clearly the necessary compromise is the creation of some sort of social contract and thus further integration, parish the thought, all the while blaming the Germans for offering good products at low prices, sinful creatures that they are.

That would be the case if Germany would export wines, olives, and clothing. However the thing is that Germany actually isn't competing that much with other Eurozone economies. Yes France, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Finland companies compete with German companies, but they also take part to the manufacturing those German exports, so do eastern European countries. No, the German competitors largely come from the US, Japan and China, from around the world.

The reason especially southern economies are in trouble is not because Germany, but largely because Chinese producers have taken over their markets, for example textile and clothing manufacturing has taken a large hit in south and as those economies are very rigid, they haven't been able to create new industrial sectors and jobs from them.

I got the TV recently so must be upgraded scaling tech.

I completely agree with you sir on the point that all GCs till date have Upscaling functionality. But I guess monitors don't have that good upscaling tech as that of TVs yet. 

I can say this since a friend on mine on 1080p PC monitor confirms this problem. I have got a 1440x900 monitor on PC.

Maybe its still not economical to produce monitors with that good upscaling tech as that of full hd tvs. Hence maybe thats why we don't see PC monitors branded from Sony now a days. I remember the old days where Sony used to make CRTs

Can anyone confirm this? OR let me know if there are new monitors released with better scaling?

A brief addendum:

A short while ago I was reading about a theory of connections between early Kabbalistic thought and heresy in Medieval Occitania. It was positing some connection because Jews were more 'integrated' or 'accepted' in positions of Occitan economic life and political power during this period and therefore may have had some forms of cultural dialogue. Certainly Jews were more 'part of civic life' in Occitania than they were in the North of France. And in fact some of the terms of various treaties and papal bulls during the Albigensian crusade actually require removal of 'Jews' from some local offices.

To me, elaborating on the connections between various non-orthodox and non-Christian beliefs of the period quickly reveals the challenge in history writing of heresy: we don't have source documents from the heretics themselves. For example, if you haven't already you will encounter the dominant proposition that Catharism was a manifestation of Christian dualism brought to western Europe by Bogomil missionaries from eastern Europe in the 12th century, making Cathars some sort of 'Medieval Manicheans'. However the source documents which support this theory are now suspected as forgeries of the 17th century, or they are not eyewitness documents but written generations after the events by Catholic monks.

But you'll find the Bogomil theory all over the pages of Lambert's The Cathars, and 90% of Cathar history by some of the best historians. 

This is why I recommend Moore's War on Heresy, but more so because of the nature of your studies I would strongly suggest starting with Moore's earlier, very influential work on medieval society: The Formation of a Persecuting Society: Authority and Deviance in Western Europe 950-1250 (Wiley-Blackwell, revised 2007) where he looks at the relationship of dominant culture and politics to heretics, Jews and lepers of the time and how historiography since that time has accepted the basis of this persecution.

These five books I've mentioned should get you saturated not just with Catharism but with another important heretical group called Waldensians, and the Papal authorized variants of mendicant preaching formed to 'compete' with the Bon Hommes of Occitania: the Dominicans. 

These books will have bibliographies that will take you down paths that might be fruitful for your masters.

Do you comprehend that there are other countries in the world, and that other cultures live in them, and that those cultures have different opinions about things? 

Firstly, there's no such thing as an unalienable right, regardless of what your constitution and bill of rights says — they are a political fiction and an article of faith. Europe has made different decisions. Secondly, the rights America has decided on are influenced by American history and American thinking: they are in no way universally applicable to all of humanity.

In The Rights of Man, written by one of your founding fathers (who was English), Tom Paine talks about individual rights and collective rights. We (America and the UK) give up some of our individual rights because they are better managed collectively. America does this; that's why there are police to protect property and people and an Army to defend against foreign aggression (although that's not what it's used for these days). Americans give up some of their rights in exchange for collective protection.

Exactly the same in the UK, except that we never had a historical gun fetish and so, quite naturally, the ownership of lethal killing machines is one of the things we allow to be managed collectively.

The thing that pisses Europeans off the most about Americans is the frankly absurd idea that your culture should be applied to all of humanity because it's the natural and superior way of doing things in all details. This is particularly weird to us because when most of us look at the US and think, do we want Europe to be like this? The answer is a very firm: ""Fuck, no!""

Wow, talk about a venture capitalists wet dream.

I can't wait for the 1% to start implementing it immediately.



Seriously though. Before you read this: the US will never implement this system. I'm going to indulge you, but there's no 'we're going broke in 2020's or 2030's'. I'll caveat that with ""if our government doesn't continue to spend itself into a hole like a madman' (2002 to 2012 we balled over 13 trillion in debt - that's not good for us regardless of how you want to politically spin it or why we did it). The rich are getting vastly richer, but, so is most of America. The only ones who aren't are people with no skills. Basically, we farmed out all no-skill jobs to other countries and now those people who used to rely on it have found they aren't keeping up with the rise in inflation. Something that government assistance programs heavily disguise, but that's again, another topic.

 I've seen this concept a lot in the intermediate and advanced macroeconomics classes I took. Every society suffers so much...I can go into the millions of reasons why it is bad supported by a lot of fancy graphs and math theory, but let's just look at reality, what is going on now.

To most classical economists (read: the guys who write most textbooks and advise fortune 500 countries on how to make boatloads of cash) the concept of giving everyone free money does nothing to help a country's GDP. Historically, it has been used as a means to help a starved economy before austerity measures need to be put in.

Every country with the exception of Switzerland (who is special, and you should know why) that has implemented this (UK and Germany do to a degree...it's basically an expanded form of our welfare and it does end, and the UK is feeling it right now pretty bad too) is right now bankrupt.

So, without even consulting history, why would the United States, the world's most powerful and juggernaut economy, whom has never had a minimum income, and has literally become so powerful even a debt crisis so large it dwarfed European nation's GDP in terms of how much value was lost, it barely flagged us down (5% unemployment is unattainable to most european nations, 9.1% is their norm, our worst ever was almost 11%) would we want to go change to a system that Greece, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and France have used and whose countries are right now so bankrupt they have people starving in the streets and rioting?

Just from a historical purpose. I mean everyone who is screaming change and we must become more socialistic, you know the sky is falling, but really, why are we flirting with failed systems that have not worked in almost every nation? Our's works. You can argue it could be better (of course), but why?

That's the one thing I don't get.

Fucking loled. The US has some of the highest trade deficits in the world itself in some families of products. 

Being simplistic, a trade deficit usually means ''you are not producing enough in your country. You have the potential to create more jobs by fostering national sectors, but instead you are relying on imports and giving someone else money you could be spending in your own land''. 

Having a trade deficit is not inherently wrong, but it exposes the country to changes in foreign markets. For example: relying on cheap food imports (both Europe and the US love this shit) is all fun and games until emerging economies decide to keep their food for themselves.

As he grew older and started to see the impact of Zionism on the Palestinian people he began to feel uncomfortable about how the narrative of the Holocaust was used to justify Jewish actions in the name of Zionism. This led him to question the 'sacred' nature of the Holocaust narrative and, ultimately, to reject the following elements of the Holocaust narrative: Hitler's plan to rid Europe of Jews, the use of gas chambers to kill Jews, the idea that anything close to 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis. 

**My opinion on the article is this:** The disappointing thing with his article here is that he made a really good case for why the Holocaust narrative can't be used as justification for current Israeli crimes against the Palestinians, as well as a solid argument against this narrative's position in society as a 'sacred cow' that can't be questioned or criticised. 

Yet, the jump he made from these arguments to flat-out denial of some of the fundamental parts of the Holocaust narrative wasn't supported by any evidence against the Holocaust, or even any arguments to explain where the flaws are in the historical account. He simply said that the story doesn't add up and he doesn't believe it.

His concluding statement is telling. He states that:

&gt;I deny the Holocaust because, as constituted, exploited and enforced, the Holocaust narrative is a false and abusive god, and I wish to put as much moral distance between it and myself as I can. 

Essentially, his reasoning for questioning some of the fundamental elements of the Holocaust narrative is that he doesn't like how it has been misused by the Zionist movement. That simply doesn't cut it. If you are going to attempt to revise the historical account that exists in society, you need to provide some evidence to prove your assertions. (To be fair, he does link to a historian's reason for denying the Holocaust). 

He even goes so far to claim that:

&gt;I’m no scholar. I care nothing for the chemical traces in brickwork or the topological evidence for mass graves.

Here is stating that he doesn't care if there is evidence against what he believes. To me, this seems like it his Holocaust denial is far more faith than evidence based.

Overall, I agreed with the arguments Eisen made in the first part of his essay. The Australian historian, Robert Manne, has written some interesting things on the idea of the Holocaust as myth. The idea that historical narrative can be used or abused to serve contemporary purposes is a fascinating topic. It's just a shame that Eisen made the leap from questioning the use of the Holocaust narrative to simply questioning the Holocaust narrative altogether.",True,,cd4btmr,4,False,False,t5_2qh9a,4,

&gt; You claimed genetic engineering was merely the same as selective breeding

No, I said that it's just another method that creates new strains, like selective breeding, which is 100% accurate. It's obviously not the same method. But it is just another method. I made this extremely clear in my last comment, and it's not possible that you accidentally misinterpreted my words. If you're going to wilfully misinterpret things I have said, you may as well just go off and talk to yourself because that is not how you have a real conversation with another person. 

&gt; Selective breeding cannot create a fluorescent cat. Genetic engineering has created fluorescent cats. You need to learn the facts.

I already know the facts. You need to learn to stay on topic. Genetic engineering is a method that offers greater options than conventional breeding, but that doesn't mean it's not just another method. Saying a strain was created using this method or some other method tells you nothing about the nature of the strain itself. You may as well lobby to label the make and model of every machine used to prepare and package your food.

It's ironic how you call me ""irrational"" when you're doing nothing but persistently missing the point, and intentionally so, by all appearances.

Look into reading books about NLP so you can actually delve deeper into your own thought process and get yourself on track.

Reason's why I say this?

1. You say you want success (to make it), but you have no definition of what success is. So with no tangible goal for success, you'll neither have a direction or know when you reach it.

2. You state something you were passionate about was law enforcement - i.e. FBI. Why are you not going after this goal? If this was something you truly wanted, but couldn't step into, why not do something lower down the ladder and work your way up towards your goal starting at the bottom. If you're still in law enforcement - you are still working towards your passion.

3. You follow this up by saying you work in the craft beer industry, something that you truly love. Once again, if you've found your passion / are doing something you love - you are already in a better position than many, why do you think the grass is greener on the other side - potentially throwing away something you love, for something you hate.

4. You want success, but you have absolutely no idea how to get it. You early on say that you have no idea how you're going to achieve success, you follow it up by saying you believe luck having a key influence in. Then bring out a story about zappos idea being formed over drinks with people. You see, you can't want a business for the sake of having a business - this will likely become the 99% failure, instead you need to find a problem that needs to be solved, one that you have a deep passion for and then build a business around that. If you expect someone else to give you the idea for the business, you will struggle when you're the one running it and things are getting tough. Take Tim's story in 4 hour work week. The nutrition business he built which gave him his escape, was based around what he was passionate about and cared about - if you really want a business, YOU need to find this 'idea' / 'problem and have passion behind it - not them.

5. Since this is a pitch to Tim / Noah, you need to realise in any situation of pitching or selling, whether job interview, salary negotiation or closing a deal, it's not what the person you're pitching to can do for you, but what you can do for them and why it'll be good for them. ""You say the question lies on what either of you could do for me..."" - I think that's a problem in your pitch.

6. Why do you want a business? You say you don't want the money, but you want the freedom to travel the world... Most businesses actually restrict people's ability to live, rather than free them. It's usually the case of 3 or so hard years and if you're lucky then after the opportunities open up, if you're unlucky you may have a lifetime of hard work for no gain. Businesses are not easy, you may fail, you will have to sacrifice a lot of things, you need to understand deep down why you want this - &gt; this comes back to following your passion / having an idea you believe in and NLP regards to your inner thoughts.

7. The things you mentioned as reasons for wanting success from a business don't require a successful business. Some goals will take more time than others...

- To live ... you can do this now, infact tying yourself down to a business is going to limit your ability to live. Decide what things you want to achieve and go do them. Go be a ski instructor in Europe, go teach kids english in Indonesia, work as a tour guide in Thailand... Volunteer to help build a school in Africa, etc - You can travel the world, live your life and earn a living from a job that is just not conventional... I stress again - a business is something that needs to be grown, nurtured and will take far more time than a full time job, it's not a path to a more fulfilling life, except for the extreme case that it becomes successful enough to be self sustaining.

- Travel ... you can do this now, if you really wanted to travel you could take a job where this is part of the job and see the world. Otherwise you can save up and take mini backpacking trips every few years... keep it cheap and see the world bit by bit throughout your life.

- Teach your brother to build a business of his own. Why does he want a business? Are you the best mentor for this when you have no idea what you want to do / how you're going to achieve it?

- Pay off your parents debt. Ok this is hard, this isn't something that's easily solvable, even if you did have a business. This is something that needs planning and setting up to be paid down over a long period of time.

The reason they are backwards is because *they* treat people as ""not quite the same quality of a human being"", specifically 51% of their population for starters. Because *they* deny human rights, because *they* treat others as less human. 

It has nothing to do with genetics, it has everything to do with their culture. And when I say culture I mean religion, primarily. They have the potential to be just as good as any other nation, we're all human. Not to say the West is perfect either, far fucking from it.

Its goods are cheaper, but by the same token it raises the exchange rate for the wider currency region. Making their goods more expensive.

And do so whilst engaging in none of the normal solidarity acts that nation states engage in to normalise wealth potential within regions:

Federal US taxation is ~25% of GDP and the variation in spending levels between rich and poor states is ~5% of GDP, so a variation of roughly 20% of federal spending.

How big a budget would the EU need to be able to slosh around 5% of combined GDP into the poor regions (bearing in mind the current budget is only 1% (and heavily constrained by CAP payments)?

The other point is that americans accept this, they are all american, whereas we are rapidly finding out just how german the germans are, and finnish the finns are, when it comes to firehosing cash at nations they consider to be essentially delinquent! In the UK this ‘sloshing’ occurs in the form of:

a) National pay-bargaining which benefits poorer regions (teachers, nurses, etc)

b) National social benefits more generous than poorer regions could afford alone (eg.housing benefit in glasgow)

c) Targeted regional development grants/discounts to encourage business growth (objective 1 EU/WEFO funds)

d) Additional infrastructure spending to support the local economy (the mainland-skye bridge)

e) Operating national services hubs from depressed regions to boost wages (DVLA in swansea, etc)

Unless Germany recognises the ‘familial’ relationship, and the obligation that goes along with that, then it needs to leave for the good of its neighbours.

This principal applies equally to the netherlands and finland, but since it is Germany that is the driving economic power for the euro’s sake the answer must be ‘right’.

One mechanism to equalise this foriegn exchange disparity would be eurobonds. To compensate for a higher than natural foriegn exchange rate the wider currency union would borrow collectively, and thus lower their borrowing costs on the back of Germany's strength.

The quid-pro-quo would be that Germany's cost of borrowing would rise, as it too would be borrowing through the wider currency union and would see its strength diluted in consequence.

In short so you're not milling through long guides. First decide what you're going to play. Hunter is a very strong choice and doesn't require much setting up. This is my Hunter deck: http://i.imgur.com/vADzTOw.jpg

Although there are one or two rares, you can replace 2x Explosive Shot for 2xMulti Shot. King Krush you can ignore too, its there just for giggles.

2x Unleash Hounds =80 dust
2x Hyena = 80dust
2x Deadly Shot =80 dust. 
1x Explosive Trap =40dust
=280 dust and the rest are basic cards.

This is a really simple grind/rush deck which will make you gold quite fast. You either win fast or lose fast and thats what we want because we dont want long drawn out games, we want fast income.

Your first disenchant will give you 95 dust as a quest reward. Thats 2 cards bought already. One of the posters he says they don't disenchant gold cards, but to be honest, Disenchanting a gold and crafting its normal equivalent is 9/10 times a net gain in dust.

E.G A Gold common disenchants for 50 dust, the regular common costs 40 to craft. We don't lose cards, but we gain 10 dust.

You are not listening. Those two part timers should also have the same amount of paid vacation time as any other employee.

&gt;No, but I can still look over their work later or have them proof my own. Either way, they let me get more done even if I'm not there.

I see. But that doesn't require them to work while you are away.

&gt;Yes, some are billed regularly over the course of representation. Others come in frequently with small discrete work. In both cases, consistent billing is important.

I don't get the mindset of people who only pay bills on time when they receive them on a special day. But this can also be automated.

&gt;No, it's not just for retainers. The law requires the separate trust account in case a fee dispute occurs and so that some client assets can be passed through the lawyer (eg if I have a client pay for an expert witness). It's not a savings account, just a pass-through account. I don't have a choice-it's mandated by law.

Okay then, but in that case there is no need to access it during vacation.

&gt;I'd still have to be prepared to turn away new clients during that period because my office would be closed,

Correct!

&gt;Promising everyone a month off isn't realistic for every industry.

Of course it is. You cannot say its not realistic. It is proven every day at least in every EU country that is is indeed realistic. 500 million people prove that it works.

&gt;We pay night shift workers more, weekend-shift and holiday shift workers more, 

Thats a totally different thing. We also require these people be paid more by law.

&gt;Making everyone take time off makes those workers who don't want that time off less well off, 

Eh, no. It helps their health. When people are too dumb to care about their health that way one should force them. Anyway, these laws exist to force *employers* to sent their employees on vacation.

Basically, the main points:    

* 3DS version of MH3U cannot access online mode *by itself*    
* Your Wii U must be connected to your Internet router via an Ethernet cable, which means you must own a **Wii U USB &lt;-&gt; Ethernet adapter**. It is the same as the Wii Ethernet adapter that's been out for years so you can probably find a second-hand cheap one, however I would highly recommend to get an [OFFICIAL Nintendo adapter](https://store.nintendo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=117712&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=10001&amp;categoryId=62707), not one manufactured by a third-party (Nyko, Datel etc.).    
* The Wii U in relay mode cannot be used for anything else. It can only act as a relay for 1 3DS at a time.    
* You will be able to join other people's room, but you cannot *create* rooms. 4 players accessing online mode using the 3DS &lt;-&gt; Wii U relay method therefore cannot play together (but that situation is highly unlikely). Some other functions may not be available compared to using directly the Wii U version of MH3U online.    
* You may ask, *“why is this so troublesome, why not just buy directly the Wii U version?”* – well, 3DS version of MH3U was released in December 2011 in Japan while Wii U version came out one year later, in December 2012; the main point of this relay thing is to allow Japanese 3DS players to play online without having to buy the Wii U version of the game. In Europe/America, since both 3DS/Wii U versions came out at the same time, it's obviously much less useful.

In my experience with Europe's constitutional monarchies, the main tangible benefit (speaking for myself) is that you have a country with an apolitical head of state that does not represent any political party, ethnic group or other faction (as an American dual citizen, I wonder what America would be like if presidents weren't actively hated by at least half the country). I think that's quite important for countries regardless of whether or not they've got a tumultuous history. And yes, before anyone says it, I know the president of Ireland is a similar figurehead. But the idea that the Queen in the UK doesn't represent Labour, or the Conservatives, but ONLY the people of the country is quite an important thing for any country to have. In addition, armed forces swear allegiance to the Queen and not the government. I like that as well - they're working for someone whose job is to care about their wellbeing, not someone who cares about making a name for themselves.

In addition, and again this is only me speaking, but I think the concept of a living royal family makes that nation's symbols and historical traditions feel more 'authentic', so to speak. You can often tell where certain things like flags, emblems, logos, traditions, national anthems etc. were created by politicians of the 'new republic' not so long ago as a way of making a clean break with their past, particularly in countries that went from monarchy to socialism. However, in the UK for example, nothing seems disingenuine about the royal standard, or the coat of arms, or the regnal seal, or the national anthem, because they're ancient standards upholding a tradition that exists today. It's rather difficult for me to explain properly as it's more of a feeling than an objective appraisal, but perhaps you see what I mean.

EDIT: for what it's worth, here's a comprehensive list of monarchies in Europe:

* Andorra (co-principality with royal duties split between the Bishop of Urgell, elected by the Pope, and the sitting President of France, which makes François Hollande both the president of a republic and co-prince of a principality)
* Belgium
* Denmark
* Liechtenstein

After the European revolutions of 1848 were crushed, 150 years later we have a very stable, somewhat democratic, peaceable Europe.

There are times when revolution is the only choice you have left (I would say most Arab countries fell into this a few years ago; as did the Soviet satellite states in 1989). 

On a more basic level, I think everyone is getting a little off-base by assuming this would be a violent revolution. The fall of the Soviet Union was largely peaceful (thank you Mr Gorbachev).

Not to mention the recent debacle McDonald's had showing how unrealistic living off one job working for them is.

None of this contradicts anything I've said.  I don't know who is making the ""low level McDonald's and Walmart employees make a lot of money"" argument that you seem to be trying to bust, but it's not me.

&gt;It is sad that you think 3 weeks after FIVE years is acceptable (let alone 4 after 15). That's all that needs to be said.

This entire thread you've been making the argument that its impossible to build a lifestyle around making minimum wage, only getting two weeks vacation each year, no benefits, etc.  The only people who are 'suffering' through these things are people who are fairly new to the company.  People who have been with the company for a while make 'decent' money, get more than 2 weeks vacation, etc.  Thus your argument makes no sense.  

To put it another way, people who get no benefits and no vacation time at Walmart don't need benefits and vacation time; those that do need them get them.

&gt;I am not having trouble 'grasping' anything you pretentious twat. My point is that since the recession most jobs that were regained are part-time ones like working at McDs. Coincidentally, they are the exact group that don't get any benefits.

Gee, I wonder what could be the cause of this.  Can you think of a massive new regulation adopted within the last few years which will make hiring full time employees significantly more expensive?

Nah, government policy can't possibly be to blame for anything.  Let's just blame it on ""greed"" and angrily shake our fists at Ronald McDonald.  

&gt;The problems Europe are having are NOT due to vacation time (with the exception of Greece perhaps). The fact that you think that shows you don't understand fuck all.
Go learn something.

haha, massive youth unemployment has been a problem in Europe for a long time.  It predates this recent eurozone crisis by a significant margin.  

And when you ask businesses in Europe why they aren't hiring young people they will tell you its because the costs don't outweigh the benefits.  It's not simply because of vacation time as you so dishonestly put it; there are an entire litany of regulatory barriers which make it impossible.  Required PTO is just one example.

&gt;What the fuck does the 'left' have anything to do with what I'm talking about you dumb sack of shit.

Nope, just in places where it happens to suit their agenda. 

&gt;Because we're on the same side in this, you and I, and even I think that would be flagrantly stupid.

Then evidently you are not a student of history? 

Wasn't it great how the US and European countries extrajudicially renditioned people off to Libya to be imprisoned and tortured prior to the 2011 uprising? But then out of the blue we decide the government is violating Libyan human rights, even though the west had special operations units on the ground who were actively funding the destabilization of the region, arming and training the radical Islamist rebels prior to the uprising provoking the government to defend itself (just like is happening in Syria). 

Ultimately, you are missing the big point. It isn't that the US is backing and arming Al Qaeda, it's that they do so selectively (a lot of reasons for this) and the even bigger point is that the US backs murderous (mostly right wing) groups all the time. 

You can see the deaths and oppression resulting from CIA activities and operations in: Italy, Iran, Albania, Greece, Egypt, Kosovo, Hungary, Turkey, Honduras, El Salvador, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Rhodesia, Congo, Angola, Ghana, Vietnam, Laos, Libya, Syria, and many more. Keeping in mind that many of these countries were stable governments or democracies prior to US interventionism.

Were not just talking about hundreds or thousands... but roughly ten million plus people over the span of half a century who have been killed directly and indirectly through US covert, overt, economic, and military actions. And that isn't even counting the millions of other people in South America, Central America, Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia who have been injured, imprisoned, and are living under oppressive US backed regimes. 

This [flow chart]( http://english.al-akhbar.com/sites/default/files/P_19_Diagram.jpg) is really critical in understanding how the CIA and western intelligence agencies attempt to destabilize regions and foment violent unrest. In Syria and elsewhere they have a whole network of right wing NGO's heavily invested in spreading and perpetuating war. This is nothing new, the US government has done this for at least five decades now.

On a slightly related note, that provides a nice in depth look at the framework the CIA uses to destabilize countries here's a nice long [PDF](http://www.kropfpolisci.com/imperialism.syria.cartalucci.pdf) (there's also a paperback book you can find for sale) that details how the CIA and neo-conservative NGO's are provoking the uprising in Syria.

If a family wants to circumcise their son, let them. It's not dangerous and part of their culture and probably an accepted practice in their society. It's not like it's castration. It's fucking skin.

Edit: Wow. Look at all those downvotes! Keep 'em coming! Just to be clear, though, I don't care if you choose to not circumcise your newborns. I understand, respect and accept your decision and arguments against it. I am tolerant of your culture and practices, why can't you be of mine for something that is not dangerous or harmful in anyway and is accepted within the borders of my country, society and culture?

**Edit 2:** Well this slightly got out of hand. I am not saying it is right, nor am I saying it's not right. Let me try and clarify my stance though I know at this point it is futile to convince any of you that I am not an asshole.

It's a choice by the parents to determine what they feel is best for their son as he grows older in a society where circumcision is a common and accepted procedure to have peformed (though it is declining here). Often those who are not ""cut"" will be humiliated with taunts and jokes stemming from both the opposite and same sex thus potentially causing undue emotional and mental distress which could lead to further psychological issues. By the time the child is old enough to make his own decision, even if taught properly to defend himself and completely understand why he was not circumcised, damage could already be done.

Yes, it's purely cosmetic. Yes, it's conforming to bullshit societal standards. Yes, it sucks. But don't deny that the type of humiliation and frequency of teasing a child experiences could be detrimental to their current and future life. This is the ONLY reason for my post. Yes, I said it's just skin, which it is, and I understand it came off minimizing the other side's stance, and for this I do apologize. It was a cheap tactic. I do understand that there are complications, but they are so statistically low that it is not deemed dangerous.

I don't think any of you who have commented have the right to judge those of us who chose to have our sons circumcised without completely understanding the implications not to do so in our society, especially as a young male grows older. My wife and I discussed the issue and felt this was the best decision to make for our son who will be growing up in a society of circumcised, ""normal"", penises and it is just one less thing he has to worry about when he hits puberty and becomes an awkward, confused teenager. If he were not then that's when kids start cruelly snickering at his junk in the shower in gym class or after practice one day and he shouldn't have to worry about that along with everything else teenagers have to deal with these days.

One argument against my stance is teaching your son the reasons behind your decision to opt-out of circumcision and how he can better inform and defend himself against others. That way he should have enough confidence and self-esteem to ward off any psychological harm. Unfortunately, undeveloped minds are extremely impressionable and trying to talk reason with a teenager can be extremely difficult. That's not to say it's not possible, it absolutely is, but raising children the way you envisioned it is hardly guaranteed. Therefore this is not easily attainable, and even if it is, his peers might eventually get to him and break him down enough to have lasting negative effects.

One final note, my wife and I don't believe that a circumcised penis is a ""normal"" looking penis, as I mentioned above (thus the quotes). Unfortunately, most of our society currently does and young people can be cruel so we felt the pro of a healthy emotional well-being as a teenager outweighed the potential risks of circumcision.

Also, to the person who so thoughtfully chose to share female genital mutilation as if it's on the same level, it is not. Circumcision, though not preventing a disease/disorder nor adding any benefit, is not removing/mutilating the ability to perform a natural function of the human body.

TL;DR I am not against nor in favor of circumcision. I am pro choice based on societal standards and what parents think is best for their son's mental and emotional well-being as they grow older.",True,,cd4f0ob,-23,1383359031,False,t5_2qhk3,-23,

Abortion should never be used for birth control. But that's what it is used for let's be honest.

In Europe they have less abortions because they are not making a left and right issue out of it. If you want to have a abortion do it, but you will have to live with that decision and you might be happy afterwards or you might feel miserable afterwards.

The USG is not treating ""dissent as defection,"" or ""criminalizing political speech."" It's prosecuting - not *persecuting,* which is similar but substantively different - a defector who committed major legal infractions against his own government.

Snowden committed treason. If he thought that what the NSA was doing violated his ethical principles, he should've just stopped working for them. But he didn't. He worked for years to compile enough confidential, top-secret material to create an uproar, and then just dumped it into the public square, materially harming U.S. interests.

The question of what everyone thinks of US surveillance efforts is **completely beside the point** when it comes to considering Snowden himself. Snowden is a traitor who disregarded his legal duty and compromised US national security, and he needs to be held to account.

If that's the case, then areas with higher unemployment would have a larger number of people looking to sell their homes and move out.  This drives prices down which allows home ownership to be attainable by lower income strata portions of the population while at the same time reducing the population that is renting in the state.  So we have a bit of a chicken-or-the-egg problem going on here.

The Monroe Doctrine was created primarily to prevent European power struggles spilling into open conflict into the American continent.  The British, who were looking to trade with newly independent states in Latin America, saw this as a great opportunity to squeeze Spain out of the Americas and prevent them from recapturing lost territory.

It wasn't until the 1890s and the Spanish American War that the US became a regional hegemon, and shortly after that with the Roosevelt Corollary that the Monroe Doctrine became a tool for protecting a true sphere of influence.

The Monroe Doctrine is more comparable to the Russia Empire's policy of protectionism of all Slavic nations than to China's annexation of Tibet.  Since the Monroe Doctrine did not specifically establish any sovereign territory (though it did lead to Manifest Destiny and westward expansion), I would say it's exactly nothing like the Tibet situation.

1.Africa was actually quite develped, there were stone cities near lake Victoria and Somalia in ancient times. Sahara was verdant and capable of sustaining large populations. The problems started around the time when slavers (initially Arabs, but later europeans) started to raid and take people into slavery. 

2.Slavery alone was bad, but not a show stopper. What really stared the gradual decline was European colonialism. Because of advanced weaponery (Gatling gun and cannon) europeans took over vast tracts of Africa. Young Winston Churchil distinguished himself in a campaing where thousands of heroic warriors were machine gunned as they attacked british positions.

3.Once European governments established colonies, they were exploiting them hard. There was no education, no local government, any sign of a local leader was immediately stamped out with brute force and violence as a rule. For decades, western governments worked hard shipping local resources such as wood and minerals to europe rather than use them to advance local civilisation. When they left, often they left abrutbtly leaving behind no transition processes, allowing local strong men to basically usurp power. Corruption and lack of direction reigned supreme.

4.Africa became a chessboard for West vs East where proxy battles between West and USSR were fought. Vast amounts of money was spent on armies and guerillas in brutal conflicts going on for decades.

5.Where there was no war, western mining companies set up shop, buying influence with bribes and guns. Minerals and wealth once again went to the west and the few corrupt politicians.

6.IMF and The World bank kept giving 'development' loans. But thanks to corruption and poor governance, most if not all money was wasted, but to get more loans, IMF and WB set up rules, in some countries up to 90% of GDP was spent on servicing western loans before Education, Health and Infrasturcture.

7.Early on (50's and 60's) some geniuses from UN and Europe 'solved' the hunger problem in Africa. They destroyed virtually hundreds of different crop varieties all evolved to survive climate and pests and replace them with mono-culture grains that was 'well suited' to Africa to give greater crop yields. It was ok for a while, then dry time came and people starved and died because the western crop failed, not just one of a hundred viaries. ALL of it because there were now one or two varieties. Oops. The west agriculturalists have learned a valuable lesson about native crops we are still discovering today. But the grain and artificial fertilizers were often bought with loans, yes you guessed they still had to pay them off.

8.Even today, the West plays games with Africa. Often tying up aid and loans to crazy requirements like 'human rights'. Chinese on the other hand, just give money for roads, hospitals and development to secure influence. So while life slowly improves, human rights does not.

TL;DR: Guns, Germs and Steel + Asshole Politicians.

Education for young adolescents should be about learning to organise your mind (by learning facts and practising the regurgitation of facts at a moments notice) so you can process things in an effective way. Not analysing things. I remember being in a lecture at uni aged 21 (officially a 'mature' student) being set my first real essay and, on the subject of referencing, the lecturer basically said, 'I don't care about your opinion unless you've got a PhD. You can learn what the greats have written and understand why they are considered the greats. Then when I think you've studied enough and can hold yourself in an argument and you have proven that to your peers, I might actually care about what you think on a thing.' Do we apply that to teenagers? The fuck we do. ""Here's a cartoon from the 1950s. Please give us your opinion on it, remembering to touch vaguely on the Cold War, the key dates of which you won't remember in a year because of the way we teach you."" We set wishy washy exams that 'release their creativity' and 'cultivate their expression' and for what? So they can waste time not learning what experts have to say on the matter?

Go to France and they all have to take French, a modern language, mathematics, and philosophy until the age of 18. The result?

The whole discussion is about an artifact from a superstitious cult's inventory. There have been many claims made about the artifact. The cult allowed a sample to be taken and it was tested properly. 

Claims made that were unsubstantiated- sample was taken from a mended area; untrue, the mended area was avoided for just such reasons. - pollen samples were from middle east- unreliable due to the fact they could have been planted or collected at any time. - sample's fibers and weave originated in western europe, france or britain, not middle east, - sample's age still dated within 300 years of original carbon dating- still 1700 years after the event claimed by cult and therefore object is still a fraud.
The ""bias"" you seem to think I have is not present.. It is based upon scientific observation. It is an icon of a superstitious cult- fact. It has been tested and clearly is over a millennium younger than said cult claims.

A 'populist' party says that more power should be taken from the central EU-Brussels central government and devolved to a national level, and then again from that national level to local level.  More local autonomy less central government.

More local government means putting those making decisions more before the immediate electorate, more accountable, and less authoritarian.  It puts more of the policy at the belt buckles of those it directly affects, and makes policy less detached.  So decidedly less authoritarian and corruption/waste less easy.

When we apply the same standards it means putting local people more  in control of local matters in the stead of large, centralised diktat.

Understand that a 'populist' party that argues for *civic* national-statism is considerably less authoritarian than somebody arguing for EU fedralist nationalism.  The federalist argument simply trades up for a greater nationalist identity.

Dude, the war in Europe was decided by the Russians. And that's just the immediate cause. Should D-Day never happened, the Russians would have stopped at the Atlantic Ocean. The Japanese Empire would not have attacked the US had it not forced its hand by crippling sanctions (which were designed to do so, according to some historians). The US did not want to do anything with the Nazis in Europe; you make it sound like you actually wanted to help... You'd be surprised how pro-Nazi the US was in those times.

Please, for all that is holy, FUCKING EDUCATE YOURSELF. Read up on the reasons for the Second World war, and you will see (spoiler alert) that your fucking meddling during the First, and the following unjust peace terms, in addition to the Great Depression (exported from the US) lead to the Nazi Party in power. So no. You can't claim you won something which you did not, and especially not when it was a forseen consequence of your and your allies (especially the French) actions. There were plenty of people who said in 1919 that this peace will lead to another war, yet you went ahead. 

Same thing in small scale at every part of the world: you created monsters, which eventually turned on you: Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden were all your puppets. You have no moral superiority dispatching these monsters. You were the ones unleashing them on the world. Not to mention the other monsters you still keep supporting.

This simpleton view of history really does make a disservice to you. It enhances the impression of Americans as ignorant and uninformed. It should be your duty to fight this image by being informed, not to make it stronger. Go on Amazon and buy a few books on the history of the 20th century, for christ's sake.

I think it just really depends on the person. I play on US servers but live in Europe, which makes my time zone way ahead of everyone else, so that's a huge issue. Second, I play on a realm (alliance-Chogall) where there is really only one guild that does ANY raiding at all, and the time they do it (Sat. 7pm-10pm realm time) ends up being somewhere like 2am for me. 

During the day, I do have a lot of sort-of free time, being a stay at home mom, but I definitely don't have large chunks of time where I can just sit at the computer and play either. I play for a few minutes here and there throughout the day.

I understand you probably have experienced a lot of minor racial differences over time but this isn't really one. I'd fully expect to be rejected for being white is that was their personal preference (in the way I've been rejected for not being tall). It's about being attracted to people which is very different from racism (or just the minor racial differences you see).

The rest is probably legitimate, though I have a lot of black friends and they have never said anything about this to me. Might just be because the UK is a bit different though. When I'm abroad in Europe it always shocks me when I realize I'm in a room full of only white people.

First, you are profoundly mistaken if you think this breaks down as a traditional liberal/conservative, Dem/Repub issue in the U.S. It isn't. For example, I'm a liberal Democrat. That said, I'm not against the U.S. cyber-surveillance program. In fact, I want us to have the world's most powerful intelligence capabilities to spy on any nation or individual, anytime or any place, and I'm glad we do. Like (I think) most Americans, I just want it directed at the right targets (i.e. let's spy on Putin a little more, and on the German chancellor a little less), and given the proper amount of oversight.

Second, I'm not worried about the Europeans. The EU can't even agree which side of their bread to butter in the morning without a 2-year fact finding panel, let alone on European-wide regulation or policy responses to anything. European states and the US are too intertwined economically, politically and militarily to step back from that relationship now. Sure, we might see some minor policy setbacks (the trade deal, for example, or Safe Harbor, etc.), and we might not be able to twist arms on diplomatic issues as effectively, but that's about it. The U.S. is too powerful and influential to not engage with deeply, and it'll always be in the EU's interest to do so.

Third, I think you're probably an angsty youth who lacks judgment or any sense of perspective if you seriously believe that there's any parallel between a open, liberal democracy like the U.S. and China or Russia.

If, however, you're going to have a system that is legally obligated to provide some form of baseline emergency service, how that system gets paid for ends up being a political issue.

You don't want insurance? Fine; as long as you never get hurt or sick enough to go to the emergency room, or can pay all of your medical costs out-of-pocket, then you've got a system that imposes no burdens on the rest of the community. And when you're young, it may well seem like you'll never get that hurt or sick. But as a matter of statistical fact, many people without health insurance do eventually need emergency room care, and when they can't pay their bills, the financial burden falls on the state.

Which means, in effect, that you *do* have de facto health insurance—you're just not paying a fair price for it. The cost of your health insurance is unfairly distributed among taxpayers—many of whom are already paying for their own health insurance as well. To make that plain: If you don't have health insurance and you end up needing emergency care, you are, in effect, freeloading on the system and driving up costs for everyone else.

There are a few potential solutions to that problem. One is to simple repeal laws that require hospitals to provide emergency care to uninsured patients. That would be catastrophically bad for you if you ever needed emergency care, but it would, at least, be more equitable financially.

Another possibility is a single-payer healthcare system—i.e. all health insurance is paid for by the government through taxation. That's a pretty popular solution in European countries, and it's what the Obama administration originally pushed for, but got lost in negotiations with the GOP when Obama thought there might still be some chance of passing a bipartisan bill.

The third is what we have now: a law requiring that everyone purchase health insurance (or pay a penalty), with related laws ensuring that insurance is accessible to all without many of the restrictions that preventing people from getting it before.

U.S. consumers would benefit greatly if these companies entered the U.S. market and offered health-insurance policies in competition with existing U.S. companies. The U.S. market is much different than European markets, of course, and these companies could not simply offer their home-market products to Americans. But if they were given access to the vast U.S. market, they would have an incentive to figure out how to sell health-insurance policies here.

The problem isn't that there is a lack of competitive options in the private insurance, it is that the structure of health care / insurance laws change insurance from a product designed to shift personal risks into fixed costs into products designed to redistribute costs between individuals.  Moreover:

&gt;I'm sure some conservatives will say that health insurance should be a normal insurance product and not a tool of fiscal redistribution. But we have this system for a reason: chronic health conditions are really expensive, and they can't be addressed through one-year contracts. Addressing the problem of uninsurability requires either heavy-handed regulation of the sort we have now and will have under Obamacare, or some other heavy-handed non-market alternative, like a single-payer plan for catastrophic health expenses.

1. I was taught in school that government is benevolent and there to keep you safe. The biggest threat to society as a whole was evil cooperations and people polluting our envirnment! (I livein California. We were really taught this shit). I recall my old government teachertreating me like an idiot for the semester for questioning the lesson. Kids are highly impressionable and are taught to trust authority figures because they know more than a kid does. 

2. I remember when I first graduated high school I was exposed to some Socialist shit via the invernet. TED was a major influence on my ideas, and some other videos I StumbledUpon. I also recall reading a lot about how Europe was this amazing paradise where everybody ws taken care of by government and led happy happy blissful lives.

3. I used to watch Jon Stewart a lot. That show was big influence on me

4. Almost my entire family identify themselves as Democrat. Their opinions really ha a major influence on the way I thought. I'd say I was a little more libertarian leaning in terms of social issues (you should be allowed to do what you want with your own life and body). I had no real understanding of economics. At one point I became really anti-drug (mostly because of school, but partly also because of my mom). 

5. Anti-capitalist tropes in media and adages suh as ""Money can't buy you happiness"" were things I really subscribed to.

6. Anti-Republican sentiment during the Bush years had me swinging hard Left, even though I was only in middle school (and later high school).

7. Weed and psychedelics. I became pretty anti-govt when I started tripping, but this really only hlped to lead me to Socialism. I wasn't an anarchist because I figured we just needed to change the govt we had, not completely get rid of it altogether.

Basically, I think it has a lot to do with environment. If you aren't being exposed to ideas other than what you're raised with, you're just going to stick with what you know. A lot of people also have no interest in exploring other ideas because they just can't see anything wrong with theirs (and sometimes they're also just lazy and can't be bothered to worry about their own opinions). 

But anyway, TL;DR I agree that there's a lot that goes into influencing a person's opinion. People are taught beliefs, and it's few and far between who will take the effort to be open minded enough to admit they may be wrong. It doesn't make them indoctrinated or brainwashed - they're just people doing what people do.

We are not really talking about skull size. We are talking about *internal cranial volume*, which in essence correlates with brain size, which in turn correlates with the number of cortical neurons in your brain.

Average brain size for Asians: 1 364 cc (over 1 400 cc in Korea &amp; Japan)

Average brain size for Europeans: 1 347 cc

Average brain size for Africans: 1 267 cc

There is tons of research about this and the trends are clear, but here is the source:

Race, Evolution and Behaviour by Professor J. Philippe Rushton, 1995
http://www.harbornet.com/folks/theedrich/JP_Rushton/Race.htm

**• What does Jared Diamond have to do with the results here?**

Nothing, really. My point is that to understand the world, you can't go on IQ alone. After all, environment and circumstance play a role. Guns, Germs &amp; Steel gives a good account of these factors in relation to why the world looks like it does.

**• Does the testing try to isolate factors (poverty, etc) within a single genetic population?**

Yes, Lynn has compensated and accounted for all these factors - and many more, and their effects on the results of the IQ test of a population. The links in the OP, and the books, contain more information about this.

The wikipedia article on ""Race and intelligence"", for example, brings up the effects of various parameters on intelligence - health &amp; nutrition, socioeconomic environment and education, just to name a few. However, Lynn clearly shows that even when fully compensating for these factors, the trends remain.

In the example of education, health &amp; nutrition, there are many studies comparing native Africans to African-Americans of the same heritage - African-Americans who are in good health, not malnourished, and who attend good schools all around the US. They perform slightly better than their native African counterparts, but there is still a major difference when compared to European-Americans. This clearly points to genetics, not environment, being the greater factor in the equation.

**• Do we have any twins studies on this?**

I'm not sure what you mean here. Twins of different races?

**• Once you control for those factors, is there an additional correlation with ""percent genetically related to Neanderthals""?**

No one has done research of this kind yet, though it would be very interesting to see the results. Keep in mind, the Neanderthal Genome Project was completed as recently as 2010.

**• What does it mean to be 4% Neanderthal but 98% related to a chimpanzee?**

Well, the latest research suggests we are more like 94% chimpanzee than 98%, but I was trying to prove a point that 1-2% base pair difference in the genome can make a huge difference between and within species. But being 94% similar to chimpanzees can make it easier to understand how we can also be 1-4% neanderthal.

If you want to know more, you can just google Neanderthal Research Project. But always look when the article was written - the final results in 2010 showed a much stronger presence of the Neanderthal genome both in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of modern non-African humans than the preliminary findings of the study suggested.",True,Camera,cd4jqh7,-2,1383341369,False,t5_2si92,-2,

&gt;She was actually pretty much ignored until the famous History of France by Jules Michelet which is nowadays considered deeply flawed if well written. For instance, she was only beatified in 1909 and canonized in 1920.
Also, she's not really seen as a symbol of french unity. Ever since she's become popular in the late 19th century, she's always been tied to the counter-revolutionary far-right, in particular national-catholic Action Française. Every year, every movement of the far-right (from monarchists to neo-nazis) celebrate Joan of Arc with a march on May, 1st in Paris. It's a dreadful sight.

These companies are eating their own seed corn. Wages are consumption and demand

let me repeat that, wages are consumption  and demand 

One thing  I can promise them is that all the nations where they've outsourced to won't be picking up the slack. That excess efficiency is why so many companies are hurting.

The future version is. If robots make goods and perform services, deliver goods and handle them and do checkout, who is going to buy the goods? 

The 10% of people whose jobs a robot can't do will not be able to maintain the consumption needed to maintain the civilization and it will either  implode , re-localize (everything is made community level) or end up socialist (the government is already nearly 40% of the US economy at all levels, going to true socialism by increments is not inconceivable.

  I do not however think  many CEO's  care. The decent ones are too short sighted and many of the others are complete sociopaths whose need to be better than everyone else is so great they will do anything to anyone

As for the topic at hand, the whole situation is complex. 

Indexing the wage will help but if there are no jobs,its moot.

  Reducing money printing and borrowing will reduce inflation and make wages go farther but with the serious hunger issue, real cutbacks could result in catastrophic instability in markets and public safety.

Ideally we'd have a market based approach, I being a Conservative prefer this but if we can't not being a  Neo Liberal  would settle for Socialized Medicine and Social Credit 

While we can mint that, the social costs are high and the US has a hollow state on its Southern Border where 1/3 of its men have mostly illegally immigrated here.

You can't have a welfare state and much immigration. 

Also the US is the hegemonic power, having the US  move to a welfare state of some kind mean an end to this function which would not be as good as some think. 

The US is often  morally dubious  but the  people craving to fill that power vacuum are black hats (Europe can't do this)

Except Singapore(80 years, with only 9 countries ahead of it, and 69% of funding is from private sources). Oh and Japan? Well they're less socialized than Europe and only partially cover things, and they're number one in life expectancy at 82 years. Then there's Cyprus which is ahead of numerous countries and has 51% from private sources.

 And then there's Ghana, who also has government healthcare and their life expectancy is 64 years, more than a decade shorter than the US.

The US is also ahead of oil rich Venezula, Brazil, and oil rich Qatar, all of whom have government systems.

Your claims only work by ignoring all the exceptions. Only by ignoring that things other than healthcare, such as lifestyle, diet, and crime, affect the life expectancy can you make such claims, along with the numerous factors that affect the cost of healthcare.


&gt;It does, but you apparently haven't dealt with the budgets of large busiensses, so you wouldn't know.

No, it doesn't. The fact someone wants more profit doesn't mean they will do things that will reduce profit. If having lower quality leads to less profit, they won't do that.

When you have a dearth of competition, that's when you can lower quality and not lose profit because you don't have competitors that can outdo you, which leads to a loss of marketshare and thus loss of profit.

&gt;I see that you don't actually have a point to make and that you're just arguing for the sake of arguing, so I'll let you have the last word.

My point is that your arguments for what you think reduce the cost of healthcare are flawed. This doesn't make your conclusions inherently wrong, but that they are not well supported.

Anyway, my feeling about the article is that the need to 'fake it until you make it' combines with the urban/black culture where flashy and ostentatious means status and wealth.

I grew up in a mostly white upper-class suburb, where my family was on the ""poorer"" end of the spectrum, but by no means were we uncomfortable. I grew up in an environment where being fashionable meant being classy, which meant conservative, carefully chosen clothing or accessories. My dad couldn't afford a Rolex, but if he wore it right, a Seiko could look almost as good. We couldn't afford a Lexus, but we could keep our car impeccably clean. We didn't own anything that was gauche or opulent, unlike the family 4 blocks away with tennis courts in their backyard. We couldn't afford landscaping or housecleaning services like everyone else on our block, so a significant amount of effort on the part of my brother and I in doing chores gave us a sense of how much work you had to do when 'keeping up with the Jones', but not surpassing them, was all you could hope for. My dad woke up at 5am every morning so that he could walk to the train station with his coffee and paper, so that he wouldn't pass neighbors or his business associates as they drove by in their luxury sedans. Our real estate taxes and our mortgage cost too much, so my parents kept refinancing, even if it meant they wouldn't own the house outright until they were in their 70s, because keeping my brother and I in the best school district we couldn't afford was important to them. My dad is a cancer survivor, so his insurance was always two or three times more expensive, and he couldn't do anything to risk losing his job. I won't claim that they had it especially hard, but it was certainly not a life of ease and relaxation.

What they did have going for them was their Eastern European ancestry, their legacy of ancestors who were willing immigrants to this country, knowing that struggling up the ladder would mean working unpleasant jobs as meat packers or poorly-compensated tailors in the hope that their children could be better educated, and do better than they had. Their race and their culture made fitting in easier, certainly, than it was for blacks, migrating to the North in the same time period, even if they started out equally penniless.

What this means, is that my parents were able to give my brother and I the opportunities they didn't quite have. Out of college, my brother makes nearly as much as my father does after 40 years in the same industry. I'm studying to be a physician. Our children will hopefully have the lives that our parents wished for their grandchildren, when they decided that taking out a mortgage they couldn't afford was worth it, if it meant more education.

So I absolutely agree that insinuating yourself into the social class above you is a driving factor in these decisions, but the lack of a specific cultural upbringing, the white, European sense of what is proper decorum, means that the efforts are sometimes misdirected or perceived as the attempt to ""live beyond their means"" that they are.",True,,cd4krwq,8,1383330648,False,t5_2r0z9,8,

He's lost the average American who 1) doesn't think spying on other countries is particularly heinous and 2) who already assumed that this was happening based on, say, the founding purpose of the NSA and CIA. 

Sadly, I think Edward Snowden's only legacy will be a myriad of government-regulated ""national internets"" around the world. Instead of an American-run world internet, with all it's faults, we'll have a Brazilian government internet, a Chinese government internet, an Iranian internet, an EU internet, etc..

A point of clarification: I claimed Snowden's leaks to the Chinese included detailed info of our cyber warfare capabilities because of such things as: the IP addresses that we were operating from; our entry points at Tsinghua University; etc. Even *Glenn Greenwald* thought Snowden went too far:

&gt; Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have. . . What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.

Hmmmmmm.....  I mean, you're right, but I could say ""black, american culture is much more similar to Africans than to any Irish person.""  You seem to be defining American culture entirely based on the majority.  But American culture is more defined by it diversity than by a single race.  And I'm not saying this because I think what you're saying is offense.  

I mean, the thing you are right about is that modern American civilization was developed by White Anglo Saxons from Europe.  We're Eurocentric in how our country developed.  But first of all, people from Asia came here long before any white people did -- over 10,000 years ago in fact.  American Indians are descendants of Asia.

As far as Asian immigrants, lots of Chinese people came to the US in the late 1800s during the mass immigration that came with the Industrial revolution.  To those people, their nationality is just as American as the nationality of a person who immigrated from Ireland.  They may have preserved parts of their Asian culture, but especially for any descendants of these immigrants, they are more American than they are Asian.

So getting back to the point, with the Vietnam memorial, an Asian person living in the US is just as American as anyone else whose ancestors immigrated here.  We're a diverse nation made up of all cultures, not a mostly white, European nation.  And besides, even in Vietnam we we had Asian soldiers from South Vietnam and other places fighting **with** American soldiers against the North Vietnamese, so the whole idea that there's something wrong with an Asian designing the Vietnam Memorial is just crazy ridiculous.",True,,cd4kvp2,5,False,False,t5_2qzb6,5,

&gt; That said, *he does* say that he would have a massive redistribution of wealth, heavy taxes on big corporations and huge responsibilities on energy companies so that they can help out the environment a little and stop putting profit above everything else. He says the concept of profit should be hugely reduced.

It's commendable that he wants to raise awareness and I understand his point but he really wasn't being fair to the interviewer.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's basically saying he wants to raise awareness and spur action. Okay, great. But people have been saying this as far back as Aristotle. The difference was those pundits also offered some solutions so there would be some sense of accountability for the causes they advocated.

The interviewer wasn't asking for a complete, holistic plan for a utopian society. He was just asking what it would look like and how to get started. Literally anyone can say ""we need a better society"". People have been talking about this ceaselessly from the beginning of civilization.

&gt; Russell says there should be change. The article says it's ""fun to watch"" but he doesn't provide any evidence for his claims. They say he's put very little thought into the outcome of revolution. I would argue that he has put a significant amount of thought into it vs. the average person, who I would say doesn't really care that much. Awareness is a start.

He also advocates people to not vote because it's simply participating in what he calls an already broken political process, and by voting, you are being complicit to that system and upholding a flawed status quo.

This actually goes against his agenda. It promotes an oligarchy where the few people left that still participate in the system can still control the system. It would be much easier to reform a democracy from within. I can't speak for other countries but if Russell Brand really thinks that American voters don't have power, he should stop before he becomes the laughing stock of the political science community. The building blocks of the US government haven't changed since the US Constitution was signed and yet the United States of 1788 looks very different from the United States of 2013, and all the changes were done from within the system and using the tools offered by the system.

Recently, the Republican Party has exploring massive revamps to their voter outreach campaigns because their historically monoculture and xenophobic approach has been alienating Asian Americans and Latino Americans. All those insulting caricatures of insidious Chinese debt collectors and illegal immigrants coming to steal jobs in an effort to appeal to conservative whites just can't win you enough votes anymore. Asians and Latinos are rapidly becoming decisive voting blocks. Why would a political party bother reforming itself to appeal to a wider audience if it didn't need to approval of that wider audience?

I keep hearing here that he's trying to build awareness but what's he actually contributing? Does he honestly think that the average American or European isn't aware of wealth inequality, giant corporate power, or pollution? It's plastered all over Western media all the time. Why would he proudly advertise that he doesn't vote when the literal purpose of a vote is for your opinion to have a pragmatic effect on the political process?

Other than the leaks provided by numerous former employees of the NSA and contractors working with them.  But you want something better than that.  Well, as I explained, the NSA refuses to allow anyone to check their files, so we can't confirm that such evidence exists one way or the other, at least to your satisfaction.

&gt; It means that no one at the NSA or anywhere else has read that confirmation email from Amazon for that third Fleshlight you bought last week. No one gives a shit because it is just noise.

I never claimed such to be the case.  As I understand, the NSA employs programs using algorithms keyed to look for patterns in behavior.  No sane person thinks the NSA has people reading literally everything on the Internet.  The point is they allegedly have access to whatever they want and use programs to comb their collected data to look for behavior they find to be suspicious.  Whether they actually look at my personal Amazon inventory is irrelevant, the point is *they probably could if they wanted to*.

&gt;What I will argue is that those cases were dismissed under due process of law.

If you had bothered to read about the cases I linked to, you'd have seen that neither have been dismissed (the EFF case was dismissed, but then reinstated and has survived another motion to dismiss by the government).  

&gt;And if not? If all of those things are checked at various levels, hidden behind warrant requirements and operating as intended? Then what? Are you going to shut your hole? No, you're just going to cry about being oppressed, move the goal posts, and satisfy your completely unwarranted indignation some other way.

I don't understand this assumption.  If the FISA court was operating as intended, warrants were being evaluated, and constitutional safeguards were in place and there were all confirmed as a matter of public record, yes, I would be satisfied.  I don't have a personal vendetta against anyone in this nor do I need to ""feel oppressed,"" it's a matter of protecting freedoms.

&gt;Oh, I certainly think they're not above such things. You read the transcript at that link and it will make you cry.

Yes, the vague possibility of ""collection"" as referenced by a former spokesmen for the National Security Council is exactly the same as a [straight up wiretap on the German Prime Minister's phone](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/27/rogers-house-intelligence-chief-nsa-europe/3282161/) for a decade.

If your penile girth is genuinely large, a Magnum is going to suck, because the nominal width (the lay flat diamter of the opening) is just 54mm. That's less than regular Durex (56mm). 

So, if your girth is above 5.3"", you start to get this unbearable (painful) tightness right at the base of your boner. Why? Because the condom is having to stretch too much to fit around your cock (stretch above ~18% and it starts to feel uncomfortable... less than 10% and the condom will start to slip, or fall off entirely, when you're thrusting). Tightness at the base of your boner really sucks, more so because all the nerves and blood vessels exit your cock there.. so the tightness suppresses your orgasm reflex, and usually kills your boner not long after. It's just math.

now, make the nominal width *genuinely* bigger and you can start to accommodate the *real* big dicks.. girths 5.5"", 6"", 6.5"".... nominal widths up to 69mm are available, not in the US, but in Europe. Why? Because you maintain that optimum stretch %.

I appreciate it's controversial, because the Magnum myth is so ingrained in popular American culture, but let's recap:

- a regular Trojan: length **205**mm, nominal width **52/53**mm
- Trojan Magnum: length **205**mm, nominal width **54**mm, flared tip
- Trojan Magnum XL: length **205**mm, nominal width **54**mm (not a typo), extra-flared tip

now, compare to Durex:

- a regular Durex: length **205**mm, nominal width **56**mm
- a Durex Comfort XL: length **215**mm, nominal width **57**mm

or a genuinely large European condom:

- length **240**mm, nominal width **6**9mm

Supporters of the confederacy wanted the states themselves to hold the majority of the power (decentrailzed power, which is why they were a confederacy), and as such they saw the Federal Government as a form of centralized oppression. Many in the south believed that they had the right to secede from the Union if they wanted to. The North, still under control of the federal government, used military might to prevent this from happening. I would say *most* southerners fought because they truly believed they were in the right. Some obviously fought for the reason that you said, because it was where their home was (like Robert E. Lee), but the majority had a good belief as to why *they* were in the right and the Union was the bad side. 

The problem was that this argument was mostly just a way for the rich plantation owners to keep their economy booming with the enormous profits they were making by exporting cotton to Europe in huge amounts. The profits gained were largely due to the fact that there was so much cheap labor in the south with the thousands of slaves that they used. The shift in the federal government view of slavery began to threaten the operation of this industry, so the power holders in the south (the plantation owners), argued against it, and the poorer farmers followed their argument about states' rights. The argument was good, but was used with poor intentions.

And I'm not kidding about how much power the plantation owners had in the south. The south, at the time, had some qualities that were much more similar to feudal Europe than an industrialized society (like the northern states), where wealth was largely based upon the amount of land you owned and the number of workers that you had working your land. The plantation owners would have been the Lords and Dukes of their time. The good thing is that because of industrialization, the north had more railroads, more factories, and more fightig-capable people (with so many immigrants).

Daladier was the PRIME MINISTER they selected to run the country. Maybe you'll find some obscure people who identified as ""socialist"" who said some strange things you don't like, but this is a weak argument. Let's focus on the people who were in power, not a bunch of no-names who couldn't do anything anyways.

&gt;Look up Paul Berman's (I'm well aware of his political shortcomings) book ""Terror and Liberalism"". He cites a wealth of ludicrous quotes from the French socialists, to the effect that they thought that Hitler's bellicosity was a direct result of Western Imperialism.

I don't know what you're implying here, but I agree with the notion that Hitler's rise to power can be directly linked to the fact that Germany's empire was ransacked in world war one by the United States, France, Britain, and other nations that gained control of German overseas territory. So yes, a lot of Hitler's anger can be explained (in small part) by the fact that Germany really was getting the shit end of the deal with the Treaty of Versailles and the aftermath of World War One in general.

&gt;And the French Left's acquiescence to the Hitler-Stalin Pact? That has nothing to do with the fall of France?

Daladier banned the French Communist Party for not being critical enough of the Molotov pact. What else did you want him to do here?

As for the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact itself, you can read [the takes of various actual historians on the issue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93German_relations_before_1941#Post-war_commentary_regarding_the_timing_of_Soviet-German_rapprochement):

&gt;&gt;Some scholars argue that for a long time the collective security doctrine was a sincere and unanimous position of the Soviet leadership, pursuing a purely defensive line,[78][167] while others contend that from the very beginning the Soviet Union was aimed at the cooperation with Nazi Germany, collective security being merely tactical counter to some unfriendly German moves.[58][168][169][170] However, it might well be the case that Moscow sought to avoid a great war in Europe because it was not strong enough to fight an offensive, but there was much disagreement over the policy between Litvinov and Molotov as to how to attain the goal, and Stalin balanced between their positions, starting pursuing both contradictory lines simultaneously quite early and abandoned collective security only at some point in 1939.[38][171]

Stalin claims in [Falsifiers of History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiers_of_History) (1948) that his agreements with Hitler were for purely security reasons rather than an acclimation towards fascism. I don't believe Stalin here entirely, but even if it were true, the MR Pact appears to only make the security situation of the Soviet Union worse by providing a great number of raw materials to Germany. At the same time, it was Hitler's intention to invade the Soviet Union for said raw materials anyway (as stated in Mein Kampf as early as the mid-1920s), so in some sense it was merely delaying the inevitable. As so long as the agreements were in place, Stalin had some leverage in being able to control the flow of the materials to Germany. In contrast, a German invasion and seizure of the raw materials would cede total control to the fascists. So it's not really an easy situation and I could see reasons to reserve judgment on the MR Pact one way or the other.

But again, all of this was a matter between the Soviet Union and Germany... it has little to do with leftists outside the Soviet Union, because, as I said, Daladier banned the French Communist Party.

Roosevelt won [the 1940 election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1940) on the promise that he would not wage war in Europe, and his Republican opposition Wendell Willkie criticized him for not being opposed to war *enough*. **My main point is still clear: it was not the French, but the British and the Americans who were foolhardy in the face of fascism**.",True,,cd4m8k6,3,False,False,t5_2s7k2,3,

I don't care what you think, but a person would rather live a comfortable stable life with a stable job then live on the road stealing to survive.  If Gypsies can't make it that stable life, then there is something wrong with the system/the society that forces them to stay there.

people are products of their environment.  You blame the gypsies because of their environment?   And lets face it, Europeans aren't exactly best known for their treatment of minorities.  

EDIT: Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that Europeans actively create shitty scenarios for minorities.  It's done passively, as most widescale population problems occur in this fashion.  There is obviously a dislike and distrust of gypsies, do you think they are being hired by Europeans even if they were good citizens?  i doubt it.  same way a Muslim in Yemen probably won't hire a Jew, or how blacks in the US tend to only get menial labor jobs.  it's human nature that reflects on the system as a whole.

Each year I attend the ISO conference to argue about that year's condom regulations (condoms are regulated medical devices). Try not to rely on anything other than manufacturers, which is tough, because Trojan will not tell you the nominal widths of their products, unlike Durex, who will (Durex = market dominant in UK.. like Trojan are in the US). In fact, Trojan would like it if nominal width were removed from boxes (in Europe, a regulation called IS0 4074 states that it must be printed on the box).

side note: Trojan can claim their Magnums are ""larger condoms"" because technically, versus regular *Trojan* condoms, the flared tip means they physically are. Unfortunately because the most critical element.. the opening.. the nominal width.. isn't, then it really doesn't matter.

It is just math. Let me show you:

54mm * 2 =108mm. The Magnum condom makes a latex circle of 108mm, when unstretched.

for a 5.3"" (134mm) circumference (girth), it will have to stretch by 134 - 108 = 26mm to fit the dick. Just math.

26mm as a % of the 108mm = 24% stretch. That's way past the 18% optimum, and it's going to start to feel tight, uncomfortable, and ultimately hurt.

now, take a guy over at /r/bigdickproblems with a girth of 6.2"".

6.2"" = 157mm. The Magnum condom is now having to stretch by 157 - 108 = 49mm to fit his dick. Just math.

49mm as a % of the 108mm = 45% stretch. That's way past discomfort, it's really going to be painful, and leave a red imprint on his dick flesh. Bad bad bad.

that guy throws on a genuinely large condom, with a nominal width of 69mm? The stretch % is transformed to 14%.

as simple as that. Dick math.

I am glad you enjoy Magnum condoms (so many guys cannot find a condom that fits them correctly.. medical studies suggest 40-45% of men suffer from this.. not just big dicks.. small dicks too).

It's an old Soviet cartoon by a company called [Soyuzmultfilm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuzmultfilm). I always thought it was communist propaganda but it seems the rights were sold to an American company in the early nineties, and they were dubbed for the European and American markets.

And coal is not predominately used, in the US at least, to supplement solar power, but natural gas, hydro, nuclear and wind.

You also have no idea about solar technology.  Sorry, you just don't. Solar panels do not ""get hotter and hotter"" if the power is not used, the inverters simply stop drawing current and the panels become inactive; the only thermal energy they take in is from the direct sunlight so they would have they same thermal profile as a dark shade of metal(like a black car). A simple experiment of looking at a black car in sunlight, and see if it ""melts"", would tell you how stupid your statement seems to me. Also CSP(Concentrated solar power), which is the Andasol plant you reference, is a technology that is floundering; it can not at all compete with the price of PV(Photovolatic) panels, as the price for CSP technology is relatively stable and the price for PV is dropping like a rock.

&gt; World-wide grid is not possible because you know, power cables loose quiet a bit of energy and hence transporting it from a ""day area"" to a ""Night areas"" is nontrivial. Not to mention that it will then be very easy for Nation x to extort others ""I turn off your power if you don't do xyz."" Or even simpler terrorists destroying power lines.

Countries already export energy resources, including energy to world-wide markets. France exports huge amounts of electricity to the whole of EU. What you are describing are challenges. Sorry, but in real-life, one simply has to deal with challenges. If nobody did, we would not have science, medicine or really anything of value at all.

&gt; Another issue is the huge resource usage of wind and solar. PV panel production leads to a ton of toxic chemical waste that must be dealt with. 

*Citation needed* How much ""toxic chemical waste"" do they produce? How much compared to other processes? Is it a lot? Spoiler alert: no, it is not.

&gt; But again, PV panels are good for remote areas but not for mass producing solar power. The main issue here is material consumption like steel.

What the hell are you talking about? Solar panels do not use steel. The only part of the system that could even conceivably use steel is the racking, but even that is normally aluminum. Wind mills use steal but have far more energy density that solar, so the usage evens out. If the resource usage was ""too high""(A level in which you did not at all define nor give any sort of reasoning for), they would simply not be economical to build, but they are built all over the world.

&gt; It's like easily 100x more per amount of energy produced than for nuclear or fossil.

*Citation needed*

&gt; Last but not least are economics. Simply said if China and India go nuclear and we go solar and wind, our energy will be so expensive that we soon be out of business literally. Without cheap energy the already crippled system will come crashing down.

*Citation needed*

The funny thing is, UK is building a new nuclear plant, it's big news from them, what is also big news is that the cost per watt is DOUBLE that of the current rate for PV solar. That's funny because it's the opposite of what you are saying. [Source](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-plant-uk-government-edf-underwrite)

Also no. We were told that it would 'reduce fatalities' every time we got more shitty gun laws (and the vast majority of them really are shitty). You could easily remove 98% of our gun laws and nothing would change, because they're that stupid. The greatest drop in gun violence in the US came between 1990 and 2005, and it was largely because the crack epidemic broke, but there's also some evidence that nationwide rollout of concealed carry had an impact.

Even if you could craft a piece of legislation that was somehow 100% absolutely guaranteed to reduce 'random murders', and even if it didn't infringe at all on legit gun owners, I would still completely object to it unless you also removed those 98% of shitty laws along with it. I would expect most gun owners would as well. This is why there was such intense opposition to the latest gun law reform attempts. Because we're tired of your 'this might help' bullshit.

The Latin ""Emperor"", Henry, presumes much in calling himself an Emperor of the Romans. It is humorous to me that the German King, who fashions himself an Emperor appointed by God, has found himself often in schism with his own religious authority, who, ironically, also wrongly fashions himself the rightful and true leader of all of Christendom, when, by the very Holy Council of Chalcedon, convened many years ago, declared the religious authorities of Rome and the City of Constantine were made to be equal. The ""Pope"" of the Latins has often tried to undermine our Holy authority, having directly challenged it in his heinous crowning of a ""Roman Emperor"" named *Carolus Magnus* in the World Year of 6309 (what you would say AD 800), as if our Empire were some foreign thing with no right to claim the title. The audacity! The arrogance! The utter lack of respect! These words come to embody what the Latins often stand for, in their disorderly realm of chaos, where war and treachery reign to no purpose. Are we to presume too that it was the Germans, and not the Byzantines, who held back the Saracen invaders for all these years? By whose blood has the fate of Europe been decided? Pose the question to any man of reasonable intelligence and the answer should be made clear. 

But we, as the rightful leaders of Christendom, should try to guide the Latins to a higher sense of understanding and purpose. I do not wish to see Christendom be in schism any longer. Despite our differences, we are of one faith, and if Rome is to be made whole again, then we must work with the Latins to build a bond of trust and friendship with them, for the benefit of all peoples of this world who seek peace and prosperity. And our first goal, in that endeavor, is to secure our once prosperous heartland in Asia Minor and retake our Holy Cities from the Agarenes, who have for too long ravaged our lands and slaughtered our people - and to what purpose? It is often a question which I ask - why must their religion promote such pointless and devastating destruction? What have we done to provoke such actions, save retaliating in the defense of our lands and our people? For many years I have fought the enemy, and yet, for all that I know of their strategies and tactics, I have never come to undersand their motive to make war on all the world. Perhaps I never will.

They basically mean the same thing, and are used interchangeably. From a distance, it makes total sense to see no difference. Yet, if you know people who describe themselves as one of them, you can start to pick out the subtleties. 

1. Bisexuals, while attracted to both genders, tend to be attracted to one more than the other. They generally are not attracted to transexuals, either pre-op or post. The negative connotation for this group is that they are just doing it for attention. If it's a girl, then she is just experimenting. If it's a guy, then he's completely gay, but in denial. 

2. Omnisexual's on the other hand are attracted to pretty much anyone equally. They will go for men, women, pre and post-op transexuals, and pretty much anyone who is a consenting adult. They don't favor one gender over another. Think of Jack Harkness from Dr. Who. The negative connotation here is that omnisexual's are just super horny people who will have sex with pretty much anyone, anytime. There is an idea that they are total sex addicts, and are unlikely to engage in a serious relationship.

3. Pansexuals take it one step further. They reject the idea of a gender binary completely. Whereas the omnisexual will have sex with men, women, and transexuals, the pansexual will have sex with someone who self-identifies as both a man and a woman. The negative connotation here is that they are the same as omnisexual's, but less focused on random sex, and more political about their sexuality. They are more likely to engage in a serious relationship than a omnisexual. 

In pointing out the differences in these terms, I want to say two additional things. 

1. Again these are just connotations. You can easily find someone who identifies as bisexual, but behaves like an omni or pansexual. All three terms do mean pretty much the same thing to both people who are observing from a distance, and even for many people within the queer community. Still, these connotations matter, and they help distinguish between different types of people in those communities. It's similar to the way gay men have twinks, bears, daddy's, etc. They are all gay men, but those terms convey different types of gay men (skinny and flamboyant; big, hairy, and masculine; and older, wealthy types, respectively.)

2. These connotations are terrible. They are complete stereotypes and are pretty unfair to the people who identify as one of them. They are general observations taken from places like the street, urban dictionary, and Wikipedia, but they are not necessarily accurate. I wanted to show you how the different terms have different meanings/connotations, which meant resorting to the negative stereotypes, but I do think it's unfair and probably inaccurate. The queer community is still relatively small and disjointed, as far as its come in the past couple decades. These words are constantly being reinvented and reappropriated. It's very possible that they mean different things depending on where you live. This is just one interpretation of it.

So there you have three types of sexuality that are all pretty much the same, but have slight differences that mean different things to people in the community.

I haven't even touched on topics like [Klinefelter's Syndrome,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome) [Third Genders,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender) [Hijras,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia) and the [Fa'afafine.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%27afafine) Christianity worked pretty hard to beat out any genders aside from men and women, but many cultures around the world have 3 or more genders. These terms start to become even more useful in those places. (If you are having a hard time wrapping your head around the idea of a third gender, imagine how the Native Americans felt when some random European people showed up and told them that you can literally own the ground.)

I only activate forced march when the army is chasing an enemy down, reinforcing an important battle or needs to move quickly through the empire and disable it otherwise for the monthly morale repair. 

I'm guessing you had the same problem and the lack of morale made you lose the battle. But if the morale is more or less the same as the enemy then you should definitely benifit from the offensive NI. The Quality NI for that matter should also give you an important edge, +10% on infantry combat ability should result in that one infantry unit of your army fights as a 1.1 infantry unit.

From 1949 until 1961 the Indonesian government sought to ""recover"" West New Guinea (later known as West Irian or West Papua), arguing that the territory, a part of the former Netherlands East Indies, rightfully belonged with Indonesia.

In late 1961, after repeated and unsuccessful attempts to secure its goals through the United Nations, Indonesia's President Sukarno declared a military mobilization and threatened to invade West New Guinea and annex it by force. The Kennedy administration, fearing that U.S. opposition to Indonesian demands might push the country toward Communism, sponsored talks between the Netherlands and Indonesia in the spring of 1962. Negotiations took place under the shadow of ongoing Indonesian military incursions into West New Guinea and the threat of an Indonesian invasion.

The U.S.-sponsored talks led to the August 1962 New York Agreement, which awarded Indonesia control of West New Guinea (which it promptly renamed West Irian) after a brief transitional period overseen by the UN. The agreement obligated Jakarta to conduct an election on self-determination with UN assistance no later than 1969. Once in control, however, Indonesia quickly moved to repress political dissent by groups demanding outright independence for the territory.

U.S. officials understood at the outset that Indonesia would never allow West Irian to become independent and that it was unlikely to ever allow a meaningful act of self-determination to take place. The Johnson and Nixon administrations were equally reluctant to challenge Indonesian control over West Irian, especially after the conservative anti-Communist regime of General Suharto took over in 1966 following an abortive coup attempt which led to the slaughter of an estimated 500,000 alleged Communists. Suharto quickly moved to liberalize the Indonesian economy and open it to the West, passing a new foreign investment law in late 1967. The first company to take advantage of the law was the American mining company Freeport Sulphur, which gained concessions to vast tracts of land in West Irian containing gold and copper reserves. 

Over six weeks from July to August 1969, U.N. officials conducted the so-called ""Act of Free Choice."" Under the articles of the New York Agreement (Article 18) all adult Papuans had the right to participate in an act of self-determination to be carried out in accordance with international practice. Instead, Indonesian authorities selected 1026 West Papuans to vote publicly and unanimously in favor of integration with Indonesia.

Despite significant evidence that Indonesia had failed to meet its international obligations, in November 1969 the United Nations ""took note"" of the ""Act of Free Choice"" and its results, thereby lending support of the world body to Indonesia's annexation.

The international community has come to question the validity of Jakarta's takeover of West Papua and the ongoing human rights abuses there. In March, 88 members of the Irish Parliament urged United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to review the United Nations' role in the 1969 Act of Free Choice, joining South African Archibishop Desmond Tutu and scores of non-governmental organizations and European Parliamentarians. On June 28, 2004, nineteen U.S. Senators sent a letter to Annan urging the appointment of a Special Representative to Indonesia to monitor the human rights situation in West Papua and the territory of Aceh.

The Act was a sham. Instead of overseeing a free and fair election, the UN stood by while Indonesia rigged the vote. Declaring that the Papuans were too ‘primitive’ to cope with democracy, the Indonesian military hand-picked just 1,026 ‘representative’ Papuans – out of a population of one million – threatened to kill them and their families if they voted the wrong way, and then told them to choose. The result was ‘unanimous’: West Papua would remain part of Indonesia. Despite protests from the Papuans, a critical report by a UN official and condemnation of the vote in the international media the UN shamefully sanctioned the result and West Papua has remained under control of the Indonesian state ever since.

The Papuans call this referendum the ‘Act of No Choice’.

Anyway, some things I would suggest:

- British film: I probably would pick something like Kes or Naked to represent a distinctive wave in British film. They're also two of the finest films ever made.

- Cut down on the Kurosawa and Ozu, and introduce a player from the Japanese New Wave. Nagisa Oshima is a good candidate. Now you have covered both period dramas with Kurosawa and modern family dramas with Ozu, and brought Oshima's vision of the decay of Japanese culture and values.

- Eastern Europe should be as represented as Western Europe is. Ashes and Diamonds, Closely Watched Trains, The Cranes are Flying, Marketa Lazarova, Solaris... a lot of incredible movies to choose from.

- Modern Asian film. In the Mood for Love and Yi Yi are probably the best two movies of the new millennium. They must not be left out. I would also add a Kiarostami movie (Close Up).

- Independent American Film: The Last Picture Show? A Woman Under the Influence? Both are classics. I would leave space for something like Jarmusch's Down by Law. Perfect viewing!

America ignored the Holocaust. The government knew it was happening and did nothing. Most people don't know this, but the Holocaust was simply the most memorable of Jewish massacres.

Yeah. I'm definitely done now. Thanks for making time fly by though.

Rationalizing is a good skill.  You should try it sometime.  I imagine life would be pretty strange if you simply read any opinion piece published by a 'reputable source' and instantly took whatever message the author wanted to convey as gospel truth.  Being able to think critically and rationalize prevents most of us from doing this, of course.

It is surprisingly difficult to pinpoint the exact period in which the armoured horseman appears in Central Asia and the Near East. If you're not familiar with the Near East, that's basically a region based around the Levantine coast, ancient Mesopotamia, and the western Iranian plateau (it often includes parts of the Caucasus and Anatolia, depending on the period). However, by the 8th/7th centuries BC we begin to see depictions of Assyrian horseman wearing heavy scale armour. [This horseman](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Assyrian_Horse_Archer.jpg) is armed with a bow in this picture, but you can see armour on his chest. [This is even clearer](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Britishmuseumassyrianrelieftwohorsemennimrud.jpg), with the horseman wielding a lance/pike. It is also somewhere around 800 BC when we first start to see horse breeds emerge with sufficient endurance and strength for long term travel; this is traditionally the period in which we see the first truly nomadic, horse-using societies.

By the time of Herodotus, we are getting descriptions of various Central Asian societies and their weaponry; some of them, allegedly including the Massagetae, gave 'breastplates' to their horses and used bows, axes and lances (both off and on horseback). Now, there is a little element of doubt that should prevent us from assuming that Herodotus was totally accurate about all of the individual details. However, it is still fairly clear that he (and probably his audience by extension) fundamentally associated horseback warfare, and armoured horsemen, with Central Asia. Armoured cavalry, though not necessarily the kind you'd associate with a big charge, is fairly well attested for the Achaemenid Empire as well. In general, the Persian cavalry were feared and respected by the Greeks, and both Greeks and Persian source indicate that cavalry were an elite and valued part of the Persian Empire's armies. We know that a large part of their cavalry seem to have been armoured but predominantly used thrown javelins and had a mace/sword as a backup. 

We also find heavy cavalry in the armies of Phillip II and Alexander the Great, relatively famously. The most famous are the hetairoi, usually translated in English as Companion Cavalry. They were the king's closet followers, a combination of his inner circle (including his generals/advisors) and those who had his favour generally. They were less armoured than the Persian cavalry, but still had a full cuirass or linothorax, and were fully intended to charge at an opponent rather than throw javelins or shoot arrows. This is the first reasonably definite example we have of cavalry charging at a body of intact infantry with success. In addition to these Companion Cavalry contingents, the Macedonians under Phillip II and Alexander the Great also used Thessalian cavalry regiments which were almost as famous for their skill and which were often used in a similar role. Now, the Macedonians are obviously not from Central Asia, India, the Iranian plateau in this period, so why am I mentioning them? It's because this then moves us into the Seleucid era, the Empire which inherited Alexander the Great's Asian possessions

The Seleucids, in addition to carrying the Macedonian military machine intact, also absorbed an enormous wealth of pre-existing peoples who had their own methods of warfare, including the structures of the Achaemenid Empire who as we saw earlier possessed armoured cavalry. This is the period in which we first start seeing a type of cavalryman that is almost as famous as the knight actually on record- the cataphract. This is originally *kataphraktoi* in Greek. During the time between the earliest armoured horsemen (that we know of) and the Seleucid Empire, weapons and armour had continued to change in Central Asia. Even more heavily armoured horsemen began to spring up. The Seleucids often levied these horsemen from their eastern satrapies like Bactria and Sogdiana, and possibly also hired those outside the Empire as mercenaries. The cavalry of the Scythians and the Bactrians were legendary in the period, and not just as horse archers either. They also possessed heavy, shock cavalry. 

Parthia and Bactria both became independent of the Seleucids at the same time. But whilst Bactria remained ruled by Greeks, the Greek owners of Parthia who had rebelled were themselves occupied by an invasion from their north. Both of these states used cataphracts even more than the Seleucids; the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, when the Seleucids came a-knocking, allegedly sent an advance army of 10,000 cavalry to meet them. This army was defeated, and the numbers may be inflated. But it certainly indicates that the kingdom had a reptutation well outside its borders (these stories about the Greco-Bactrians fighting the Seleucids were written back in the Mediterranean), and the Greco-Bactrians managed to keep their independence so something must have gone right. The Parthians would eventually become even more important, not only retaining their independence but eventually conquering the remnants of the Seleucids themselves and becoming the next important Empire in the region.

They are also important for your question because the Parthians were legendary for their cavalry, not just horse archers but also their cataphracts. We once again have depictions of these catraphracts- much has faded with time on [this depiction](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/ParthianCataphract.JPG), but you can very clearly see that the entirety of this rider is covered in bands of armour. Reconstructions of what these cataphracts looked like generally are something a little like [these](http://www.iranchamber.com/history/parthians/images/parthian_cataphracts.jpg). These were very important components of Parthian warfare, to the point where very little is even said about what infantry they used. The Sassanid Empire which succeeded the Parthians also used cataphracts heavily, and we once again have [direct depictions](http://www.rickhemi.com/uploads/7/9/6/1/7961524/4678349.jpg?422) of cataphracts in their art. There have also been many reconstructions of various parts of the Sassanid heavy cavalry, for example the [cataphracts](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Ancient_Sasanid_Cataphract_Uther_Oxford_2003_06_2%281%29.jpg) themselves but also [elite armoured archers](http://www.radpour.com/images/stories/sassanian_persian_archer.jpg). We benefit from having much more of the Sassanid Empire's own thoughts on their different troops and what their equipment was, as this is an era in which we have a much greater number of sources.

I am given reason to believe that similarly heavy-armoured horsemen to the cataphracts also existed in East Asia. Likewise, at various times the Achaemenids, Seleucids and Sassanids all bordered or even controlled North-Western India at various times. And various Central Asian peoples like Scythians came to control North-Western India and settle there. What I do not know is whether there was ever anything like cataphracts adopted by Indian states in any of these periods, which is an interesting question. However, these are areas where I do not myself possess information enough to really make any claims.

The elephant in the room that I have not mentioned thus far are the Romans- during the Roman Empire, the Romans began to hire Catraphracts as mercenaries/auxiliaries for their army. As the Empire went on, particularly in the Eastern Empire, they began to themselves train and equip cataphracts (and a very similar type of troop called the Clibanarii, which may in fact simply be a synonym for cataphracts for the Romans anyway). There is a whole subsequent history of the cataphract in the Eastern Roman Empire/Byzantine Empire (depending on which term you favour), but that's getting away from my point; ultimately, it is Central Asia which introduced Europe to the armoured horseman, not the other way around. There actually were armoured horsemen in the areas that you describe, and incredibly important they were too. In all of the societies I've talked about they were usually somewhere near the top in terms of social status. In the Assyrian Empire being a lancer was generally a path to wealth and social status, and this doesn't really seem to have altered in the subsequent Empires of which I spoke; either the armoured horsemen were in themselves aristocratic in order to afford the armour, or becoming that kind of horsemen conferred wealth and status on them.",True,middleeast,cd4ol8x,174,False,False,t5_2ssp3,174,Moderator | Ancient Greece | Ancient Near East

&gt; This war was patently not about saving lives. Rather, it was a war of neocolonial plunder, its principal objective being to topple the Gaddafi regime and impose a more pliant puppet in its place.

&gt; Washington and its allies instigated the war in large measure as a strategic response to the outbreak of mass uprisings by the working class against Western-backed regimes in Tunisia, on Libya’s western border, and Egypt, on its eastern border. The aim was to halt the spread of revolution and reassert US and Western European hegemony in the region, while supplanting the economic and political influence of China and Russia and seizing a more direct hold on Libya’s energy reserves.

The author states that as if it were incontrovertible fact, but what evidence of any of that is there? If the war was indeed about seizing control of Libya's energy sector, why has oil production (as stated in this very article!) dipped so low? 

I also have a problem with this:

&gt; The country’s disintegration into fiefdoms of rival militia warlords, the paralysis of its economy, and the poverty of its people are all proof that what they supported in Libya in 2011 was not a “revolution,” but an imperialist rape.

That's just bad reasoning. Revolutions aren't exclusively the domain of pure-minded idealists, all working towards a common vision of a free and democratic society. They often consist of highly disparate interests united by nothing but a shared dislike of the current regime, and those interests very often fall to squabbling once the old regime has been displaced.

Contrast two models of mounted warfare.  The steppe nomad, whether from the great steppes of Eurasia, or the Great Plains of America, went to war as light cavalry.  Settled Agricultural people, whether in Europe, Bysantium, or Persia, tended to develop heavy armored cavalry mounted on heavier horses.

Economics:  

Steppe nomads used grass fed, self foraging horses, which could maintain themselves in large numbers on the open plains with minimum human tending.  When steppe nomads invaded off the steppe, their ability to extend campaigns was often limited because they could not find enough forage for their large horse herds.

Agricultural people, lived in areas that did not have large prairies of grass.  They maintained horses on restricted pastures and supplemented their feed with grain.  For them, horses were few and expensive.

Geographic:

On the great steppes, light cavalry had the ability to achieve strategic mobility.  They could range great distances, sustaining themselves by grazing, and even sustaining their riders for a while with blood.  Riders could travel with multiple horses and switch between them, to avoid tiring them out and to travel farther and faster.  The ability to cover large distances quickly was a great advantage on the Steppes and favored light cavalry.

In broken country and farmland, horses could not go far without finding food supplies.  Grain was likely to be locked up in castles.  Grass was scarce.  Transporting grain in wagons to supply the horses was slow and expensive.  Strategic mobility was less important (as wars were local).

Conclusion:

If you live in agricultural country horses are expensive, and mobility is not so important.  It makes sense to make the few horses you have as powerful and deadly a weapon as possible.  Breed large horses.  Train horses to charge home and to fight.  Mount heavily armored men on the horses.  Armor the horses.  On a constricted battlefield, the armored knight will be a dominant fighting force (until the development of powerful bows and disciplined pikemen).

If you live in steppe country, strategic mobility is important.  Horses are cheap.  You want a large supply of horses who are hardy and survive well on grass (not necessarily the largest or strongest or fastest horses possible).  You want light riders who can cover large distances and use their mobility across the Sea of Grass for strategic advantage.  There are no fixed towns or crops that you are trying to defend, so you never need to fight to the death.  Retreat is always a good option if faced with superior force.  A large mobile army is better for you than the most powerful and deadly individual warriors.

I normally don't believe in this sort of stuff at all and don't know whether there might be a perfectly logical explanation for it (if anyone has one, I'd greatly appreciate it!), but this has happened to me twice in my life and I have no idea what the hell it was:

So, I grew up in a small city across the lake from a much larger city. Depending on the weather, you can get a nice view of the cityscape from my hometown's side of the beach - especially at night. So one New Year's Eve when I was 10 years old, my parents and a group of friends of theirs (along with their two kids, which were my age) decided to go out to this lake, thinking there might be a firework display visible from across the water. The water was completely frozen and our side of the lake was well lit with street lamps in the parking lot, but there was no one around and no fireworks, as it turned out. Well, the adults decided to make the most of the evening by laying out a picnic on some boulders and getting tipsy, while us kids went off a little further to run around on some ice. We were standing under a tree when suddenly we looked up and saw something strange in the sky. No more than 15 feet above our heads, there was a dark grey diamond-shaped object with what looked like some kind of intricate pattern all over it, about a yard in length, gliding slowly and silently towards the tree we were standing under. We watched it for about twenty seconds, and then it suddenly vanished into thin air while floating above the tree. We all confirmed that we had seen the same thing but could not figure out what it was. 

As the years went by, I began to think that maybe because we'd been so young, we'd actually just imagined this or seen something normal that we could not recognize. I'd almost forgotten about it completely, but then, fast forward ten years and I'm in Europe on an exchange program. One sunny afternoon, while walking home from the corner store alone, I see the same damn thing in the sky, just 10-15 feet above me, and again, it vanishes into thin air after about 10 seconds.",True,,cd4pbf4,2,False,False,t5_2qh1i,2,

|**about artist**|VNV Nation is an electronic music group formed in London in 1990, now based in Hamburg, Germany, that combines elements of trance, synthpop and electronic body music (ebm) into what they call futurepop.  VNV Nation began as a one man project from Ronan Harris.  In 1995 Mark Jackson joined the band permanently as a live drummer.  VNV Nation's inspiration was originally the clash of the modern and classical European cultures, where mythology and technology live in an uneasy fusion, but this has since broadened to encompass a world view.

&gt;Rationalizing is a good skill. You should try it sometime. I imagine life would be pretty strange if you simply read any opinion piece published by a 'reputable source' and instantly took whatever message the author wanted to convey as gospel truth. Being able to think critically and rationalize prevents most of us from doing this, of course.

There is a difference between rationalizing and critical thinking (which by calling it a 'good skill' means you have no idea what it actually meant).

With national focuses I generally go bureaucrats to get administration up to 100%, followed by clergy up to 2%, from there I'm not an expert.  
  
I don't go the diplomatic route; Crises and alliances are far too fickle, and far too unpredictable to base your strategy on. Instead I suggest you take your cores by force.  
   Here's how:
  
Instead of only taking Crete from Egypt, you can wait until they're at war with the Ottomans (the Ottomans generally fight Egypt for their cores over the course of several wars) and press for part of Egyptian Africa as well. Most likely Egypt will have a reactionary rebellion, they will lose their allies, and Great Powers will lose their influence. If that happens, then you can keep devouring chunks of Egypt through the decades. If you can spare the infamy, conquer uncivs! The more land you conquer the more colonial soldiers you can raise, the more population you have to tax, and the more goods you produce. If you ever have 0 infamy you are wasting the money you spend on your military.  
  
Keep relations up with the Great Powers. Countries with relations of 100 or better cannot justify wars against one another! Use this to keep colonial powers from taking your hard earned colonies, and potentially use it to get alliances with them.  
  
The Scramble for Africa.  
IIRC to colonize you need  
Breach loaded rifles (military tech, second from the left, third down)  
Colonial Negotiations (discovery in Nationalism and Imperialism, Culture, third from right column, third down)  
Medicine (Industry, far right, second down),  
Machine guns (military, second from left, fourth down)  
and you need to have a rank of 16 or higher (but you should get that from all the conquering you've been doing).  
  
Try to take as many colonial provinces as you can. A good way to get more colonies than you can afford is to take over a 'line' of states surrounding unclaimed areas. That way you don't need to actually compete for the majority of the colonies you'll end up taking.    
  
With a large portion of Africa under your control, you'll be able to raise armies large enough to conquer your cores.  
  
To be able to claim Constantinople back from the Ottomans you need to remove them from all European regions that connect to the region Constantinople lies within. All that means is that you need to retake your cores, and then free, or conquer Bulgaria.  
  
TL;DR  
Conquer uncivs, colonize, and take your cores by force. You need to Free Bulgaria as well as take your cores to make Constantinople conquerable. ",True,,cd4pq5o,7,1383390813,False,t5_2su3h,7,Victorian Emperor

I'm [Métis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tis_people_%28Canada%29) — a culture that's recognized as aboriginal in the Canadian constitution, but not ""first nations"". What this means is we're a culture that's a *mixture* of Native and European. 

How did this culture come to be? Well, some time long ago, one of my great grandfathers decided to marry a Native woman. They had children, and those children married other mixed race people. 

At some point, the language [Michif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michif_language) came into being, which is a mixture of French, Cree, Ojibwe, and English.

Concurrently, the Métis had their own music, fashion, mythos, etc. And where did this come from? The quite distinct cultures of Native and European peoples.

So... were my ancestors appropriating culture? I don't think so. Culture never exists in a vacuum — including current Native cultures, which often takes material from others. 

***
Be that as it may, there's a difference between appropriating someone else's culture, and earnestly trying to learn from it.

Here's a big table listing all of this data together:
http://www.commondatahub.com/static/geography/currency/country_currency_codes

Now in addition to country currencies, ISO 4217 includes commodities like metals, expressed in price per troy ounce.  The metals start with ""X"" followed by the chemical symbol (XAG, XAU, XPT).

Bitcoin is already being considered ""XBT"" although it isn't official yet.  Here is some info on XBT:
http://www.xe.com/currency/xbt-bitcoin

So what I actually propose would be best is to allocate an entirely new ISO-3166 prefix for stateless crypto-currencies.  There aren't many prefixes available, but maybe something like ""CE"" for crypto-currency electronic.

Then we would get:

* CEB - Bitcoins, in ""mBTC""
* CEL - Litcoins, in ""mLTC""
* ... etc ...

Most everybody seems to agree that mBTC is the best unit for now and the future, but if we just circle jerk around it on forums, nothing will happen.

XX/XY doesn't directly cause you to grow a specific set of genitalia. It causes hormones to be released, which in turn trigger specific receptors, which cause the [sexually-ambiguous genitalia](http://intersexroadshow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/phalloclitoris-anatomy-and-ideology.html) we all start with, to begin to specialise.

This might seem like splitting hairs, but it's important because the hormones that cause the differentiation can get disrupted — regardless of your DNA. For example, the hormones might not get triggered correctly, or swamped by other hormones (produced by an endocrine disorder, or as a result of drugs taken by the parent, two give two examples), or the receptors might not pick up on the hormones, or [a variety of other issues can arise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex#Causes).

All of that's even assuming the chromosomes came out XX or XY in the first place; though rare, a few folks are XXY, XXYY, XYY, XXX or other combinations.

Although each individual one of those possibilities is quite uncommon, because there are so many different possibilities, when you add them all up, it works out that at least 1 in 2000 people are born intersexed (some estimated go as high as [1 in 150](http://intersexroadshow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/how-common-is-intersex-status.html)).

this corresponds to evolutionary theory where all non-African populations are more closely related to each other than to Africans

It follows a typical European system with power shared between the head of government, the Prime Minister, the largely-ceremonial President, and a unicameral legislative body called the National Assembly.  It is a member of the EU.

Hungary's history of legislative government dates back to the 1290s, with the Diet of Hungary, a system similar to that of the Estates-General of per-Revolutionary France.  It represented only the nobility, the clergy, and wealthy burghers.   By the 1700s, Hungary's political system had become dominated by the German Hapsburg Dynasty and effectively the Kingdom of Hungary became part of the Austrian Empire, though never officially annexed.  The Hapsburgs chose to not form a Diet for decades, causing nationalist and political conflicts that would erupt in the mid-19th century.

The first Hungarian attempt at modern democracy was the Hungary Revolution of 1848, part of a string of liberal revolutions that shocked conservative Europe.  This government can be well-remembered in its success at recognizing minority rights and uniting the various ethnic groups within Hungary, no mean feat within the chaotic landscape of the Balkans.  The revolutionary government was eventually crushed by reactionary forces, leaving democracy dormant in the country for another seventy years.

In 1918 the Hapsburg Empire was defeated in the First World War, and collapsed.  An brief attempt at second Republic was met with little success as the Democrats were attacked from both sides by Conservatives and Communists.  In 1920, Hungary again became a Kingdom, under the Regent Miklós Horthy.  Horthy's rule was initially reactionary, and then - following the trend throughout Europe - Fascist, and even a member of the Axis Powers in WWII.

It was the Red Army that would occupy Hungary at the end of the war, and inevitably instituted a communist state, a People's Republic of Hungary.  This state was in no way representative of its people's will, and little more than a satellite of the USSR.  Hungary continued under Communist domination for decades, aside from a brief attempt at democratic revolution in 1956 which was violently repressed by the Soviets.  In 1989, with the weakening of USSR, Hungary tore of its chains of Communism and became a modern Western state.

The newest Republic of the Hungary has been a stable Western liberal democracy since 1989.  In 2012 it finally replaced the old Soviet Constitution with the new Fundamental Laws of Hungary.  It has a typically-European large spectrum of political parties, from conservative to socialist.  Several years ago there was some controversy over Hungary's voting laws, which were thought to be discriminatory towards people with disabilities.  There has also been some concern lately that Hungary's newest constitutional reforms might give too much power in the Legislative and Executive branches.

Generally though, modern Hungary is a somewhat shaky but largely successful democracy, with its own internal issues and conflicts.  Elections are counted by votes, not which candidate eats more.",True,350,cd4rjti,3,False,False,t5_2qmeb,3,

Weekend specials have different objectives. For events tailored to long term players it impacts a small percentage of our playerbase and further increased the gap to top tier. The ""On Track"" is something new this year. Before St Patricks Day this year your never saw discounts or bonuses on tier 8 or higher. Already you're asking for the tier 8,9,10 promotion to be doubled... It's already a 2 week event, it's better than any single weekend bonus ever written, and your suggestions is to increase it. - That shows already that it's being taken for granted.  Ofc everyone would love top tier tanks to be discounted by 30% and earning 30% all the time, why not? It's less effort for more return and that at the end of the day and when we really get down to it, is what everyone wants in every game they play (Ok with the exception of people who are a sucker for storylines).   Long term players should note you've had more high tier discounts this year than you've ever had and more opportunities to make credits than you ever had. Making out your're hard done by is a bit hard to take from our side.

Rampage couldn't say that because you should know by now that we don't announce stuff in advance. This isn't a Wargaming thing, it's a ""that's just how it is"" thing. It's a stupid vendor that announces discounts in advance. When you do that people stockpile currency, spend it all, then barely spend currency afterwards.  If you've already been saving then kudos, if not, then a sale does exactly what it's intended to do, promote impulse buying.

I'm sorry that our promotions are something to cause you to complain and I hope the 2 other things you mentioned ease up. We don't want angry players, we want happy players and a nice community. When I say things will change for the better I do mean it, we just can't make some things immediate. Yes things could have been done differently in the past but then if hindsight was foresight everyone would spend all day discussing what might happen and nothing would get done.  

Looking ahead for November and beyond we have the WoWP launch, Xbox360 content, awesome new stuff for WoT, WoT Blitz, WoT Generals and World of Warships on the horizon. Wargaming isn't just a Russian thing anymore, it's a global company with a global audience. We won't always get it right all the time and sometimes you got make mistakes to learn from them. (Trust me, I know this more than people would think).  
I'm sorry once again I set expectations in this subreddit for NA players, all I can ask you guys is to see out November and don't always look for what's missing. Remember weekend events are bonuses, they're not something to be taken for granted or a standard game mechanic.

No one should have said the weekend events will be the exact same. I said myself ""pretty much"" because at the time of writing it I knew of slightly different events that were planned.

The Reformation. People were leaving in droves, it was a confusing time. The printing press made the Bible widely available for the first time ever, and people were coming out with new interpretations of what was said. The Church had to state clearly and explicitly that there was only one true catholic and apostolic church. 

Vatican II, the goal of the Church is to bring others back into the fold. A more pastoral approach was needed. The basis of the teachings hasn't changed, simply the way it was stated.

The title of your linked study: ""**Possible consequences** of the overlap between the CaMV 35S promoter regions in plant 
transformation vectors used and the viral gene VI 
in transgenic plants""

It doesn't even make any definitive claims....

&gt; Although information is available on the elements important 
for promoter activity and the functional domains of the overlapping gene VI this information has not been combined to investigate the possible impact of this overlap. 

Not very critical or even strongly worded against GMO.

However to the contrary:
http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2012/media/AAAS_GM_statement.pdf

&gt; The EU, for example, has invested 
more than €300 million in research 
on the biosafety of GMOs. Its recent 
report1
 states: “The main conclusion 
to be drawn from the efforts of more 
than 130 research projects, covering 
a period of more than 25 years of 
research and involving more than 
500 independent research groups, 
is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky 
than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”


GMO does increase yield:
http://www.pgeconomics.co.uk/pdf/focusonyieldeffects2009.pdf

- Mexico - yield increases with herbicide tolerant soybean of 9 percent.
- Romania – yield increases with herbicide tolerant soybeans have averaged 31 percent.
- Philippines – average yield increase of 15 percent with herbicide tolerant corn.
- Philippines – average yield increase of 24 percent with insect resistant corn.
- Hawaii – virus resistant papaya has increased yields by an average of 40 percent.
- India – insect resistant cotton has led to yield increases on average more than 50 percent.


More has been published about the harmful effects of chemicals in ground water than the harmful effects of GMO.  If you think the fact that Brazillian farmers have to spray chemicals 6 times a year on their soybeans is less harmful than GMO I am going to need more than ""Possible consequences"" and ""has not been combined to investigate the possible impact"".

&gt; Lastly, I would just say that the primary reason many intelligent scientifically literate people like myself are highly suspicious of GMO safety

Thank you for making it clear that you are scientifically literate and intelligent. Also maybe even implying that I am not?  If someone has to tell you they are intelligent they usually are not.
