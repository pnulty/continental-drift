As a life-long hockey fan and someone for whom hockey has been the source of some of my most incredible sporting experiences, I fear he is right.

When the NHL lost the entire '04-'05 season, it took them three years to recover. A '12-'13 season seems less and less likely by the day, and the KHL has come a long way in those eight years. 

There's still enough money in the pot today that they'll get another labor agreement together. But five or ten years down the road, it's quite conceivable that the KHL will become a more attractive career option for Europe's top players.

Just as I cannot help but be overjoyed with the prospects of the sport I love best, I am pessimistic about the future of hockey.

,metalgearsolid,,True,t3_15qhxn,False,t3_15qhxn,EvilFefe,0,0,"&gt;I'm going to say MGS4. Everyone seems to have this infatuation with Metal Gear Solid 3 even though half the game you were guiding yourself through a menu equipping camo, healing yourself, or changing equipment. That game required you to stop and take yourself out the experience way too much.

&gt;Now for the reasons I actually like MGS4 the best. I'm not going to be cliche and say something like graphics or gameplay even though the graphics and gameplay were far superior than in previous installments, I'm going to say it was for the story. The story of MGS4 is brilliant, I remember playing it the first time and being blown away because it answered a bunch of question that I had left over from MGS2 (You know, the 7 year cliffhanger) Things like this made me just go Holy shit!
[The Darpa Chief is Sigint](/spoiler) 
[Para-Medic was actually Dr. Clark, The person who made Gray Fox](/spoiler) 
[Vamp was still alive because of Nano machine's Naomi created]
(/spoiler)
[Akiba was actually Johnny from MGS2 and MGS](/spoiler)

&gt;I could go on for a while because there was just a plethora of downright cool intricacies in MGS4's plot that could make any fan squeal the first time he plays it. 

&gt;Now, I'm going to continue talking about the overall fantastic plot of MGS4, I'm going to talk about the nostalgic moments Kojima manages to through at you. These are some moments that also made me squeal like a little girl the first time they happened, Moments like these were just brilliant. [Going back to Shadow Moses and being forced to play a little bit of MGS1 beforehand](/spoiler)
[When you have the Motorcycle sequence with Eva/Big Mama](/spoiler)
[when Snake says ""You haven't even taken the safety off yet rookie"" to Johnny](/spoiler)
[The Final fight with Ocelot, that has Music and Health gauges that span all the Metal Gear games](/spoiler)
[Psycho mantis trying to move your controller](/spoiler)

&gt;There are other times that you are just slapped in the face with nostalgia from MGS4, but now I'm going to move twords the emotional side of MGS4. MGS4 was also the most emotional MGS and this is again another reason I think the plot of MGS4 is solid gold I'm going to stop with the spoiler tags because I am going in depth here, please don't read ahead If you haven't played MGS4 (but who here hasn't)

&gt;The downfall of Raiden. Yes, Yes everyone seems to thing Raiden was this hardcore cyborg in this installment but I always seen him as a broken man. He had alot of cool choreographed fight scenes but whenever he opened his mouth it was quite depressing. He hated what he had become and he knew (or though) Rose would never love him again because of his body and the things he had did to her previously before he off and left. Eventually you all know what happens to Raiden in Shadow Moses, and If you don't stop reading because this will be a spoiler. When Kojima sets it up were he saves Snake but ""Dies"" This was a very strong scene in my opinion, Hearing the anniversary line from MGS2 then ROSE!!!! then fade to black. Almost teared up a bit. Now, Now how could I almost forget the Naomi scene, The scene were Naomi kills herself and Vamp was probably one of the strongest moments of the game. Otacon once again loses someone he loves and for the second time at shadow moses. Seeing the sorrow and despair Otacon is going through that moment was very tough, Teared up a bit here because it was a very moving scene. Now this scene with conjuncture with the scene in Outer Haven with the Patriot AI and the Naomi recording just brings it all together, I love how Naomi affected the plot in MGS4. Now I'm just going to quickfire some emotional moments from MGS4 because there really was alot.
[The scene in Europe were they burn Big Boss' body](/spoiler)
[When Solid Snake ""commits"" Suicide](/spoiler)
[Big Boss showing up post credits](/spoiler)
[Meryl finally getting to have a happy life and making up with Cambell in the Epilogue](/spoiler)
[Before and after the Microwave sequence, Seeing Meryl trying to protect you and Raiden as well, Not only that but while you were going through the Microwave chamber you seen that everyone was essentially about to die because they were no longer able to hold off more](/spoiler)
[Raiden finally accepted himself (sort of) at the end when Rose and his Child come.](/spoiler)

&gt;I really like MGS4 and I hope I posted enough reasons about the plot to maybe change a few of your minds. MGS4 really had a story that was beautifully crafted and it still holds up as my Favorite game of all time.

,FutureWhatIf,,True,t3_15pkvu,False,t3_15pkvu,griftersly,0,0,"Let's assume the year this takes place in is 2035.

The IEA is forecasting a 4 degree celsius warming by then, which is 7.5 degrees F. When you factor in the fact that the temperature difference is more extreme in the poles, it is likely to be 10 degrees fahrenheit for Siberia.

A Siberia that is 10 degrees warmer would be way easier to exploit than the one we have today and it is likely that the Russians would have already started mass exploitation around the 5 degree mark (2024). Russians would come to do work at these mines/facilities, and industries and services would come to service them.

Furthermore, a lack of belligerent acts by either the U.S. or Russia as well as the death of all of the former KGB members in power, allows the U.S. and Russia to become diplomatically friendly. As a result, immigration rules are relaxed for E.U. and U.S. Citizens, allowing many people fleeing unending high unemployment (due to stagnant economies and automation) to come to the region and call it their new home. As a result the population of Siberia triples to 124 million people. Only 8% of which are Chinese.

As a result of long-term economic and diplomatic stability as well as abundant resources (which become more accessible every year). The Russian Economy has posted 5%+ economic growth every year since 2017 giving them a 7.5 Trillion dollar economy in 2035. The Russian Government of the 2010s begins spending large amounts of money on Military R&amp;D and by 2035 is only second in spending to the U.S. (spending 337 B$ annually as per 4.5% of GDP Military Spending). As a result of this and diplomatic belligerence from China, The Siberian border is well secured with missile batteries, AA guns, and Quick Response units. The Naval Base at Vladivostok is well secured with numerous naval ships easily capable of outgunning and outranging most of what the Chinese can put to sea.

Russia will also have successfully boosted it's population with large cash incentives going higher for every child a woman has. As a result the population of Russia in 2035 will be 242 million and the amount of people under 25 will go from 24% to 50% of the population of the country. (Massively increasing the pool of conscriptable citizens).

So that's Russia in 2035. But how is China doing?

China is hit with three serious demographic bombs in the 2010s. 

The first being that a disastrous number of the population was entering old age and no longer working. The effect being that as many as 450 million people would take in pensions and reduce their consumption dragging down basically every domestic market in the country by 2025.

The second being that since most of the people entering old age would retire to their family homes in the countryside, the epidemic of chronic respiratory illnesses (caused by extreme and unreported levels of air pollution) hit the young and middle aged disproportionately hard. Even though stricter pollution standards would come into play in 2020, it was too late to prevent two of the younger generations from having the highest lung and esophageal cancer rates in the world.

As a result, the Chinese economy is in shambles having deflated 7 years in a row (2019-2025).

The third bomb is that because of a huge gender disparity in the population, 55-65 million men who are currently adults will die by 2035 without having ever had children.

So by 2035, China will have missed even the most pessimistic population projections (mainly because of the respiratory illness surprise) and have about 1.15 B people (instead of the forecast 1.3).

As a result of the consistently bad economy, China would have to limit growth in military spending and so their equipment and personnel might very well be 20 years behind the times by 2035.

The last detail, regarding China I wanted to mention was one of civil stability. All of these situations would have a long term destabilizing effect on China. This is without even mentioning technological advances that would make censorship like the kind that the Chinese government is used to borderline impossible.

So what would happen if China invaded Siberia?

Well, they would know that the Russian border is well defended and that the sea is a no-go. Their only remaining option, is a land invasion through Mongolia (because the Russians would not have defended their border with Mongolia nearly as well).

Mongolia, seeking to expand its diplomatic and trade realm would have aggressively sought to forge relationships with both the U.S. and E.U.. Though it is anyone's guess whether they would have taken this all the way to a defense treaty level, it is almost certain that an invasion of Mongolia would illicit a response from both NATO and the E.U. Army. As a result, China might very well have been better invading Russia directly, as economic sanctions might come down before China would even successfully reach Russia. Though to China, this would have been the preferred strategy since it would allow them to put down a foothold inside Russia with less loss of military assets.

But there's a problem, Russia would communicate the fact that the Mongolia play was just to invade them.

Now through the many years, Russia was building and expanding its economic and diplomatic ties, particularly with the E.U.. As a result, an already large amount of Oil trade with the E.U. became a symbiotic relationship, trading in a large number of various resources and services. Though, it did not join the E.U. at any point before 2035, Russia did adopt the Schengen Agreement in 2027. As a result, the E.U. would have fielded it's Army and Air Force in assistance of the Russians in order to protect its sizable economic interests in the country. This would have effectively doubled the strength of the Russian opposition.

Meanwhile as the two sides are fighting on the ground, the U.S. fearing a dead man's trigger scenario where the Chinese opt to nuke indiscriminately rather than lose, field their entire Navy in the South and East China Sea. Then they launch their new bunker buster missiles (designed specifically for this scenario) against every nuke and advanced anti ship missile silo in China. Destroying all but 6 of their nukes, which successfully launch at their predetermined targets. The four nukes flying over the Pacific towards the U.S. are destroyed by jets carrying megawatt lasers. The one aimed at Moscow is successfully intercepted by the Russian Air Force just 200 miles from its target by an anti-ICBM missile. The last one, aimed at New Delhi, is fired at by a new prototype artillery weapon the Indians developed, and though it is not destroyed, it flies out of control and detonates against a Himalayan mountain on the Chinese side of the border (about 20 miles east from Burang, in Tibet).

With too few warship buster missiles, or a navy of any real might (most of the good ships are lost attempting to keep the Russian Navy from entering the East China Sea.),
The war ends when the Russian and American navies pull into port at Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Qingdao. The entire war lasted 8 days with less than 8000 casualties.

China is forced to hand over all of its disputed territories to the other side of the dispute. Tibet is given the option to become independent, but as a result of time, propaganda, and developing events, it stays. A new Chinese Constitution is drafted by Russia, the U.S. and the E.U. effectively turning China into a Federation and disbanding the Communist Party Forcing it to adopt a proportionalist multi-party two-chamber-congress democracy.

As a result of the EU's Assistance in the war (as well as extremely warm relations), Russia agrees to join the European Union in 2043.",1357016132,t5_2v3da,12,1357003503,1430820839,0,12,,c7p0vo6,t1_c7p0vo6,

With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. . . .

    . . . As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance.

    Many Americans do not understand that the Russian wheat belt is the steppe, which has hotter summers, colder winters and less rain than even the relatively arid Great Plains. There is not a common understanding that the histories of China and Europe are replete with genocidal conflicts because different nationalities were located too close together, or that the African plateaus hinder economic development. Instead there is a general understanding that the United States has been successful for more than two centuries and that the rest of the world has been less so. Americans do not treasure the 'good times' because they see growth and security as the normal state of affairs, and Americans are more than a little puzzled as to why the rest of the world always seems to be struggling. And so what Americans see as normal day-to-day activities the rest of the world sees as American hubris.

    But not everything goes right all the time. What happens when something goes wrong, when the rest of the world reaches out and touches the Americans on something other than America's terms? When one is convinced that things can, will and should continually improve, the shock of negative developments or foreign interaction is palpable. Mania becomes depression and arrogance turns into panic.

    An excellent example is the Japanese attack on American forces at Pearl Harbor. Seventy years on, Americans still think of the event as a massive betrayal underlining the barbaric nature of the Japanese that justified the launching of a total war and the incineration of major cities. This despite the fact that the Americans had systemically shut off East Asia from Japanese traders, complete with a de facto energy embargo, and that the American mainland -- much less its core -- was never threatened.

    Such panic and overreaction is a wellspring of modern American power. The United States is a large, physically secure, economically diverse and vibrant entity. When it acts, it can alter developments on a global scale fairly easily. But when it panics, it throws all of its ample strength at the problem at hand, and in doing so reshapes the world.

    Other examples of American overreaction include the response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik and the Vietnam War. In the former, the Americans were far ahead of the Soviets in terms of chemistry, electronics and metallurgy -- the core skills needed in the space race. But because the Soviets managed to hurl something into space first the result was a nationwide American panic resulting in the re-fabrication of the country's educational system and industrial plant. The American defeat in the Vietnam conflict similarly triggered a complete military overhaul, including the introduction of information technology into weapon systems, despite the war's never having touched American shores. This paranoia was the true source of satellite communications and precision-guided weapons. . . .""

2. "". . . the U.S. is unique. And just as we have the world's most advanced economy, military, and technology, we also have its most advanced oligarchy.

    In a primitive political system, power is transmitted through violence, or the threat of violence: military coups, private militias, and so on. In a less primitive system more typical of emerging markets, power is transmitted via money: bribes, kickbacks, and offshore bank accounts. Although lobbying and campaign contributions certainly play major roles in the American political system, old-fashioned corruption--envelopes stuffed with $100 bills--is probably a sideshow today, Jack Abramoff notwithstanding.

    Instead, the American financial industry gained political power by amassing a kind of cultural capital--a belief system. Once, perhaps, what was good for General Motors was good for the country. Over the past decade, the attitude took hold that what was good for Wall Street was good for the country. The banking-and-securities industry has become one of the top contributors to political campaigns, but at the peak of its influence, it did not have to buy favors the way, for example, the tobacco companies or military contractors might have to. Instead, it benefited from the fact that Washington insiders already believed that large financial institutions and free-flowing capital markets were crucial to America's position in the world. . . .""

It's not a matter of Team America: World Police vs. all the peace and prosperity that exists presently in the world minus all the American bullshit.

For some reason, people seem to think that after WWII the entire world just somehow figured out how to be friends. That after centuries of warfare, Europe just up and decided to play nice with each other. The simple fact of the matter is that they have no other choice, because they all use the same military: ours. Moreover, since they do not need to maintain substantial militaries, all those countries are able to divert their resources toward infrastructure and social improvement (if there's one reason why all those social policies work in these countries, this is it).

So what happens if the U.S. cedes its position as the world's primary superpower? Well, first of all, such will mark open season for competition for the #1 spot, and along with it a super-militarization of countries like Russia and China (if you think they're super-militarized now, think again). Secondly, every other country in the world now needs to maintain its own independent military - especially countries under the influence of Russia and China (and the U.S., if it decides to stay in the game). Accordingly, funds for infrastructure and social policy decline. The socialist miracles we like to laud in the U.S. will for the most part cease to exist.

In a way, the U.S. provides economies of scale and specialization for military force. Sure, on one hand U.S. citizens must foot the bill, and on the other hand they reap many of the benefits (perhaps unfairly) therefrom, but one should weigh whether it is worth it for one country to spend $700 billion each year, or for every other country to spend far more than that combined (in excess of what they spend now) - and if the former whether another country is better-suited to the role (though your choices are probably limited to Russia and China). I'm not saying there's a right or wrong answer to that, but I am saying that the world will change substantially - it's not just going to be sunshine and rainbows minus unnecessary U.S. involvement. The (relative) world peace we enjoy right now isn't as natural as younger generations might have grown to assume.

Of course, another option might be to split this superpower between the U.S., Russia, and China, but if you're familiar with the Cold War, you might think it's not so bad for one country to have a ""benign"" (if just barely) dictatorship over international affairs, rather than a competitive triumvirate. Because when world powers compete, they don't compete over infrastructure or social policy (would that it were so!). They compete over military power.

And guess what? Since no one needs to worry about competing over military power right now, guess what we compete over now? We can all point out that America is losing that competition, but someone has to hold the fort, I guess. Or do they?

Jesus is believed to have existed. This is also pretty much accepted in the community regarding history and I also believe that. So that's a step up from most other (smaller) religions. Obviously Mohammed and such also physically existed and this is no explanation for the entire magic stuff.

""Why should I believe in this religion over the others?""

For many the difference in Christianity is that God loves you and wants a relationship with you(read: we're social mammals looking for approval, God gives this approval, hence it makes us feel good, this is obviously just my opinion on it).

You could say that religion is natural because our need for approval is natural.

*Last of the Breed* and *Jubal Sackett* by Louis L'Amour

##Last of the Breed

This book is set in the Cold War era. Major Joeseph Makatozi (part Native American and grew up learning their ways) is captured by the Soviets and placed in a camp in Siberia. He escapes and is pursued all across Siberia.

##Jubal Sackett 

Set in early Colonial America, Jubal Sackett goes west from the Appalachians to the Rockies. He meets a tribe of indians along the way and is asked to find their exploratory group while he is traveling. I can't say more without giving away too much.

##Bonus mini-bio of my favorite author!

[***Louis L'Amour***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_L%27Amour): Often known as ""America's Storyteller"", he was primarily a western novelist, though the term he preferred for he works was ""Frontier Stories"". Over the course of his life, he wrote 105 stories, of which 89 were novels, 14 were collections of short stories and poetry, and two were nonfiction. As of 2010, 320 million copies of his work had been printed, and every single work is still in print. He wrote books set in pre-colonial times through the late 1800s. Additionally, he had a few outliers (which were *great* stories) set in: 12th century Europe and Mid-East (The Walking Drum) and Mid 1900s (The Haunted Mesa and Last of The Breed)

He grew up in the west and traveled all over it. He knew it better than any other writer. I would put his work in the category of Historical Fiction, because he tells so much of how life was. He would even included some philosophy in his stories. One thing that he really liked to talk about was the Indians and their way of life.

He had one series of 17 books about the Sackett family. He chronicled their beginnings in England in 1599 through the mid to late 1800s. This series basically tells the story of the American people in that time period. It skips the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, but it follows the settlement and life of the new land.",False,t5_2t403,2,1357008371,1430821304,0,2,,c7p1vsh,t1_c7p1vsh,

You stand corrected.


There was Noah And he had 3 sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; all Semites *(and that includes Arabs)* come from the line of Shem as noted here:

&gt;In linguistics and ethnology, Semitic (**from the Biblical ""Shem""**... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semite

**So the Palestinians/Arabs &lt;Granddaddy was ""Shem""!**

Ashkenazi come from Japheth. Who begot Gomer who begot Ashkenaz as stated here:

וּבְנֵי, גֹּמֶר--אַשְׁכְּנַז וְרִיפַת, וְתֹגַרְמ3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0110.htm#3 

**So the European/Ashkenazi ""jews"" &lt;Granddaddy was Japheth!**

And the Ashkenazim converted the name of their religion but not their grand-daddy or their Babylonian Talmud in the year 740 AD as stated here: [3] http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/khazars1.asp

Can you see how they had different Granddaddies? That's what you call ethnology

No, I can assure you most farmers in Europe still use modern hybrids they were selling at markets.  I was just in Spain a while ago and I recognized new melon cultivars being grown...  Melons bred using modern breeding methods by scientists like the ones who work at Monsanto (methods not including GMO technology of course).  Yes, some use old heirlooms or old world varieties but those are for small markets and any of them looking to work on a larger scale or make more money generally use hybrids and synthetic inputs (organic and otherwise). 

As for traditional farming methods being better to modern science based alternatives, ask ancient Mesopotamia how that worked out for them.  Traditional farming methods there helped turn much of the area into an inarable desert in ancient times.  Also, if traditional farming methods work perfectly and science is is trivial, why was the green revolution such a big deal?  If those farmers in places like If Norman Borlaug and others hadn't brought modern agronomic practices and modern higher yielding varieties to counties like Mexico and India, there would have been massive starvation.  Without synthetic nitrogen inputs (ie non-traditional farming methods!) there is no way to produce enough food for everyone in the world.

Your bleeding heart romantic lamentation of the loss of family farms is tired and ill informed.  If everyone was to revert to what you call ""traditional methods"" of farming, we would see an incredibly drastic shift of labor.  I'll bet you wouldn't want to go out and hoe a corn field for minimum wage would you?  Most people wouldn't either.  We use genetics, farm equipment, and chemicals, as well as poorly paid immigrant labor in the US and other countries unfortunately, for dealing with things like weeds.  Traditional farming requires a drastically higher labor input.  Modern corn varieties can shade out weeds easier (as they grow faster, can be grown closer together etc.), produce higher yields, some can produce higher yields with less inputs or tolerate disease and marginal land better with the right genetics.  

I don't even know where to begin with your argument about economics and about being poisoned(?) to death.  A marriage between the best parts of traditional farming and modern scientific methods is the best bet for food security and good farming etc. your arguments just sound incredibly backwards and anti-science.",False,t5_2qh1i,3,1357018661,1430822180,0,3,,c7p3qqy,t1_c7p3qqy,

No not really what i've meant, but once motherhood comes around alot of women just give up to raise children which daycares are more common in business centers it should be that women should try to re-enter the workforce after the child is born. 

&gt;It seems that more and more families where both parents work, when they have kids choose the parent who gets paid less to stay at home and look after the children, whether its the mom or the dad, which incidentally was a discussion a while back with respect that dads get less time off work, or none at all after the birth. Whereas in Europe a couple can choose whichever parent or split the maternity leave between the parents, however the two of them like (the dad gets his own paternity leave on top of that).

I'm sorry but you are wrong. Classical liberalism is a specific subset. There is also modern liberalism. Maybe instead of just saying the same thing over and over you should actually read the article. [Classical Liberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism) actually has a separate entry. 

&gt;You are terrible at logic. If you want to have an intelligent philosophical discussion, define and support your assertions, or get the fuck out. A vague platitude such as ""many political ideas are unachievable"" does not mean anything nor contribute any substance to the discussion.

You really want/need me to write that all out. 

How about communism, you already made an argument for that one being unattainable. I had a professor who made the argument that there has never been a real communist state. They all either failed to go beyond socialism or devolved into some form of dictatorship with central planning held by the few or single person in power. In effect communism was impossible given current data to actually form on any meaningful scale. 

You also have anarchism which like communism requires everyone to buy in to the same strong philosophical stance. Not to mention the likely economic effects it would have. Many technological advancements have been because of the drive of capitalism to improve things or by a group cooperating. Not by an individual who lived in a society where nobody had any obligation but to themselves. 

These simple to draw conclusions are what we call obvious, you could go one step further and say self evident but you have to have an idea of the topic first. Given your critique of communism though, it is self evident to you.  

Believe it or not, Liberalism does not mean what the say on TV. It is a term used by political scientists to describe a family of related philosophies. Most people in the west can be described as a Liberal of some form. Socialism and Communism, while not strictly Liberalism do owe a great deal to it. In influences and as a basis for development at the least. Marx would never had written his essays if he didn't have the Liberal European states around to critique. 

Speaking of Marx, I do think his assessment is for the most part correct. His prescribed solution is completely nutters though. ",1357024877,t5_2qhc8,1,1357024494,1430822713,0,1,,c7p4py0,t1_c7p4py0,
,worldnews,,True,t3_15mhye,False,t1_c7oc4gw,LAMJ12,0,0,"you have a very philosophical view but I'd argue it is extremely distanced from reality. I'd prefer a fairer and happier country where the government makes an attempt to redistribute wealth- Equality of opportunity have you heard of it? Its an American concept and it is indispensable in understanding today's European social democracies. Equality of opportunity means that everybody has the same chance and there is nothing fairer than that in my opinion. But to do that governments need to provide public goods equally amongst the people (public goods being something which can't be distributed privately.) That costs money and a lot of it. And governments need to also make sure that people feel the effects of taxation the same/are not overburdened by taxation- do you understand the difference between a flat tax and a tax which has the same cost to people (I'll expand this later?) 

So to both maximise the governments revenue and to fairly distribute the cost of taxation but not the cost of taxation purely in monetary terms which is what you limit your argument to, governments use variable taxes. Now what you say in the bulk of your argument is that you can't overtax anyone- but overtaxing the poor can be as easy as taking 5k out of 20k earnings and in most countries that means rice everyday/or no healthcare or no tv , etc. whereas a rich 200k earner can absorb 25% like nothing because he still fulfills all his economic needs and a lot of his wants too (aka 65' plasma TV.) Of course he'll have to buy a mercedes instead of a Lamborghini but I really don't see that many people/him crying over his loss. 

Furthermore, you again repeat that giving any lower classes a tax advantage will lead the rich to leave- that is complete and utter bullshit. It depends on the degree of the tax on the rich- they couldn't give less of a shit if the poorest guy was getting 0% and they were getting 5% but if both the poorest and richest guy were taxed  90% they would both leave regardless of what they were getting taxed and regardless of whether it was morally fair. They look out for their own best interests and in real terms, the best countries to live in the world today all use variable tax whether or not you love it or hate it and as such that is why the rich aren't fleeing to somalia or any other downtrodden third-world shithole where nobody even bothers to collect tax on foreigners. 

Rich people appreciate that their money is used in wealth redistribution which eventually comes to benefit them in terms of security, healthcare, educated workforce, etc. A problem only comes about when governments such as the Greek government make it incredibly easy to avoid paying taxes at all- and of course due to human nature the richest will straight up avoid paying taxes even if they have to pay some money to do it and they end up making a profit at the end of it. Secondly the problem comes about when there is overtaxation  but as I said before overtaxation means different things to different people in different geographical and economic situations. 

You are looking at this problem from a straightforward imaginary point of view but you are not inspecting the reasons as to why tax might be higher, how it benefits the rich, how it would harm the poor to have the processes of wealth redistribution severely diminished and how this would tarnish their equality of opportunity or as you said ""widen the gap between those who have and those who have not."" Additionally you keep referring to this argument that only flat tax will make the rich happy- it is not a flat tax that makes the rich happy its that they think that their taxation is reasonable for what they get out of it. They don't care what their maid gets taxed- shes a bloody maid so what if she pays 20% less, its pithy money. ",False,t5_2qh13,2,1357024568,1430822717,0,2,,c7p4qeb,t1_c7p4qeb,

,AskHistorians,,True,t3_15rk0r,False,t1_c7p5atc,LucifersCounsel,0,0,"&gt;WW1 the US played a minor fighting role but had major influence in ending the war.

Actually, the US played a major but relatively ineffectual role. By May 1918 they had a million troops in France, but during their period in combat they suffered about 320,000 casualties, while the French suffered about 330,000 in the same time period, but held a much larger section of the front.

The most that can be said of the US presence during WWI is that their arrival signalled to the Germans that the war would continue indefinitely because the US could continue committing troops for years to come, while the other warring nations had been hurt badly by the years of fighting preceding the US involvement. At that point the Germans knew the war was unwinnable, even if they weren't necessarily going to lose, and *everyone* had had enough by then.

If anyone can be said to have contributed the most to the war effort against the Germans, it would have to be France. They fought from the very beginning of the war, to the very end, and it was in France that the German advance was halted.

Having said that, what really brought that war to an end was the 'flu pandemic of 1918. At that point the entire world had a much greater problem to deal with than the petty European political differences that caused the war, and the troops were especially vulnerable due to the conditions and cramped quarters of the front lines.

I'm not surprised that the US would claim they brought the war to an end, though. American Exceptionalism is something that pervades it's culture. If it's good, they did it first, and if they didn't, then it couldn't have been good. At least that's the attitude most Americans display.

&gt;WW2, the US was very key.

It was a major player, but hardly ""key"". The key player was the Soviet Union. They *destroyed* more German units than the rest of the Allies *faced*, and they fought the German's elite units and most sophisticated weapons. By the time US troops actively engaged German troops, they were facing a military already decimated by the Soviets, and not even their most elite remaining units, which were still engaged against the Soviets. Western Europe fell easily because the Germans had lost most of their military power in the Soviet meat grinder.

Even the argument that the US supplied the Soviets doesn't really hold water. For example, arguably the best tank of the war was the Soviet T-34, that could face the best the Germans had to offer and hold their own, while American tanks were so outclassed that the idea was to throw as many of them as possible against German tanks in the hope of overwhelming them by sheer force of numbers. The US sent three times as much aid to Britain as it gave to the Soviet Union, yet they hardly made a dent in the Germans compared to the Soviets.

Essentially, the US sent 7000 essentially obsolete tanks to the USSR, then claimed those tanks, that couldn't compare favourably to even early German tanks, were somehow more responsible than the 57,000 T-34's the Soviets produced by 1945. And that was *just* the T-34.

What the Americans did provide in good numbers that became an essential part of the Soviet war effort, was trucks. But clearly, the Soviets could have handled that themselves, if they had needed to. Between 1937 and 1944 total US tank production of all types was 88,816, while the soviets produced at least 106,025 between 1940 and 1945. Remember, though, that the Soviets had been invaded and were being bombed, while the US was unscathed.

So on to Japan. What most people seem not to remember is that even though the Japanese and Soviet Union had not declared war on each other, the UK and US had gained a commitment from Stalin to enter into the war in the Pacific within three months after the fall of Hitler. On August 9 1945, the day the US bombed Nagasaki, they did so by invading Manchuria. This had far more effect on the Japanese than the bombing did. So, if it is possible to claim the US caused Germany to surrender when they entered WWI, it is equally possible to claim the Soviets forced Japan to surrender when they joined the war against them in WWII, only months after capturing Berlin and ending the war in Europe.

The fact is, the Soviet Union won WWII, and the US hated that fact. The atomic bombing of Japan was not designed to force the Japanese to surrender, it was designed to signal to the Soviets that the US had a weapon that could be used against those massed tank units if the Soviets decided to just go ahead and take the rest of Europe and China. The Soviets had as many tanks as the Americans, but they were significantly superior designs, so the US tactic of mass attacks would not have worked.

In the end it was a bluff that wasn't even necessary, because the Soviets had no intention of taking Europe or China. All they wanted was a buffer zone between them and the west, and especially wanted Germany neutered as a military force. They got what they wanted, they fulfilled all the commitments they made, but the US/UK immediately reneged on most of their commitments and started treating the Soviet Union as an enemy as soon as the war came to an end.",1357036557,t5_2ssp3,-9,1357036330,1430823412,0,-9,,c7p67dk,t1_c7p67dk,

and you just posted the same article, again? to what point, so I could read it for the billionth time?

And your sample size is simply excellent. More guns = more deaths only works if you directly compare a european country to the USA only. Because if you compare to their neighbor that has 5 times as many guns, or their other neighbor that has fewer, you will find the stats dont line up. Leaving your sample size as ""1"" is really not a good way to prove anything, all you have proved there is that the USA is violent.

Because comparing european countries, canada , etc to each other, you dont get the fancy numbers you would think you would. there are plenty high gun, low crime countries, and just as many of the opposite.

Even within the USA that isnt true. Going state by state, many of the states with the most guns and laxest laws, have less murders than canada or europe. Most of the ones with the astronomically high rates that skew the rest of the USA have very very strict gun control, even by canadian standards, like chicago, NY, LA, Detroit, Washington DC.

Outside of some of the urban centers with extreme rates of poverty, no healthcare, no social safety nets and entrenched gangs(thanks to drug and alcohol prohibition), the USA's murder rate is actually pretty normal, much closer to canada's and Europes.

Not all of them, im not trying to prove guns decrease violence, but there is plenty evidence that amount of guns, or laws do not universally directly affect crime rates

How old are you, the gap is different depending on your age. 18-30 is MUCH bigger than 30-42. Age gaps are an issue but that rare nto generally insurmountable. 

&gt;We Skype a few times a week, talk on the phone and online every day...We are pretty much inseparable. We have both said 'I love you' and honestly, I do love him - I have never felt like this before in my life. He said he has not told a woman that he loves her for over 10 years, if that is true then this is a big deal for him too.

I met my SO online, we lived in different countries and I hate to say it but...... you don;t love him, at least not like you think you do, because it is VERY likely not _him_ that you love. Here is what i posted before about this issue:

&gt; **The person you love is not really him.**

&gt; Its your idea of him, and there is a 100% chance he is not exactly who you think. He may be 99.5% like your idea of him, or 5% like you imagine, but he's not who you are in love with. I felt a lot for me s/o before i met her, but i resisted from thinking of it as love until I'd actually met her, and the gap between starting to talk and meeting was well under 2.5 years.

&gt; This doesn't mean he's not awesome, or that you won;t get married and be blissfully happy, but you need to understand these grim realities to make it work. Until you meet then its partly a fantasy, and if that fantasy isn't what you hoped you waste a lot of time you could have spent on something simpler and more real.

&gt; Don't take this to mean you shouldn't end up with him, me and my s/o have lived together a couple of years now, but it takes work. She isn't who I thought she was online, she's got faults i missed and good points I hadn't imagined. Overall she's 500% awesomer in real life, but i didn't know that till we met.

&gt;Good luck! 

Basically you are almost certainly projecting things on the guy that may not be there. Think of it as you having the potential for love with him, but recognise there is a reality gap for now, even with skype etc. 

Also, all the European men thing sounds liks balls to me. Europe is a pretty varied place anyway, you can't talk  about 'European men' and say much that isn't a useless generalisation. Which country is he from? That at least gives more info: a brit may be different to a frenchman, spaniard or dane.

Nonsense. The Iranian loanwords in Proto-Uralic and in the various daughter languages (Proto-Mari, Proto-Mordvin, Proto-Permian) are well-documented. In ancient times, the Iranian languages were spoken very far north bordering on the Uralic languages, while the Slavonic branch of Indo-European was limited to southeastern Poland/western Ukraine and not in contact with most of Uralic until after the turn of the second millennium AD.

You really must have no acquaintance with the history of the Uralic languages to make the claim you did. That's nothing to be ashamed of -- we can't all specialize in all language families -- but I urge you to read *The Uralic Languages* ed.

You seem to confuse cause and effect when it comes to equality. Trying to make people more equal results in reducing their quality of life, and often in genocide, famine and the like (every Marxist/Atheist state ever). 

Trying to improve peoples quality of life on the other hand can make homogeneous populations more equal (Japan and Northern Europe). 

TL,DR?: You are neglecting Natural Law which would lead to utter ruin if your ideas were put into effect. Equality ought not be the goal, even if it might be the result.

British Army in World War I,AskHistorians,military,True,t3_15rk0r,False,t3_15rk0r,military_history,0,0,"This line of argument has generated a lot of disagreement in the past, but I think that the USSR would have defeated Germany without Western assistance. Please note that when I say 'war', I mean the fighting from 1941-1945 between Germany and the USSR; not the entirety of WWII. It's pretty undeniable that victory in the Pacific was anything more than an American and Commonwealth effort.

My main points are:

*The German offensive was halted in the winter of 1941 on a line running roughly Leningrad-Moscow-Crimea. Their gains after this were limited to the area captured in the Ukraine, the Crimea and the Caucasus as part of the Operation Blue offensive towards Stalingrad. The front running past Moscow and Leningrad stayed relatively stable until the Germans began to retreat; neither city was actually captured.
The Red Army was in 1941 in its worst condition at any point in the war; in terms of manpower, equipment, armour and air support and probably morale as well. Huge mobilization, the development of better weaponry, the introduction of improved tank and aircraft designs, and the opportunity for the untried military leadership to gain experience, would only see the Red Army's situation improve. The Wehrmacht and its allies, on the other hand, launched Barbarossa well prepared and with the most troops and vehicles they could muster. While it was far from a rapid decline, the Wehrmacht did steadily lose effectiveness; while the average soldier was pretty much always better trained and equipped than his Soviet counterpart, and he did benefit from a constant influx of new technology and increasing mechanisation, I don't think this was enough to counteract the effect of attrition. By 1942 the USSR produced twice as many tanks as Germany; by 1943 three times as many. The Wehrmacht was therefore probably at its most effective, all things considered, when it launched the campaign; the Red Army was probably most effective at the end.

*Support from the US and UK did not have a notable effect on the early stages of the war, before the German advance had been halted. Little support was forthcoming at first; the West had been decidedly suspicious of the USSR, regarding it as almost as much of a threat to stability as Germany. Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and part of Poland only worsened the prospects for cooperation. It was only the USSR's unintended conflict with Germany, and the realisation that the USSR could take the brunt of the fighting, which motivated Western assistance. Even so, Lend-Lease, despite having taken effect in March 1941, was only extended to the USSR in October--and considering the time taken to ship equipment to the USSR, and then for it to reach the front line via the Soviet Union's poor lines of supply, it could not have any sizeable effect before the spring of 1942, after the Blitzkrieg had been halted. Lend-Lease shortened the war dramatically, probably by years, but it didn't save the Red Army from collapse, nor enable it to push the Wehrmacht back to Germany.

*It is true that Germany was deprived troops due to its occupation of much of Europe and ongoing fighting in North Africa. Yet both were relatively minor in comparison to the Eastern Front, which was by far the largest theatre. In addition, the absence of some troops was somewhat outweighed by the fact that the previous campaigns in Poland, Norway and France provided experience to soldiers who would go on to fight in Russia. More importantly, there was a sizeable German military presence in the occupied territories long before the US got involved. At the time of Barbarossa in June 1941, Germany retained 38 divisions in France and Benelux, 12 in Norway, 1 in Denmark, 7 in the Balkans, as well as 2 in North Africa. These troops would not require significant reinforcement until 1943; by which time the USSR had definitely halted the Wehrmacht and was beginning to turn the tide and push it back to Germany.

Therefore the USSR would most likely have won. We know that a barely prepared Red Army was able to halt the Blitzkrieg before Western aid, however significant, really took effect. The USSR had staved off a collapse in morale which could have seen the Red Army, and national unity, dissolve. From that point on, German victory was unlikely due to the superior manpower and industrial capacity of the USSR, and the fact that the USSR was able to match Germany in terms of technology. The Red Army would gradually increase in size and power, and the Wehrmacht would decline. The USA's role was important in defeating the Japanese, shortening the war in Europe and preventing Soviet occupation of Western Europe. But Germany would have been eventually defeated by the Soviet Union alone.

,NeutralPolitics,,True,t3_15rhzt,False,t3_15rhzt,codayus,0,0,"I'd say the approach of the Kyoto protocol was always flawed, and in several ways.

First, Kyoto is predicated on the idea that to save the planet, we *all*, *collectively* need to consume less.  ...but it only asked the developed countries to do so, which wouldn't be enough.

Second, by only targeting some nations it exacerbated an already crippling collective action problem.  Every country wants to benefit from global warming being solved, but would like all the *other* countries to pay the cost.  After all, says &lt;insert random country here&gt;, if we alone don't abide by Kyoto, the world will still be fine.  But not ever country can be a free rider.

Third, and much worse, by not being comprehensive Kyoto allowed (even encouraged) the export of consumption.  We saw, relentlessly and constantly, moderately polluting factories closing in the EU, and more polluting factories making the same products opening in China, producing goods which were then shipped (using fossil fuels!) back to the EU.  On paper, this cut EU CO2 output, and was thus, wonderful and green.  But it was an accounting trick; global CO2 output spiked upwards every time it happened.  (And it didn't do the economy of the EU any favour either.)

And you won't be able to solve the issue of exporting CO2 production without making Kyoto truly universal, but there is no force which could do that.  Countries are self interested, in theory and in practice.  For small countries, that still leaves open a carrot and stick approach, but countries like the US and China are too powerful to force, too large to bribe, and yet too polluting to leave outside Kyoto.

And if nothing else, there's another problem:  There's a ton of oil and gas underneath us; thanks to advances in shale oil and shale gas extraction, there's far more than we realised even a decade ago.  If it's economic to extract it, it will be, eventually, absent a military occupation.  Concerns over fracking will delay it, but as energy prices rise, the cost of not exploiting these reserves will become unbearable.  Sooner or later the reserves will be pumped, and shortly thereafter, burnt.  So, question:  Is someone going to invade the Middle East to make sure that nobody pumps the oil under the Saudi sands up?  Answer:  No.  Even if someone was able and willing to do so (and after the Iraq war, that's an open question), they're more likely to do so to pump it up, not *stop* it being pumped up.  Whatever solution we reach has to result in a world where people simply leave the hydrocarbons in the ground - by choice.  Because we can't *force* them to, and if they aren't left in the ground, no faffing about with emissions targets will do anything more than slow the warming down by a couple of years.  (And remember, that's all the original Kyoto Protocol was meant to do; it was never intended or projected to *stop* the warming, just delay it by a few short years.)

So in sum, yeah, Kyoto is absolutely doomed (but then, that was clear before the first climate summit; the UN process doesn't/can't solve issues of this type).

But there is good news:  Technology!

First, solar.  Most renewables are hopeless, but solar is getting cheaper at a ridiculous pace.  In many ways, it's a classic ""disruptive technology"", and at some point fairy soon, at current trends, it'll switch from being inferior to fossil fuels to being superior.  The results will be huge.

Second, shale gas.  Natural gas is actually pretty environmentally friendly.  Notice how in that infographic US emissions *dropped*?  Despite the US not signing Kyoto?  Yeah, a lot of that was outsourcing emissions to China, but much of the rest was a greater use of natural gas, which is much lower carbon than coal.  And the US has a *ton* of it, so much so that natural gas prices in the US have plummeted.  Other countries will likely follow suit, and the result is - hopefully - a nice medium carbon stopgap until solar comes online to provide actual low carbon energy.

Third and finally, nuclear.  The tech has terrible PR problems, and Fukushima didn't help.  And yet...thorium reactors are an amazing tech, very safe, and if evaluated on their own merits seem very, very promising.

So that's my view:  Collective government action is doomed, and would be pointless even if it wasn't.  Some mix of natural gas (now) and solar and thorium (soon) will solve the problem though.

This can be taken at least in two manners.

1. Reddit is made up of mostly Protestants as Reddit is mostly westerners and Protestants are concentrated in the west.

1. Reddit is influenced more by Protestantism.

I take the 2nd view as what the person was implying.

A good example of this is the two names for the Christian God in China.  Because of influence of Protestantism, the idea that there are Catholics and there are Christians has been accepted. Now this doesn't mean that the person saying it is Protestant or even Christian, but they have been influenced by the overall culture of Protestantism.

By taking the 2nd view, it is saying that the West when speaking on Christian topics is greatly influenced by Protestantism. When we speak of the East in relation to Christian topics, we refer more often to Eastern Orthodox and Catholic.

You speak to a random person in the West, they will speak from a position that favors Protestantism. Random person in Eastern Europe and soviet bloc, you are looking at Eastern Orthodox and Catholicism.

You sound like a sociopath, this is exactly the mentality of medieval Europe. The state is authorized by God, therefor you must obey, or you go against God.

Didn't you state that there has never been an anarchist society? How do you determine that there is already a defeat in that case? Using that logic we could say that an anarchist society has a better track record of having failed 0 times compared to the vast majority of states in human history having fallen already.

I have entirely lost interest in your argument, it sounds petty and as if you have never been involved in violence before. It is easy to advocate for violence when you are not the one who has to perform the act.

My own approach is different here: most people in most ethnic groups are essentially breeding fodder. They're not bad, they're just not exceptional in any way (they will try to disguise this with bizarre behavior, in the worst cases becoming *hipsters*). This means that what we see of any group in general is not representative of the whole; like all other things in life, each population is a Bell Curve, with most in the middle, some who are useless, and some who are exceptional.

For African-descended people, I might point to Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas, Malcolm X, and Marcus Garvey as inspirations.

For Jewish-descended people, I might point to Theodor Herzl, Baruch Spinoza, Laurence Auster, Kurt Vonnegut, and others.

Let's look at what would be the optimum situation for Europeans.

We gained most of our strength as isolated populations who lived in cold places and spent most of their time in internal warfare. To me, this internal warfare or struggle is most important: we practiced vigorous quality control, albeit in a decentralized way.

The problem we face is that there are many temptations that lead to self-destruction. Laws and force can't stop these; they come from without as well as within. What if our society idealizes Justin Bieber, Snooki and Fred Durst? We can breed ourselves into *Idiocracy* without help from anyone else, and in fact our current policies favor that (in addition to multiculturalism).

Looking back at Plato, who watched the Greeks self-destruct, the same symptoms were present there.

We need a strong culture that resists degeneration, and then the rest of the world can be left to its own devices. Our people will resist its intrusion, as their people will resist our intrusion, and so the original balance of earth is kept.

I don't want total elimination of any group.

I could also mention the Erasmus program which is a great thing for students (basically, for those who don't know what that is, it's a grant associated with an international study program that lets students spend one or two semester abroad, so much for discovering other cultures !)

This is, of course, only speaking about small conveniences. The truth about Europe is much harder to describe, the political and economical system is not widely accepted. I, sadly, can't get into the technical details, as an example you can look for the criticisms of the Common Agricultural Policy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#Criticism) that will give you a good idea of why Europe has to be restructured.

The people: Americans are awesome.  We are friendly as shit, and walking around with a smile everywhere we go.  Somebody comes up with a foreign accent and we want to know more.  Go to old Europe or most of Asia or the middle east or the FSU and people are surly, cynical, and rude.

The diversity: There is no such thing as Typically American.  We have everything, and all of it in critical mass enough to take everything to the extreme fringes.  We don't just go scuba diving, we go to the challenger deep.  We don't just fly, we go to the moon.  We don't just build buildings, we build skyscrapers.

The altruism: it is easy to lose the larger picture here, but the USA constantly pays for the betterment of the world in blood and treasure.  We could easily stay home and make money, but we choose to do what we think is right, even if the execution is imperfect.

First, they will look for someone to blame. Next, they will look for a messiah to lead them out. That messiah will be the one who points the finger of blame and shows that he has the strength to eliminate it. The people will flock in that direction like flies on to shit no matter how bad that person is. They will blindly excuse any injustices and crimes in favor of the false hope that their new leader will make everything all right for them. 

America, during the great depression, came very close to adopting the Nazi way of life. We were enamored with Hitlers seemingly miraculous rescue of the German economy and the huge social advancements the people had made between 1933 and 1939. Guys like Ford and Siemens put out publications extolling the Nazi virtues and even set up shop inside the Nazi regime. Even after Pearl Harbor, it was Hitler declaring war against the US in honor of his treaty with Japan that brought us into Europe. In reality is wasn't the Americans who saved the Jews. It was Japan. If they hadn't attacked then we never would have invaded Europe. America was perfectly happy with Hitler controlling Europe.

Fast forward to today. American politics has become infected with a very dangerous and old religion; Dominionism. Dominionists believe straight up they are the word of God and all must kneel before it and any method is justified in getting this result. Followers of its close brother religion, Puritanism, were literally kicked out of England and our own Constitution intentionally separated them from government influence (Washington and crew had gotten tired of people being executed in very torturous ways for very minor crimes). Today, our Republicans are thinking directly along Dominionist lines. They will give no compromise in their negotiations, they feel that food and housing and health care should only go to those who deserve it (and everyone else can die for all they care), and they feel that wealth should only go to those in their leadership positions. 

Where I live is an area of the country that has been nicknamed ""The Old Dominion"". Officially that nickname is stated to be a joke. It is no Joke. America's very first government (Capital: Jamestown, Virginia) was very much a dominionist government. One that merrily slaughtered Indians in the name of God, executed its own citizen by means of pressing (without trial), and regarded as too barbaric even by the Church of England's standards. They also controlled American food, stripping farms at harvest to dole out food only to the worthy. If threat of death didn't keep you in line, very real starvation would. Only scale has kept early America from being listed as one of histories most horrendous dictatorships. They just couldn't slaughter the heathens fast enough to make the ranks.

The American economy is tanking and our republicans are doing everything they can to ensure that it does. This is not the actions of a party that is about freedom. It is the actions of a party that want complete and uncontested control over our government. They know that when things get bad enough the Americans will look to a hero for answers and they mean to supply that hero. That hero will very much purport himself to be a man of God.

We he takes control America will proceed to wage a war that will make WW2 look like a schoolyard scrap in comparison. We will go on a conquest spree that will make even Genghis Khan look like an amateur. We will slaughter our own minorities and very likely destroy our Indian reservations, and kill them.
And we will do it in the name of Jesus.

It may sound insane, but the fact is that we have already subjugated an entire race, and this before modern technology. People like Romney getting a shot at presidency are proof that we are beginning to get desperate.  That the election was decided by the vote of only a state or two means we are very close indeed. Fear is a great controlling device. The way things are going in another couple of election cycles the republicans will be able to put Pol Pot on the ballet and win with him. Just so long as that leader can appoint blame, and has the balls to kill what he blames. 

TLDR; History shows that poverty and famine are awesome tools for creating totalitarian dictatorships. A starving population looks to have a hero, and will embrace one no matter how evil he is.

Mexico is [the ultimate melting pot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Mexico#Ethnic_groups). Asia isn't an ethnicity, it's a mix of many ethnicities - all with very different appearances. Forgetting that, do you think the most desirable areas to live in Asia (Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore and HK) are Asian only? There are massive multicultural populations in all the most desirable places in Asia. Israel is an open society and Judaism is both a religion *and* an can be considered an ethnicity.

Things like civil liberties, habeas corpus, a devolution of powers and rights to owning a gun might be disliked by the political elites or social democrats in Europe, but to the vast majority of Americans, they are fundamental human rights. That is more important than a social contract. It is something that they believe comes from God or if they are atheist like me, from nature. 

It is not a fetish, and dismissing it as such is extremely naive. The constitution is perhaps the most important document in the history of the world. Not only was it the first ever real declaration of human rights and the supremacy of man over his governments, but nearly every constitution in the world is based on it. 

Furthermore, Americans are not averse to changing their consitution. I mean, they've changed it 27 times for goodness sake! With some of these changes drastically undermining the original intent of the constitution in my view, particulalry the 16th, 17th and 18th amendments. 

Basically, don't confuse a constitution which you ideologically disagree with for one that is broken. Many 'progressive' changes have happened in America by sidestepping the constitution, which have massively increased the role that the federal government plays in peoples lives - a role that would shock and scare the founders and would never stand up to the wills of the people, hence why they have not and will not test any of the new departments, overreachers or unconstitutional powers by asking for the constitution to be amended to include them.

[The total population of the European Union is a little over 500 million](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-QA-09-047/EN/KS-QA-09-047-EN.PDF) and if you add non-EU countries that form part of the Schengen area (Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein) it's even more.

&gt;if it were remotely true it would be unreasonable to expect the US to allow for an immigration rate that would double or triple it population within a few years. The economy and infrastructure wouldn't be able to support it.

It is true (as shown above), but also I'm not judging the American or European immigration policies, I'm just stating the fact that Europe lets in a shitload more people than the US.

&gt;Second, Europe is not one country. The US allows in far more immigrants than any one EU country.

Simple algebra tells us that any one EU country allows in the entire Schengen area population (over 500 million people) minus its own population, so wrong again.

Why would you do that? As you yourself have stated, Europe is not one country, so migration between European countries should not be viewed at the same level as US citizens moving between states.

Granted, however, that color difference does play a role in integration, by both the majority who may discriminate on those who look different, and the ethnic minorities themselves who may feel and want to be different/separate from the rest (communitarianism). 

I feel integration, and social integration as well, is only possible when immigrants stay relatively few in numbers. I don't think it's possible to have a peaceful integration if immigrants are numerous enough to form ethnic neighborhoods, entire communities where they wouldn't need or have the opportunity to interact with the native culture and population. Many people say countries form ethnic ghettos with their immigrants, but it seems to me many times ethnic neighborhoods are formed by the immigrants themselves. No country decided to create a Chinatown. It created itself, by Chinese immigrants deciding to go live where other Chinese people did, and in time formed a Chinatown on their own. Thus Chinese immigrants are often not at all socially integrated, though, contrary to African immigrants, they tend to not resolve to violent crime or form ethnic gangs. 

If in small numbers, immigrants seem to integrate, socially and in general, very well. But when a country like France lets in 200,000 immigrants each year, most of them coming from Africa and the middle-east, integration is painful. 200,000 a year is enormous, equivalent to the population of Aberdeen, and to that of the French city of Rennes (11th largest city). It makes integration especially more difficult when there already are massive integration difficulties with immigrants (or children of immigrants) who are already here. The integration of immigrants has been on the forefront of public debate in France since a decade at least and yet we're still importing massive numbers of unskilled labor from third world countries, although we do already have unskilled and massively unemployed immigrant populations here.

That's why I'm for restricting immigration more. From Africa and the middle east because that's where most immigrants to Europe come from, and because since they're of a very different culture, their integration is harder than for, say, a Spaniard or Pole. Not to mention historical and cultural factors will often lead some African youth immigrants not wanting to integrate, and hating France (even though Spain and Italy suffered bloody conquests in the past from France, they have largely moved past historical differences - and I've never heard a Spanish immigrant complaining about how Napoleon massacred Spanish people or something). 

The situation is very complex and I don't want to seem like I'm generalizing, but do your country a favor, and support parties who would rather prefer selective immigration of skilled workers, and not massive imports of unskilled labor, especially if they're from outside Europe - and thus you'd avoid the problems massive immigration countries like England, Sweden, France and Germany have.",False,t5_2qh4j,5,1357059227,1430824603,0,5,,c7p8qhv,t1_c7p8qhv,

Maybe not with the total lack of physical contact, but feeling like a relationship leper - reasonably attractive, people like me, people say I'm a catch, but then none actually want me caught.

The thing that's turned this all around for me? Online Dating (Cliche? ok!). I can't underemphasize the importance for me of going into a situation knowing that the other person is looking for a romantic relationship. Simply having the ""are they even single/ready for a relationship/interested in me?"" question removed by virtue of the fact that if we're meeting in person was an immediate anxiety diffuser. You still may not connect in real life, and that's ok! But it takes a whole bunch of the questions surrounding a ""date"" off the table.

Since starting online dating almost 2 years ago, I've met probably 20 people for first dates, gone on 2nd/3rd with 3, and am in a full-fledged relationship with one. Now, that might not seem like great odds, but just meeting people within a romantic setting in a 'testing each other out' sort of way is really great! It makes it easy to see the things you're willing to be flexible about and the things you aren't. Plus, most people only really need one!

But here's my biggest takeaway from the whole experience. In meeting 20-some 23-or-so guys within the context of judging whether a mutual romantic relationship would work, it wasn't a lack of confidence that was shutting the conversation down, it was an abundance of apathy. There is something so miserable about a person who chooses to be unhappy and/or unimpressed by the world. 

One of my dates had been in the marching/pep band for one of the best college football teams in the country, and had JUST come back from a 3-week trip to Europe. I'm a traveler, and I played in band in high school, so I thought we'd have plenty to talk about. The conversation played like this: 

""Oh, so tell me about traveling for the band!"" 
""I mean, it was fine, I guess. It was a pain to have to get up so early in the morning and sometimes the hotels were pretty crappy""

""So did you get a chance to go to the such-and-such monument when you were in Vienna? (the date was awhile ago, my brain is fuzzy). 
""Yeah, it was a super cold day and there were crowds everywhere. It was really annoying."" 

45 minutes in we were stuck talking about the weather. There wasn't a second date. 

Now, I'm a person who appreciates black humor, and who is plenty sarcastic; I'm not sitting here wanting everyone to sit in a field of flowers feeding a flock of birds. But I think the world today, and especially internet culture, wants us to be unduly cynical, and in my experience, apathy looks terrible on everyone. We shouldn't be so afraid to be excited about things!

That's my fear for you, as both a 23-year-old male in this culture and as someone who's experiencing rejection. You have plenty of reason to be disappointed; that's fine. But just try not to let that control your life, or your dating. Excitement and passion about things you care about comes across as confident. Even if you don't have total confidence in yourself, having confidence in your decisions, taste, and experiences is a huge step.

If you think online dating's a viable option for you, I could pull together some of my tips on what makes a good online dater (quickly - convey excitement and interest in the things that excite and interest you! Don't waste too much time with people who you'll have to convince about key aspects of your life and/or personality (there's a baseline of what makes you ""you"" and that shit's not going away. No matter how cute the girl is, she's not worth sacrificing that). Write individualized messages based on the profiles you're reading - it takes more time, but we can tell when you're copy/pasting). 

Anyway, this is getting long, and it's a new year. So, with a lack of a better closer, I sincerely wish all the best to you in your endeavors!

I do not agree that segregation is the optimum word, however I understand and agree with the immigration suggestions.

The reason I believe is because of the obvious large influx of immigration to Europe (I live in Poland, which has similar issues to Western Europe but on a much smaller scale).    Voluntary Segregation, such as people from one culture all living together in one area, leads them to not accepting or adapting to the culture of the area they've moved into.  This leads to the natives not liking these different people and sometimes hating them outright.  It also works in the other fashion, with these small (and sometimes large) groups pushing the native culture out and implanting their own to the detriment of everyone.  Even hating the natives for not accepting the culture they've supplanted from their original countries

I believe this is wrong of the immigrates to do.  They chose to move to the new countries and should adapt to what is here, not supplanting what they left behind.

Data on this specific issue  provides at best a contradictory picture.  US vs Mexico as an example.  Vastly differing gun laws, firearms access, and huge differences in number of firearms in public hands with what some would consider results not in line with ""common sense.""  Another fact present is that at present no data exists that there is a direct positive correlation between firearm presence or proliferation with societal safety.  I did not say there is no link, I said there is no data to support the assertion that there is a positive link.

One thing I'd really like to see is a study that removes crime statistic data from the US locals with restrictive firearm laws and\or non-existent privately owned firearms.  Places like LA, New York, Baltimore, Chicago and see what that removal does for the rest of the nation as a whole.  Just how far would crime, murder rates and even firearms related crime change?  Would it change enough to be a significant set of data to research further?  My suspicion (based on current data on these places) is that the ""new national"" data would reflect a significant drop in crime, which I think is relevant to this specific issue at hand nationally, as it would move the country closer to the European numbers that the US is generally compared against.     

This is an emotionally charged issue and unfortunately those not only within society but those within the government are advocating for emotionally charged solutions on a subject they have very little factual knowledge on.  Gross mistakes on the workings of firearms, current legalities, myths surrounding abilities of firearms, and the application of emotional intent onto inanimate objects abounds and keeps real data from being considered.  Reactions on the opposing side are based on paranoia (well founded in some instances) over personal safety, personal liberty and freedoms and a fear of an ever increasing involvement by the government in their daily lives.

The only thing I take issue with is how they don't explain how Thor gets to Earth but him using the Tesseract to return to Asgard gives you an idea and anyway it's not important. The movie is smart enough to let you figure things out for yourself-- who is the World Security Council? Well, I guess they secure the world-- and instead focuses on excellent dialogue and comic book action. And Whedon wove *so many* comic book elements into the movie and he did it so smoothly that I can't help but be awestruck every time I watch it. The short list includes: Hawkeye was originally a bad guy, and here he more or less starts the movie by working for Loki; Thor fights both Iron Man and the Hulk in two scenes that fit seamlessly into the narrative, thus *more than* meeting that classic requirement that two heroes, when meeting for the first time, must fight; the god damn Helicarrier. In any other asshole's greasy mitts, those elements would have been forced into the script as obvious and out-of-place fan service, but Whedon knows the form so well-- and respects his audience enough-- that he and Zak Penn took the time to make everything work together like a watch. Shots like Iron Man shooting his unibeam into Captain America's shield; Captain America and Thor reaching out to catch their thrown weapons at the same time; Hulk trying to pick up Mjolnir; these are all things I honestly never thought we'd get to see in a movie. I mean, honestly, set yourself back a year. Could you have *imagined?*  

When someone like eastern_european_guy decides to shit on The Avengers because it's easy and it makes you look like you're *really* different from all the nckbeard rabble, ignore him because the movie wasn't made for non-nerds who only half-watched two of the prequels. The Avengers was made for comic book readers who enjoy spectacle and, even more than that, dearly love the idea that while Tony Stark was trapped in a cave working on the first Iron Man suit, Steve Rogers' frozen body-- perfectly preserved from *World War II*-- was mere months away from being discovered by explorers. People who love the idea that while Bruce Banner was trying to find a way to create the next American super soldier, Clint Barton was recruiting Natasha Romanoff to SHIELD, probably to the protests of Phil Coulson. Meanwhile, the Stranger and fucking *Thanos* were concocting new ways to add more systems to their empire. For example: who to lead the assault on Earth? Wouldn't it be great if an answer just fell into their laps? If only. *That's* why The Avengers is a great movie. The Avengers pays off on all of those promises and more. It's smart, it's funny, and it rewards losers like me who literally watched a nine-hour cut of the previous five movies (I watched it in chunks) before it came out.

Far and away the most noticeable things about this county are the diversity in geography and the expansive road and highway system which, as someone said before, make for the best road-tripping I have ever experienced. 

We also have a fantastic selection of beer. Sure the major American brands (budweiser, et al) are not very lust worthy and we certainly aren't the Belgians in terms of beer pioneering, but the trend of microbrewered beer has exploded in the last 20 years in this country meaning hundreds of varieties of delicious beers with so much depth are only a trip to the liquor store away.

It is also my opinion that we do have the best music. Americans invented jazz, blues, hip-hop. Rock and roll, and hardcore punk. Fortunately nickleback is Canadian so we can't be blamed for that.

As has been said we've been pioneers in numerous technological fields such as the space program and the Internet, the manhattan project, the human genome project, and more.

As for the food, I'm not sure so sure.

More importantly, though, I think pro-Israel people shoot themselves in the foot by framing the debate this way because it naturally brings discussions to issues on which Israel looks the weakest rather than those where it has more tangible moral high ground.**

What you're saying isn't quite accurate. The notion of ""Palestine"" doesn't carry an ounce of religious distinction, and throughout the region's history it has been diversely populated. There were more Jews in Palestine than anywhere else, but the idea of Israel ""beloning"" to the Jews in the same way we think of Scotland as beloning to the Scots is fictional. Ancient Hebrew-speaking kingdoms in Palestine aren't really any more pertinent to the debate than any of the countless non-Hebrew-speaking kingdoms that have also sprouted up there over the centuries. 

Much of the regional discontent in Palestine during the early stages of Zionism (pre-Balfour Declaration) had less to do with settlers being Jewish than being European. Anti-Zionism began, and in most ways still is, an Arab movement rather than a Muslim one. Arab Jews weren't too pleased with Europeans taking their land either.

The Palestinian Charter specifically includes Arab Jews as among the ""Palestinians"" for which the PLO advocates. Yasir Arafat's wife was a Christian. Michel Aflaq, the co-founder of the Ba'ath Party in Syria, was an Orthodox Christian. Of course there are dozens of groups under the flag of Palestinian liberation, but the ideology of the PLO doesn't frame this as a religious issue. 

This post might come of as a bit rant-ish, but seeing the issue framed this way is particularly irksome to me because it takes attention off Israel's actual points of moral high ground and instead focuses on the esoteric aspects of the debate that the PLO and Israel will *never* see eye-to-eye on. Israel treats Palestinian refugees much better than other Arab countries do and (despite Netanyahu's obsession with the idea of a Jewish State) has a secular and forward-thinking culture in most regards. These sort of considerations are less important when people boil down the debate to ""who has the right to the land."" Then, the only important issues become settlements and walls - the very issues that Israel looks the worst on.

And I don't necessarily mean just picking champs that are good in teamfights or synergize or whatever -- I mean understanding what your comp is good at and isn't, and what their comp is good at and isn't, and hence the kind of global decisions your team should make.

For example, if your team has good poke but weaker 5v5 teamfight than theirs, just avoid teamfighting, period. Split push all day, make sure you can kite them if they try to force an initiate (with champ choice, Shurelya's, etc). Understand that they will try to force baron to make you teamfight, where they will have the upper hand, and think about how to turn it against them without playing right into their hands (e.g. poke them with 4 as they try to baron while 1 splits and threatens to take inhib)

Know if you want to prolong laning for as long as possible, or force it to stop asap. Understand the effects of having a numerical advantage somewhere in the map, both in its strengths, so you can take advantage of it and get free objectives, and weaknesses, so you can trade objectives and come out even, or even ahead, when the opponent tries it on you. Always be aware of how the power balance looks throughout the game for both teams (how good each is early/mid/late), but being mindful of the factors that generate the strengths (it doesn't matter if their ult combo is very strong if one of the ults is down, Vayne may give their team the edge late but it's irrelevant if she's farming bot while you fight at Baron or you catch her out and instagib her, etc)

""Despite its high toxicity, Scheele's Green was also used as a food dye for sweets such as green blancmange, a fondness of traders in 19th century Greenock, leading to a long-standing Scottish prejudice against green sweets. The presence of Scheele's Green as a colorant in absinthe is now thought to be the source of the problems with the liquor that led to its banishment in most European countries and the US by 1915.""

And it's still worse than DotA or\and Smash Brothers. Most heroes are unbalanced, some nerfed to hell and useless, some are blatantly overpowered. I spent enough time in this game to predict how match will end. 

Matchmaking is utterly horrible, you can't look for games in lobby, you either invite friends or hope for matchmaking to send you in a fair game. Unfortunately you are more likely to join empty game or already lost one where enemy team pushed too far already, gg, rank down, fuck your stats. People who join in game progressively later gain unfair advantage in levels since they replace a bot maintaining his level (bots level up automatically for some mysterious reason). 

Netcode is crap, i often join a game and would have ping above 150-200 as well as other people even if host is pretty close to me. This shouldn't happen even if host is on west coast of NA, i live on edge between europe and asia and get something around 90 on american servers. 

When they add a new hero it's usually doesn't get balanced in weeks, with exception of recent TB inspired character that could've instakill you easily before hotfix.

Farsi has a very interesting construction as well. Originally, the present stem had an aorist aspect to it. For example, ""konam"" could mean ""i do"" or ""i am doing."" The continuous marker hami- was thus employed to indicate a difference between, ""konam,"" ""i do"" and ""hamikonam"", ""i am doing."" Hami- was truncated to the current marker mi-, which still retains its concept of continuousness in the imperfect, cf. ""kardam,"" ""i did"" versus ""mikardam,"" ""i was doing."" The mi- marker now could mean ""i do"" or ""i am doing."" The aorist conjugation, sans mi- marker, is seen as archaic and best reserved for proverbs. To resolve the difference, colloquial Persian employs the verb ""dashtan"" (to have) to imply present continuous, as in ""daram mikonam"" ""i am doing.""

So I was at a local bar nearby my house the other night, just enjoying a craft beer and having a chat with the bartender about some of the finer points of various microbrews, when a rather attractive-looking brunette female specimen sauntered up to the bar next to me to order a drink - an appletini. Now I had a good opportunity to strike up a conversation with this strapping young lady, but she was clearly the type who thought she was hot shit, so I figured I would start off the conversation with a subtle neg.

""An appletini? Really? Have you ever even tried a microbrew?"" I said with a charming grin. She looked at me for a second, then asked me what a microbrew was. How adorable. ""Microbrews are a type of specialty craft beer typically found across Europe,"" I explained patiently. She replied rather shortly that she didn't like beer. ""I'm not surprised that you say that, if all you've ever had is the cheap watered-down American swill that most of the patrons of this bar are drinking,"" I said, gesturing around at the rest of the bar. She rolled her eyes and began looking around the bar as well, clearly just as bemused as I was by the swag-monkeys in the bar sucking down their Miller Lites.

After a few more minutes of playful banter, this little brunette minx finally just came right out and told me her intentions. ""Look,"" she said, ""that's my ex-boyfriend over there. You're a little weird but I kind of just want to make him jealous right now, plus I'm rolling on molly and horny as fuck. Do you wanna get out of here?"" Well, who am I to turn down such a proposition? I escorted her out to my Prius and, on the drive back to my place, explained to her my perspective on drug legalization. While I generally stick with marijuana and do not personally approve of MDMA (or ""molly"" as she had called it) I am in favor of legalization of all drugs as I believe the government should not have a say in what people do with their own bodies.

Fast-forward to fifteen minutes later, we are in my bed and about to do the dirty deed. Right as I am about to achieve penetration, she stops me and says, ""Not there. I'm Catholic, I don't believe in pre-marital sex... you can do me in the butt though."" She gave me a little smile, which quickly faded when she saw my face start to turn red with anger.

""You... don't believe in pre-marital sex, because you think some make-believe SKY WIZARD forbids it?!""

""Look, it's just what I believe. I can suck you if you want too, just not in my vajayjay..."" At this point the illogical nonsense she was spewing combined with her use of the word ""vajayjay"" had me fuming.

""You think you will remain some pure and virginal angel JUST BECAUSE YOU TAKE COCK IN EVERY HOLE BUT THE MAGICAL ONE?! YOU REALLY THINK YOUR FICTIONAL FAIRY-DEITY CARES ABOUT THE EXACT MECHANICS OF HOW YOU WHORE OUT YOUR WORTHLESS BODY, YOU FUNDIE CUNT?!""

At this point she was in tears, undoubtedly overwhelmed by the onslaught of logic and reason with which I was violating her tiny brain. She begged me to please just let her leave, and she would find her own way home. I agreed that it was definitely time for her to take her leave. (I would've offered her a ride home but I don't normally allow known supporters of an oppressive fundamentalist status quo to ride in my Prius.)

I spent the rest of the night lighting up a bowl and watching some porn to satisfy my needs. I might not have gotten laid that night, but I still went to bed with a feeling of accomplishment.

Everyone rags on the Middle East actions, but it is quite relevant to EU energy security. The Cold War was basically won by strong military in the ME allowing regimes there to keep gas prices low. This ended up bankrupting the Soviet Union and making them much less influential in Europe. 

Don't think for a second that without a force willing an able to keep favorable people in power that promoted cheap energy exports that soviet supplied dissident groups wouldn't have waged war there and set their production back decades. All while keeping gas prices high enough for the ussr to dictate whatever terms it wanted to European nations.

See, after the World Wars, Europe was so obliterated that their economic and military power was significantly drained, so much so, that Russia or the United States could've seemingly walked over Europe and taken it. Germany was in absolute ruin, Italy was struggling to survive with the heavy fines forced to be paid, France had lost quarter of a million soldiers. There was barely a European force in any kind of fighting shape. Enter: The United States, and to an extent, the Soviet Union. Two massive industrial powerhouses with a strong military presence in throughout the subcontinent. To this day, the US military has nearly 100,000 soldier in Europe. 

The main reasoning for their being no more in fighting, in my opinion, is that if the European powers had not aligned together, at least economically, they would've been torn apart. Also, most of their militaries are small and do not have the logistical capability to wage wide scale war without intervention from the United States. Look at Libya for example, a European operation that required wide-scale American assistance. Without the US's military capabilities, there is no war between European states post-World War 2.

I am not particularly well read in this aspect of American history, but according to this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States#Exporting_democracy) we've been interventionists since a whopping two years before WWI. Can you give me some examples of the US being an interventionist force a significant amount of time prior to WWI?

We were interventionists since the Spanish-American War. We intervened, interfered, and became the new ""imperial"" masters of former Spanish possessions in the Philippines and the Caribbean. While we never owned Cuba, it was our backyard prior to Castro. Many of the Marine Corps' heroes were forged in the crucible of Central American and Caribbean Warfare, as well as engagements like the trade activities leading up to the Boxer Rebellion in China.

&gt; Needless to say, the US is without a doubt not the soul souperpower of the world.

Actually, it is. There used to be a second, but it collapsed under its own weight. China and several other states make up an opposing force but they still don't possess the commercial or military power to present a credible alternative. They aren't anywhere near as powerful as the 19th century European powers or the USSR of old.

What matters is not the size of a country--pure population is actual a very poor guide to size and power of military, What matters in political organization. The population that Rome could draw for in the Second Punic War, for example, was undoubtedly less than what late Medieval France had access to. And yet Republican Rome could raise armies vastly in excess of anything seen in the Medieval period, keep them in the field for longer, send them on further expedition, and equip them better. At Poitier, John II brought together at most about 10,000 men, and the entire First Crusade brought together about 30,000. At Cannae, on the other hand, Rome fielded almost 80,000 soldiers after two brutal defeats, and even after their annihilation it could raise and equipped more armies on two different theaters (Italy and Spain). After eighteen years of war it was able to send a force of perhaps 40,000 to North Africa.

When I was a kid I loved playing sport for the same reason all kids love sports, they're fun to play, and over time this caused a great competitive streak in me that I've never shifted (nor would I want to).

It's worth pointing out that my main sport was football (soccer, if you're American), and my Uncle started taking me to see out local team, Manchester United FC. I loved watching them play when I was younger and soon became obsessed with the club and the players who were heroes of mine. It was kinda my thing when I was young, I was that one really competitive kid who loved this football club and everything about it.

When you invest so many thousands of hours into something you care massively about it becomes part of your everyday life, I clung onto any news coming out of the club, every game (be it first team, reserves or under-18s). I basically morphed into a die-hard fan over the years as the club became a huge part of who I am.

Like I said before, sports gave me a huge competitive streak. So, naturally, when I watch my beloved United I get so caught up in it because I want us to win everything: every tackle, every loose ball, every game, every trophy. The club has made me the happiest I've ever been when we won the European Cup on '08 and it's made me break down into tears and make me the saddest I've ever been when we were pipped to the title last year in the last minute of the season by our closest neighbours and rivals.

From an outside view, it may seem ""strange"" and ""pathetic"", but let me tell you: when you've been granted the amount of happiness, sadness, joy and despair by a sports team then it ceases to be just a sports team, it's truly a way of life and I would have it no other way.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, it also affects my moods for days at a time. I'm really crappy when we lose, but when we win, I'm the happiest person in the world.

We're just taking the more 'official' route to the US. The reason the European shops can do what they do, is because they aren't manufacturers - so they have nothing to lose. What they don't tell each customer is that they can be liable to a $2,500 fine from the CBP (same fine for importing a Kinder Egg, which is an insanely popular candy in Europe!). Kinda surprised they label the package like that. 

The CBP can't go after the shops, because they are 're-sellers'. Technically, our [European Distributors](http://www.theyfit.co.uk/pages/european-distributors) for TheyFit could do the same, except we make them sign contracts where they agree not to. Maybe I'll test the theory out though, who knows if they are behaving :-D

Index funds are pretty straight forward. The brokerage takes a sampling of stocks from every industry, and every size company, sticks it in one fund and calls it an index fund. Then you buy shares of the fund, rather than the stocks in it. The value of the fund goes up or down based on the sum of the stocks in it.

A whole-market index fund tries to sample as much of the entire stock market as possible (obviously they don't actually get every individual stock, but they get a lot). So this kind of index fund goes up and down with the stock market as a whole. You can find a list of the individual stocks the fund holds through the brokerage.

There are also smaller index funds. ""Large Cap"" indexes focus on large corporations. ""Small cap"" focus on small companies and ""Medium"" or ""Mid Cap"" focus somewhere in between. Large companies tend to be more secure, but less likely to grow. Apple may do well, but it's unlikely to double in size. The value will grow slower and steadier, and dividends will be more regular. Small companies are more volatile and more likely to go out of business, but can just as easily double or triple in value in a short period, doubling or tripling your investment along with it. Companies of any size can go out of business though. In this way you can adjust your risk - increasing risk and potential reward by switching to smaller company focus, or decreasing risk by switching to a large cap index. Either way you still have the advantage of not losing all your money from any one company going out of business.

You can have industry funds also, that focus on one type of business and seek to hold shares in a broad array of companies in that industry. This may be a good choice if you know that industry well, and you have reason to believe it will perform well.

There are also funds dedicated to foreign market investments. You can buy funds invested in West European market indexes (about as safe as the US), developing country indexes (higher risk, but higher potential gain also), East Asian indexes and so on.

Funds are really flexible, so skimming through the list of funds a brokerage sells can give you a better idea, and you can look into any that seem interesting to see what they're actually investing in.

Brokerages have a lot of information they have to provide. Before investing in any fund, review the prospectus and look at what the fund actually holds. Always review the fees - you can usually expect some kind of annual account maintenance fee, and there may be ""loads"" - fees for buying and selling shares of the fund. You can get no-load funds and you should stick with those unless you have good reason to choose something else.",False,t5_2rjo5,1,1357074888,1430826556,0,1,,c7pclof,t1_c7pclof,

I'm from a third world country in Eastern Europe and am on Reddit discussing what I do on a foreign language that I speak fluently. As a matter of fact, I didn't fall into any crowd. I don't really have a lot of friends. Maybe that's the reason I got into graffiti.

It all started around 6-7 years ago, when a cousin of mine came over to play some PC games (PCs were really rare and expensive in my country back then, and he didn't have one). He showed me a graffiti sketch he did earlier that day. It said 'RAP'. I was astonished and wanted to be able to do such a thing myself. I tried doing the same 'RAP' sketch, but I didn't really make it as good. Possibly because he is 4 years older than me, thus meaning he was a lot better at drawing than me at the time. After trying to copy his 'RAP' sketches, I shelved graffiti for a couple of years. I didn't find it interesting anymore. Then, a few years later, I really wanted to do more of it and bought some spray cans. After the first wall piece I did, I was hooked.

A lot of other graffiti artists influenced my work, especially in my early days. Since there are not many writers in my area (Well, there are a lot of them in the capital, but not in my town), I had to rely on the internet to provide me with inspiration. Nowadays, I'm only influenced by the will to paint more.

The Thalmor already have power of Valenwood, Elsweyr, and they already have some power in Cyrodiil, the Empire is like their ""bitch"" at the moment.
&gt; Yes, Skyrim is relatively weak but so is Morrowind and the Thalmor hasn't bothered there.

There's not much to be gained by attacking Morrowind and really there's no benefits of having Morrowind.
&gt;To invade from the East, the Thalmor would need to go through Morrowind which is most likely also hostile territory and even further away from Dominion territory.

East from Cyrodiil, I apologize for not being clearer.
&gt; You can't send an army into a country without them noticing. It's impossible, especially considering the distance between Skyrim and Elsweyr (the closest Dominion territory).

Cyrodiil will definitely notice, whether they do anything about it or not is debatable in my mind. Skyrim will only know that the Dominion has come when they are right on their doorstep, Skyrim won't be able to group up men that quick to defend Riften from attack (using Riften as an example). I don't see why Skyrim would notice the Aldmeri Dominion coming?

&gt;Wounded or dead? I don't think so. Once the Stormcloaks take Solitude their casualties drop immediately and there'll probably be an influx of new recruits and in the off chance that war does start then even ex-Legionnaires would join up to fight the Dominion.

It seems to me that majority of young Nord men and even women are either already apart of the Imperials or Stormcloaks or are about to join. Point is, is that Skyrim has just had an internal war and people have died from that war, number of people is debatable although its a big enough internal rebellion to have a high number of casualties

&gt;The Dominion had experience fighting Nords in Cyrodiil but not in Skyrim. No Mer army has touched Skyrim since the First Era.

And Skyrim hasn't won any wars in the past 500 years, but the Thalmor have beaten Skyrim and Cyrodiil soldiers, and have been able to beat Valenwood to submission.

&gt; I still want to know why the Dominion would attack Skyrim over Morrowind or Hammerfell or the Empire which are just as weak.

I explained Morrowind above, as for Hammerfell, they proved to be too difficult. Need to take into account that the Dominion was also fighting off Skyrim and Cyrodiil at the same time, Hammerfell is weak from internal conflict over the years but they won't be as weak as Skyrim. As for taking over the Empire, they already have the White-Gold Concordat. That's enough for the Thalmor at the time being.

South Africa's Zuma. He's a prick.

&gt; Israel is a few years behind most Western voters. They haven't revolted in new radical movements because the economy kept growing. Right now, the most common emotion regarding politics in Israel is despair.

&gt; The citizens don't believe it's possible to act in their rational self-interest. Go for a two-state solution, and both Hamas and Fatah will stab them in the front and back (just go look at the speeches Fatah officials gave at the UN). Annex Area C and withdraw from the rest, and the international community will stab Israel in the front and back. Unilaterally withdraw and cut off Israeli sponsorship of Fatah, and Hamas will take over the West Bank and attack Israel.

&gt; Israelis feel cornered between a two-faced ""partner"", a fascist enemy, and an international community that openly favors the other side. Ironically, it is behaving like a shit-headed little bully precisely because it feels completely friendless.

This is partly a self made problem. For the longest time, Israel had the unflinching, unquestionable support of the vast majority of European nations and both of America's political parties.

I would say it goes further than despair; it's self-destructiveness. Most of the world votes to upgrade Palestine, and even longtime allies either vote against Israel or abstain. After the vote, does Israel get the wake-up call? No, it annexes more of East Jerusalem. It doesn't have to, since an international intervention isn't going to threaten its territory. It just chooses to give the UN, including its allies, the middle finger and piss off the Palestinians even more, at the same time making the two-state solution (the positions it officially supports) even more difficult.

How do you negotiate with this? With a state that can no longer even pursue policies that benefit it?

&gt; I agree about Fatah. Problem is, the majority of Palestinians view Fatah as collaborators. The whole notion of a two-state solution in which Israel remains a Jewish state is, for most Palestinians, an unacceptable legitimization of the Zionist project. As far as they're concerned, if the Jews are entitled to Tel-Aviv then the Jews are also entitled to Jerusalem. Therefore the Jews must not be allowed Tel-Aviv or even West Jerusalem, let alone allowed to continue their conspiracy to spread false archaeological theories that Judaize the holy city of al-Quds.
(Most Arabs don't use the original long version: al-Quds al-Yahoud, ""the holy place of the Jew"".)

You're not wrong, and maybe it's wishful thinking to believe that Fatah can deliver the consent of its citizens, but when Fatah says it *may* give up the right of return, or East Jerusalem, it should be showered with praise, resources and money.

Give Fatah everything it wants and continue meaningful negotiations there, and kill the shit out of Hamas when it gets uppity; should be the strategy. Instead it's become collectively punish everyone in Gaza, and undermine Fatah whenever it's funny.",False,t5_2qh13,-1,1357076136,1430826722,0,-1,,c7pcy9b,t1_c7pcy9b,

(Note: this is a particularly European assumption, Indian schools of philosophy do not necessarily hold a metaphysical ground is necessary for ethical behavior). Metaphysics can motivate ethics. If I believe in Plato's Realm of the Forms, and truly believe the highest form is ""The Good"" I would be conceivably be motivated to attain ""The Good"" as in the Allegory of the Cave. (I realize this is an elementary reading and not necessarily the most accurate, but it was a rough and ready example. It's New Years, I'm hungover, bear with me). In the same way as Plato's system, other metaphysical beliefs can incentivize ethical behavior. The same goes with philosophy of language, I am a relative novice in the field, but knowing the power of language will certainly motivate me to behave more ethically in my use of it, and become more sensitive to the other in my use of language. 

That leaves the question, is ethics the main motivation for doing philosophy? You will have to answer that for yourself, but it looks to be a pretty good one to me. Think of the central questions of philosophy, ""What is the Good Life,"" ""What does it mean to Be?"", heck, one of the oldest questions in philosophy is ""How does one live virtuously?"" The cliche description of philosophy I always give to people when they ask ""what is philosophy?"" is the transliteration from the greek--love of wisdom. It is interesting that love is literally embedded in philosophy. It seems that ""doing"" should be the ultimate telos of philosophy if it is to have one.

All of this happened with those ""horrible"" groups of whites in charge.

Since their fall from power and the dwindling of the white race around the world, the world itself has fallen into chaos and disarray.  Africa, ever since overthrowing apartheid, has spent its time infighting and cannibalizing what was created.  Europe, now overrun with socialists and arabs, has been rapidly falling into a pit of debt and social chaos which it will never escape.

The USA has seen the rise of the entitlement culture that is enslaving our youth to the idea that it's the government's job to take care of them as they are indoctrinated by teacher unions.  Welfare culture is almost the norm now.  Independent thought is harshly demonized and rejected, while we are told we must accept everyone's every little quirk and sickness as ""normal"", leading to an unhealthy culture that is steeped in drug abuse, obesity, sexually deviant behavior, and a laundry list of other issues we face now not as ""minor issues"" but as systemic corruption within our society.  This is the result of ""critical theory"", ""cultural marxism"", ""multiculturalism"", ""diversity"", and ""egalitarianism.""  All of which we have been subjected to our entire lives.  The Great Lie of the Frankfurt school has plagued us for too long.

What happens when whites glimmer away? Liberty and freedom go with us, and so, too, goes society.  We are not destined to all be the same color.  Once whites are extinct, the muds will ethnically cleanse each other.  Look at Africa, where north Sudanese ethnically cleanse south Sudanese for being blacker than them.  Or Hutus slaughtering Tutsis for not being black enough.  All nonwhite races hate each other and us.

why would it get involved in a war in the collapsing eastern block? they neither had the legitimacy to intervene, nor the interest in doing so, nor was it safe at that moment to get involved in what might have russian interests on one of the sides?

bah, more like the cavalry that came in after the thing was done anyhow. after the operation storm, the army crossed the border and the serbs were losing territory in BiH as well. So suddenly negotiations were possible. imagine that...

I don't really see why europe would give a shit about genocide outside its borders, when there is no will in the UN to do anything. And I def think they generally shouldn't do a damned thing in such cases, since tolerating such breaches of international law only leaves the doors open for it also committing outright aggression, like what the coalition of the willing did in say Iraq.

,PoliticalDiscussion,,True,t3_15s1px,False,t3_15s1px,[deleted],0,0,"As an Irish person, living in a country whose Government hands out extremely generous social welfare, I'll share my perspective on the matter:

Here in Ireland, we have a welfare system that will give an unemployed person:

* €825 per month towards their rent
* €200 per week in cash
* €130 per month per child they have
* A fuel allowance
* A transport allowance
* A medical card, entitling them to free medical care and ultra cheap drug prescriptions

Not only that, we now offer the unemployed free entry into college courses of their choosing. Each student in Ireland currently pays €2250 in fees, regardless of the course or college they're in, so an unemployed person who chooses to do a 4 year degree will get (at current rates) an equivalent of €9k. We also provide every child in the state with free primary and secondary level education.

It doesn't stop there though, every housing area in the country is now obliged to provide ""social housing"" for the unemployed. This means we have a situation whereby Person X can be out working every day, paying their tax and budgeting to afford the mortgage for the house they live in, while Person Y next door to them gets the house for free indefinitely and heaps of cash benefits on top of it. 

To help cover the costs of these unbelievably generous benefits, those earning €35k or more per year pay an effective tax rate of 55%. 

As someone who lives in a country that offers all of this, and charges its taxpayers the rate it does, I *abhor* it. 

What it has done is provide an incentive for those who aren't bothered doing anything with their life to never work and in exchange they receive the aforementioned benefits...*indefinitely*. We have provided the not bothered with an alternative, a cushy life on the pocket of the taxpayer, and those who end up unemployed with an incentive to stay unemployed as the welfare they receive will be more generous than what they can get for themselves on a minimum wage job.

It has allowed EU nationals to come into Ireland, sign up for these benefits and then go home. The Irish tax payer, to put it bluntly, is being taken for a ride.

Now, I'm not going to sit here and say that nothing should be provided for those who fall on hard times, of course not. However, once you start providing these things, those receiving it start demanding *more* and *more*. Then, if the welfare programs are scaled back **at all**, these people are the first to hit the streets protesting. They show absolutely **ZERO** appreciation for what the taxpayer and the government provide here, and instead of being willing to scale back the luxurious welfare they receive, are calling for higher taxes on the employed and especially on high earners (€100k+ p/a) who already pay 71% of the tax in the country.

We now need to bring in facial recognition technology and special ID for those receiving welfare, to be implemented this year, due to the sheer level of fraud the system is suffering from. Until you live in a system where there is a massive issue with free riders, it's very hard to comment on it theoretically.

So as someone who lives with a very, very generous welfare system, what programs do I believe in? I believe in free access to education and basic healthcare for all. I believe we should aid those who have fallen on hard times, and provide them with somewhere to live and food to eat and we should provide them with the support in their search for employment. 

What I do not believe is in the current system that we here in Ireland have. It provides a massive incentive for the lazy, and career criminals, and removes the incentive to seek gainful employment from the unfortunate. I do not believe that the unemployed should be treated the same as contributing members of society because they are not.

How should we deal with free riders? I believe we should have diminishing benefits, based on length of time on welfare, going from a decent house in a decent area with a decent amount of cash for food/other expenses every month, to being put into shared accommodation in the middle of nowhere and given food and travel vouchers to get them by. 

**TL;DR** I live in an extremely generous welfare state which provides an incentive to the lazy to never work, and removes the incentive from the unfortunate to seek gainful employment. The system faces widespread fraud and has become almost completely irreducible due to the voting power the mass numbers of unemployed now hold. The huge taxes taken to cover the system and the attitude of those receiving the benefits is driving a massive gap in society, promoting a ""them and us"" culture.

Caligula was raised how he ruled, sick, twisted, cruel, violent, deadly and bloody. But you have to remember that he was human and was simply responding to what he was taught by seeing others do it. He was a human and he cried when his father was killed, missed his mother, found comfort in his sisters, liked certain foods, got colds and found some people simply intolerable. He was a man of many different shades of grey. There is no way of knowing if he was insane or not, we weren't there so it isn't fair to call him crazy. He was simply an abused little boy who grew in a bitter man who wanted others to suffer like he did.

Onto the story and examples:
----

He wasn't 'crazy' exactly, just extreme in odd and violent ways and had a very twisted upbringing.


His grand uncle had possibly killed his father via poisoning, Caligula would have been watching his father getting weaker and sicker and possibly in the room while his father took his last breaths. I forget whether his mother was killed or banished at the moment but Caligula was taken to his grandmother's house and raised in the hustle and bustle of the court until he was fifteen/sixteen and he was put on Tiberius' private island. Though there is still debate and it'll probably never be proven who did it as Caligula's father certainly had many enemies but Tiberius is considered most likely.



The island was carnal hell on Earth. Naked children, male and female, ran through the gardens for the enjoyment of perverted old men, orgies every night, feasts where people could gorge themselves, rape and sex everywhere, and people were killed for entertainment. There are stories of men, women and children jumping to their deaths off the steep cliffs to avoid the torture, rape and general nastiness of what awaited them. Tiberius eventually had guards sit in boats around the island to clean up bodies / save whoever could be saved and bring them back up to the island for twice the amount of torture.



Caligula had already witnessed his family killed or banished and suddenly he was placed right under the man who had possibly done it, he had to engage in exactly what the twisted man did to make sure he wasn't murdered. He must have lived in terror every day. Eventually, Caligula was made heir to the Roman Empire, not because he deserved it nor that he would a good ruler, but because Tiberius resent Rome and it's people for hating him and looking down on him and he wanted to punish them by creating someone exactly like him to rule. Not only did he succeed, he out did himself. Caligula was as twisted as someone could be growing up on that island and twice so with his mother having made him think himself a god. 



When Tiberius looked like he was going to die, Caligula proclaimed himself Emperor and took off Tiberius' ring and put it on himself. When Tiberius woke up suddenly and demanded to be given dinner, someone, there's debate on whether or not it was a member of the Praetorian Guard or Caligula himself, smothered him with his own pillow.



The sex with sister's is a by product of all of them being fucked up and having no other family but if I've learned anything from Reddit it's that incest is more common than I thought. The prisoners were either a political statement designed to put fear into citizens to prevent uprisings or for gladiator games but more on gladiator games later.



There's also a story of how he built a bridge of boats and rode his horse and chariot across it. This is true. Ish. The noble people of Rome were starting to make a fuss so he put them in their place. He built one part of the bridge smack dab in the middle of where the nobles vacationed during summer (think Martha's Vineyard or Cape Cod) and extended it several miles to a poor port town across the bay and rode not only his horse and chariot but his army as well. This took two days for the entire party to cross to the port and come back with anyone who wanted to join. 



Just imagine how the nobles felt when their peaceful little town was suddenly destroyed by not only the Emperor but also with the extremely drunk and rowdy army and any people from the port who wanted to join in on the free booze and fighting.


The second reason he did this was to prove a prophetess wrong. When he was younger and about to become Emperor, an old prophetess had told him he would become Emperor when he rode a horse across water.



Back to the gladiator games and how he fucked them up. He had learned blood thirst from Tiberius and he used it. He once threw an entire section of the audience (front row, they were important people) to lions because he was bored between shows. After he got bored with how 'tame' the brutal fights to the death were, he order all of them be drawn out longer and to make them bloody, for example, if a fighter was on the ground and could be killed with a slit throat, you now had to slice him on the arm or shoulder, not killing blows but enough to draw a shit ton of blood and let the guy somewhat get away.


The games were so Romans could see some blood and gore but mostly death and Caligula took it away from them. It was like Mitt Romney changing the rules of football.


He also extended his palace to the sacred temple of Romulus and Remus, believing himself to be a greater god and being than those who were said to have discovered Rome. Nowadays it would be like someone building on top of the Vatican.


There's also the story of how he made his soldiers collect seashells after he failed to march on Britain. The Rhine was considered the end of the world to most and when they reached it, the soldiers refused to go onward, a move of mutiny. Generally, the punishment for this in Rome would have been to kill every third or fourth member of the legion but Caligula recognized he was on thin ice and killing battle hardened veterans would have been the final straw so instead, he ordered them to collect seashells, something considered feminine, in a 'war against Neptune' to humiliate and demean them, basically punishing them and making them look foolish.



Eventually he was murdered by his own Praetorian Guard in the tunnels to go to the palace, in such away that Caligula would have been happy to witness in ways of bloodshed. The one who murdered him was actually a guard he made fun of a lot in front of everyone for his feminine and soft voice and for having his genitals permanently mutilated during a battle.


There are many reasons as to why Caligula was the way he was, his upbringing played a major part, he didn't learn that raping other men's wives during dinner and then bragging about it and demanded they (the woman) grade his performance wan't okay. He also had a lot of sex and drank a lot, even by Roman standards. There was a possibility he had caught an STD that caused key parts of brain to malfunction (I could have sworn a strain of herpes caused it, people said Syphilis but that was brought over to Europe by the dirty birdy Christopher Columbus, and STD caused some head fucking up and it will be left at that) but a more likely component would have been the wine. 


The Romans brewed their wine in lead cauldrons, believing the metal helped give it taste (Roman wine was awful and extremely strong by itself so they added a lot of things, mostly watering it down, something Caligula didn't do, and adding crushed fruit) and Caligula drank a shit ton everyday. He was essentially slowly giving himself lead poisoning, something that didn't help his mental functions. 



You also have to remember that history is written by whoever gives the most satisfying records not who's honest. Most of the records are written either hundreds of years after Caligula lived, like us writing about George Washington, so some of the facts are a little fudged and others were written by people who didn't like him and wanted to make him look bad so they blew somethings out of proportion and pulled the good things someone might have done out of the light. For example, Nero may have fiddled while Rome burned but he saw himself as an artist and wanted to make something that showed his grief, maybe recognizing that he couldn't do much or that the fire was too far gone to be stopped. What could he have done? The city was in chaos and no one could have been organized in a way that would have been effective for long, panic would have won over. You also never hear about how he opened his palace to those without homes while their's was being rebuilt and how he spent most of his treasury on rebuilding.



Sickness also ran in the line of Roman Emperors, even if they weren't related, Julius Caesar was very sick in his own right and it lead to his downfall, he couldn't get up to accept an extremely high privilege because he had an upset stomach and would have embarrassed himself. Back to Caligula, he most indefinitely had epilepsy, Roman royals had to learn to swim as part of their education but Caligula didn't and it was unusual, this is believed to be because of advice given to epileptic people even now, don't swim in cause you have an episode and you can't be reached. Your spasms could harm someone trying to save you or could even drown the person. 



Caligula was a sick puppy because he was raised to be one, he was sick in his head and the rest of his body but he also almost deserved to be, he had been through hell and his childhood and all of his teenage years were lived in constant fear of the world around him, where taking a nap didn't mean you woke up again and eating dinner didn't mean it wouldn't have arsenic in it. In the end, he probably said fuck it and went to town on the people who abandoned him and treated him badly and lashed out at the wrong people. Perhaps if he had a different frame of mind or a different way of thinking then he could have been the next Augustus or Julius and been a great ruler but he didn't, he was an abused little boy who grew into a bitter man who wanted others to suffer like he did.

1. Everyone hates elitists.  You may have a good argument, but by no means should you be putting down other games or the communities of other games.  I speak from the experience of a person with over 500 hours in Dota2 but also (about) 400 normal games in LoL.

2. Both games do require skill.  In both Dota and LoL alike people *will* be dominated in lane and teamfights without skill.  That being said, I'll point out the flaws in some your arguments.

&gt;100 different champions that all have abilities that are similar, while having little to no need for mana preservation but control the lanes via spam is not skill, that's bland.

While the actual skills are similar and do have less variation than in Dota, mana preservation is still an important factor in the game.  Why else is blue buff control so important?  Why do energy-based heroes have such stronger laning phases (and weaker teamfighting strengths) than mana-based champions?  How do you explaim the dominance of autoattack harass in mid lane, where mages with weak autos have nearly always laned in season 2?

&gt;I don't know if you know this but Dota is a game that LoL was based on and Dota still has more games played per year than LoL has had since 2009, there has been many discussions on the LoL reddit about Dota2 and the general consensus is that LoL is easier and less competitive than Dota2.

Yes and yes.  Although, part of the reason Dota has more games per year is exactly its older age.  Furthermore, LoL is not necessarily easier but does have a easier learning curve.  We also see an expansion of counterplay potential in the recent season 3 updates, with a slew of new items and gameplay changes.

&gt;No replay system so you have to use a third-party, no voice comm because most of the LoL community don't want to deal with kids and ragers, doesn't that tell you something about the general community in LoL? 

If anything, this tells me that there is a great amount of improvement and growth that Riot can put into place.  Just like Dota and Dota2 have, LoL has lots of potential for growth.  I believe that they can both learn from each other and can become much more than they currently are.

&gt;oh and btw, Season 2 world championships and people cheated, there were 60 minute games where 74 ward kills had happened and only 13 champ kills, very exciting and very eye-opening to see that Riot fails so hard on the elementary level of hosting a tournament even though they have hosted a tournament in the past, but did you see The International 2? 

Low champ kills aren't necessarily a failed tournament, it's a testament to the players' skills.

&gt;solo queue is not competitive &lt;&lt;

Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Go tell that to the Korean/European/American players who play LoL as their job.  People may not take it seriously all the time, but it is sure as hell competitive.  By the way, since we're being snarky.  567,000 unique viewers watched TI 2012 ([source](http://blog.dota2.com/2012/09/the-2012-international/)). 8,282,000 unique viewers watched S2 WC ([source](http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/45610/t1780040-league-of-legends-captures-over-8-282-000-unique-viewers-for-season-2-world-championships/)).

I know that in England violent crime is in far excess than it is in the US. The reason why people in Europe don't consider carrying a firearm are two fold. 

A. By in large in most civilised nations so long as you stay away from areas known for violence, it is fairly rare to be attacked, not non-existent, but fairly rare. 

B. Most English, as well as many other Europeans are taught from birth that guns are bad and that they should never even consider carrying one. If they were actively being attacked they wouldn't consider even then getting a gun.

,AskSocialScience,,True,t3_15s508,False,t1_c7pe71n,[deleted],0,0,"&gt; One factor in Europe's attainment of wealth was the plundering of resources and raw materials from the American continents,

I don't know if plunder is the right word. The initial colonization of the New World by Britain and France was driven by timber, fur, and *trade* with the natives. Large-scale conflict with them didn't start until the whites' populations exploded. OTOH, no one exploited the Americas like the Spaniards; from the get-go they brought down local leaders, enslaved the populace, converted all to Catholicism, and set them to work the silver mines.

The most egregious use of slave labor in the Anglo/French colonies wasn't to exploit local resources like timber/fish/fur/minerals but to work plantations. The most profitable plantations were in the Caribbean where native populations were sparse and undeveloped. Sugar plantation owners in the Bahamas were the wealthiest men in the world and made wealthy American planters seem poor by comparison.

&gt; They might have doubled their colonization efforts elsewhere though.

Like where? The Americas were so fertile for colonization because of coincidence. The natives had no natural immunity to Old World diseases because they didn't really maintain livestock or live among them like Europeans and Africans did. This meant that releasing 20 hogs, a small herd of cattle, or a few bands of horses in the Americas spread disease faster than we could cross the continent *and* completely disrupted Native cultures. *This simply wouldn't work in Asia*.

Then there's the advantage in metalworking and gunpowder Europeans had over the Natives. This advantage was nullified in Asia because the inhabitants had these things as well.

But right now, you're probably going to mention Africa. Well, the funny thing about Africa is that Europeans had to wait to *really* colonize Africa until the advent of railroads and anti-malarials. African diseases did to Europeans what European diseases did to Native Americans. Africa even has a disease that kills horses, which were needed to ferry supplies for guns across the continent. With no guns and awful disease, this left Europeans fighting Africans with sword and spear ruining any technological advantage. Africa wasn't colonizable until the Maxim gun allowed Europeans to mow down hordes of Zulu.",False,t5_2sml9,26,1357084685,1430827818,0,26,,c7pfa5r,t1_c7pfa5r,

Really?

* WWI 1914-1918

* WWII 1939-1945

Seems to me **that was a gap of only 21 years** between the end of one and the start of the other (or 25 years from the start of one to the start of the other -- and yes I am aware the US did not ""officially"" enter those wars until 1917 and 1941 respectively)... one thing is certain and that is the gap was no where NEAR a 70 year span.

Going back from WWI in US history: prior to WWI was the Spanish-American War (1998) so a gap from then to US entry into WWI of just 19 years; *discount the SA war as not ""major""? fine...* then prior to that the US Civil War was from 1861 to 1865, a gap of 52 to 56 years versus the start of WWI (and only 37 years to the start of the SA war); going back further the Mexican-American was was in 1846 to 1848 (not even a decade prior to the Civil War), *and if you discount that (and also skip a host of minor ""wars/conflicts""), then...* the War of 1812 was only 40 years prior to the Civil War; and the Revolutionary War (1776 to 1783) was 29 to 36 years prior to that.

So no ""70 year cycle"" present there.

Moving forward from WWII, the Korean Conflict began in earnest in 1950 and ""ended"" in 1953 (of course technically speaking it has NOT yet ended, but still) -- that was only a 5 year long ""peace"" gap from WWII; and the Vietnam Conflict arguably began immediately in 1953, but even if you want to discount the early involvement and date it as beginning during LBJ's *direct* involvement of US troops in 1965 it was only a gap of a mere dozen years.

**But perhaps you meant major EUROPEAN wars...**
-----

In that case, there were various ""wars"" or conflicts every couple of years -- and prior to WWI the ""major"" conflicts were:

* Franco Prussian War -- 1870-1871 (just 40 odd years prior to WWI)

* The Revolutions of 1848 (France, Austria, Italy, Bohemia, Hungary and Germany, etc) -- only slightly over 2 decades prior to the FP war.

* Napoleonic Wars 1796-1815 (a ""peace"" gap of just slightly more than 3 decades prior to 1848).

Etc.

**In short, there is NO 70 YEAR CYCLE** except in some faux-pattern-creation of someone's vivid imagination.

*Wars tend to happen when countries (and/or its ruling elites) are or think/feel they are ""constrained"" -- often significantly as a result of HIGH population growth (especially in terms of teen and twenty something young males) that is unaccompanied by similar resource &amp; territory growth.*

Wars then provide the (nearly always illusionary) prospect of the gaining wealth -- getting control over -- if not outright direct possession of -- the ""wealth"" (resources/peoples) of adjacent/nearby countries or of distant ""colonies"" (which are generally NOT actually ""colonies"" but rather conquered territories paying tribute).  

They also provide a means for the two-fold interests of the ruling class: first it ""vents off pressure"" from the youth, directing it outward against a ""foreign"" enemy (and thus keeping the proverbial kettle from boiling over internally in the form of riot/revolution); and secondly it tends to allow significant profiteering opportunities for those involved in provisioning the armaments (this includes both the manufacturers who make tremendous money selling crap in bulk to the government, AND then banking/financing interests which plan to make huge amounts via the debt-based {leveraged monetary expansion -- essentially loaning ""new"" money that never existed before} financing of the war, hoping to recoup several times over via the gains of the war, or in the case of its loss, via internal taxation {and/or the arbitrage and gaming of a ""war bond"" system, propagandizing the gullible public into first buying, then abandoning, and finally redeeming via taxes said farcical instruments at 100% par value}).

*So, yeah there is a ""cycle"" (if it can be called that) but it is nothing that is so easily predictable in terms of years or decades.*

EDIT: And if Wheeler's hypothesis (which I think rather dubious and based more on an application of Ronald Coase's adage of ""torturing data to make it confess"" to his liking) regarding things like solar/climate cycles has any validity, then it has to do with *failing* crop &amp; harvests versus population growth (IOW we're back to population pressures vs resources, rather than any ""mystical"" 70~120 year influence of lunatic/[solatic](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=solatic) nonsense).",1357115281,t5_2qhpn,22,1357084707,1430827821,0,22,,c7pfacx,t1_c7pfacx,

To my knowledge, the Austro-Hungarian empire was acting excessively bellicose because they knew Germany would be forced to come to their aid in a war situation. This just happened to be the spark that set things in motion. Austria-Hungary was attempting to exert control over Serbia, as a buffer against Russian influence in the region, so the assassination simply gave them the excuse they needed to present Serbia with unattainable demands; the refusal of which gave Austria-Hungary an excuse to attack. Russia came to their aid, and Germany came to the aid of Aus-Hung. The rest, as they say, is history. What essentially happened during this period was a collapse of the old empires of Europe (Ottoman, Aus-Hungary, aaand i'm probably missing one...it's been a while since i've studied it.) So what I'm saying is that it would have happened sooner or later. Austria-Hungary was trying to maintain the empire, and in doing so, brought about its destruction. Also, they were woefully ill-equiped to fight a modern war at the time, as they still utilized horse-back calvary. Therefore, Germany was forced to fight a war on two fronts against the Brits/French and the Russians, because Aus-Hung could barely protect itself.

Middle earth is Tolien's alternate history of Europe.

Why on earth would you find that kind of genetic variance on such a small geographic area? The various races immigrated to Middle earth in the same fashion that cro magnons entered Europe. There is a distinct lineage of every group in Middle, and for your information, there are in fact several different human cultures, each distinct, and each with similarities to actual European societies, but there is no reason there would ever by the kind of diversity you suggest in an area the size of northern Europe.

Now, your issue with too few women I really don't understand. Only the first part of the Hobbit trilogy has been released, and it's the portion in which they're crossing uninhabited wastes. There are almost no characters outside of the protagonists AT ALL, regardless of gender. Beyond that though, I fail to see why this is even an issue. If your problem is that none of the Dwarves are female, then I can answer that quite simply.

The story wasn't written that way. 

Why, you ask? Because from an anthropological perspective, men are, biologically, more disposable then females in terms of reproductive value, and thus fell into the more dangerous tasks of hunting and fighting. This is an anthropological fact that you just have to get fucking used to. Is it sexist? OF FUCKING COURSE, but biology doesn't give a shit if the genders are treated equally, we, as humans, do.

Take angler fish, for example. The male angler is about a centimeter long, is incapable of catching it's own food, and lives a very short life span. It's entire biological function is to find a female angler fish, roughly a foot long and several thousands of times his size, to which he can attach himself to and DIE. He bites onto the female, then is literally absorbed into her body until there is nothing left but a wart on the females skin where his testes are. These then provide the female with sperm in order to reproduce.

Biology doesn't give a fuck about equality, that's a human thing, so while men and women are equally capable, they are different. Now don't try and convince yourself I'm saying that women are biologically inferior, that's a fucking ridiculous idea, and a straw-man argument. Women are not inferior, just different. That's not something you can deny, look in your pants.

Women, due to humans' tendency for single births and a long gestation period, are not nearly as biologically disposable as men. One man can have literally thousands of children. One women can have perhaps a dozen before the odds of death from birth complications become overwhelming. 

So that right there is why men, throughout history, have been hunters and fighters. Can women be hunters and fighters too? Of course they can. The physical difference, as a result of genetics, between men and women is present, but it's not exactly overwhelming. The issue isn't that women can't be hunters or warriors, it's that a foraging society that did such would have vastly decreased odds of survival over the long term, simply because you have removed so many women from the process of reproduction. Because they're dead. 

Some math: Let's say a single man in a hunter gatherer society has the potential to impregnate a women every day and still have time to gather food, etc. Assuming one in thirty attempts is actually at the time of ovulation, that's 12 fertilizations per year. This is a *very* conservative estimate as well. On the other hand, a women can have 1 child every nine months, plus another 9 months to a year in between at minimum. That's every 18 months about. So in the period a women can have one child, a man can have 18. 

If he copulated multiple times per day, that number shoots up. Women are, in terms of reproductive success, *far* more valuable then men. Hence why men fall into dangerous occupations. Once a culture left foraging for agriculture, this system stayed in place, employing men in dangerous occupations (until modern medicine, that is). It is, simply, the most biologically successful model for most of human history (so 199,950 years out of our 200,000 years as a species), as it yields the most offspring, and ensures the continuation of the species. 

Yes, I do support equal rights and an end to discrimination. That's why I'm involved in microlending, and make what donations I can. But do I thin we should rewrite everything to include a politically correct cast of perfectly diverse characters? No fucking way. That destroys the heritage of the original work. I don't want my history, or my literature, to be altered after-the-fact on the off chance that it might offend someone. I want humanity, warts and all, so that we can observe what we are and used to be, and make changes for the future. 

Well fuck, I haven't even gotten into the literary aspect yet... I'll keep it short: injecting artificial diversity into an already VERY VERY thoroughly planned fictional universe (there are dozens and dozens of notebooks Tolkien filled describing the history of Middle Earth. It started out as an anthropological thought experiment) would utterly shatter the suspension of disbelief, and render the entire film ridiculous, in addition to insulting the work of a fantastic author.

Was Tolkien perhaps a bit sexist? Of course, he was writing in the 50s. Should we just wash it all away and pretend we were always perfect?

After alot of thought, hand wringing, and research to finally ""solve"" my desk seating dilemna (whether with an office chair or something else), I bought a leather glider/swivel recliner a couple weeks ago off craigslist for 30 dollars. It's been glorious.

To make the recliner work I thought I'd need some elaborate pieces like a retractable arm with a tray for the keyboard/mouse, etc. Keyboard in my lap and mouse on a small cheap ikea laptop table, right next to the chair, works great. I moved my monitors closer to me on the desk so they're not so far - looks weird and wastes desk space, but I can get a thin desk in the future.

In fact, if you consider that Christianity provided justification for centuries of torture and genocide, it could be argued that those moral systems were a shitload *better* than what effectively comes out of Christianity.

The morality of the Bible is an absolute morality, i.e. it's meant to be followed inflexibly, without exceptions; and it's the morality of people from a time where human lives and suffering mattered a lot less, where slavery was as acceptable as the subjugation of women. By modern standards, religious morality is rotten to the core. Having plagiarized and trademarked a few universal human values like ""don't kill,"" ""don't steal"" and ""don't lie"" doesn't rescue it; even our caveman ancestors had that figured out.

No, since 1AD we've had 2000 years of philosophy to work on questions of morality, and both the philosophical concepts of morality and our accepted cultural standards of morality have improved tremendously. [We are living in the most peaceful times ever](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker07/pinker07_index.html) and standards of living keep improving worldwide. Religious morals are a throwback.

Outside of religions, modern moral frameworks tend to be [consequentialist](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/consequentialism_1.shtml). Many refinements are possible on this basic concept. You could read up on John Stuart Mill to learn about [utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism). A more contemporary ethicist I enjoy reading is Peter Singer. I strongly recommend his book [Practical Ethics](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethics-Peter-Singer/dp/0521707684/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).

In civilized countries, ethics is often taught in schools, and of course parents teach their children to be nice. It's not really rocket science! People eventually realize that the world is more pleasant when people play nice. For the minority who still has trouble with that, there's the disincentive of going to jail. That works, mostly.

There was a loophole however, Jews were allowed to practice money lending to Gentiles. In practice this was a way in which rich Christians, usually the nobility, were the actual moneylenders with the Jews acting as beards for the process. In order to make an often meagre living from this the Jews would put their commission on top of already high interest rates and this would mean that even a modest loan could cost a lot more to pay back.

When one lot of Jews became extremely unpopular the nobles would whip up the anti-Semitic sentiment and run them of town and in this way they would seem to be protecting their Gentile subjects. Eventually new Jews would arrive in town and the process would begin again.

The origins of European anti-Semitic feeling probably comes from the Catholic Church  placing the blame for killing Christ on the Pharisees.

Well, yes and no. My comment was intentionally meant to be read either way, depending upon how much of a Star Wars geek you are.

On the surface, it's an over-generalization that seems a bit silly when applied universally, as you've pointed out, implying sarcasm on my part.

If you recognize it as a quote by Yoda from *Empire* and are generally willing to give a Jedi Master the benefit of the doubt or recognize that the context of this quote specifically applies to force-usage, then you take it at face value. The general idea being that when you use the force, you are manipulating the energy field of all living things, essentially the be-all-end-all of the universe.

Even tough I am from western Europe I have never considered Luxembourg or Monaco to hold great power even if they are very rich on a personal level. 

When it comes to Japan I feel like their power has been diminished from the powerhouse they used to be in the '80's and this power has been taken by South Korea due to their expansive politics in education. And the last ten years or so China has also stepped up. Japan is no longer a ""big"" nation in SE Asia compared to how they used to be.

I guess the question for the future will be how they will be treated by their powerful neighbors, China and South Korea, and I guess that does not bode to well for them. 

As a small side note, a few small nations do carry great power relative to their size. The Vatican as an extreme example due to the Catholic church, but also nations like Norway carry some weight in the international scene despite being only 4 million people.

From what I've read, early studies focused more on the process and certainty of fossilization.
Xenophanes used fossil evidence of marine organisms to theorize land mass being previously covered underwater.
Ibn Sina Wrote more on the fossilazation process during the islamic golden age.
-After that the 17th &amp; 18th centuries became the defining times on the study of fossils, resulting in forming of the school of paleontology.

for my personal thoughts.. merely speculation here on..

The interesting point I see here is where Ibn Sina comes in. The Islamic golden age was renowned for the sheer mass of scholarly works being translated and studied. It wouldn't be inconceivable that the topic would have been a popular chain of thought.

However I believe it would have been the study of much smaller fossils. Larger fossils are incredibly delicate, and very rarely recovered in a manageable state. Also a good deal of history is lost, due to wars etc. Its very possible larger specimens were studied, worshiped, destroyed.. but we have little current evidence of such.

If your'e interested in the arabic golden age I mentioned here:
 A good starter on this would be Science &amp; Islam by Ehsan Masood (Very well written) and Pathfinders by Jim Al-khalili.

It's the mindset, it's the rationality, it's the enlightenment and the alleviated sense of purpose of Europe that sets us apart. This may sound harsh, but I can not deny these truths, as most fellow Turks do, which in turn stagnates us. 

Turks do things haphazardly, we have a national attitude of 'last minute goal', the easier path is always chosen over all other ethical or moral paths which in turn doesn't solve or achieve, we are very polar in attitudes, we seek extremes, we don't understand specialisation, systems and routines are just not our kinda thing and most importantly of all,  we are emotion over mind.

We just simply are the Orient.

Same thing happen all the time, you just have to look at US history and prohibition: Lots of compagnies were stopped at the same time, so a huge wave of a new generation of alcohol makers and sellers came crashing all at once, for 5 times the price, 5 times less the quality 5 times less the morality, and 5 times less the morality. That, and a sudden interest in the old toys that were given away, coming from the public. 

Lobsters where once a dish shipped in huge quantities to prisons in some Europe states, that would serve it to their inmates. They loathed it (maybe it was overcooked? Or maybe it was just the fact that it was dumped for them because it was dirt cheap, and they ate it all the time...?). It eventually got less common, the price went higher, and there was a sudden interest from the upper-class. I personally like lobster, but eating something that's ''special'' and highly priced adds something special to the meal, it's psychological, and also a statement about and to you and your peers. It becomes more than just food, it have added value (however BS that value is in reality). Lots of sushis are becoming more and more prized because of that, and before their endangered status, they weren't really sought after.

1) Modern Americans usually know how to swim, and they know how to read, and how to do math. These are rare skills in these ancient times. On the other hand they usually don't know how to ride horses.

 Except for not knowing latin and greek, reading and math would make them learned as if they had a doctorate; but it will be tough to prove this because they lack the classical education they will be quizzed in. An educated modern who studied latin and majored in medieval and ancient literature would be considered a doctor. A modern catholic priest in those times....


2) They have a peculiar alignment that will not match the religions and culture they are meeting. They will not like to see young children having their arm sawed off for stealing bread, or for mobs storming the jewish quarter because they think they are spreading the plague.  

3) They will have nice teeth, strong bones, and on average be taller.

4) They will for some reason think that they can buy anything with money, without entering into feudal obligations. This may make these superstitious and pre-enlightenment people think that the Americans behave like lowly merchants.

5) People think that moderns will have ideas about organization and devices that would change the world, but this is unlikely. Making a printing press, or other important techs, might do so.

6) Americans may know martial arts, or even own a rifle (with limited shots) that in my mind should do a lot of damage, save to 1/2, like a wand of lightning or some such potent artifact.

7) They are more likely to be asthmatic, have allergies, wear glasses, or be obese. They are less likely to suffer from parasites, idiocy from iodine deficiency, weak muscles from constant starvation, or scars from small pox.
 
Of course, many of these ideas will not matter in the typical D&amp;D world. The morals and customs in the typical fantasy world are more similar to modern America than medieval or ancient times.

You want to use your chem teacher father's mortar and pestle to grind something you plan on drinking?  

I don't think this is a good idea.  A mortar and pestle can work for french press or pour-over coffee, but won't be as good as a blade grinder, much less the consistent particle sizes of a burr grinder.  But don't use one that has ever contained anything you wouldn't eat directly.  I might use my mom's kitchen set, but I'd never use something used to grind shit up for a chem class.

As for what folks put in their coffees, most of us don't talk about putting things in coffee because we generally take our coffee black.  

You don't have to: drink it how you like it, not how you *think* you should like it; we find that well-brewed fresh coffee is pretty delicious already and doesn't need anything else to improve it, while cream and sugar often mask the subtle parts of a cup that can be most appealing as a difference between good and great coffees.  

Cream and sugar are traditional options for brew coffee, while some cultures prefer honey and some southeast Asian cultures put a little butter in.  Europeans will occasionally put salt or egg into the brewing pot to remove some bitterness or astringency, but this isn't typically necessary for even decent coffee, much less anything better than that.

,explainlikeimfive,,True,t3_15s3j6,False,t3_15s3j6,Carol_White,0,0,"This is a big question but here are some possible answers:

1. Political stability. The American Revolution resulted in a society in which there was general consensus that this should be a republic. While the Revolution had been a civil war, in the sense that many Americans remained loyal to the British crown, these ""loyalists"" left America following the war, upwards of 100,000 people. Therefore, there was not a radical opposition remaining to cause trouble. While Americans have had their disagreements (most notably the Civil War of 1861-65), there has historically been a great deal of consensus. There was a broad middle class and a smaller gap between rich and poor than existed in Europe or Latin America. Compare this with, for example, Mexico, where the range of opinion about politics was so vast that there was a constant string of revolutions and coups for decades following independence. Americans have had the same constitution since 1788.

2. Early industrialization. If the history of the Industrial Revolution tells us anything, it is that the early adopters had gigantic advantages. After 1815, the US government adopted policies that enabled industrialization. The US passed high tariffs which protected them from the British dumping their manufactured goods. In Latin America, by contrast, national leaders supported free trade, which lined the pockets of the planter and commercial elites but crippled industrialization. American industrial spies stole technology from Britain. American capitalists shifted investment from commerce to industry. Poor agriculture in New England, coupled with widespread immigration in the 1830s and 40s, provided the labor force. The Supreme Court made judgements that protected contracts and other elements of capitalism. By sheer luck, there was lots of coal and iron in North America. By 1900, the US had the largest industrial capacity in the world.

3. No serious local enemies. The United States in its first few decades was a fourth-rate military power. They needed to survive in the midst of the gigantic and destructive wars of the French Revolution. They did this in part because of luck, in part because of skillful diplomacy, but mainly because there was a big ocean between themselves and Europe. In North America itself, there were no serious challenges to continental expansion. The Indians were disunited. The Spanish Empire was in retreat. Mexico was, as already mentioned, politically paralyzed. The British up in Canada were a challenge, but hard-won diplomatic successes from the 1820s-40s prevented territorial disputes from flaring up.

Perhaps you would find less 5's acting like they're 9's in the club ~ there's no way any guy would put up with that shit if he could get casual sex with a 9 for 35 bucks and no time investment.

Historically this is why women are almost always against anything that gives men access to easier, cheaper sex on the whole:

* Women tend to think pornography is more immoral than men on average.
* Women think the same of prostitution.
* Most sexually shaming is women shaming other women, for lowering the price for sex and hence causing their pussy stock to plummet. Men could usually care less unless it's the mother of their child.

No links to these trends but I've read about them before and are mostly common sense. It would only make sense that this would do damage to the average female SMV, but honestly it can't drop much lower than it already is.

Including time spent on both entertainment and using an hourly wage of my time of 20 dollars per hour, I'd calculate an average lay to cost me around 60-200 theoretical dollars. Without including time spent more like 30-50 dollars. I don't think the price can drop much lower than this, and females being driven heavily by biological processes when it comes to mating, likely wouldn't drop their ""price"" by much in the event that this was available. I think the more likely trend would be a larger quality gap, aka, more ugly guy hot chick pairings than average, and average quality for men who still have game and high value going up as a whole.

You can actually experience a gap like this in the world now. America has a shitty sexual market for men, because men take better care of themselves there and the market is flooded with war pig feminazis. Move to a foreign country like Japan, Southeast asia, South America, Russia, or eastern Europe, and you'll find more beautiful women on average, and also less quality men. Instantly your dating life will change, quality and SMV going up. Game principles all still apply heavily though. Speed of seduction might actually slow down because women are less whorish outside of western civilization on average (in my experience).

I lived in Southeast Asia for most of the past decade, had medical treatment in most countries at one point or another — mostly fevers and minor sports injuries but a couple emergency room visits for more serious ones... and we had our first child there. I'd say that in the countries known for medical tourism (Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand), the good hospitals are as good as, or better than, 95% of what you'd find in the USA — but at a fraction of the price.

In Cambodia, Laos, Burma, etc., you will not find world-class care but they can deal with most stuff, and in real emergencies, there are flights to Singapore/Bangkok/KL/HK every hour or two.

I don't think it's anything to worry about.

&gt; budget

Depends on your style, but you can get by on US$30/day everywhere except Singapore, as long as you're not picky about accommodation. Add more for booze in Malaysia/Singapore where alcohol is a bit pricier than the other countries. Add another $20 in Singapore unless you sleep in a huge dorm and scrounge on food.

If you're not sure about your comfort level, then start in Singapore and work your way from there (Singapore-&gt;Malaysia-&gt;Indonesia-&gt;wherever else suits your fancy).

1. Historically, there was large Irish settlement in the Carribean prior to large-scale forced African immigration
* /θ/ and /ð/ become /t/ and /d/ in both Hiberno-English and in the Caribbean
* Using ""do"" as an auxiliary with tense implications in a non-standard manner is common to both parts of Ireland (possibly as a result of influence of Irish) and in various dialects spoken by Africans in the Western Hemisphere, including both Caribbean English and AAVE.  However, the manner of usage is quite different.  It is, however, a shared innovation which could be evidence of a connection (or just a coincidence).

[Here's something I found](http://books.google.com/books?id=uLGk7ERov98C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=rickford+ireland+caribbean&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IneyejGXz3&amp;sig=6s3gDOC3xTJeSNhCktubB5RilCs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3LTjUJW1JaLZ0wHYi4CQDw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=rickford%20ireland%20caribbean&amp;f=false) regarding this.

However, West African influence is definitely pretty important.  In much of the Caribbean, African slaves outnumbered Europeans by a significant margin, and there was a constant stream of enslaved Africans being brought over, fresh out of speaking African languages.  That's especially evident in the formation of various creole languages of the Caribbean, such as Jamacian Patois or Trinidadian Creole.  Those languages quite clearly show heavy West African influence, and they have influenced and continue to influence English there.  They're also what the ancestors of people in the Caribbean probably would've been speaking.

It's also important to note that the English spoken when the dialects diverged was quite different than would be spoken today.  That could well explain some of the differences.

The issue is we'll probably never have proof.  Spelling in English has been fixed for a while, so variants in spelling are our primary clue to pronunciation in the past.  But the slaves who began speaking these dialects were usually kept illiterate.  Unfortunately, people from the era who were concerned with language seem to have been concerned mostly with how the upper-class spoke, not in how slaves in distant colonies were learning English and forming new dialects.

tl;dr Definitely some West African influence, as is evident in creoles spoken there.  Maybe some Irish influence thrown in too.  We'll probably never know for sure.",False,t5_2qhos,9,1357101730,1430830151,0,9,,c7pk30d,t1_c7pk30d,

Hvor får du det fra at vi øker innvandringen? Etter å ha skummet NOU'en du linker til over fant jeg ikke noe konkret som indikerer at ikke-EØS-innvandring økes. Tvert om synes NOU'en å gå innom kontrollen som er satt på innvandringen til Norge de siste 35-40 årene (men dette skal jeg ikke uttale meg for sikkert om da jeg ikke har lest NOU'en skikkelig). Det er misforstått at Arbeiderpartiet fører en ""åpne grensene for alle""-politikk (for the record, jeg er ikke AP-velger). Ta en telefon til Juss-Buss hvis du vil høre mer om hvor vanskelig regelverket for utlendinger som kommer til Norge er.
 
Det jeg kunne finne av tall var følgende, sakset fra en artikkel SSB ga ut etter påstanden om at vi ville stå overfor muslimsk flertall i Norge i fremtiden (iflg. SSB vil forøvrig andelen muslimer i Norge ligge på 7% i 2060):
&gt; Det har vært en sterk økning i innvandringen til Norge etter år 2000. Dette skyldes i all hovedsak økt innvandring fra EØS-land til ledige jobber i Norge. I samme periode har det vært en svak nedgang i nettoinnvandringen fra Afrika, Asia og Latin-Amerika. Nettoinnvandringen fra muslimske land har årlig vært 6-8000 etter år 2000. Den andelen som dette utgjør av samlet nettoinnvandring, har gått ned fra 80 prosent i 2000 til godt under 20 prosent etter 2007.

EØS-innvandring kan du ikke kritisere uten å kritisere avtalen i seg selv; hvis vi ikke ønsker å ta imot borgere fra EØS-området bryter vi med prinsippet om de fire friheter og kan glemme et videre samarbeid med EU-landene. Det betyr også at vi effektivt kobler oss fra markedet i Europa og må inngå separate handelsavtaler mv. med alle statene enkeltvis. Å være EU-motstander er nok innenfor fremdeles, men EØS-motstander er nok noe vanskeligere.

De personene vi tar imot på humanitært grunnlag er vi i stor grad forpliktet til gjennom andre internasjonale konvensjoner enn EØS-avtalen såvidt meg bekjent. 

Folkerettslige forpliktelser er noe vi forsøker å etterleve, noe som også gjør at vi har et så velfungerende diplomati og relativt mye å si ute i verden til tross for at vi er en lilleputt i verdenspolitikken.

This is som of the biggest bullsh* that I've read in 15 year on the internet. Muslims tend to believe that ""in the beggining, muslims ruled Andalucía"". Well, let me tell you how it came to be. In the 8th century, 300 before the crusades muslims love to bitch about so much, an invading muslim army crossed the strait and conquered by the sword the Christian visigothic kingdoms of Iberia in what was the first inter-religious agression in western Europe, and they would have swallowed all of Europe hadn't they been stoped by Charles Martel at the Pyrenees. Being muslims, they quickly fell into internal struggles which allowed the resistance to liberate Córdoba by 1236 and the entire peninsula by 1492 with the recovery of Granada in what was probably history's longest resistance war. It says a lot about the nature of the invaders the fact that they could not win over the local population in 7 centuries. Right after the last one was expelled or converted, Spain went on to be the world's most powerful nation for the next 150 years.
BTW, forget about ""700 years of ruling almost all the peninsula"", as by 1150, 3/4 of it had already been liberated.

Declining population is a problem on multiple levels, especially when it comes in the context we're seeing today where people are inexplicably less fertile, and for no clear reason. 

There's also, in a modern sense, no such thing as over population. A decade or two ago this was a real question academic circles were asking themselves and they couldn't find any solid link in recorded history of an instance where human society was over populated which then led to some catastrophe that couldn't be averted. The Mayans didn't know what crop rotation was, and Europe didn't know what soap is during the black death. Even today there's very little land that's being used to its maximum. Dense human populations are perfectly sustainable today thanks to modern technology, it just becomes a question of how much money you want to spend. The infrastructure necessary to maintain densely populated cities- Japan's up there, if not the top in this regard- is expensive, and requires maintenance. If you can build a society that's responsible, its entirely sustainable as well. Even the worst of it- electrical generation- is perfectly renewable, or at least sustainable for the very long term if you're willing to put the money into it. Nuclear power, especially non-plutonium / uranium sources such as thorium salt reactors (while always an option, TS reactors weren't nearly as popular for states in the cold war because there was no efficient means of translating the same basic science behind them into functioning nuclear bombs) produces power at competitive rates to traditional reactors with only a small fraction of the radioactive left overs, and when built properly have no real chance of melt downs. Yes, even if a 9.0 earthquake hits it, and then a tsunami. The worst of it would be the clean up. 

The Japanese problem is fairly unique. The youth don't start families because the cost of living in Japan is so exorbitant that wage slavery has become a relative fact of life, even if only 1 in 6 people live in poverty. In the last fifteen years Japan's been rocked by *five* recessions, and the corporate climate has rapidly become one of complacency. Losers are protected at the expense of keeping on real talent, and despite no laws mandating it, there's an attitude that the first job you get, you wont get fired from unless you *really* try. And for a few years there the government practiced the attitude of, ""too big to fail"" like it was going out of style. And don't even get me started on the short comings of the Japanese education system. It exemplifies the idea that you can't demonstrate proficiency with subjective testing. Even if the US system is ineffective, it's at least *easy*. Japan's has that same lingering question of how important half the information you're asked to be accountable for is, yet is many times more difficult. And the job hunt's become so bad in Japan that it starts your last year of college. I was only making half hearted attempts at it half way through. 

So on the front end of things, you have a society that is basically, by design, going to lean away from the family life. It's no wonder so many youth in Japan become NEETs and hikimoris (basement dwellers in nerd lingo) when the game feels so rigged against them. 

And on the back end you have an aging population and a government that's managing it's finances so poorly that, had it not been for Greece, would be the world's largest debtor. ",False,t5_2qh13,15,1357104400,1430830489,0,15,,c7pkson,t1_c7pkson,

The reason that Japan's population is decreasing has much more to do with social problems than economic ones. Japanese men are getting tired of the social setup of Japan, in which men work 70 hour work-weeks while their women stay at home, take care of the kids, and complain endlessly about how the man is always away. This is the cause of the 'soshoku danshi' movement - so-called 'vegetarian boys,' who are completely apathetic about Japanese work life and refuse to get girlfriends. Similarly, many Japanese women are getting sick of the social setup, too. What educated individual wants to give up their career and social life to stay home the rest of their lives to raise children and cook for someone who's never home?

① I think the ""saving money"" factor is pretty big: not so much for building the stations, but also for ordering train cars because an 8-car train is probably nearly double the cost, and most Shanghai subway train cars are still bought from overseas (European) engineering companies.

④ When my wife was pregnant and we lived at Longyang Rd, and Line 2 terminated at Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, we would occasionally do this on Line 2 when going to Puxi, by taking it to Zhangjiang and then stepping across the platform and riding back. This is especially attractive during rush hours, when you're not just getting a seat but some personal space.

⑦ Huamu is a good one because of its unique open design. It's hard to pick just one, so I'll list a few favorites: the colored tunnel in the Xujuahui interchange, the multiple-line exchange at Century Blvd, the ""walk of humanity"" at Shanghai Railway Station, the Expo-inspired design at Yaohua Rd, the one-line two-level platform at Nanpu Bridge... And definitely agree with people listing Zhongshan Park interchange as the most hated, for a family with a stroller our most common resort is to exit and ride escalators through the Cloud Nine mall, argh.

⑧ In fact as of a week or so ago, the official subway map posted in stations has been updated to show the name of that station being changed from ""Shanghai Aerospace Museum"" to ""Shendu Highway"". An official announcement has not yet been made, but is expected soon.

3. I am a Christian and a Creationist.

Anyone with half a brain and a curious mind can easily reconcile proven scientific fact with what the Bible supplies to be taken of faith. Noplace in the Bible is evolution explicitly excluded save for human evolution. 

Frankly, however, human evolution still strikes me as a bit wibbly since I've yet to meet anyone capable of explaining how within only a few generations a species of primate shed most of its fur, grew a larger brain, developed language, art, culture, and creative problem solving then suddenly exploded across the globe faster than any other species in the history of the Earth. As for humans sharing traits with primates, we also happen to share many traits with just about all mammals. Chimpanzees have 99% of our DNA? Chickens have 85%. I'm not impressed.

Even better argument: Researchers have found the depreciated genes in birds that once gave them tails, scales, and teeth. Activating these genes results in very dinosaur-like creatures, or as far as we can tell from the embryos. (Why don't they let a Jurassic chicken grow to maturity!? [Insert inane pun question the courage of the researchers])

Let me know when a gene is found in humans for lack of reasoning ability. Find a gene that makes for a perfectly healthy, functional human but with his intelligence simply diminished below the point of anything more complex than fishing termites with a stick. THEN I'll be interested.

Also, I've never understood the relative lack of ""pre-human"" fossils. We have plenty of remains from All other families of critters.

The idea that speech cannot be censored for political reasons (like banned ""hate speech"" in Europe today) has been a constant in American life. The rejection of distant authority has informed American political debate over the centralization of powers to the federal government, from the colonial cry of ""no taxation without representation"" to the ""states' rights"" debates before the Civil War, and is still relevant today, with the latest incident being the relationship of Obamacare to the Commerce Clause.

You have countries like Norway that can still experience mass killings. You have countries like Japan that have strict laws against firearms, but very high rates of suicide. Some of the most armed States in the US have murder rates comparable to the Western European average; if you plot out rates of gun ownership and the murder rate between the United States, there's little correlation. To top it off, the relative murder rate in the US has been steadily dropping.

Combine that with the relative impossibility of curtailing trade in firearms even if they were made wholly illegal, considering the ease with which drug cartels can move drugs, guns, people, and money across US borders.

If we want to cut down on gun crime with any level of effectiveness, we need to improve social security to reduce the harsh effects of poverty and we need to invalidate illegal drug trade by legalizing and regulating drugs. Trying to limit gun ownership would be impractical and would do nothing to stymie trade in illegal guns. I bet it would do almost nothing to reduce the murder rate if guns were made illegal in the US.

Imposing gun control in the US based on a Western European narrative irresponsibly fails to consider all of the other ways in which the US is different and doesn't quite fit into the same mold, whether that's in the form of different social institutions, different ethnic problems, different neighboring nations, or different culture.

Taric and Ashe, unfortunately, have become less frequent of picks among the higher elo. -IF- you are going to catch an ashe player the best to watch would be Genja007 from M5 BenQ, though the Moscow Five group stream in russian, and from my experience very seldom compared to the NA/other EU streamers. If you see an M5 stream though GoSu does play taric at a crazy level of agression. http://www.own3d.tv/MoscowFive/live/41747

It is not uncommon in fact. Many species do this through the [founder effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect): It ""is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population...as a result of the loss of genetic variation, the new population may be distinctively different, both genetically and phenotypically, from the parent population from which it is derived. In extreme cases, the founder effect is thought to lead to the speciation and subsequent evolution of new species."" Most examples include island species who are usually founded by a small breeding population that migrated from another land mass (usually a continent). 

Back to the cheetahs: ""The cheetah has unusually low genetic variability. This is accompanied by a very low sperm count, motility, and deformed flagella. **Skin grafts between unrelated cheetahs illustrate the former point, in that there is no rejection of the donor skin.** It is thought that the species went through a prolonged period of inbreeding following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age."" This is a problem because cheetah populations are also subject to hunting and poaching further reducing their numbers. They also need a lot of land to live off of. They are not very adaptable, they are a highly specialized species. Given this they are very susceptible to the negative effects of their inbreeding. Also, a small disease could effectively kill the whole populations since any given individual would be less likely to have the genetic predisposition to be resistant/immune to the disease.

Another example includes the [European Starling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Starling#North_America): ""~60 Common Starlings were released in 1890 into New York’s Central Park...The Starling has done spectacularly well in the United States, the original 60 birds having swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America."" Proof that a small starting population does not equal inbreeding or extinction.

Wow dude, that's some groundbreaking shit. Protestantism is DIFFEREnt than Mormonism?! Wow, man, I had NO IDEA! Haha. Ridiculously non sequitr. I mean the logical structure of what you said equates credibility with the ""big difference"" between protestantism and Mormonism, which you mention as a new world history/cosmology and prophet. I mean how does either of those things have anything to do with credibility?? You're telling me that some dude saying he communicated to god through a burning bush is any more fucking credible than Joe Smith saying he saw God in a grove of trees? I mean if God did it back then, why the fuck would he stop with the apostles in Jesus' time. 

&gt;They don't have an equal sign between them, because Mormonism has a new prophet, new world history/cosmology. 

Really? Do we have to go through this? No one said there was an equal sign between them! This is simple logic, dude. I just said they were just as believable as each other. Obviously their different in a lot of respects. The idea that the Garden of Eden even existed is just as fucking crazy as it being in Israel or Africa or the US. I mean who the hell knows where the fuck it was?!?!? There's exactly as much evidence that it was on the moon: zero.

&gt;Additionally, conveniently enough Joseph Smith, as an American citizen was revealed that his country was very special in religious terms.

Conveniently enough, the writers of the Bible, being from Israel, thought Israel was ""very special in religious terms"". And the Protestants in Europe thought the same thing about Europe. This is your criterion for credibility?

&gt;I mean I don't even want to continue.

HAHA - yet you fail to realize that NOTHING you said makes Mormonism ANY less crazy than the protestant religion you mentioned. Don't give me this ""focusing on bible interpretation"" shit on why Protestantism is somehow less crazy or more acceptable. That is total bullshit. Mormonism focuses just as much on Bible interpretation and as a student of the Bible (and one who does not believe in its divinity) I would say Mormonism comes WAY closer to even the obvious shit in that book. The fact that you would even bring that up...well...in your own words, I don't even want to continue. Joseph Smith was both religious genius, but every religious genius is in some sense a fraud or at least self-deluded, because religion itself generally has those characteristics. 

I mean I actually find the idea that God inhabits a star named Kolob a LOT more plausible that he is a matterless, formless force or whatever incomprehensible shit your normal brand of Christianity believes. At least Joseph Smith had the brains to show that almost all Abrahamic religions can't even square their beliefs with clearly observable laws of thermodynamics. Joseph Smith's teachings did away with creation ex nihilo which, by the way, is fucking crazy and invalidates pretty much the vast majority of truth claims of Abrahamic religion, in my humble opinion.

And if you like Mormon values, why the hell would you want to kick them out of your country. Look, I don't give a shit about Russia - I'm just pointing out that it is a really fucked up place for them to do something like this.

It's worth noting that, unlike the conscripted or volunteered rank-and-file, the officer corps was maintained as a standing army, and a good one; many officers and generals on both sides had received a formal military education at West Point and had experience from the recent war against Mexico. In this respect, the US might well have been ahead of Europe, which had stagnated a bit since defeating Napoleon. 

Consider the troubles of the British Army in the Crimean War only a few years earlier: the officers there had not had a chance to work in the field in decades, and were infested with incompetent members of the middle and upper classes who had bought commissions because it was fashionable, whence came awful moves like the Charge of the Light Brigade. It's plausible that fresh British troops under poor leaders could find themselves outwitted and destroyed on the field by Americans already hardened by years of conflict. That said, morale and execution is everything, and it's probably still likely that the discipline and equipment of the European forces would win out, especially if we're talking about a continental power like Prussia that lavished incredible wealth and attention on its land forces and had a more robust core of talented and experienced officers.

But equal numbers is a very generous concession to make when the Union could field armies in the tens of thousands against small expeditionary forces that would have had to cross the Atlantic and then share supplies with the impoverished Confederacy.
