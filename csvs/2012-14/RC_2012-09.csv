Any account of a ""god gene"" that causes the majority of Americans to helplessly organize their lives around ancient works of religious fiction must explain why so many inhabitants of other First World societies apparently lack such a gene. 
  
The level of atheism throughout the rest of the developed world refutes any argument that religion is somehow a moral necessity. Countries like Norway, Iceland, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom are among the least religious societies on Earth. According to the United Nations' Human Development Report (2005) they are also the healthiest, as indicated by measures of life expectancy, adult literacy, per capita income, educational attainment, gender equality, homicide rate and infant mortality.  
  
Conversely, the 50 nations now ranked lowest in terms of human development are unwaveringly religious. Other analyses paint the same picture: The United States is unique among wealthy democracies in its level of religious literalism and opposition to evolutionary theory; it is also uniquely beleaguered by high rates of homicide, abortion, teen pregnancy, STD infection and infant mortality.  
  
The same comparison holds true within the United States itself: Southern and Midwestern states, characterized by the highest levels of religious superstition and hostility to evolutionary theory, are especially plagued by the above indicators of societal dysfunction, while the comparatively secular states of the Northeast conform to European norms.  
  
Of course, correlational data of this sort do not resolve questions of causality--belief in God may lead to societal dysfunction; societal dysfunction may foster a belief in God; each factor may enable the other; or both may spring from some deeper source of mischief.   
  
Leaving aside the issue of cause and effect, these facts prove that atheism is perfectly compatible with the basic aspirations of a civil society; they also prove, **conclusively**, that religious faith does nothing to ensure a society's health."" - Sam Harris

Porque na prática existe o PS/PSD (ps um pouquinho à esquerda e psd um pouquinho à direita) que alternam o poder entre eles, culpabilizando sempre o anterior pelos problemas do país. E existem os pequenos partidos como BE, PP e CDU que propõem medidas populistas e impraticáveis com o único objectivo de angariar votos e quando chegam ao poder fazem exactamente o mesmo que os partidos do bloco central.

Em geito de resumo das decisões tomadas por cada partido, a grande maioria são medidas a curto prazo, e como tu provavelmente sabes do teu dia a dia, medidas a curto prazo têm efeitos benéficos a curto prazo, e, dependendo das medidas, podem ter efeitos nefastos a longo prazo. Efeitos que só se vão notar dai a 4 ou 8 anos e vão ser um problema dos outros. Já estás bem a perceber qual é o nosso problema, certo?

E agora perguntas, em quem voto? Bem, podes dar uma vista de olhos [aqui](http://www.euprofiler.eu/) para saberes qual é o teu alinhamento político, mas o resultado do teu voto vai ser o mesmo, vai o PS ou o PSD para o poder.

I know you understand this PSD; the very nature of your comment makes this clear.

But people sometimes think in terms of ""household"" debt if you don't remind them of the distinction. I am guilty of this at times, so I imagine that people who are less familiar with these markets are likewise susceptible to this error. 

That being said, your point is certainly valid and you are probably stating a very optimistic case for the sovereign debt of nearly every country in the world, ex. U.S. In most cases, as a country's periodic interest payments increase as a percentage of periodic income, then risk is reassessed and interest rates rise.

**How does this hurt when the coupon (interest) payments on US Treasury debt are fixed?**

Most countries have sovereign debt maturity structures wherein the average maturity is 2 to 5 years. The average maturity for U.S. Treasury issuances is currently around 5 years. The upshot is that governments are contantly rolling debt over, using the proceeds of the new debt to repay principle of the matured debt. 

The continual process of rolling debt over allows capital markets to constantly reassess risk and adjust effective interest rates. Intuitively we understand that we, as lenders, want a higher rate of return for lending money to a riskier borrower. This is true even when it is the same borrower but the borrower's financial picture has weakened.

**Why is the U.S. different? Or why has the U.S. not been punished for its burdgeoning balance sheet?**

There is one minor reason and one major reason.  

The *minor reason* is that the U.S. is still the world's single largest economy and has the deepest, most active, and most liquid capital markets. It is also still the most reliable country in terms of productivity, efficiency and the rule of law. Although effectively it also benefits from the cumulative strength of its principal allies, e.g. the UK, the EU, Japan, Korea, Australia and NZ, as well as from the strength of its trading relationships with the BRIC and some OPEC countries. So while its risk profile has increased, it is still a relatively more attractive and safer place to park larges sums of ""risk averse"" capital. 

The *major reason* is that the dollar is the world's reserve currency and, more importantly, is the world's contract currency. A lot of people don't understand that when India, for example, buys oil or borrows money from Dubai, the contract is dollar-denominated. 

So India needs to convert its national currency into dollars to pay Dubai for the oil or Dubai needs to convert its local currency into US dollars to provide the loan. The net of this is not only a tremendous demand for dollars, but also a strong demand for risk-averse, short-term, dollar-denominated investment vehicles. The market for U.S. Treasuries and Eurodollar contracrs, among other markets, provides the bulk of this investment capacity.

The guilty pleasure here is that the U.S. Treasury is the only entity that can legally print U.S. dollars. When any other country starts to print excessive amounts of money, that country turns its currency into play money because the formula for the value of a currency is approximately (demand for that currency/volume of that currency in circulation.) With the U.S., the demand for our dollars is not only a function of our economy or our government's balance sheet, but also a function of the world's economy and the world's balance sheet. So absent sufficient natural demand from other countries, we can literallly print dollars and buy our own debt at rollover with little to no punitive impact on the effective rate of interest of our borrowings.

We earned the right to this guilty pleasure by being the most responsible borrower and most effective and robust economy. We are starting to see dents in our armor with certain BRIC and OPEC countries denominating contracts in local currencies. But it is still a miniscule part of the big picture. Even if this practice were to spread, it would take years and decades to completely unwind our currency's strength and pervasiveness. 

Keep this in mind the next time an r/collapser or other doom n' gloomer predicts eminent disaster because the Treasury printing presses are running 24/7. If the basis for their analysis was correct, the U.S. would already be in civil war.

Greece was clearly fading, and there was no guarantee that it could regain its old intellectual prowess. Whether or not the Empire was warranted is another issue. If Julius Caesar had been killed by the pirates, for example, the republic would have lived on, becoming a major state without taking over the entire Mediterranean. Still, the Republic, I imagine, would have been just as intellectually productive as its real imperial successor if not more. Instead of fading and crashing in the 400s CE, though, I imagine that instead, Rome would have fragmented into a series of smaller kingdoms, each trying to emulate its Latin predecessor. Minus the church, I think that within a few hundred years, there would have been another major state, perhaps based farther to the north in modern France or Germany, or wherever the center of trade ended up. It would have been akin to the transition from Greece to Rome--it took several centuries, but power and prowess were transferred from one major state (or in Greece's case, series of states) to another. This cycle would continue, perhaps, much like the Chinese dynasties. The only difference is that they would have had access to the Atlantic, the desire to expand that's been native to Europe since Philip II and Alexander, and the resources to do so.

Hence why we need global depopulation. It's not so much that our birth rates need to reach the level of 3rd world countries. Their birth rates need to reach our level. Below replacement. I understand that for current demographic problems, you would wish to see upper class white birth rates increase, and I would probably support this happening myself. However, in the long term, I hope to live to see global depopulation. The exact number I will leave to demographers to nitpick on, but serious doubt exists about the sustainability of current population levels. 

If a people are unable to reach below replacement level fertility through voluntary choice, it seems to me that it has to be forced on them, either by nature or by man.

&gt;Population expert Joel Cohen points out that, in 1950, there were nearly three times as many Europeans as sub-Saharan Africans. If U.N. estimates are correct, there will be nearly five sub-Saharan Africans for every European by 2100.

Do we wish to see the majority of humanity experience life in a global South Africa, a multicultural paradise where 28% of men admit to having raped a woman, and more women have been raped than are literate? Or do we wish to see the majority of human existence take place in Western countries, where women and men can strife to reach something greater and more beautiful than going through life without being raped?

I think we can agree on the answer. Something has to happen.

Above all else, third world population control should be our number one priority. It's not just an issue of white survival, it's an issue of human dignity. Most billionaires (including Oprah Winfrey) on the planet understand this. They throw all their money at keeping 3rd world people from having children. I don't care how they sugarcoat it. Most right wingers don't understand it, and want to abolish foreign aid.

Perhaps the rise of the Chinese state is a good thing. Assuming that they do not see European people as a source of potential competition that has to be destroyed, and so far they show no sign of hostility towards us, perhaps they may show the political willpower to end the miserable state of the third world, by exporting their one child policy model to the rest of the world, with an exception for the (family of the) exceptional.

We Europeans are handicapped in our liberal ""live and let live"" altruism. China understands that another man's business is your business as well. We can't isolate ourselves from what happens there. China will hopefully lead the way in implementing 3rd world population control, which will indirectly help stop the immigration happening to our nations.

If we in the Netherlands implement a one child policy with an exception for the exceptional, we could help solve our demographic threat from minorities as well. Hopefully under Chinese influence our government may be wise enough to do such a thing.",accountt1234,False,1,0,

In America, different states have different amounts of money. Alaska is poor. New York is wealthy. The federal government taxes people, and redistributes that money in spending. New Yorkers pay a lot more than they receive, and Alaskans receive a lot more than they pay. This allows for all of us to share a currency, because even though a New York dollar would be stronger than the US dollar is, and the Alaskan dollar would be weaker, it gets balanced out by the redistribution of wealth through federal taxes and spending. 

Now look at Europe. There is a common currency, meaning that Germany, which would have a strong German Mark (German dollar), gets to have a weaker Euro. Greece, on the other hand, which would have a really weak Greek Drachma, has a stronger Euro. This means that Germany's healthy economy can export a ton of stuff, similarly to China, because of a relatively devalued currency. Greece on the other hand imports more than it should because of a stronger currency. This means that they get an economy that is continually getting weaker, while Germany is benefiting. This is solved in the United States by federal redistribution, but EU doesn't have that, so certain member states (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain in particular, or the PIIGS) are doing very poorly economically while others, like France and Germany, are doing comparatively very well because of the effects of a shared currency over seriously different economies.

By the 1850s as much as 90% of the native population had been wiped out through contact with Spanish coastal traders and migrants from the California region, and Europeans were rather confused to find themselves the first whites to settle a land mostly devoid of Indians in the 1830s. There are some instances where whites did trade for blankets, or threatened to spread smallpox among the tribes by opening a bottle of ""spoiled air"" presumably of the disease (germ theory wasn't fully established in the scientific community until the 1920s.)

I'm interested in this topic, and I think that ultimately people will conclude that:

There were a wide variety of human species in the world, maybe a dozen in Africa and another dozen outside of Africa.  They all had different strengths and weaknesses.  One of those species (let's call them the globals) suddenly started expanding.  The globals were more socially focused (totalitarian) which allowed them to expand.  As the global spread they mixed with the local species.  The globals had an advantage of the hybrids who had an advantage over the locals.  As time the population went from having 100% local DNA (everyone being pureblooded local) to almost 100% global DNA (the globals won, only vestiges of the locals remain).  The ""globals"" are what we call modern humans today.

This process is still going on today.  The iceman from 5300 years ago had about 6% neanderthal DNA.  Modern Europeans have only about half of that.

http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/neandertal-ancestry-iced-2012.html

As time goes on it seems that the local DNA is getting swamped by the global DNA.  I might just be projecting, but I associate neanderthal DNA with introversion, nerdiness, etc... and the global DNA with extroversion, etc...  I wouldn't be surprised to find that the average nerd was 3% neanderthal while the average non-nerd was only 2% neanderthal.  That still means that we are 97% and 96% modern human, so not that different.

Mixing with different species of humans would have helped kickstart different races of humans, though there has been evolution since then (and continuing now and into the future).  Many people reject this idea for political reasons, so you probably don't want to bring it up.  This usually is expressed as the ""out of Africa"" vs ""separate evolution"" debate.  It turns out that both sides are right: separate evolution happened first, then one species came out of Africa and dominated them.  Of course ""out of Africa"" was also ""into Africa"".  That one species (globals as I am calling them, or modern humans) didn't just dominate the neanderthals and denisovans, but it also dominated all of the other species in Africa.",[deleted],False,1,0,

There were a wide variety of human species in the world, maybe a dozen in Africa and another dozen outside of Africa.  They all had different strengths and weaknesses.  One of those species (let's call them the globals) suddenly started expanding.  The globals were more socially focused (totalitarian) which allowed them to expand.  As the global spread they mixed with the local species.  The globals had an advantage of the hybrids who had an advantage over the locals.  As time the population went from having 100% local DNA (everyone being pureblooded local) to almost 100% global DNA (the globals won, only vestiges of the locals remain).  The ""globals"" are what we call modern humans today.

This process is still going on today.  The iceman from 5300 years ago had about 6% neanderthal DNA.  Modern Europeans have only about half of that.

http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/neandertal-ancestry-iced-2012.html

As time goes on it seems that the local DNA is getting swamped by the global DNA.  I might just be projecting, but I associate neanderthal DNA with introversion, nerdiness, etc... and the global DNA with extroversion, etc...  I wouldn't be surprised to find that the average nerd was 3% neanderthal while the average non-nerd was only 2% neanderthal.  That still means that we are 97% and 96% modern human, so not that different.

Mixing with different species of humans would have helped kickstart different races of humans, though there has been evolution since then (and continuing now and into the future).  Many people reject this idea for political reasons, so you probably don't want to bring it up.  This usually is expressed as the ""out of Africa"" vs ""separate evolution"" debate.  It turns out that both sides are right: separate evolution happened first, then one species came out of Africa and dominated them.  Of course ""out of Africa"" was also ""into Africa"".

Your comment is very thoughtful and provocative.  For starters, it certainly made me go to Wikipedia and make sure I actually knew what American exceptionalism meant! 

I think the most important argument that you make is this one:

&gt;I think if you don't have confidence in America's greatness then that would lead you to believe greatness must be reached through cooperation and assistance of other countries (AKA Liberalism on the international stage).

First, let's make sure we have our definitions in order.  This is always the most important step in a discussion but usually the one that is neglected.

I read the Wikipedia definition but I also wanted something from a more traditional source.  I found an entry on American Exceptionalism in the *Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy*, edited by Richard Dean Burns, Alexander DeConde, and Fredrik Logevall.  The definition was written by Trevor B. McCrisken, an assistant professor with the PAIS program at the University of Warwick in the UK.

This definition is no doubt oriented towards an understanding of foreign policy, but since you are discussing exceptionalism in terms of international relations I think this works well for our purposes.

Based on the definition, it seems that AE implies the following beliefs:

* that ""the United States is a special nation with a special role to play in human history"" (p. 64).
* the distinctiveness of the New World (America) from the Old World.  McCrisken:  ""In contrast, the New World was committed to freedom, morality, and the betterment of humankind"" (p. 65).
* that America will not rise and fall, but perpetually rise.  ""Practically everything that the United States does as a nation is regarded as pushing forward the boundaries of human achievement, be it in politics, industry, technology, sports, the arts, even warfare. Certainly there are some mistakes made, but they are few, they are learned from, and they are improved upon at the next attempt. No matter how many setbacks they may face along the way, Americans will continue forward resolutely, striving for progress toward forming an ever more perfect union. Americans think of themselves as exceptional, then, not necessarily in what they are but in what they could be. For this reason the sense of exceptionalism can never die, no matter how unexceptional the nation may appear in reality"" (p. 65).

On this last point, McCrisken adds something that I think is very important:  ""[Exceptionalism] is tied to what it means to be an American: to have faith in the values and principles that caused the nation to be founded and to continue to exist"" (p. 65).

According to McCrisken, all exceptionalists believe ""very strongly in the basic benevolence of their actions toward other nations. National motives are not perceived as being driven solely by the desire for material gain but also by a dedication to principles of liberty and freedom for all humankind. A corollary of this belief is that it is the duty of the United States to help the rest of the world follow the example of the chosen people"" (p. 65).

McCrisken also describes two basic ways of being an exceptionalist:  the *exemplary* and *missionary* positions (it's okay, I laughed too).  Exemplary exceptionalists believe the US should lead by example and remain basically isolationist, while the missionary exceptionalists believe we need to spread democracy/liberty because everybody wants to be American whether or not they know it.

McCrisken identifies many Presidents with various forms of exceptionalism, including Woodrow Wilson, who is also regarded as a progressivist who helped to bring the progressive position to prominence in early-20th century American politics.  Wilson not only used exceptionalist rhetoric to justify our entry into WW1, but he also created the antecedent to the UN, the League of Nations.  These objectives were related to his belief that America was a special nation with a special role to play in international affairs.  Basically, McCrisken's point is that Wilson subscribed to the ""missionary"" strand of AE.

Based on McCrisken's arguments, I don't think unilateralism vs. multilateralism is a fundamental distinction between exceptionalists and others.  Exceptionalists appear to have no problem with multilateral action.  In fact, an exceptionalist like President George W. Bush would probably be fine with multilaterial action so long as it served the missionary interests of spreading democracy.  This was, in fact, a key argument for the wars he started.  In fact, many of GWB's foreign policy decisions could be justified with the rhetoric of AE, whether they were unilaterial or multilateral.  Often, unilateralism was seen as the lesser choice but one that he was fine with because of the righteousness of America's mission in the world.

When you say ""Liberalism on the international stage,"" I am not sure if you mean the foreign policy choices of ""liberal"" US presidents, or classical liberalism.  I would argue that there are some overlaps between AE and a classical liberal approach to foreign policy.  Clearly, the most important would be the belief that liberalism is fundamentally right and will eventually spread to other nations.  However, one could also argue that past presidents have used the methods of liberal foreign policy for missionary ends.  The notion that free markets will spread democracy is fundamentally the idea that via liberal foreign policy America will be able to spread liberty and thus fulfill its destiny.  If memory serves, this is a justification used by both Republicans and Democrats.

Turning now to the first point you make:

Your first point implies that Conservatism should be associated with:

&gt; belie[f] in the free market over government [and] individualism over collectivism

I think these are basic tenets of classical liberalism, the kind that came out of the early modern era in Europe.  These views are basically held by American liberals and conservatives.  **NOTE:**  Let's be clear here.  The current Democratic party in America is itself divided amongst a variety of leftist positions.  The term ""liberal"" has, somehow, become associated with progressivism or socialism.  But an American liberal position would actually be to the right of those positions.  Both conservatives and liberals operate within classical liberalism, although they disagree about how to interpret it.

It's also important to note that both conservatives and liberals tend to endorse some limits on individual freedom and the free market.  Even Kant, one of the most important philosophers for liberalism, acknowledged a key distinction between freedom and license, arguing that there could only be freedom within limitations.

If we were to follow the line of argumentation that I quoted, we might end up creating a very black-and-white picture of conservatives as well as liberals and the rest of the left.

Going back to the specific binaries that you're describing:

&gt; free market over government
&gt; individualism over collectivism

There is definitely the notion in AE that part of America's greatness stems from its commitment to liberty, although as I pointed out the term ""liberty"" is itself open to interpretation.  This goes back to item 2 of McCrisken's definition about the separation from the Old World, where things are based on one's lineage rather than on one's merits.  But AE is not a theory of the individual, it is a theory about America itself as a special kind of political experiment.  While a strongly collectivist government would be at odds with a belief in AE, I don't think this means that every social program is automatically a rejection of AE.

Finally, there are definitely countries who believe in the free market but who are otherwise not committed to liberty.  China is a better example of this every day.

**Tl;DR:**

* A preference for multilateralism does not mean that one is not committed to American Exceptionalism
* We have to be careful about thinking about AE as a doctrine of the individual, as it is usually a belief about the greatness of America as a nation and does not argue that America's greatness comes from great individuals
* We should also be careful to not assume that all American liberals are collectivists or anti-free market, since American liberalism descends from the same intellectual DNA as American conservatism",the_federalist,False,2,0,

&gt; we're always at least in the 10s

The US is number 11 (not including Hong Kong, which is not a country). Again, Japan and South Korea are obviously much higher than us, but if you remove them it starts to cluster fairly closely. South Korea's quarter on quarter average, incidentally, is actually _decreasing_. And the demographics of those countries aren't particularly similar to the US. With the exception of Finland and Japan, they're all small and have their population centers very close together. The way they set up their infrastructure is going to be completely different than the way we do... and it's going to be much easier. If we decide to actually be fair and compare comparable states, Delaware is roughly equal to Japan and other small states like New Hampshire/Vermont/DC would be right up there in the top five. Furthermore, the countries that have the most growth (Latvia especially, but the countries with top growth in general) are the ones that are throwing just about ALL their available funds at it. That's perfectly fine for them, but not something a very large county can do. The US can't afford to put all of our eggs in one basket (yes, even if we cut the military, reformed healthcare to be cheaper, raised taxes, etc etc). And, to be honest, it doesn't even make much sense for the US to do it (outside of something that would be nice, if we had infinite capabilities).

The difference is that Westeros is the equivalent of a medieval England/Europe, and they quite clearly doesn't endorse rape and pillaging, etc - but as we all know, if you're on the winning side, they're quite happy turn a blind eye to it because:

No-one in our back four would make it into the Arsenal defence of yore, I doubt any of them could even have made the bench. Inferior to United, Chelsea and City's defence.

Santi Cazorla is our only top-tier player in midfield. Arteta and Rosicky are another year older, Diaby and Wilshere are both probably spending most of the season injured, Coquelin and Frimpong are both unpolished youngsters.

Giroud and Podolski are untested in the PL, Chamakh failed that test.

Pentax can't announce discontinuing its 2 high-end cameras without announcing and showing their replacements.  That would kill sales totally.    
Instead they do deep discounts to move the stock that is in the pipeline.  Then announce the new models and see if the old models need to additional rebates to move the bulk of the shelf units.    
    
Rebates were announced today on everything but the K-5, that had a $100 price drop this last month.

The 645D uses a sensor that was made by Kodak before they sold the Image Sensor Solutions division.  So we knew a replacement of some sort has to transpire.     
http://photorumors.com/2012/05/01/pentax-working-on-second-generation-of-the-645d-medium-format-camera/    
    
The K-5 is due for replacement this month.  B&amp;H is out of body and lens kits.    
And the K-r/K-x replacement is months overdue.  The problem being that the K-r, K-x, and K-7 are still available new over much of Europe.    
Unless the K-30 is supposed to be the entry-level dSLR.  It would have to drop in price to compete with the units from Canon, Nikon, and Sony.   
Ricehigh is saying the newest entry-level will be available in more colors than any other camera ever.    
    
The full-frame, if it is to exist and the information I have is right, could be shown at Photokina but wouldn't be able to be sold for 6 months after the a99 (with the same sensor) hits the shelves.  This may be true for the Nikon D600 also.

If you dont like the little Y bones you can cut the meat with parallel cuts - they will become soft after frying (works only when you plan to fry it) - here is the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2beAl464Is that demonstrates it around minute 4. 
Where I live most people dont even filet it - they just cut it into ""horse shoes"" and fry those in bread crumbs. Remember not to cut it into too many pieces or youo will ""multiply"" the bones. 
In case they are from ""muddy"" water (you wold know as any other fish from that water would have muddy taste - bottom feeder or not) you may leave the filets rest in milk in cool place during night.

That thread is full of comments saying ""Spanish teams are overrated??"" and then the park bus comments.

Chelsea has not lost in the last 13 matches against Spanish sides. Mind you they only faced some of the top sides because of European matches including their pride and joy Barcelona who have not beaten Chelsea since 05. Chelsea finally loses the 14th match and now all Spanish teams were underrated and the Premiership is overrated?. That is 1 defeat out of the 14 matches, no Spanish side has that record in Europe against English teams. I'm not even saying the Premiership is better but if you were to conclude on recent results then it is pretty clear which league has the stronger participants. How you base the Spanish teams are superior to all Premiership teams after 1 game is beyond me.

I'll go as far as saying that /r/Soccer is overall the worst community to discuss football for a supporter who has decent knowledge about his/other clubs. Your opinion matters as long as the majority agrees with it and in most cases it would be fine but at /r/Soccer the majority is the active userbase soaking in the completely inaccurate football knowledge from other users who have little to offer other than half-arsed puns.

So if this keeps on going at the same rate the community will only get worse as time goes on and even now it is way down in the shitter in terms of football knowledge. I think we should make a better community like /r/football and strictly moderate it against such plebs so a community only for level headed and genuine football fans. Anyone making non original puns while offering little to nothing in terms of opinion should be shown the door. 

Quality &gt; Quantity. /r/Soccer is now a great place just to get Karma via circlejerking like this ""troll"" usernamed guy is doing, check his posting history. Similar case with most of the accounts on /r/Soccer.

Fiscally, they're mostly classical liberals in favor of ""economic liberalism"", and as such favor free markets, free trade, private property, and opposing protectionism. Also, since they're often but not always fiscal hawks they're often considered ""on the right"" due to a generalized fiscal conservatism. But, this is overly simplistic since The Economist favors a free market approach more than most American Republicans, Democrats and certainly ""right-wing"" National Socialists, other nationalistic pseudo-fascist parties (as seen in Europe), etc.

You may disagree with them on these matters, but I believe the Editors respect the democratic process enough to understand the tension between classical economics, Keynesian economics, Austrian economics, etc.

On social and so-called ""moral"" concerns, The Economist tends to be liberal as well. For instance, they see the war on drugs as being counterproductive and advocate liberalization, they support a right to gay marriage, and I assume they acknowledge a need for a right to abortion.

It varies so this isn't everyone's story.  A lot of kids when they were living at home had access to copious amounts of free food and didn't have to pay rent or utilities.  They got to regularly eat nice meals because their parents were established in their careers and had been doing them for 10+ years.

The kids go off to college and it is the first time they get to experience the large difference in what they make and what their money actually buys.  The kids are usually making minimum wage, working part-time while paying for their books, rent, food and utilities.  They might also be living off(instead of working) a tiny stipend from their parents or student loans.  Depending on their living status and number of roommates, it's not untypically for 70%+ of their income to be going towards rent.  What's left over can be extremely small: $10-20 a week after bills. They can only afford some unhealthy combination like ramein, cereal, and mac and cheese for several months at a time.  That's not the whole story.

In the US, food is something we've never put as much emphasis on like Europe.  Food comes out of what is left over.  This already spartan budget is usually where people steal funds from to buy treats like alcohol or stuff they can't live without.  They make the situation worse by telling themselves, ""I'll just eat ramein a couple of times each week instead of real food to save money.""  It's not uncommon to find kids that have replaced dinner for a month with ramein because they wanted to be able to afford whatever was important to them at that time.  Some kids do it during the semesters and then you have the life time academic people that do it for several years.  Some kids live off that ramein, mac and cheese, and frozen burrito diet their entire time in undergrad and even through grad school.  That's a portion of the kids that could afford better then $10-20/week, but choose not to. 

td;lr Education is extremely expensive and the jobs that are available to kids pay just enough to sustain themselves.  Not all kids have to live that poor, but a large number do it themselves. ",[deleted],False,2,0,

And the effects of such a dose taken intravenously are instant death, finding the guy dead with the needle is his arm. And again, what I don't see discussed, is that his tox report indicates Benzo's in his system on top of the 3x lethal heroin dose. 

Believe it or not, though I dislike Courtney vehemently, I don't necessarily feel the murder theory has to be a nefarious thing. One factor in favor of the suicide theory is that, pretty much for the entire year of 1994, Kurt was recklessly abusing drugs, heroin and otherwise. He was also clearly depressed by all accounts from the point of the European tour on, and Courtney's infidelity combined with rejection of his reconciliation advances in Rome 3/94 clearly ""broke"" him in some way. Finally, the time from when he left rehab until he wound up dead, he was clearly totally ""lost"". Where am I going with this? He may have been found dead, or almost dead, by Rene, Cali, or Dylan, and the gunshot was done by them out of mercy (if not quite dead) or just to ""save the brand"" (if dead)...Kurt's death would not have generated nearly the press that it did (and still does) if it was by simple misadventure; as it is he's hailed as some sort of troubled Jesus figure (and I have loved Nirvana since I was 13 years old, so no disrespect intended). And while THAT could be taken cynically too (being about the money), it could just be about their friend.

Muito resumidamente (mesmo muito), quando vais votar nas eleições legislativas, votas numa personalidade de um partido (e, consequentemente, no seu partido) que se está a candidatar à formação de um governo. O teu voto é contado para o teu círculo eleitoral, o teu distrito, que vai eleger X deputados para a assembleia. A assembleia da república portuguesa tem 230 lugares para serem ocupados.

Esses 230 lugares vão ser ocupados conforme o número de deputados que cada partido conseguiu eleger. Se olhares para o ""U"" da assembleia, vês os partidos distribuídos entre ""esquerda"" e ""direita"" como já te foi explicado.

O partido mais votado é aquele que é convidado pelo Presidente da República a formar um governo.

Portanto tens dois poderes que são eleitos durante as eleições legislativas: os deputados da assembleia da república (o poder legislativo) e o governo (o poder executivo).

Muitas pessoas esquecem-se do primeiro poder, julgando que só estão a votar para a formação de um governo. É um erro. E porquê?

Vindo do wikipedia: "" Compete à Assembleia da República suportar o governo, tendo de aprovar o seu programa e o orçamento de estado e pode derrubá-lo por meio de uma moção de censura. A Assembleia é também o maior órgão legislador, onde são discutidos os projectos de lei. Qualquer revisão à Constituição, tem obrigatoriamente de ser aprovada por dois terços dos deputados.""

A assembleia é o maior órgão legislador.

Uma boa parte da legislação é votada em assembleia da república para ser aceite a sua aprovação pelo Presidente da República. O PR raramente veta uma lei que foi aprovada em assembleia.

Mas os partidos raramente se entendem quanto à aprovação de leis em assembleia. Daí que ouças dizer que para governar em portugal é preciso uma maioria dos deputados daquele partido (ou coligação) na assembleia. Porque quando um governo coloca a votação uma lei que julga ser benéfica para o país, o mais provável é que os outros partidos da oposição não se sintam à vontade para a aceitar prontamente.

Daí que quando um governo não tem a maioria da assembleia, tenta uma coligação com outro partido para poder passar/vetar as leis que bem entender. Claro que isto não é levado ao extremo e muitos governos/partidos acabam por aceitar algumas sugestões dos outros. Daí que se discutam as propostas em assembleia com tempo de antena para cada partido dar a sua opinião.

Ainda assim, na minha opinião, as maiorias (de coligação ou absolutas) são prejudiciais para a democracia. Se um partido ou coligação tem o poder de passar/eliminar o que bem entende, isto só pode ser um movimento contra democrático. Mas é a minha opinião.

Foi por isso que embora não seja simpatizante do BE, votei neste partido nas últimas legislativas. Fí-lo porque nas sondagens já era clara uma maioria de direita na assembleia da república. Como o país está em crise económica, a última coisa que eu queria era uma assembleia esmagada pelos partidos de direita, quase eliminando o BE. Não se esqueçam que a questão da inconstitucionalidade da subtracção dos subsídios de férias e natal foi levantada também pelo BE. Se este partido tivesse praticamente desaparecido nas eleições como se previa nas sondagens, a questão poderia não ter sido levantada.

É por isso que voto a pensar na assembleia da república e não no governo. Tanto me faz votar à esquerda ou à direita, nos extremos ou não. Se compreenderes a distribuição de lugares e o que é que isso significa na tua vida prática, talvez comeces a pensar da mesma forma.

No entanto, esta é a minha opinião, convido-te a desafiá-la e a fazeres a tua própria pesquisa sobre o sistema político português. Para isso tens que entender bem o sistema partidário, a representatividade, o Presidente da República, as autarquias, os tribunais, etc etc etc. Não é simples, mas se tiveres interesse consegues absorver o suficiente num fim-de-semana. Começa por procurar no Google ""sistema político português"", ""eleições legislativas"", ""eleições autárquicas"", etc.

Boa sorte e espero que isto te ajude a reflectir e a encontrar as tuas próprias conclusões.

Think about it. Barcelona and Real have absurd amounts of debt, which are covered by municipilaties and Spanish banks for example, even though they are in a crisis. The Dutch and German governments pay extra amounts of money for the EU because Spain is a financial mess. It's ridiculous.

When the days of extreme debts and financial bailouts are over the teams with a good transfer policy and good youth academy will finally be succesful.

Right now Ajax had a great transferwindow.

* Sold Vertonghen, on his last year of his contract for app 12 million euros. Bought a very good defender for 3 million

* Sold van der Wiel, on his last year of his contract for 5 million euros. We already have a replacement (own youth academy)

* Sold Anita for a decent amount, bought Boccara for under 500k and Schone on a free transfer.

Now, this policy was only introduced this year, but it's something I really enjoy to see. Other examples are Newcastle United, Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund. It's nice to see that intelligence and a good policy can sometimes compete with money.

I do know, however, that in the 1970s, France at least was very prudish, on par with the current United States.  There's an extremely fascinating and very well written book called ""Good Sex Illustrated"" which was written in the 1970s by a French author.  The US at the time was seen as very sexually liberated and progressive while France was the opposite.  But, the French government had published a set of sexual education manuals which were hailed as 'liberal', 'progressive', etc.  The book analyzes these sex ed materials (different books were produced for different target audience age groups) and points out a great many things that I had never even thought about before.  For instance, there is a tremendous amount of commerce-related vocabulary used related to sex (and still is).  That is fundamentally wrong since sexuality cannot be 'spent' or 'wasted' or 'lost' and most people generally agree that it is not something which should be 'traded' like a good.  But in older cultures, it was.  The sexuality of a child was (like the child themselves) the property of the father.  ""Deflowering"" a girl was a property crime committed against her father.  That is where ""saving yourself"" comes from.

The scientists didn't face any charges (arguably correctly) as they were just building weapons like our boys were doing too. The head of the nuclear bomb project was German and after developing that little gem he moved to NASA and put a guy on the moon. Not forgetting space exploration at that time was code for testing ICBM technology for potential all out nuclear war.

It's good to get some feedback from Europe.  I really think conservative Christians in the U.S. who want to blur that separation should learn a lesson from what happened in Europe, and from what is happening now in the U.S., ever since the rise of the religious right in politics.  

In the U.S., it started with Pat Robertson and Robert Reed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and culminated with the two-term presidency of George W. Bush and the religious test that has been applied to Republican politicians ever since.  Reagan never flaunted his religion, and as a result people who disliked Reagan did not blame religion for what he did.  But lots of people today leap from contempt for conservative Republican politicians to contempt for religion, because Republican politicians so visibly wrap themselves in religion, and attack Democrats as irreligious.

There is a place for religion in public life, of course.  It played a strong role in the civil rights era, for example.  But Martin Luther King was not a politician, he was an activist.  His religion guided his activism, but his activism was not about breaking down the separation of church and state.

Lee Sin - I am guessing M5 is responsible for his popularity in Europe.  I think the general feeling in NA is that Lee Sin is not as good because he falls off late game so you really need to be pretty good with him to risk that payoff.

Maokai - He wasn't as popularity in NA compared to the big three Nautilus, Nocturne and Mundo because he could be shut down from stealing his blue buff.  But nerfs to the big three meant his popularity rose as well as Blaze only playing him at MLG Arena really bought him to the forefront.

Skarner - Dig bought him over from Korea and I would guess most of his games were due to Dig playing him in NA.

Shyvana - for a time she fell outta favour when ganking &gt; counter jungling.  Seem to come back in favour recently, maybe due to the big three nerfs and SV do seem to favour him a lot.

Olaf - probably most of the games were due to NintendoX playing him in NA.

Arenanet, Chris Whiteside and especially Arenanet supportteam.

Every single minute that passes is more aggravating.
We as people are being told since we are very young that we should treat people the same way that you want them to treat you.
To never lie and to be honest, and to never categorize stereotypicaly against other people and put them in the same basket.

Not only did you mislead your playerbase and the public by annoucing that you only banned 3k people, but you were also being a bit hypocrites by doing so.

You did a great job on demonizing the offenders, to make us all look like evil malicious beard stroking world dominating evil geniuses.

When you were the hero's to the rescue smacking the ban-hammer in our bloody faces.

Since that is the story that almost all news website are publishing, some are even adding claims that 'we' destroyed the economy.

But that is far from the truth.
To all Arenanet's internet white knights, hold your horses before you blindly downvote this comment.

The truth being, one of your employees had screwed up big time in one of the most basic aspects of the game: vendor's.

We have been raised as decent human beings and told to never jump to conclusions, so we are merciful and we are not demanding that said person should be fired on the spot.

We understand that all of you have been and still are under great pressure, stress and lack of sleep for the past months.
And we believe that you guys are just humans, we all make mistakes.
We dont want to punish you for it (by creating a sh*t storm , demanding his immediate contract termination, making petitions, contact news websites ect...)

It wasn't a exploit that required the players to jump 3 times, spin around 5 times and shout ""open sezame"".

It wasn't a exploit were u had to stand on a exact location to avoid a boss mechanic so you could solo him and get his loot.

It wasn't a exploit were u had to drag a mob to a npc to let said mob kill the immune npc which u then could loot.

It was a bug that consisted of walking to a vendor and buying a items for low amount of karma, going to the mystic forge and upgrading said items to something more powerfull. (Karma's a b*tch, right ? *budum tschh*)



But the worst part is not the exploit itself per se , it's the time it took before it got fixed.

To be clear, it was not a smallscale exploit that only a few people or one guild knew about and took advantage of it for a houre.

It was a red hot glowing topic on many zones chats inc cities and their overflows , it was as hot if not more then a WoW vs GW2 debate for over 10 hours !
With Arenanet not doing anything during that period of time.

Please correct me if im wrong Arenanet, you have the exact time from when u released the cooking exploit hotfix until the karma exploit hotfix.
But it was pretty much during the whole day in EU.

Which brings me to why i called you a bit hypocrites, and i'm really not trying to bash you Anet, i think you guys are mostly awesome but there's just no other word in my vocabulary to describe it.

According to your own Rules of conduct &amp; User agreement, evryone who bought even just one weapon has broken the contract.
Anyone who wants to report a exploit is at risk of being banned since they have to experience or use the exploit in the first place to become aware of it.

With a exploit, you either do it or you dont. So please stop categorizing the offenders as if we are not human beings.
But i know why you are doing it, from a P.R and marketing perspective it's much better to say that you banned 3k people for a exploit.
Instead of saying that 3 times as many of people have been exploiting, which would had indicated that it was a pretty big blatant bug hence mistake from your part.

And this is the part, for some reason that you as a company yet human beings started to act in a stereotypical way.
You categorized the offenders, claiming that some were 'lesser offenders' and gave them a temporary ban, others were 'bigger hence more serious' offenders and received a permanent ban, yet others didn't even receive any ban based on what exactly ?! on ... numbers.

Numbers are not a way to know our motives, the 'bigger offenders' might simply just be faster, have more karma, more silver to spend on traveling, more bagspace, or more time or all of the above then the 'lesser offenders'.
Not to mention the high amount of weapons purschaced was due to the randomness of your OWN mystic forge system.
Something that you know YOURSELF that requires alot of luck and alot of trying just to get a exotic, let alone a exotic suited for your needs.

And to add insult to injury, botters of which ARE the reason to ruin many games in the history of mmo's are receiving a temporarely ban of only 72h from the start.
Dont even get me started on the obvious cooking exploit either.

So 3rd party program users received a slap on the hand, ingame bug abusers received a perma ban which didn't made any sence, which should had been the otherway around from the start.
But thank you for atleast acknowledge that mistake made by removing the perma ban.


Thanks to dumb luck of the Trading post and Mail system being down for different reasons, the exploit was contained.
I'm not gonna deny that it COULD had ruined the economy by people who would sell exotic weapons but i doubt it, but you have to admit that if people wanted exotic weapons they did not needed to jump trough loopholes to obtain them due to the simplicity of the bug.

I take full responsability of my actions, and im willing to take all the blame (like i said here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/z44ml/karma_weapons_exploit/c61c09n ) and i am thankfull of being able to receive a chance.
Even if putting evryone on the support queue was a dumb move, i'm sure the support team has plenty on their plate already, it should had be done automaticly by removing the perma ban the moment the update was posted, since i fear it will take weeks now but anyway.


But that does not alleviate's you Arenanet of explaining why it took you guys soo long to hotfix that bug and to hopefully apologize.
Not just to the exploiters who were in a sence banned due to long period of time that the bug was spreading like wildfire and thus the lack of care that Arenanet seemed to express.

But at the very least to your legitimate customers.
And that is why, i would like for not only those who agree with me, but especially those who disagree with me not to downvote this comment but instead upvote it to increase just slightly the chance of getting a answer on this important detail.

Since if you are really against exploiters, like i am (believe it or not) you want to know why it took so long and what actions they will take to avoid it in the future.

Thank you if you have read everything and sorry if it was a painful read due to my English.

It would surprise you then to realize that even though the Roman Empire and Macedonian Empire united large areas of land in Europe, the Mongolian Empire united even huger tracts of land in Asia - a fundamentally bigger place, with more people, a more ancient culture, and a larger geography.  With that being said, it is my belief that the reason the empires of Roman senators and Macedonian princes are usually so notably ""important to history"" is due to the education you have received - a western heritage.  I think the realization that not only is Asia older, but bigger, and Genghis Kahn conquered it *all*, usually shows that while both were important it is not just Hellenism and Romanism that shaped the world.

One of the things the Republicans do far, far better than the Democrats (and, frankly, better than almost any political party anywhere) is to put their differences aside once a nominee has been picked and aggressively campaign and vote for him. It's not going to matter; short of Obama doing something totally insane in the next nine months, or the economy cratering or aliens invading, Obama will keep the presidency, and the Dems will probably see some gains in 2012.

Honestly, the interesting thing to watch is going to be ""what do they learn from their (probably crushing) defeat this time?"" Last time, it was that they needed to at least pretend to care about the little guy, even if it was mostly to pander to them and tell the middle class that everything is the Dems and the poor people's faults. But that ended up making a pretty robust new wing in their party that is fighting tooth and nail with the other two. It will be interesting to see if they actually do end up splintering somehow, as a lot of pundits were saying they might in 2008.

The answer there is ""probably not,"" but the business wing of the Republican party may have just realized that it has totally fucked itself. Their previous tactic had been to mouth platitudes about morality to keep the moralist wing engaged with them, while knowing that, because they were rich, they could privately do whatever they wanted, or, at worst, fly to Canada/Europe/India/Thailand and do it. Now, their Southern strategy from the 70s on is turning around and biting them in the ass, because the moralist wing has a new ally in the Tea Party wing; they tend to actually agree on moral issues with each other, unlike the business wing which is privately making ""what a jackoff"" hand motions whenever the moralist wing has its back turned, and the moralists don't really care much one way or another about as long as the godless Communist muslim socialists aren't running things, so the two are a better fit for each other. The business wing currently looks like the mad scientist at the part of the Frankenstein film when he realizes his monster can (barely) think, it can feel, and it's not really mad at the villagers after all, it's mad at its creator. It doesn't help that FoxNews is on the fence about whether the business wing, the moralist wing, or the Tea Party wing is going to be the horse to back, because, while it is a right wing propaganda machine, it's also a business.

Didn't we develop and send on loan so more potentially world class players, didn't we improve upon our previous season.

The amount of misinformed over reacting anger surrounding this transfer window is obscene.

Arsene Wenger has worked in the same way every year, he always states he doesn't want to buy anyone just because, he needs players to fit with the quality and system both on and off the field.

Last deadline day we bought in Andre Santos, Per, Arteta and Yossi and Park. Granted something behind the scenes was up with the park transfer but the other 4 were all important purchases. Per and Arteta had proven quality. And Yossi and Santos gave us a strength in depth and an experience in age and European football.

This year we have already bought in 3 quality players. Who are settled into training and settling into the league. We had no Need for anything more. We sold RVP so Wenger is confident between Giroud and Poldi they have enough to make up his goals. And as for Alex Song, I'm really not sure where this reputation of being a quality DM that we need to replace. If you watch highlights of last season he had some impressive moments, but if you watched every match he was average making some extreme howlers on the way. He failed to track back repeatedly he dropped behind central defenders allowing players to jump our offside trap and he gave away possession looking for glory ball. In my opinion he is exactly thesame style as Diaby a box to box midfielder. But Diaby has much more dicipline. If you are looking for a DM coqulain is much more defensively minded and in tough away matches will provide much more to our defence than Song.

In short we are not football managers, coaches or even informed experts, we are fans, we should sit back and take faith in the way our club is run as it is clearly very well. And we should support our team and manager.

I also mentioned, in another post, that travelling along a coastline is far simpler than sailing across open water. As we know Columbus's voyage went majorly across open water while, as [this](http://thelistcafe.com/images/stories/Lists/059_Top_10_Greatest_World_Explorers/greatest-world-explorers-leif-ericson-map.jpg) map clearly shows, Ericsson's was mostly following coastlines. This would have made Ericsson's voyage significantly simpler in terms of navigation, and, though it is not certain who's voyage is longer in precise miles since Ericsson stuck to the easier-to-navigate coastlines and thereby lengthened his journey, it's clear that as-the-crow-flies, Columbus got much farther from his point of origin than Ericsson did. In addition, if that is not enough to prove that Columbus's crossing of the Atlantic is worthy of some measure of praise just as Ericsson's is, the land Ericsson sought on his voyage had in fact already been seen by another sailor, Bijarni Herjolfsson, and Ericsson set with man's information in mind. Ericsson already knew, unlike Columbus, what the land he was looking for looked like, approximately where it was, and about how far away it was. Whatever Columbus thought he knew about the location, distance, and appearance of his destination, he had no way to know about the intervening continents upon which he instead landed. 

So yes, the Vikings reached North America before Columbus did, but Columbus journey, in my opinion, wass not only just as challenging as Ericsson's, but also was infinitely more significant in terms of European history. Columbus's voyage connected the European world to the America's in a way that Ericsson's voyage had not. Where Ericsson's voyage had little impact outside of Greenland, Columbus's voyage ultimately not only sparked transatlantic trade between Europe in the Americas, but led to a transferal of crops, such as corn and potatoes to England and Ireland, that allowed the European population explosion to take place and prevented famine for centuries to come. His voyage contributed significantly to the rise of Europe as a world power. This is just as important as the fact that Columbus had not the coastlines of Greenland and Northern Canada to guide him, nor the information about his destination that Herjolfsson provided Ericsson with when he sailed across the Atlantic. I think it is clear the Columbus, regardless of Ericsson's voyage beating his, is deserving of credit if not for his navigational skills, than for his historical impact.",Rowona,False,2,0,

You know, it would really help if theists did not escape after being asked a few hard questions.

I think that religion in Europe diminished a lot in catholic countries. Catholic church has always refused to adapt its sex rules to a changing world. Catholic priests are very reluctant to adapt their views in this domain. Reliable contraception changed the way that sex, family and fidelity can work in harmony in our society.

Before contraception, out-of-wedlock sex was a very immoral behavior : it could create a situation where a woman would have to raise a child alone at a time where female workers were very uncommon. Even had it been more accepted, it would be a really unfair situation where men could escape all responsibility for sex while women would have to raise children alone. The Catholic church gave a sensible advice : no sex before marriage. Therefore children would be born in an economically more viable environment. 

Now comes contraception. What should the Church say if it wanted to stay a source of social stability? ""Do not have unprotected sex outside wedlock!"". That's the only constraint. But instead they decided that anything new about sex was just wicked and evil. I think that protestants are far more tolerant about that. Pastors can marry and understand more about sex and family life than Catholic priests. They could more easily see society change. Oh, there are bigots, sure, but there is not a higher bigot authority that mandates a dogma all way down to all protestant churches. ",keepthepace,False,2,0,

1. ""Plain"" pizza is unheard-of. I went to a ""pizza bar"" in Finland and casually commented to my Finnish friend that it was strange that a pizza bar would be out of plain slices. She asked me what I meant by ""plain"", and when I explained, she literally thought I was joking. They have no such thing there. You say we ""go crazy with toppings"", but I feel the opposite: here, toppings are sort of an exception to the rule, while from what I saw they were essential in Europe. Granted, the big pizza chains (Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns) all push ridiculous topping combinations as a way to differentiate themselves. But honestly, the big chains are not considered ""real"" pizza here to begin with (at least not by NY pizza snobs like me).

2. Tomato slices. Margherita pizza (with tomato slices) is the closest thing I found to ""plain"" pizza in Europe, and I cannot describe the degree to which it assaulted my sensibilities as a pizza-loving New Yorker.

3. It's hard to describe, but there is a fundamental difference in the *concept* of pizza, which I think is tied into the reason Europeans are more likely to use a knife and fork. Eating European pizza with a knife and fork seems appropriate; eating American pizza with a knife and fork is laughable. Part of is is because the crust in Europe tend to be less solid. It's more like regular bread, and you just can't pick it up like you would here in NY. When I was in Europe, I felt like ""this isn't pizza, it's just bread with sauce and cheese and things on top"". I realize that's basically the definition of pizza, but that's not the way we approach it. It's also treated more like a sit-down meal than a ""whenever"" food, compared to America. I was shocked when I stepped into a Pizza Hut in Sweden, which is one of the cheapest fast food chains in America, and found velvet carpets and golden chandeliers. It was a fancy(ish) restaurant. The pizza reflected this, not in its quality, but in its concept. Most of the pizzerias I saw in Europe were more like restaurants.

Again, the styles vary everywhere, so this is a generalization. Also, most of my experience in Europe was in Finland and Sweden, which makes this even more of a generalization, I'm sure. Again, I'm only half-serious.",Mikuro,False,1,0,

Germans like it very, very fair in that department. 

We bought a (roughly) 2,300sft home here in the US, which is considered humongous. The first question from my aunt was ""how are you going to keep THAT clean?"", because Germans consider help with cleaning their house either as frivolous/arrogant, or as a failure. Besides, they also are very intent on keeping their privacy and don't want strangers roaming their house all the time. And yes, most everything is smaller in Germany, inlcuding garages. The suburban McMansions, where the garages take up the entire front of the home and then there is a little side entrance, are ugly and vulgar. Architecturally, the attempt is made to integrate them into the front, or side, of the house much better. 

Bonus round: The fact that I have a huge water heater in my basement here in the US, constantly keeping the water at a certain temperature, boggles my (Geman) familiy's mind. It's considered wasteful when there are more efficient ways to do it. Which I will as soon as get an integrated solar heating system up that also heats my warm water. Don't get me started on using the dryer all the time instead of hanging laundry out to dry....

AC: a) there hasn't been a historic need to cool your houses in Europe - which may change with global warming since the summers recently have been much hotter, b) to ""temperate"" your house, you open what's called ""a window"" there, c) German are very sensitive to what's called ""Durchzug"", meaning they can't stand a cold draft in any form for very long and almost every single German I know in the US despises AC for that reason, including myself. Many joking conversations with my friends led me to conclude that this is an insurmountable cultural difference ;) There are places, were you can't live without AC, of course, like Texas of Florida, but that's not the point of this exemplification.

The reason politics in America is a ""team sport"" is that the US has a comparatively large population (approximately 19x the size of Holland's) and is geographically huge. This means that voters feel like they need to be conscious of who is ""likely"" to win for fear of ""wasting"" their vote. So, while the US has many parties beyond the dems and repubs, they get relatively few votes because people feel like no matter what they do locally, those candidates don't have a chance. Political candidates in a huge country need to appeal to a larger variety of voters, and they need to raise a ton more money. No one can raise that kind of money without a massive team behind them; so smaller parties are already out of the running. And many people feel like ""Well, I'd vote for a green party candidate, but they could never win anything in the South, so it's pointless."" This is a geographical problem Holland doesn't have. 

Holland is small and has a population that's comparable to a couple US cities. If you liked a third-party candidate in a situation like that, it would be MUCH more feasible that (a) that candidate could raise enough money to be viable and that (b) a candidate who appeals to you is likely to appeal to many other people in your country because you live in relatively similar situations. You don't have the same spread as the US, where people in different regions live in basically totally different economies and cultures, and candidates have to appeal to ALL of them.

This is not to say I'm a fan of the US system, or that American voters are not stupid. (Though it's worth noting that many, perhaps even most, Americans don't vote. I think that accounts for many of the reality-TV watchers). But comparing the US system with a tiny European country is a bit disingenuous. Americans could be the most progressive, educated voters on the planet and we'd probably still only have two main political parties because nobody likes voting for a sure loser.

I live near and attend a very large university so I have a reasonable amount of contact with european white people - however they are only highly educated ones. In general they seem either:

a) very silly. An interaction with a rowdy group of Italian exchange students comes to mind in which they wanted to pose with me and some of my black girlfriends because it was chic I guess? They were constantly inebriated so who knows. Another incident involves a German guy who stayed with a friend of mine. One of his first questions to my (also black) friend was ""are we going to meet any gangsters?"" with a sort of innocence which implied he had no idea what a gangster was, or any idea about black culture at all. The guy was very kind and well meaning and quickly learned better.

So to make a generalization, there are those who have only been exposed to the glamour of music videos and think all black people are glamorous. However they are generally easy to re-educate. 

b) Very politically correct. This is among the mostly the highly educated - those holding masters or doctorates. They are well versed in the PC catchphrases of the day, i.e. more likely to refer to someone as a ""person of color"" and almost never use the simpler term ""black"". However, these people are virtually indistinguishable (with regards to race relations) from other highly educated white people.

Did you actually do any research on this subject before commenting, or are you just going on the assumption that the US is shitty and regressive? 

The fact is, bicycle lane projects have been underway in many US cities for some time now. Perhaps not on the scale of Copenhagen, but they're there. I think the real problem in America is that people just don't ride with the same enthusiasm that they do in Europe, or if they do, they see it as recreation and not transportation. Any suggestion that they ride to work, school or various errands is usually met with any number of excuses why they can't or shouldn't, coupled with the sentiment that they would love to, if only.

Quite frankly, I think one of the biggest hindrances to widespread adoption of cycling in America, at least in my region (Southern California) is that there is social stigma attached to it. It is seen as the mode of transportation of the homeless, immigrants, and the very poor. 

In short, yes, the US could use more bicycle infrastructure, but the biggest hurdle IMO is changing people's mindsets.",31109b,False,67,0,

Unlike Europe, the members of that coalition are not clearly delineated in different parties. In Europe, you will have a specific party for the Greens, the socialists, the center rights, the center lefts, the isolationists, the free market proponents, and many other parties that will align themselves around any number of other issues like foreign policy, social rights, immigration, etc. In the United States, we have two parties (most of the time) called Democrats and Republicans. These parties are not American equivalents of any of the European parties however. In Europe, after an election, all the varying parties win seats in a parliament and then have to come together to form a governing coalition. In the United States, an individual party IS the coalition. Today, Democrats are the coalition of many different groups, often with conflicting interests. They are made up of the American equivalent of the Greens, labor unions, social liberals, and often non-interventionists (though I'm aware that this has changed over the decades). The Republicans are a coalition of the religious conservatives, free market advocates, neoconservatives, and many others. The job of each parties' presidential candidate is to keep the coalition together for the upcoming election. This means compromising among groups within your party/coalition. It's similar to the way European parties will have to give up on key issues after an election in order to bring another party in so that they can have a governing coalition. The difference between Europe and the US is that, in the US, we know what the coalition will be ahead of time. When you vote Republican, you know that you are voting for the coalition of the religious conservatives, free market advocates, and neoconservatives. Similarly with the Democrats and labor, environmentalists, and social liberals.

That precision allows the team to compare the nuclear genome of this girl, who lived in Siberia’s Denisova Cave more than 50,000 years ago, directly to the genomes of living people, producing a “near-complete” catalog of the small number of genetic changes that make us different from the Denisovans, who were close relatives of Neandertals. “This is the genetic recipe for being a modern human,” says team leader Svante Pääbo, a paleogeneticist at the institute.

Ironically, this high-resolution genome means that the Denisovans, who are represented in the fossil record by only one tiny finger bone and two teeth, are much better known genetically than any other ancient human — including Neandertals, of which there are hundreds of specimens. The team confirms that the Denisovans interbred with the ancestors of some living humans and found that Denisovans had little genetic diversity, suggesting that their small population waned further as populations of modern humans expanded. “Meyer and the consortium have set up the field of ancient DNA to be revolutionized — again,” says Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not part of the team. Evolutionary geneticist Sarah Tishkoff of the University of Pennsylvania agrees: “It’s really going to move the field forward.”


Pääbo’s group first gave the field a jolt in May 2010 by reporting a low-coverage sequence (1.3 copies on average) of the composite nuclear genome from three Neandertals. They found that 1 percent to 4 percent of the DNA of Europeans and Asians, but not of Africans, was shared with Neandertals and concluded that modern humans interbred with Neandertals at low levels.

Just 7 months later, the same group published 1.9 copies on average of a nuclear genome from a girl’s pinky finger bone from Denisova Cave. They found she was neither a Neandertal nor a modern human — although bones of both species had been found in the cave — but a new lineage that they called Denisovan. The team found “Denisovan DNA” in some island Southeast Asians and concluded that their ancestors also interbred with the ancestors of Denisovans, probably in Asia.

But these genomes were too low quality to produce a reliable catalog of differences. Part of the problem was that ancient DNA is fragmentary, and most of it breaks down into single strands after it is extracted from bone.

Meyer’s breakthrough came in developing a method to start the sequencing process with single strands of DNA instead of double strands, as is usually done. By binding special molecules to the ends of a single strand, the ancient DNA was held in place while enzymes copied its sequence. The result was a sixfold to 22-fold increase in the amount of Denisovan DNA sequenced from a meager 10-milligram sample from the girl’s finger. The team was able to cover 99.9 percent of the mappable nucleotide positions in the genome at least once, and more than 92 percent of the sites at least 20 times, which is considered a benchmark for identifying sites reliably. About half of the 31 copies came from the girl’s mother and half from her father, producing a genome “of equivalent quality to a recent human genome,” says paleoanthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who was not part of the team.

Now, the view of the ancient genome is so clear that Meyer and his colleagues were able to detect for the first time that Denisovans, like modern humans, had 23 pairs of chromosomes, rather than 24 pairs, as in chimpanzees. By aligning the Denisovan genome with that of the reference human genome and counting mutations, the team calculated that the Denisovan and modern human populations finally split between 170,000 and 700,000 years ago.

The researchers also estimated ancient Denisovan population sizes by using methods to estimate the age of various gene lineages and the amount of difference between the chromosomes the girl inherited from her mother and father. They found that Denisovan genetic diversity, already low, shrank even more 400,000 years ago, reflecting small populations at that time. By contrast, our ancestors’ population apparently doubled before their exodus from Africa.

The team also counted the differences between Denisovans and chimps, and found that they have fewer differences than do modern people and chimps. The girl’s lineage had less time to accumulate mutations, and the “missing evolution” suggests she died about 80,000 years ago, although the date is tentative, says co-author David Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard University. If this date — the first proof that a fossil can be directly dated from its genome — holds up, it is considerably older than the very rough dates of 30,000 to more than 50,000 years for the layer of sediment where the fossils of Denisovans, Neandertals, and modern humans all were found.

The team says the new genome confirms their previous findings, showing that about 3 percent of the genomes of living people in Papua New Guinea come from Denisovans, while the Han and Dai on mainland China have only a trace of Denisovan DNA. Furthermore, the team determined that Papuans have more Denisovan DNA on their autosomes, inherited equally often from both parents, than on their X chromosomes, inherited twice as often from the mother. This curious pattern suggests several possible scenarios, including that male Denisovans interbred with female modern humans, or that these unions were genetically incompatible, with natural selection weeding out some of the X chromosomes, Reich says.

The new genome also suggests one odd result. By using the detailed Denisovan genome to sharpen the view of their close cousins the Neandertals, the team concludes that living East Asians have more Neandertal DNA than Europeans have. But most Neandertal fossils are from Europe; Paleoanthropologist Richard Klein of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, calls the result “peculiar.”

Most exciting to Pääbo is the “nearly complete catalog” of differences in genes between the groups. This includes 111,812 single nucleotides that changed in modern humans in the past 100,000 years or so. Of those, eight were in genes associated with the wiring of the nervous system, including those involved in the growth of axons and dendrites and a gene implicated in autism. Pääbo is intrigued in particular by a change in a gene that is regulated by the so-called FOXP2 gene, implicated in speech disorders. It is “tempting to speculate that crucial aspects of synaptic transmission may have changed in modern humans,” the team wrote. Thirty-four genes are associated with disease in humans. The list suggests some obvious candidates for gene-expression studies. “The cool thing is that it isn’t an astronomically large list,” Pääbo says. “Our group and others will probably be able to analyze most of them in the next decade or two.”

Back in Leipzig, the mood is upbeat, as researchers pull fossil samples off the shelf to test anew with “Matthias’s method.” First on Pääbo’s list: Neandertal bone samples, to try to produce a Neandertal genome to rival that of the little Denisovan girl.",ellieD,False,20,0,

Is it? I would rather have a good healthy squad than an excellent injured squad. Besides, what tells you this year's is worse than last? Have you actually watched milan play last year? Is ""long ball to zlatan + his magic"" considered good tactics? We had no midfield last year. Nocerino, aquilani (injured) and van bommel/ambrosini is much, much worse than nocerino + de jong + montolivo. 2 italy internationals and 1 netherlands. With these guys bossing the middle you should expect lots of goals being scored by different players, not just Zlatan. 

So midfield this year is better than midfield last year.

Now for the attack. Last year our attack was Zlatan. Pato, injured, barely scored. Robinho didn't score much, SES was too young. Now,  say they stay healthy, robinho + pato can score 15+ goals each very easily. And we got Giampaolo Pazzini. Sure the man had a shit season last year, but he's pazzini. He was doing magic back in fiorentina when parterened up with Montolivo, now we got both. We also signed Bojan and Mbaye-Niang. So, we can say that we have one of the youngest, fastest forwards in Europe. If each of them score 10,15+ goals we don't need Zlatan creating chances and scoring. We have our excellent midfield creating chances, and the forwards just concentrate on attacking.

For the defense, I have nothing to say. It is worse, but not as much as non-milan fans think. On the right we have Abate, solid. same as last year. On the left, we have the same shit as last year. Now in the mid, we lost Nesta and Silva. Nesta last season was good, but worse than the season before, and worse than the season before that. He was injured a lot, and when we replaced him with say, Bonera, we really suffered the consequences. What about Silva? Well, we lost a world class CB, but selling thiago to PSG was the only way to sell Zlatan. if we waited 1 more year, Zlatan's price would've dropped by at least a half. Now, we have Acerbi and Zapata covering the defense. They might not be world-class defenders, but they are young, very promising youngesters. I've seen zapata play 1 friendly and I can honestly say he's a beast: very strong, excellent pace, good positioning. We will also be signing Yanga-Mbiwa next year (and perhaps in january?), so our defense will become much, much, MUCH better. With 1 or 2 signing each year from now on, we will have a squad that will be able to compete for like 7 years.

But this time we won't make the same mistakes.

The conservative shift in recent years is going to swing back, and the 2010's are going to make the 60s look pale starting in a few years.  There is going to be some HUGE events: race riots, protests, and possibly a few events where people actually storm some symbolic building (like their state capital, an entire campus, possibly wall street) and tear the place apart.  Lots of deaths on both sides.  But we'll recover: we had campus shootings and race riots in the 60s and got out of that eventually.  

Huge turnover in the political demographic fueled by more bad weather events, further division between poor and rich, 2-3 pathological scares, a shrinking disenfranchised middle class, and suddenly more access to instant media than ever (the 1960s was television, the 2010s will be Internet).  And some of the old fat cats in charge will die out.  The 2020s and early 30s will be a prosperity boom, which will then crash due to global food, energy, and water crises.  The 2050s will be a little on the bleak side, but that will recover in the 2070s somewhat.

The Internet and rising energy prices will force more telecommuting; if your job does not require your presence, you won't go.  The traffic will peak at some point and then sharply drop off.  Travel will be reduced to mostly consumer goods; deliveries, services, and such. Most highways will be subsidized by heavy tolls.  Mass transit via electric vehicles will be much more common.  Neighborhoods will change to be more eco-friendly: biking, small EVs, with streets easy to navigate.  ""Your local neighborhood,"" will be more of a focus.  Homes will be more and more making their own supplemental energy and technology will drive electrical costs down.  Cities will become denser, and more ""planned cities"" in the middle of nowhere will be common. (One famous one will spring up in Nebraska that pisses the HELL out of the native Americans).

Fresh water will start to become a serious issue.  Meat will become too expensive and considered a luxury, and then kind of pushed to the side as a little backwards and shameful.  New materials easier to recycle will replace a lot of things we normally throw away: a strange kind of mylar-like foil will be your standard wrapping for most non-crushable goods (or stuff shipped carefully, like fruits), and a harder plastic-ceramic-like substance or recycled metal for most hard daily objects (dinnerware, housing goods like lamps, the covers of appliances, and so on).  Things will be shipped to your home FAR more than you going to go out and buy them, and small shipping crates (similar to [http://oceancontainer.com/products-2.html?gclid=CKW9pafYlLICFQjc4AodA1MAXQ](these) ) will be in most people's yards kind of like how shipping containers get reused.

China will be a superpower and then crash and burn.  Tensions between the US and China will force a lot of people to side with the ""allies"" of America, thanks in part to Europe.  There will be conflicts in India and Indonesia due to this uneasy ""new cold war.""  Taiwan will be invaded and completely taken over, which will be the rallying cry for decades how evil China is/was.  What will kill China is similar to what killed off the Soviet Union; poor resource management, government corruption, and eventually just general incompetence.  But even so, they will face rampant starvation, disease, and a dependence on other countries for resources (notably oil and gas, but food is a close second).  They will also lose a lot of their own people who will flee, notably their ""brain talent,"" who will flee to other countries, become a resource for new technologies, and eventually turn the tide.

""Artificial intelligence"" will become far more common, but poorly defined.  Is a delivery vehicle ""intelligent"" because it tries to protect itself from accidents, tries to stay operational as long as possible, and do what it can to continue to get fuel?  Is ""fire"" alive because it feeds, reproduces, and grows?  By 2060, still no one will have a good answer.  But your house will ""know"" who you are, logic loops like HAL9000 had will cause some mostly humorous, but in some cases scary, accidents.  Programmers will be blamed.  The new slave labor, the new migrant workers, will be mostly ""robots"" that do a majority of the work.

The next super power will most likely be South and Central America, but the United States will still be paddling in 3rd place, kind of like how Europe was during the end of the cold war.

&gt; In remarks published Egypt’s Al-Akhbar newspaper in November 2011, Ahmadinejad stated ""This entity [Israel] can be compared to a kidney transplanted in a body that rejected it. “Yes it will collapse and its end will be near.”[

...

&gt; In July 2012, ahead of Qods Day, Ahmdainejad said that ""any freedom lover and justice seeker in the world must do its best for the annihilation of the Zionist regime in order to pave the path for the establishment of justice and freedom in the world,"" and that the ultimate objective of world forces must be the annihilation of the ""Zionist regime"". Ahmadinejad added that “the Zionist regime is both the symbol of the hegemony of the Zionism over the world and the means in the hand of the oppressor powers for expansion of their hegemony in the region and in the world” and that ""liberating Palestine"" would solve all of the world's problems. Ahmadinejad also made allegations and repeated traditional anti-Semitic slurs that ""Zionists"" control the world's media and financial systems, and that a ""horrible Zionist current"" had been managing world affairs for ""about 400 years.""

...

&gt; In August 2012, at an annual protest against the existence of Israel,[114] Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that ""the very existence of the Zionist regime is an insult to humanity"" and that ""the Zionist regime and the Zionists are a cancerous tumor. Even if one cell of them is left in one inch of (Palestinian) land, in the future this story (of Israel's existence) will repeat.""[115] Ahmadinejad also said that Israel would soon be finished off, and that “the nations of the region will soon finish off the usurper Zionists in the Palestinian land"".[114] Ahmadinejad added that ""it is dangerous if even 10% of the territory is given to the Zionists."" Ahmadinejad also said, ""The western powers cannot tolerate criticism of the Zionist regime. They feel compelled to defend it.""

CLG.eu wasn't given a lot of time to get there settings down right, and they were having sound issues with their computers. This is true. However, they also had illegal headsets with them (ironically, the not-allowed ones worked...)

People have said that they lost the first game because of the sound issues and having to scream to be heard in the sound proof booths (very loud inside, etc). The second and third matches were done with sound and TSM won game 3 in a close match.

Point being: CLG.eu lost. They had equipment trouble, but they also had illegal equipment and could've been DQ'd right there. TSM was inf avor of them being given more time, the tourney admins forced the game to go however (schedule to be kept.) Bottom line though, CLG.eu lost.

I'm not an expert on the details of the pre-Christian religions of Celtic speaking people, but I did take a course that went over some of the details. Basically, natural features like lakes, rivers, forests etc. were believed to have been inhabited by female supernatural beings (which is why Celts loved to throw their shit into bodies of water), while male deities are ones based around crafts, war, the arts etc. Some academics theorize that the female supernatural beings represent leftover religious figures from one or more pre-Celtic people, while the male deities are imports from warlike Celtic speaking people who were really good at smithing and other crafts. The two kinds of deities supposedly synthesized into regional pantheons.

It makes sense for the military, since your job is almost always to kill the enemy.  But it also shows how violent our police force are trained to be- perhaps, to some degree, out of necessity, because we have some very violent criminals.

My training is as an infantryman and a military policeman, so I've been instructed in rifle marksmanship and handguns.  Like I said, I was trained to shoot center mass.  If someone is *coming at me*, I am shooting center mass, because I have to kill them before they can get close enough to disarm me.

Maker: Grand Rapids Bookcase &amp; Chair Company (Lifetime) Year: Formed 1911 Reference: Arts &amp; Crafts Furniture Design: The Grand Rapids Contribution, Don Marek

""Notes: Grand Rapids Bookcase and Chair Co. (Lifetime), Hastings and Grand Rapids, MI. Formed 1911 by A.A. Barber by merger of G.R. Bookcase Co. and Barber Brothers Chair Co., both of which had produced A&amp;C furniture since 1903. Called new line “Lifetime Furniture.” Produced various styles, including Cloister (1911), Jacobean (1913) and Puritan (1917). Shopmark appeared as paper label, decal or brand. Manufactured a high quality A&amp;C line, often with Stickley influence, but featuring unique design details. By 1920s had discontinued A&amp;C for popular European revival style.""

Based on that, I'd guess this is Puritan style, would that be right?

I'm confused. So, most historians say joshua existed and did various things because of his judaism.

So we've got historical backing for joshua, but not for his being commanded by God, etc.

Fascism is one of the reasons why Verhoeven chose Buenos Aires as the hometown of the heroes. [Argentina's past is full of fascist overtones.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_in_South_America#Argentina) Some of its politicians even tried to emulate Mussolini at some point. And after WW2 they even harbored Nazi war criminals.

But still, why did they choose Argentina and not Italy or Germany?

In the Starship Troopers book the heroes were from the Philipines. And because of Spanish colonialism many Filipinos have Hispanic names. Some Hispanic names from the book that were transfered to the movie were Juan ""Johnnie"" Rico, Dizzy Flores, and Carmen Ibanez.

But you can't make an action blockbuster movie for the American market without characters that Americans can relate to so he had to make the characters white. And if you want a country of white people who have Hispanic names then you want Argentina. 90% of their population is of European descent. Their European component is 60% Italian and 40% Spaniard.

What puzzles me the most is why so many people didn't realize that the movie was a satire of fascism. Kids squashing bugs and kids smiling while wearing military uniforms contrasted with soldiers getting their guts ripped out by the bugs made this obvious.

Extra reading: 

Starship Troopers 3 was loyal to the tone of the first film. And one of the major themes of the movie is how religion can be used to control people in a fascist environment. And they also extended on the idea that the humans who follow the propaganda of their totalitarian governments aren't really that different from hive based insects.",adolfojp,False,8,0,

We play on the EU server. The dominant language in the EU is NOT English, it's quite a mixed pot. So when we play on EU, while we prefer English speakers - and it being the internet many people from EU speak English quite well, despite it not being their first language, but all but the assholes of the community understand when they can't, despite it being annoying.

Throw in the Russians. I'm not being racist, at all. This is speaking from someone who frequently plays in parties with Russians who think the same. Russians, don't care. They give NO fucks for anyone else. They have their own server, where they can play and speak Russian. Instead they come onto the EU server and abuse the fuck out of everyone, refuse to speak any word of English that ISN'T abuse, and then play horribly - This is the 90% of the time. There are a few times when I play with Russians and they're quite pleseant and I enjoy the game, they're helpful, and these experiences stop me hating Russians.

The point of it is this, there wouldn't BE a problem if Russians could actually communicate with us. DotA2 - I dare say more so that League - is a game EXTREMELY reliant on teamwork, co-ordination, and moving together. When you're on the server when the majority put in the effort to speak a language, and then have a minority which curse at you in a foreign language, refuse to try and communicate, play badly and blame it on you, you can immediately expect players to stereotype and dislike that minority. 

I for one, when I'm in a game which has French people, make an effort to speak French because I learned that. When I see someone speaking German, I don't abuse them, because they don't abuse me for speaking English. I've had numerous encounters of Russians coming on to the server and abusing French, Germans, English, you name it, and then going on about ""Fucking Europeans"". It's not a racial issue - it's an extreme communication problem exacerbated by the self-absorbed attitude of many players - predominantly Russian.

I'm sorry but there is a big difference. First off, immunization is not just for the health of the individual but for the health of everyone around them as well. We have regulated and required shots due to this fact to make sure the spread of disease, infection, and what not is minimized. We have regulations that require certain things to happen. Surgery is specific to that individual. Surgery is a last method option that is only used when you must have it done. Circumcision is not required surgery by any means.

&gt; It's legal because infants are incapable of giving or denying consent. If we were talking about a child who was old enough to understand potential risks and benefits, that's a different story. Until the child reaches that age, parents have the legal right to decide what is best for their child so long as they don't do anything unreasonable. Circumcision does not fall under the unreasonable category.

You lost me here. First of all, when can a child understand the risks and benefits of something? That doesn't develop until 12-13 or so (or even later). It is in fact unreasonable to subject a baby/infant to an intense operation. And since you think circumcision does not fall under the unreasonable category, let's just be all equal about this and allow clitoral hoods to be chopped off as well. Since circumcision for female and male is a ""reasonable"" thing to do. No unnecessary surgery is reasonable.   No culture subjection is reasonable. 
 
&gt;     

&gt; Circumcision has not been shown to be harmful most cases, and in fact has been shown to provide benefits to the child. That's why circumcision is not illegal.

Oh really? In every case, the penis is damaged. It just depends on how much due to how much skin is left. There are so many more benefits to have a foreskin. And infant circumcision seems to be only legal in the USA and a handful of other countries. Europe, Canada, Australia, and many other 1st world countries have banned or in the process of banning infant circumcision.  

&gt;You're trying to do just that for outlawing circumcision.

No, I don't believe like some illogical religion. I research and understand. I look up the facts. And the fact of the matter is circumcision was a byproduct of religious views, cultural mentality, and propaganda. If you do a quick search, you can find many articles supporting claims that list in detail  the benefits of a foreskin.

[For example some of the benefits include:](http://www.noharmm.org/advantage.htm) 

1. Full penis length and circumference
2. Protection.
3. Ridged bands.
4. Gliding action. 
5. Specialized sensory tissue.
6. The frenulum.
7. Proper blood flow
8. Immunological defense.
9.  Langerhans cells.
10. Proper lymph flow.
11. Estrogen receptors.
12. Apocrine glands.
13. Sebaceous glands.
14. Dartos fascia.
15. Natural texture and coloration of the glans.

In fact, you have the potential to be pretty friggin' hot - you're already well on your way there! You're tall, and you have what appears to be a masculine build - broad shoulders that narrow down by the waist, and I can't quite tell because *none of your pictures involve you looking at the camera* but you look like you have very nice eyes.  But anyway here's a bullet pointed list that might help you - there's some overlap with what others have posted but I'm sure you won't mind.

* Clothing - you've got the nice shirt/jeans combo down - that's great! Chicks (or maybe it's just me) dig that stuff. If you've got the spare money, do yourself a favor and consider tailoring some of your shirts to be more fitted at the waist (I've been stalking a few of your posts). Your jeans could also afford to be a little tighter, or at the very least, straighter. I've noticed that they seem to bundle up at your feet as well, so for this look you may also want them a bit shorter. Nothing wrong with looser jeans, it just doesn't fit the slightly european look that I think you'd look fantastic in.

* Speaking of, I think you'd look great with a european-style haircut! You look remarkably similar to someone else I know who underwent a similar makeover and now looks *amazing*. At the very least, just grow your hair out [a little bit](http://images.askmen.com/galleries/men/david-beckham/pictures/david-beckham-picture-1.jpg). Feel free to use a teensy bit of hair gell to complete the look - just don't go all Jersey Shore on us, bro. I think even [something longer](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5XDpjr6x-G4/TvwEj8sE3qI/AAAAAAAABzA/hDXnxE68S0Y/s320/Euro%2BMen%2BShort%2BHair.jpg) might suit you really well - just hold off on that until you've got the acne on your forehead cleared up.

* Invest in new glasses (or get contacts) if you can. Those ones are rather 90's, no offense. This applies to both guys and girls - eyewear can literally make or break a look. For you, I think maybe a somewhat thicker and darker frame would look great - this look is admittedly more hipster, but is much better the ""nerdy"" vibe that your current ones give off, I'm sure. Pair this with your new hairstyle. Feel free to shamelessly ask your eye glasses person which new glasses would look better on you - being vain is good in this instance!

* Acne. People have mentioned this. If you're having trouble finding products, and can afford it, just go to a dermatologist. They probably know what's up better than we do and can help you. At the very least, make sure to wash your face every morning and evening, and if possible, gently wipe your face with water after meals as well, because I've noticed that oil tends to accumulate on skin after food (no idea why).

* Personality - based on limited stalking you seem kind of shy! I could say, ""try not to be,"" but that'd be difficult. I think you should at least try forcing it a little. First off, eye contact. Practice, practice, practice. Guys seem much more attractive when they are able to look directly at a girl, no matter how hot the girl is. Smiling would also be great for you - speaking of which if you feel like uploading a photo of yourself actually showing your eyes, that would actually help a lot in determining whether your claims of ""ugliness"" or valid!

The extreme theory is that each epitheted or differently interpreted God is actually a different one, regardless of similar imagery or names. So what I'm saying is that your connection between El, Asherah, and Yahweh seems a little tenuous.

Additionally, not all similar imagery is directly related. You are right to point out Phoenician alphabets transmitting to Greece, but I question the elements of Babylonian literature being so directly connected to Homer for one big reason; the epic poem, the epic genre, is not just a feature of Babylonian and Greek history. The reason that we know that the Iliad and Odyssey were originally oral works is because they were directly compared to some surviving bardic traditions in 1920s Europe, in particular the Balkans. That implies that a epic poem tradition need not be tied to a single origin point.

I checked out the book from which that wikipedia quote was sourced; it would have been nice to name that source given it's quite a bold statement and is only a single sentence making up an entire section on the wikipedia page, which tends to look a bit dubious. The book in question is *The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth* by M. L. West

This book is much less strong on the subject than the wikipedia quote implies. Rather than arguing for direct parallels in imagery, West is mostly comparing motifs and literary devices. For example, the Epic of Gilgamesh sharing a theme of divine intervention and wandering with the Odyssey.

However, I also have major methodological misgivings about that book. Firstly, he never considers the idea that certain motifs are related because of inherent similarities of epic poetry regardless of their cultural origin. 

Second, he weasels himself out of having to be specific, for example;

&gt;Several scholars have been struck by the similarity of this to the beginning of the Gilgamesh epic in the Standard Babylonian version.

Which scholars? He does not name them in the text or cite them in a footnote. He is generally a little loose with actually referencing a lot of the conclusions being brought up in the text.

Thirdly, he is making a very sweeping analysis, essentially comparing literary similarities and that's as far as it goes. There is little to no knowledge of Babylonian and Greek culture+history demonstrated here. What history is stated here is often extraordinarly generalising statements with no listed sources.

For example;

&gt;When the Hittite Kingdom grew up, starting in the seventeenth century, it was from the first exposed to Assyrian literary and cultural influence.

He is a philologist, I am sure he did not make this discovery and conclusion on his own. Not only is it sweeping and generalising but again, it isn't cited.

Don't get me wrong, he demonstrates a fantastic knowledge of Aegean and Mesopotamian literature. I think the work is tremendous. But I will not accept that the work actually delves more than lightly into actual historical analysis, and I see nothing here to indicate that Greek religious imagery was consciously taken from Babylonian originals. For a start, we actually don't know when the depictions associated with the Olympians actually first began; we know little to nothing about Mycanaean Greece's religious practices.

The Ugaritic tablets are separated from the transmission of the alphabet to the Greeks by something like three or four centuries at minimum, and to really prove that such a direct connection exists between Greek and Ugaritic religious imagery you would need actual material evidence for it, preferably showing an evolution over time and the clear intrusion of Ugaritic archetypes. I'm not saying it's impossible, what I'm saying is that this is sketchy territory even for the ancient world, and it lacks viable evidence. I've spent too much time working with archaeology, and the major physical evidence indicates a connection between Cyprus and Ugarit during the Bronze Age that did not last into the period in which Cyprus becomes dominated by Greek culture.",Daeres,False,3,0,

1. A significant stalling or even collapse of the AMOC is incredibly unlikely by end of century, let alone on shorter timescales.
2. The Gulf Stream is a surface (and therefore wind-driven) western boundary current. As long as we have wind, and the planet is rotating, we will have a Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream != the AMOC. 
3. The idea that the Gulf Stream is responsible for North Atlantic Europe's relatively mild climate is largely a myth. 
4. In order to melt enough ice in order to significantly slow down or collapse the AMOC, an enormous amount of warming would be necessary. The North Atlantic would cool relative to the global average, granted, but it would still be warmer than present due to the amount of warming necessary to trigger the AMOC cooling. The idea that there would be a ""new ice age"" is flatly incorrect.

This idea was based on the Laurentide meltwater collapse of the AMOC responsible for the Younger Dryas, and the aforementioned misconception about the role of the Gulf Stream.

1500-1750ish: multiple European countries colonize North America, including Spain (Florida, Mexico, California, Texas), France (Quebec, Louisiana, Mississippi River), and Great Britain (Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania). Reasons include economic opportunities (Mercantilism), religious freedom (Puritans, English Catholics, Huguenots, some Jews), and competing with other countries. 

1754-1763: Seven Year's War (French and Indian War): France gets its ass kicked and loses what is now Canada to British; British win was costly so they jacked up taxes in their American colonies.

1775-1781: American Revolution. War breaks out in Massachusetts; other British colonies rebel as well. In 1776 colonies collectively declare independence. Gain France as an ally; together they force the British to surrender in 1781. 

1787: Constitutional Convention. First form of US government (confederacy) made federal government too weak. Constitution sets up current federal republic system, as well as the presidency. 

1804: Louisiana Purchase. US buys all of France's NA lands (roughly covering the middle of the country) for real cheap. Expansion westward begins. 

1812-1814: War of 1812. US tries to invade Canada, British retaliate by invading US. Both sides call truce; beginning of positive US-UK relations. 

1835: Texas Revolution. Newly independent Mexico invites Americans to settle in Texas to help pay war debt. Differences between Texans and Mexicans lead to revolt and declaration of Texas Republic. Texas annexed into US in 1845. Leads into Mexican-American War; won by US easily. US gains more territory in the West. Gold found in California leads to mass migration starting in 1848. 

Pre-Civil War: big difference between Northern and Southern states. Southern states based on agriculture, hence dependence on slave labor. Northern states mostly industrial. Both sides become political rivals. Big question arises: does the Constitution allow states to secede from the US? As new states are added, N and S try to keep the number of ""slave"" and ""free"" states balanced to keep each other in check. In 1860 abolitionist Abraham Lincoln is elected President; Southern states immediately secede and form Confederacy because of feared economic impact. 

1861-1865: Civil War. US invades Confederate States in an attempt to force them back into the Union. South prevailed and attempts to invade North until stopped at Gettysburg, PA in 1963. Lincoln's 1863 Emanciation Proclamation ends slavery in the US. South surrenders in 1865, but North levies huge penalties on South after Lincoln's death that marginalized the South and lead to racial tensions. 

Other 19th century American events: widespread immigration from Europe into US,  namely Irish and Germans. Leads to anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic movements in US. Expansion westwards. Wars with Native Americans lead to resettlement attempts (ex: forcing the Seminoles from Florida to Oklahoma). 

1901: Spanish-American War. Accident/attack on US ship in Havana and journalistic spin leads to US declaring war on Spain. US gains Puerto Rico and the Phillipines, and Cuba gets independence (although many wanted it added to US). Beginning of US as a (minor) world power. 

That's a ""short"" summary of key events. Of course if you want more details there's Wikipedia. Also sorry if it's messy; I'm on my phone.

If lower long term rates are being offered as a benchmark for success, as Bernanke did, the implication is that they were ""too high"" before. Going forward, if rate easing is being offered as a policy solution it implies that rates are ""too high"" right now.

&gt;Would that raise demand? I think everyone realizes that it would. The same thing is true when moving from paying 2% interest to 1% interest--it's just a question of degree.

Only to the extent that demand for credit is rate sensitive. In the current environment where households in particular have a great deal of private debt overhang and are deleveraging, there's little appetite for additional credit at any price. Not from households because they're underwater (or worse) and not from firms because households aren't spending.

Consider then what happens if borrowers stay away and the negative rate lending bonanza fails to materialize. Banks still bear the costs of negative rates and have to either eat it, becoming less profitable and finding their already suspect capital positions even more impaired and/or they will pass those costs through to what borrowers and depositors they do have... the (unintended?) consequence being *tighter* lending and higher rates for borrowers.

In fact, it can be quite difficult defend with the right target man. Their physically strong while not being reckless and they're steady, while not spectacular at the back. At the Hawthorns, they're one of the toughest teams to beat. And for a mid-table team with hopes of playing in Europe, they have to be.

I played GW1 till EoTN and switched to WoW around TBC (07) and played WoW till this year, came back to knock off 15 or so HoM points to get 30/50 and I found GW1 somewhat unrefined compared to WoW, I loved GW1 don't get me wrong and WoW is pretty garbage right now and I have zero plans to go back to WoW.    

GW1 seemed to fill a very specific niche, the way the PvE was done is pretty much unique to itself, the whole instanced PvE, missions, dungeons etc. The lack of jumping and how very specific builds are required for late/end game. Obviously those factors if reincorporated in GW2 would not have worked; an instanced non open world MMO in this day and age.    

There are some problems with GW2 as we've all seen, minor oversights by ArenaNet that had repercussions on players negligent or foolhardy enough to *abuse* them (pricing and etc.). The Trading Post being down forcing the economy in to a slump and the mail system not working all the time combined with the gold trade limit which further hampers the economy. Guesting not working yet meaning we can't play across servers and previously joining a friend in overflow didn't always work and player's lack of account security (same password for sites and the game etc. etc.). Servers are also located in 2 datacenters 1 for Europe and 1 in the US for the rest of the world.

I think if you're in a situation where banning mutilating the genitals of children causes nationwide outrage to the point where it would be an overall negative effect you need to take a good long think about if that is a nation you should care about the stability of.

But I don't believe that. I personally think Germany to be one of the greatest countries in the world, but this is one of it's serious flaws (which it shares with much of the world of course). But if such a ban took place, in future decades it would be seem as a great step forward for humanity, we will look back on mutilating the genitals of children and think ""wow, we were fucking barbarians in 2012"".

Now please don't take this part personally as I'm using the example as it's familiar and accessible - and a great piece of human history that no members of modern society *should* even feel guilty about. But instead it is something that the whole world should have learned a great lesson from.

What makes me saddest of all is that in part Germany's WW2 guilt has stopped a lot of people from speaking out against it, sympathising with Jewish traditions, for example.

The entire thing is ass-backwards bullshit - WW2 was a time in which the German people went along with and en masse stood by while great atrocities were carried out against people. To use that as a justification to *not* act now is absolutely insane! That is simply what is happening again now - people are justifying crimes against humanity, the life-long physical and psychological scarring of these vulnerable people on the basis that it might harm society *as it stands*. It's all for fucking status quo. If anything was learned in the last century it should be that you *do not just let shit like this happen no matter what the consequences*.

If it destabilizes society then so fucking be it, it's a better outcome than having stood by and done nothing. It's better than slipping into the abyss where you no longer have a nation that is *worth* saving because of what you have allowed it to become.

A line was uttered in Norway regarding circumcision banning too. ""We can't be the first country to do it."" People want it to happen but who will be brave and take the first step? I had high hopes that Germany being such a great country would be the first domino that would cause change across Europe over the decades to come, but it seems it is not to be. It seems almost that the fact of Germany's history is almost a barrier to stop it happening, when everything else about Germany could see it done. A strong, progressive country that has a chance to alter the course of the future for billions of children who will otherwise suffer terribly.

If Germany doesn't take that first step, who else will? The current position of Germany holds some power and, with that, responsibility to do the right thing. Even in the face of some potential trouble it may cause.

I have to ask anyway - *specifically* what do you think would happen if it was totally criminalised and prosecutions began. What would happen in a week, a month, a year, or 10 years in your opinion? I can hardly think of a circumstance worse than what is happening now...

Look at the actual numbers.  All of the developed countries are either stagnant, or declining in emissions.  We're all pretty stable in population, too.

We went through industrialization when our numbers were a tenth of what they are now.  Developing nations, on the other hand, have grown to HUGE populations, while managing to remain fairly unindustrialized.  Where the Western world used industrialization to vastly increase the rate at which resources could be transformed from raw to finished, and thus became wealthy, the developing world remained dependent upon muscle power for much of the 20th century.

Now, two and a half billion people are trying desperately to catch up.

The CO2 is not coming from our love of the SUV. It's coming from lighting, heating and manufacturing of goods that we consider the basis for modern life.  Yes, many of us in the US drive big cars.  We live in a place that was settled in a large way after modern transportation.  

Still, we could stop driving all of our personal cars and not make much of a difference to the yearly production of CO2 on the planet.  On the other hand, we cannot stop farming.  We can't stop shipping food.  We can't turn the lights off in the hospitals, the schools.

Most of the problem is from the production of electricity, with ""transportation"" taking a second.  Transportation isn't just 20 mile per gallon personal SUVs.  It's very efficient trains moving grain, it's very efficient boats moving rice.  Transportation is how we get the things we have to have to people who have to have it.  It's how we go to work, so that we can pay the bills to feed our children.

It's important to think about replacing inefficient cars with more efficient ones, but we have to move beyond that narrow definition.  We have to begin thinking about how to cut down energy use in all human activities.

&gt;I think we should be focusing on getting people to buy 40MPG cars.

I think this is a band-aid applied to a severed limb.  The US is at (or very near) it's lowest level of emissions in nearly 20 years.  Many of the European nations have been reducing emissions every year for over a decade.  We may as well have not bothered, because for the last dozen years or more, the developing world has increased their emissions by double digit percentages.  They have more than tripled their output in the time we've been telling people to replace their 60 watt bulbs with compact fluorescents. 

The US (the bad, evil, SUV driving bad boys) produce about, what 15% of the world's CO2 emissions?  If we cut ours by 30% *next year*, from 17 tons per person to 11 tons per person, China and India only need to increase theirs by less than a single percent to completely wipe out all of our progress.

They are gaining by more than 10%.  I'm not certain, but I think that their increase next year will be as much as our *entire output* will be.

Many people blame the US anyway, saying that if we didn't buy stuff from China, they would not produce the goods and thus would not create the emissions.  This assumes that a couple of billion people in Asia don't buy anything, and that everything they produce is bought by the 300 million people over here.  Does that seem logical to you?

They are growing, their economy is growing, their population is growing, and they have built more coal burning plants in the last 10 years than I can count.  

So, feel free to convince people in the US, who are suffering through an increasing debt burden, who's real income has not gone up in over a decade, who have recently lost 40% of their wealth due to ""market adjustments"" and ""real estate losses"" that what they *really* need to do is to buy a new, smaller car.",deck_hand,False,1,0,

It is a grand geography, one that covers the many lands that the assorted free people call home. There are seven known continents, all of them floating in an endless pattern around what my people call the Mictlatl, the maw of darkness. They spin endlessly, in a cycle only now being charted out by our high-priests of the obsidian skies. Each of these continents has scarce, unique resources thanks to an uneven distribution of elemental spirits, prompting wars and trade in equal measure. Long before my time, an Orcish barbarian by the name of Ka’Huaka managed to assemble what he claimed was a gift from the spirits of the underworld. In reality, it was the first of the crafts capable of jumping between worlds without being destroyed by the hunger of Mictlatl via a technique now known as “Etheric skimming”. It is one of those marvelous crafts I intend to charter, and put to paper what my people have only dreamed of.

Each world is dominated by a different race, each with what I hope is a unique twist. The above log is written by a young Elvish explorer hoping to live up to his fathers accomplishments. About a hundred years ago, the already mentioned Ka’Huaka figured out a way to travel between worlds safely and quickly. This ushered in an era of trade, conquest, and exploration not dissimilar to the one that occurred in our own world when the Europeans first made contact with the Americas.

Given all the species that exist and have existed, there should be billions of transitional fossils in the fossil record; we should have found tens of thousands at least.

###Response:

1) Some important factors prevent the formation of fossils from being common:

* Fossilization itself is not a particularly common event. It requires conditions that preserve the fossil before it becomes scavenged or decayed. Such conditions are common only in a very few habitats, such as river deltas, peat bogs, and tar pits. Organisms that do not live in or near these habitats will be preserved only rarely.

* Many types of animals are fragile and do not preserve well.

* Many species have small ranges. Their chance of fossilization will be proportionally small.

* The evolution of new species probably is fairly rapid in geological terms, so the transitions between species will be uncommon. 

Passenger pigeons, once numbered in the billions, went extinct less than 200 years ago. How many passenger pigeon fossils can you find? If they are hard to find, why should we expect to find fossils that are likely from smaller populations and have been subject to millions of years of potential erosion?

2) Other processes destroy fossils. Erosion (and/or lack of deposition in the first place) often destroys hundreds of millions of years or more of the geological record, so the geological record at any place usually has long gaps. Fossils can also be destroyed by heat or pressure when buried deep underground.

3) As rare as fossils are, fossil discovery is still rarer. For the most part, we find only fossils that have been exposed by erosion, and only if the exposure is recent enough that the fossils themselves do not erode.

As climates change, species will move, so we cannot expect a transition to occur all at one spot. Fossils often must be collected from all over a continent to find the transitions.

Only Europe and North America have been well explored for fossils because that is where most of the paleontologists lived. Furthermore, regional politics interfere with collecting fossils. Some fabulous fossils have been found in China only recently because before then the politics prevented most paleontology there.

4) The shortage is not just in fossils but in paleontologists and taxonomists. Preparing and analyzing the material for just one lineage can take a decade of work. There are likely hundreds of transitional fossils sitting in museum drawers, unknown because nobody knowledgeable has examined them.

5) Description of fossils is often limited to professional literature and does not get popularized. This is especially true of marine microfossils, which have the best record.

6) If fossilization were so prevalent and young-earth creationism were true, we should find indications in the fossil record of animals migrating from the Ark to other continents. ",[deleted],False,14,0,

That's painfully obvious (unintended pun).

&gt;  circumcision often is performed under anesthesia.

It often is not, in fact until quite recently it was systematically done without anesthesia in the US. It seems difficult to get reliable figures about it but it seems that anesthesia is now used about half of the time.

&gt; You can drum it up all you want with such charged appeals to emotion

You want to read that in what I wrote, I guess because you read it in others' writing before, and because it seemingly helps your argument. But I'm not trying to appeal to emotions; I'm exposing my views of the subject. If I need to detail:

 - extremely painful: definitely;
 - traumatic experience: most probably;
 - utterly sensitive sexual parts: the penis tip skin definitely qualifies;
 - relentless, desperate crying: my experience from my son who bumped his head two days ago;
 - unpleasant experience: this sure is not Disneyland.

This is in the case of circumcision done without anesthesia. Obviously the worst part of the physical pain and trauma disappears when anesthesia is used, although still not Disneyland.
 
&gt; And curiously, medical science has been unable to reach a consensus 

The subjective experience is what it is but a very simple, irrefutable fact is that a non-negligible part of erogenous tissues and nerves are severed by the procedure; the procedure is in fact meant to do exactly that. This does not improve the sexual experience.

&gt; Indicating.... that there isn't much of anything lost.

That's confirmation bias if there's ever been such a thing. Absence of consensus indicates that the issue remains undecided, exactly that and nothing more, nothing less. It may very well be ""quite a bit"", the objective results would be exactly the same, sensations being fundamentally incommunicable.

&gt; Piercing your ears is also 'body mutilation'

No. Mutilation means the loss of some flesh and of some function; both criterias are absent in the case of ear piercing. The only similarity is the unnecessary, unpleasant experience, although the amount of pain is obviously not comparable.

&gt; the facts are that there is no long term harm

These are not facts, this is wishful thinking.

&gt; If your argument hinges on comparing circumcision to likely blinding someone

You didn't read what I wrote, namely, ""severing part of the eyelid"", which would not lead to blindness in most cases.

&gt; eyeball is not equivalent tissue to glans

The cornea is in fact quite a bit comparable to the glans penis membrane, and the consequences of severing part of the eyelid - a dry, thicker cornea on the now-exposed part - would be quite comparable to the consequences of circumcision. In most cases it would not lead to total blindness, rather some loss of quality in vision. And this loss of quality would similarly be difficult to measure objectively. 

&gt; A better analogy would be removing the last phalanges of the little toe.

I think my analogy is better. Removing the little toe would be more akin to scarification - painful, unneeded but without loss of function.

&gt; Which, while strange to me, would be something I'd objectively have no issue with.

I would definitely have an issue if physicians started advising the surgery be done on newborns for hygienic purpose. This would be a travesty of medicine, just like ""hygienic"" circumcision is.

&gt; so long as someone is making the decision for their own children in good faith, I see no reason to  condemn

I definitely think that pushing forth fallacious medical arguments to justify the procedure is very condemnable. If it's done in good faith it's utter ignorance. If it's done knowingly to encourage the procedure it's utter perversion. 

The question that should be asked to American newborns in this one: ""We suggest to cut out part of you penis. You will lose some sexual sensations and functions from it, although we don't know how little or how much, and you won't know either. Your friends in Europe will not undergo the surgery, they will be left alone and never hear about it, and will not be bothered during their lives by their intact penis more than by any other part of their body. In fact in case they want the surgery done later, which happens sometimes, this will always be possible; however this does not go the other way round. Now do you want us to cut you now?"" Guess the answer.

&gt; I was circumcised as part of Judaic tradition

The simple, hard truth is that boys are better off with their penis left alone, just like girls are better off with their vulva left alone. People do what they want to their children, I'm not going to fight; on the other hand if people come to me with untrue, erroneous or fallacious arguments to justify their deeds or beliefs I'll say no.",chris3110,False,1,0,

In the U.S., the party system is a little messed up, mostly because of the winner-takes-all that dictates the winner in the elections on the Executive Branch. Same happens with Congress, with a FPTP system, in which only the Senate has direct elections. Add other problems, like gerrymandering and lobbying, and we have a problem keeping up with the needs and ideals of the population. A two-party system isn't able to offer the different PoVs in the whole political and ideological spectrum, and when the power is always established between only 2 ""powers"", corruption is more likely to happen. And this is a BIG problem in Europe (in some states, at least) right now, where the dominant parties submit the interests of its people to the wills of the ""market"". 

When you have a plurality of parties with chances of actually doing something, discussions tends to be more healthy and productive (logic-wise), but might lead to standstills since, well, they all can't agree on everything. But at least it keeps the conversation fresh and more focused on the problems that the people think that matters (check the rise of the Green Party in Germany, for instance), an important thing in  a democracy. If dominant parties take power for granted, they will be not only addressing the problems at their will, but they will also choose which problems they want to address. It's not impossible for the people to push for those subjects, but it takes a lot more effort and mobilization of masses. I think it's very important for a democratic country to have parties that represent every side and ideals of its people, and let people democratically be represented proportionally by those parties according to their (the people's) will.

The Democrats and Republicans are so big that within the party itself it has many ""factions"", making the voter ""bundle"" their ideals with stuff that they don't really agree with.

Well of course they have the previously mentioned parties, but I'm very much under the impression that they have their own parties as well. That is to say that the parties operate primarily in french and mostly only have voters in Quebec? I assume I could vote for them if I wanted.

Alright so from what I understand Harper is signing a bunch of trade agreements. Which is good, for the most part, at least I assume. Unfortunately they apparently have some extra stuff jammed in there that deals with copyright law.

CETA (I think), was one done with Europe and is similar to ACTA. As far as I know, now it is illegal to download copyrighted stuff from the internet as well as upload, where before it was just illegal to upload.

There is also the TPP thing that nobody seems to have any information about. This one includes the US and apparently it's very similar to SOPA. All I know for sure is we need to wait until more information is leaked.

These things scare me because I am very much for a free internet and anonymity. I just want to know how to voice my concerns to, basically, or what action I can take to help. There are petitions but they all seem to be fore the US.

The only way a bullish silver bullion investor (silver bug) can decide that, is by comparing the deal to the spot price of silver.

Think about that statement.  You explicity use the word ""bullish"", meaning, he expects the price to go up.  Right?  Right.  So, if he expects the price to go up, and he's as bullish as some, he might believe the price could go north of $100/oz.  And if the price goes to $100/oz, what does that make his purchase of this nazi coin at $12?  A GOOD BUY, MAYBE?  

Did we need a numismatologist for that?  You know *why* we didn't need a numismatologist for that?  Because of the silver content.  AND LOL as you eloquently pointed out, German junk coins are sold at spot +5% by the kilo in Europe, which makes them akin to &lt;GASP&gt; BULLION. 

Now, was it a good buy at *today's* current price? (because that's your next question, I'm sure of it)

Well, think about this: 

I've bought ASEs and CMLs, as bullion, at $25 and $45 and everywhere in between.  I consider them *ALL* good buys because I'm, as you say, ""a bullish silver ~~bullion~~ investor (silver bug)"".  

Hold on tight, I'm about to blow your mind right now:  *Some of my ASEs and CMLs have numismatic and/or collectible value on top of their ""bullion"" value*.  It sounds like you might need to let that one sink in for a minute because it's WAY over your head from what I can tell.  But at the end of the day, you're right.

The EU seems to be in a moment similar to the disintegration of the Articles of Confederation government (similar because the disintegration was fueled by structural economic dysfunction; design flaws), and the solution seems similar as well, that being federalism. 

Like the early US under AoC, the first choice of the EU nations was to go with a confederacy of sorts. Like the early US, they tried it, and it's not working so well right now. Even if the EU does the absolute minimum of reforms to preserve the integrity of the euro (shared currency being a critical part of the EU), it requires Germany (the most powerful/influential EU state) to give up some critical sovereignty and control in the realm of budgeting and banking, something they seem unlikely to do as the status quo is working very well for them. Also, due to the crisises throughout southern Europe, money is flooding out of those nations' banks and into German banks. That's a variable somehow in this, but I'm not sure how it will affect German decision making regarding the EU. Overall, I think Germany is key to whether the euro and the EU make it or not. I'm not sure there was a state among the original 13 colonies that had the other 12 over the barrel like that (but I may be wrong). 

Another factor forcing the early US to federalize was the continual threat from the UK and presence on the continent from several other european powers. The early US was very weak in a dangerous world, so that helped force everyone together. I'm not sure the EU nations feel a similar level of vulnerability, in part due to the US/NATO umbrella of force, and in part due to their own entrenched position in their territory. 

However, all it takes is a dramatic sudden change from Greece (Golden Dawn's popularity now is comparable to the Nazi Party's popularity in Germany in 1928, and there are a few decisions Greece can make that will cascade), from Spain (seems a ticking bomb like Greece a year ago, the crushing poverty and despair among the newly poor, the huge numbers of unemployed under-30s...), from the cascading nature of the euro banking problem, from Russia (taking advantage of a weak Europe, Putin being Putin), or from Germany (making a bad decision that departs from the status quo in a bad way, or to stick with the failing status quo). An adverse reaction from any of those that reveals European weakness and vulnerability could push the many countries closer together. But it could also create Cold War-like conditions between the countries if there's bitterness at economic betrayal. 

tl;dr - odds are the EU will either shift away from the status quo to something more federalized like the US under the Constitution (more likely in the realm of treasuries, banking, and some aspects of budgeting, but I think the EU counterparts to state governors and state legislatures will have more power than their US counterparts), or it will fly apart and Europe will be as it was for centuries, but in a millenium less favorable to Europe than the previous one.

What is your opinion on things like the Pirate Party (which I stumbled upon) or other independent parties? I assume they have very little chance of winning, considering the type of voting system we have in place and the fact that they don't get much press.

Most of the extremely minor parties are usually just poorly managed and don't even take themselves seriously enough, such as the Communist Party. I guess that's why they are minor parties, but if you look at America's minor parties, they're relatively well managed, even if they're a bit crazy (Green Party USA). 

As far as the Pirate Party goes, I really don't have much to say about them, let alone nice things. They may as well be apart of the Green Party. I jokingly refer to them as the Hipster Party. 

&gt;Well of course they have the previously mentioned parties, but I'm very much under the impression that they have their own parties as well. That is to say that the parties operate primarily in french and mostly only have voters in Quebec? I assume I could vote for them if I wanted.

In the federal elections? The Bloc Québécois is really the only federal party that could fit in with your description. In short, the BQ is a party to advocate for Quebec in Parliament without having any strings attached that a normal party would have (a normal one being that runs candidates across the country). In other words, they can make decisions for Quebeckers without any ""outside"" influence effecting them. 

That's about it, though, and the BQ is a dying party, and has been for a long, long time. The only reason why they haven't died off sooner is because the Liberals ended up annoying Quebec, the Conservatives rejected them, and the NDP never appealed to them before. 

&gt;CETA (I think), was one done with Europe and is similar to ACTA. As far as I know, now it is illegal to download copyrighted stuff from the internet as well as upload, where before it was just illegal to upload.

I haven't done too much research in to CETA, but from what I know is that it's extremely over exaggerated in regards to the apparent privacy invasion and copyright changes. Again, I haven't looked in to it severely, but I didn't notice anything horribly damaging. But as I said, I haven't looked in to it in any depth. 

Also, CETA hasn't even been ratified yet, it's still being negotiated on. Europe is too busy kicking their feet because Canada won't give them money. 

&gt;These things scare me because I am very much for a free internet and anonymity. I just want to know how to voice my concerns to, basically, or what action I can take to help. There are petitions but they all seem to be fore the US.

I didn't say ""liberate Europe again"", rather I said ""re-liberate Europe""

The former could be interpreted to imply that the original liberation was accomplished solely by the U.S.   The latter phrasing leaves the question of ""Who originally liberated Europe?"" open.

For example, if China had single-handedly liberated Europe during WWII (in an alternate universe hypothesis) ... then Europe somehow funds itself again in shackles ... now it could be said ""The U.S. must re-liberate Europe (as did the Chinese, before them)"".

tl; dr:  By my crafty phrasing, I avoided declaring anything about who liberated Europe.

And then(accidentally?) stumbled upon what REALLY drives the price of oil, the speculative market.  You should look into how it works, because it is 100% of what drives the price of oil in the world today, and it's controlled by a handful of billionaire traders that(surprise!) stand to benefit *much* more from Romney's statements about cutting taxes for the rich than Obama's stated position.  
  
&gt;refusing to build a pipeline  
  
You're obviously talking about Keystone.  You should google for some ACTUAL info regarding this pipeline, not only are there no *long term* job benefits as almost all jobs created by building it are gone after it's built, but how are the truckers and train operators going to do once that oil is moving through a pipeline?  Oh hrm, looks like we'll *lose* jobs on that one.  One of the stated purposes of this pipeline(easily found on google) is to ""reduce the problem of oversupply in the US midwest"" by piping the oil right on by.  Projected changes in US energy costs once the pipeline is in place show that we will end up paying $4 billion more per year on petroleum.  One of the stated goals of the company that wants the pipe line is to be able to move oil to the gulf coast so they can export it to European and Asian markets where the cost of oil is higher, which means we won't even be using any of this oil here!  Well that's not entirely true, if they ever spill it we'll get to use it to help destroy the gulf coast just a bit more..

The only similarity is the unnecessary, unpleasant experience, although the amount of pain is obviously not comparable.

How do you know the amount of pain is not comparable? I've seen people scream bloody murder when getting their ears pierced. Furthermore, your definition of 'loss of tissue' is a new one, and, besides the point, still fits the bill for proper piercing, wherein a small plug of skin is removed to make way for the decorative insert. Basically, you're saying 'this type of body alteration is bad because I don't like it, but this other type of body alteration is ok, because I'm comfortable with it'. 

Which is why this whole 'children have rights' argument breaks down; unless you get this bent out of shape at the notion of piercing the ears of anyone below the age of 18, you're a hypocrite.

&gt;These are not facts, this is wishful thinking [on harm].

You can continue to claim what you want, and say things like 'it doesn't improve sensation' or 'sensation is lost' or 'it's traumatic', but again, the medical data isn't there. You can also hand wave this away by saying there's some sort of selection bias, but if there is no evidence to support your claim, and you view this as simply MORE proof that your claim is correct, you are arguing in the wrong forum. /r/conspiracytheories might be better suited.

Severing part of the eyelid... I want you to think for a second about ludicrous this comparison is, and perhaps reconsider addressing the utility of discussing the topic of body modification with the analogy I offered.

&gt;I would definitely have an issue if physicians started advising the surgery be done on newborns for hygienic purpose. This would be a travesty of medicine, just like ""hygienic"" circumcision is.

Hey me too. Good thing no one has suggested circumcision be performed for hygienic purposes.

&gt;I definitely think that pushing forth fallacious medical arguments to justify the procedure is very condemnable.

Hey me too, good thing no one has done that (save, perhaps, you, insofar as claiming that medical data supports your position).

&gt;The question that should be asked to American newborns

This is your first problem; newborns don't have rights, they don't have choices. The life of a child is not one of their will and actions based on consensus with their opinions. If a child vehemently didn't want a vaccination shot, you'd be a terrible parent and a horrible human being by saying 'You're right, you don't want it, you won't get it!'

&gt;You will lose some sexual sensations and functions from it,

Everyone accuses libertarians of promoting anarchy, especially ""government safety net"" types (i.e. ""I was too stupid to plan for retirement!! Don't take away my social security!!"" &lt;- those idiots), statists and the corporate elites.

**meaning 1:** maori are New Zealanders who have found a new way to exploit anyone with money, Generally anyone who lives in New Zealand is a New Zealander, however some of the population of ""Aoetaroa"" have decided they're different from the rest of us. They don't even need to have a different skin colour, just some sort of very weak and diluted claim to a realative who didnt even originate from this country. Unfortunately the weak polititions of New Zealand have given them almost anything they want to avoid an ""Uprising"" or to put anyones nose out of joint. It is really sad what has become of this country, and its people, maori is way of spelling uncontrolable ridiculously ignorant seperatism of a once fine nation. It is also a way of spelling ""we will lie about anything"" including the fact that our ancestors were fooled, destroyed and educated by the English settlers who were years ahead of them.
""Awwww bro I got one 800th maori in me I think on my dads uncles brothers wifes ex mother in-laws side so I can get into Uni and stuff for cheap aye and dont even have to try"" 

""Aww bro the laws dont apply to me Im maori"" ..... how does that make you special.... 


**meaning 2:** Self proclaimed land owners of New Zealand. In 1840 British settlers realised the lack of intelligence of the natives that they had recently encountered and decided to form the treaty of waitangi. In this treaty the maori signed away all their land in exchange for a few guns and bracelets. Sometime around 1900 the maori brain evolved to the point of having 2 brain cells, and they realised what a terrible mistake they had made. Ever since then the maori have been trying to seek revenge on the white man by selling him crappy tinny's, taking his shoes, and generally stealing everything that isn't nailed down. This type of behaviour is hardly suprising coming from a culture that actually beleives New Zealand was caught like a fish and pulled to the surface by one maori in a canoe. To this day, maoris still exist in new zealand inhabiting such areas as otara, mangere, and a million other shitty places you'd never have to go to if marijuana was legal.
""Duh thats rite bro you get 0.3 grams of weed for your $20, now you know how it feels"" 

""hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo"" 

""aw bro my cru of maori's is the baddest bro we can't even afford a spray can to tell people who we are""

**meaning 3:** A race of people whom the New Zealand government seems to favour over the people of European decent in New Zealand. Maori receive such bonuses as: 
- cheaper university fees 
- extra money on government benefits (as if to encourage them) 
- their own political party that only persons with maori decent can be in. (they can also be in the other parties if they wish) 
Maori seem to have no morals whatsoever. Their favourite pastimes include drugs, alcohol and smoking behind the P.E shed. Some maoris prefer to beat up and steal from the elderly. No maori wears his own shoes. 
The New Zealand Government seems to think they should encourage the maori race, but these days most criminals in NZ are of maori decent, so really they are encouraging them to be criminals, and therefore insuring the future of New Zealand to become one huge Otara.
""bro, hook a brother up aye? I'll smash ur white ass, you betta watch ur bak aye I'll get my black maori homies onto you""


**meaning 4:** A New Zealand people, traded everything for nothing, and now have buyers remorse, which will carry on for another hundred years. Supposedly the ""natives"" -this has been proven false, there were other people here first before them, who the maori ate. They are 10% of the general population, and 90% of the prison population. Go figure.
NZ Person: ""Dude, grab us a beer?"" 
Maori: ""Eh? Bears live in asia...""


**meaning 5:** People that claim to originally come from new zealand who were dumb enough to sign away there land for basically nothing, now they try to claim it back and call anyone that doesnt agree with them 'racist'. They also smell funny. they get a whole bunch of extra benifits from the government but still are the dumbest people in new zealand.

If the Soviet Union wasn't threatening enough I don't see anything else that would be (I know Europe just got done blowing each other up when the cold war started so France and Germany teaming up would have been a little awkward but the Soviet Union collapsed and there are no more big scary boogeymen so i don't see it).

The only way I could see it happening would be if there was a massive economic collapse in the EU and a number of countries like Greece, Spain, and Italy get hit HARD, while the more wealthy countries like France and Germany weathered the storm and came out fine. The people in the devastated countries would have to be desperate enough to elect radical extremists (kinda like the neo nazis getting elected in Greece or the actual Nazis in Germany during the Great Depression) or have the radicals over through the government. Europe would then need to divide between the rich democracies in a new EU and the more totalitarian radical governments. Maybe, if the threat was great enough this new EU would unite into a single nation to fight the other powers in Europe and once defeating them make them states in the new European nation similar to how the south was brought back into the union after the American Civil War.

The mean intelligence of blacks is much lower than for whites. The least intelligent ten percent of whites have IQs below 81; forty percent of blacks have IQs that low. Only one black in six is more intelligent than the average white; five whites out of six are more intelligent than the average black. These differences show in every test of general cognitive ability that anyone, of any race or nationality, has yet been able to devise. They are reflected in countless everyday situations. “Life is an IQ test.” http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/foreclosures-by-race-and-ethnicity.html

There is a huge academic literature on the gaps in cognitive test results, practically all of it converging on the fact that African American mean scores on cognitive tests fall below the white means by a tad more than one white standard deviation. There is in fact so much data on this now that we have meta-studies — studies of the studies: the one best-known to me is the meta-study by Roth et al. in 2001, which covered 39 studies involving nearly six million test-takers. That one standard deviation on cognitive testing has been so persistent across so many decades, an academic sociologist, calls it ""the fundamental constant of American sociology"" — it's like the speed of light in physics.

Although James Watson earned a share in a Nobel Prize for his work on the structure of DNA, he ruffled more than a few feathers last October when he said, “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours—whereas all the testing says not really.”

Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis

The book claims to represent the largest collection and review of the global Intelligence Quotient (IQ) data, surveying 620 published studies from around the world, with a total of 813,778 tested individuals. Lynn's meta-analysis lists East Asians (IQ 105), Europeans (100), Inuit (91), South East Asians (87), Native Americans (87), Pacific Islanders (85), South Asians and North Africans (84), non-bushmen Sub-Saharan Africans (67), Australian Aborigines (62), Bushmen and Pygmies (54). 

Lynn defines races as the genetic clusters or ancestral population groups identified in previous genetic cluster analysis by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues in their 1994 book The History and Geography of Human Genes.

As a straight swap for Diarra its probably an alright deal, but it is worth noting that Granero did feature in some of Madrid's better performances under Mourinho. Besides, Madrid's issues (albeit quite early in this season yet also applicable to matches against top european sides under mourinho) have not been defensively, they've been in the fact they have been too one dimensional when they have the ball. 

Also, i disagree with the ""orders of magnitude"" comment only in that football goes through its fashions and Essien was one of the finer examples of a style of player, whereas the emphasis at the moment is in more complete passing midfielders (the market for spanish players in the premiership being an example of this). This was evident in Atletico Madrid's destruction of Chelsea, which consisted of a colchonero midfield which Granero would easily slot into and relish. Dont get me wrong, I can see Mourinho's logic in acquiring this kind of player given he was the key exponent of the physically robust, athletic style that Essien thrived in, but i dont think his signing will add to his current Madrid's deficiencies. It will, however, be hard for Essien to look deficient given the make-up of the team he's slotting into, its whether he can prove decisive in matches where his team needs to be the protagonist rather than the reactive side(ie Madrid vs Bayern Munchen last season) which is what i meant by my comment. But thats a philosophical point because id rather a team with as much quality as this Madrid side has play to their potential rather than watch cowardly displays. ",lonely_marsupial,False,1,0,

When warm water meets cold water, its easier for the cold water to sink to the ocean floor than it is for the water to completely mix. If the cold water was predominately travelling in a different direction from the warm water, it will form an under water current that travels in a different direction from the surface.

An example of this is the North Atlantic.  Water at the equator is warmer due to more exposure to the sun.  As it expands, some of it travels north, where it begins to cool off.  Once it reaches the area around Iceland and the North Sea, it is cooled and forced to the bottom, where it flows back out to the Atlantic and back to the equator, where it warms up again.

The answer, as I see it, is two-fold:

For one, *they do.* Only arguing from what I read on PZ Myers' blog, he identifies as a secular humanist and he has -just off the top of my head- supported campaigns of the SSA, the MAAF, the FFRF and CampQuest. The same certainly goes for the others that want to establish the A+ label. Note also that ""Atheism plus"" is, as it appears, not an organization with a leadership and an agenda, but (I use that word a lot, don't I) a label, a name that describes your philosophical position.

That brings me to the second point, and that is, as I mentioned, that they love being atheists and that they want to wear that name proudly. They see a connection, as I also explained, between atheism and humanism, and they want a shorthand way to tell people that. They don't want to be humanists who happen to be atheists. They don't want to be atheists who happen to be humanists. They want to make clear that they are atheists who derive from that, and correlate with that, and credit that for their humanism. They don't want to divorce those ideas because they feel they belong together and support each other.

None of the names on the list behind your link make that connection explicitly clear and wears it proudly.

Then, and they admit that without shame and without, in my opinion, to *deserve* to be ashamed, they see that atheism (the new vocal assertive atheism) is currently rapidly gaining traction in society and they want to make use of that popularity. In record numbers, people are coming to the conclusion that ""wait a minute, the whole god thing is a sham!"" Pure atheists, so to speak, close the case there and say ""well done"". The plussers say ""now what? Doesn't that mean that religion is a huge fraud? Doesn't that mean that the churches' sense of entitlement in moral issues is entirely baseless? - *Where do we go from here?*""

They want to cheer with the current enthusiasm for disentangling oneself from the god-babble, and then channel that energy into social progress. In other words, *precisely to swell the ranks of secular humanism with those that freed themselves from religion!*

One note: This kind of ""directional thinking"" makes little sense for Europeans (like me) who never justified morality and immorality through gods and religion in the first place. But for people who were brought up in a society that's soaked, drenched in religion, who have been taught since before they could think that all morality comes from a supreme ruler in the sky and his middle management, the churches, I think it's a great idea to take the rage that they've been lied to and turn it into something productive.

**TL;DR:** 1.) They do, and they always did. 2.) But while they're doing it, they don't want to hide their atheism, no, they want to proclaim proudly that that is their motivation - and encourage others to make that step as well.",Antares42,False,1,0,

From my part, I don't think that multiculturalism works, but...

* I think that western countries should assimilate immigrants, like the US has done. US after all is a mono-culture. However the one unique thing about America is that it is country founded on idea, either you believe in the US constitution or you don't. In Europe we have defined our self's via language, religion, race, etc... If we want to assimilate immigrants, then we have more or less have to throw out at least race. In my opinion religion goes out too, as European societies are modern societies. So for example being Finnish becomes more a question of language, set of beliefs and values, patterns and models of actions, etc...
* I think that our western civilization is going on a transformation to being a global civilization, a global culture so to say. And as it spreads around the globe, the whole globe will start to look the same, however the values on which this global civilization is being founded are not old values of west, but values of modernity, capitalism, consumerism, individualism, etc.. Just look at our western societies, they are very much different than they were say 50 or 100 years ago, they have transformed much.
* I think that the European Union is one birth place for global integration. Most European nations have reached modernity and share more or less same value base from were they can integrate more closely. In time other places around the world will make this same journey as they develop and become modern societies.",jrohila,False,8,0,

* they have a highly selective immigration policy and bring in only the type of people they need - mostly highly skilled workers who are well educated and are therefore more likely to integrate into their socio-cultural environment better, more likely to find a job and support their family, less likely to end up resorting to crime

* they are relatively isolated from the rest of the world which makes it easier to control their borders for illegal immigrants

I think the major share of the blame for today's tensions between different cultures in Europe within nations lies with the post WWII governments. Their immigrant policies have been too lose and they were too naive in thinking they're just bringing in workforce instead of actual people (Germany being the prime example here). Furthermore, there has been no longterm vision with how they are going to integrate the immigrants. They built social housing and let the immigrants fill them up, not realizing they're basically ghettoizing them. How is a Turkish family in the 60's going to integrate into German society if all their neighbours in their block of flats are Turks? How is an Algerian family going to integrate into French society surrounded by Morrocans and Tunisians? The immigrants were offered all the benefits of the welfare state, but no terms of service. So when you're put in front of a choice of going back to Turkey and work for low wages or enjoy welfare benefits in the immigrant bubble in the middle of Germany, what do you pick?

Today, the discourse regarding multiculturalism revolves mostly around Islam and Muslim extremists, how Islam itself is a threat to European values and democracy. The ones who pull the short end of the straw here are not the imams in Pakistan, Iran or wherever calling for burnings of flags and killings of western imperialists, but the average Muslim immigrants in London, Marseille, Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen etc., who moved away in search of a better life, and in a lot of cases, to flee from the above mentioned aggressive retorics and oppressive regimes. There's no denying that a lot of criminal offenders come from an immigrant background, but you have to look at the context of things. They are being brought up in a secluded immigrant environment, go to schools that are predominantly filled with immigrants, most of them coming from a poor financial background. How are they supposed to fit in?
