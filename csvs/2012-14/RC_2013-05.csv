1,"Taking out loans to pay for college is not ""nonsensical"", it's a statistically great choice to improve your income and pays for itself multiple times over.  The problem is when people decide to go to a school that costs an astounding 125K and leave without the grades or the major to get a job to repay that debt.

Interest on loans is a very costly thing.  It exists for many reasons, but anyone taking out that much money should know the potential to get buried in debt.  If interest didn't work like it did, everyone would take 100's of thousands of dollars out.

Again, you say debt slavery.  Was he physically unable to escape from his job?  Obviously not, he left.  Could he change his job to another?  Absolutely.  He did.  Was he unable to move up the corporate ladder, making more money every year until he could pay those debts?  Considering he is making 100K now, I would assume so.  So how is he a slave?  Again, you're acting like simply being poor or being in debt is being a slave.  

My brother spends his entire paycheck on rent, food, car expenses, and bills.  He tells me he has less than $1,000 saved up.  Is he a slave for working and not gaining anything from it?  He couldn't travel to Europe, much less get a job there, or pay for a 125K education.  He is in a worse position than OP.  So is he even more of a slave in your eyes?

1,"Now, I may be guilty of dumping too much on you alone, especially when, as we both know you've been hating on GoDz's bias well before it was popular, and were somewhat justified. 

However, I disagree that he is considerably worse than other casters, and I disagree with the conclusions that the community often jump to hastily in these matters. 

Let's get the obvious out of the way: GoDz has had many reasons to be more ""in tune"" and empathetic towards the Asian DotA scene.

1. GoDz and LD both got a lot of their notability from casting the Asian games months ago when many other big channels did not. You could say that a lot of his own popularity rides on hype on the Asian scene.

2. Australians have closer DotA history with SEA/CN than they do with EU. A lot of their pro-scene's current situation has to do with Chinese dominance of SEA and AUZ. E.g. one of the few notable AUZ teams (Chains Stack, partially AUZ, at least) showed promising results and great play, but were ultimately shut out from notoriety simply because of the dominance of a few teams that consistently dominate the scene (the Chinese and Orange). 

3. You also took issue with his betting against NaVi, but frankly, a lot of objective people bet against them not only after the group stages (in which tons of Westerners got a wake up call that they had underestimated the Asian teams) but after NaVi themselves had reported disappointing bootcamping.

In other words, he has plenty of legitimate reasons to promote and be more hyped about Eastern DotA, reasons that many others also have for supporting Western DotA. E.g. Tobi, for a long time, was accused of being too biased for Western DotA, and a lot of that has to do with how much more invested he was in Western DotA at the time.

It's all very normal and within their own justifiable prerogatives. 

However, so many of GoDz detractors have to make it about race and accuse him of being a race traitor, or wanting to be Asian or whatnot.

Canada was settled in several waves, especially after WWI (my moms family came then), before the October Revolution(My dads family), and during and after WWII(lots of Eastern Europeans, Scandinavians and Germans). Some former prisoners of war petitioned to stay as well. So we have a lot of people that fled strife.

One of the consequences of those peoples experiences is that they were careful about talking about their beliefs and politics. While the USA received a lot of war refugees as well, their population was already immense. Canada's flood caused a significant expansion of the population. It influenced our society.

Earlier settlement by people of the British Isles was of similarly closed mouthed individuals. Sometimes they were remittance men, second sons or black sheep of their family. Many were poor Irish and Scottish.

So especially in my part of Canada(the west), it is considered uncouth, tacky, or even rude to enquire as to someone's religious beliefs.

*Firstly, we have to consider price.*  Unless you're rich, it doesn't matter than Switzerland has ""the best whatever"" because you'll rarely be able to afford it anyway.  Yes, people in Europe go out plenty, but it's not nearly as much as Americans.  They simply can't afford the price tag.  In the USA, we have food for all budgets.  You can get a $5 meal, you can get a $15 meal, you can get a $50 meal, and you can get a $100 meal.  This is clearly a win for the customer.  If you want cheap, you can get cheap.  If you want something by a world renowned chef, you can get that too and it's going to be cheaper than getting something by a world renowned chef in Europe - guaranteed.  

*Secondly, we have to consider variety.*  Some Euro countries are pretty good when it comes to variety, but many are not and the rest of the world just plain sucks.  Overall, USA has a good variety of world foods if you live in a metro area.  Many of the cuisines are made by the immigrants and they are great.  It is important to compare similar regions though... Obviously NYC is going to crush rural France and Paris is going to crush rural Kentucky.  But overall, I think there is more variety in the US for comparable population centers.

*Lastly, I would also like to talk about grocery store prices.*  USA is ridiculously competitive across the board.  It is absolutely amazing to me that I can get chicken cheaper in a downtown DC supermarket than in rural Botswana or rural India.  It is incredible what economies of scale and mass production farming can do.  I continue to be severely disappointed by seafood and meat prices in the developing countries.  They can't compete with USA supermarkets and in many cases they are not even close.

Does understanding a position mean I agree with it? No, nor should it, and nor should the ability to consider and think critically be interpreted as such. It's not until we understand all positions that we understand how some can be wrong. In the case of the Holocaust, it was wrong because the scapegoating helped no one, stripping Germany of its humanity, the Jews of their lives and heritages, and Europe as a whole of its decency. Apartheid was wrong because it systematically stole the heritage of millions of people, despite the fact that the land use by whites led to massive amounts of wealth for those whites. The Herero genocide was wrong because it was an unjustified slaughter of innocents for the crimes of the few. And the massacre in Haiti? It was wrong because, though slavery was a violent evil, it is wrong to respond to that evil with further slaughter. It made the slaves little better than their masters.

3,"&gt; Yeah, you Americans that live in a society where if you happen to suffer from a complicated, protracted disease or illness you either need a shitload of money to get insured or will end up in recovery with an enormous debt.

Just out of curiosity, do you also believe that all Dutch people walk around in wooden shoes or that all Englishmen wear bowler hats and carry umbrellas?

I realize that it gives Europeans with inferiority complexes a way to feel better about themselves to imagine that all Americans are obese and uninsured yahoos, but you shouldn't actually believe it.

About 90% of all Americans are fully insured.  Most of those that are not are young healthy adults.

Oh horrors!  Not struggle!  Someone catch me, I may faint.

&gt; I'd think that in such an economy, such a society where a severely handicapped and dependant person is basically left out to dry it would be quite natural to make the rational decision and simply not allow that fetus to generate said handicappee.

6,"hey, thanks for your question :)

So most anarchist advocate federalism as what ""binds us together"", after the destruction of the state and capitalism. From the sidebar:

&gt; Anarchist society has no central authority, but instead consists of interconnected communities that use direct democracy (specifically, consensus) to organize themselves without rulers or bosses.

In other words, we envision small communities utilizing principles of direct democracy for self-rule, federated over a large territory through federal bodies. This is a similar structure that was in historic modern large-scale anarchist societies (Catalonia, Ukraine, etc): ""a large scale anarchist society"" thus being a federation of communes and directly democratic controlled territories.

In other words, anarchists advocate ""decentralized, but not disconnected"". Kropotkin gave the example of railroads: the railroad system accross Europe at the time (and still today) was *decentralized* in that all railroad planning was not done in one place but rather a scattering of plans that only needed to hook up at the edges. A modern analogy would be the internet or WWW: many servers that define protocols, conferences and meetings to standardize across the world, without sacrificing the agility of autonomy. So, the idea then is to perfect the anarchist organizational model for a community of 200-2000 people, get out the ""rubber stamp tool"" so-to-speak and stamp it across the entire land. a. Hopefully that makes more sense? :)

Also, one point: many anarchists may distinguish between government and state, with the latter being the ""violent corporatism that enforces capitalism"", whereas the former can exist as positive organization within an anarchist society.

2,"The thing is, though, that contrary to your position, I don't happen to see a lot of historical evidence that the Jews were oppressing Europeans, and even if they were, it can't be even remotely compared to the enslavement of people in Haiti. Is it the case that the Jews held positions of power in some economic sectors and some political positions? Sure, but that's because traditionally, these were the only positions allowed to them. I find it difficult to imagine that being shunted into a particular sector of society means you are dominant over the entire society, but you're more than welcome to clarify that argument for me. 

Now, I think it's also worth noting that you are making what I consider to be a deeply flawed analogy between the Haitian massacre and the Holocaust. Consider for a moment that we're looking at the deaths of 5000 people in Haiti against 6000000 Jews in Europe (and that's counting solely Jews, not every other Holocaust victim). In the case of the Holocaust, you have a systematic scapegoating of a people who - though you may argue they cornered the economic and political arenas, a point I thoroughly disagree with - did relatively little wrong. In Haiti, you have slave owners who worked and beat thousands of slaves to death. The wrongs committed are incomparable by the victims are incomparable, at least as I see it. Once again, you're free to argue against me. 

The methodology of the massacres is different. In the Holocaust, you have thoroughly willing, thoroughly participatory Nazis. This is not to say every single Nazi approved of the Holocaust, but it is to say that a higher percentage did, suggesting that there was more approval overall of a plan to massacre millions of people. In the case of Haiti, most of the massacres didn't happen until it was absolutely clear that to not do so would be an act of treason. In the article you cited, it says ""Before [Dessalines'] arrival, there were only a few killings, despite his orders."" This once again implies very little support for the idea, suggesting that this wasn't a genocide so much as it was a vendetta. This is a relevant distinction between the Holocaust and Haiti. 

So you say my reaction is to mitigate the Haitians and not the Germans. That's not my intention in the slightest. My intention is to point out facts you're whitewashing in favour of your idea that I only care about the deaths of non-whites. 

Let me ask you this. In the Armenian genocide, you have the case of between a million and million and a half white Christians being killed by the Ottomans. How do you view this, considering it's the massacre of whites that is very, very clearly seen as a bad thing, at least by countries that didn't participate in it? I can take the Ottomans' position once again (the Armenians held land and property that was valuable to the Ottoman Empire. Plus, there had been numerous violent crimes and rebellions committed by Armenian rebels), but this doesn't mean I feel the Ottomans' actions were justified, nor should it be forgiven. Once again, understanding isn't agreement, nor is it mitigation. 

Also consider the Rwandan genocide and the slaughter of Tutsis by Hutus. Here we have intra-racial conflict (though it's far more complicated than that). Would you say my response to that would be to say that both were wrong (or right) because of their race? Generally, this is viewed as a terrible occurrence because of the sheer loss of life, not because of the race of the participants. 

Finally, it's worth noting that you are right about one thing - there are very few massacres of white people that are discussed as part of common culture. Might this be because they don't happen anywhere close to as often as other genocides rather than that some over-arching force is actively purging them from our memories?",0,c9q1h8m,1431366178,False,t3_1der7q,,,Quouar,0,t5_2qh13,1367374977,t1_c9q0xtg,worldnews,,False,0,,True,t1_c9q1h8m,2

When I was five years old I used to hear this pulsating energy every night. And every night it kept getting louder. In retrospect, it reminded me of a heart beating. I also felt it getting closer every night, and when it got unbearable I would run into my parents' room (that was my boyhood home: a little ranch-style house in Southwest Detroit). So one night, I ran into their room and I felt/saw this thing duck it's head under the door frame and enter the room. It looked like it was made of green energy, or something. I screamed and my parents woke up and it went away, and I never saw it again. But I'm pretty sure that whole ordeal was about a month long, which is forever in kid terms.

I also saw a ghost in a rocking chair when my family visited my dad's old house in Macedonia. That was in 1993. I never told anyone, but then when we went back in 1998, I heard my dad telling my mom about his grandfather's favorite rocking chair, and remembered when that shit went down. It sent a chill down my spine!

My grandfather had a patch of land outside of Detroit where he farmed a large garden of vegetables to pickle for the winter. He was an old school European. My g-pa was a no-nonsense sort of man that took no stock in anything supernatural, and didn't speak any English, really. One day he came back and told me he saw a pair of kids at the edge of the woods. They way he described them, to me, sounded like they wore 18th century clothes.

If you want to blame anyone for empowering Hitler, blame the League of Nations in negotiating the treaty of Versailles. The economic state that the treaty put Germany in coinciding with the economic failure of the US economy which had a huge fiscal stake in buying German debt plunged their economy into the point where conservatism became an exploitative political answer for the vulnerable and increasingly destitute people of the state.

As for antisemitism...spare me if you think Hitler was the first German to hate Jews. He himself was brainwashed by the Kaiser and his great anti-Semitic propaganda.

As for his expansionist, militaristic attitude than what about Britain?! The Raj?! As if their occupation of India was not an expansionist, imperial agenda. Indian's were subject to great inhumanities as well. If you can't agree with that, than look at Britain's occupation of Kenya and tell me Germany was the only inhumane empire.

Every empire had an expansionist agenda. The USSR had republic states that weren't tied to the Russian ethnocentricity of Russian culture. Not to mention that Stalin was as inhumane as Hitler and completely hoped to expand the soviet empire as fruits of his effort against the third reich.

Hitler sucked but the European powers that combated him certainly weren't ruled by angels. Retaining the liberally influenced hegemony of Europe was all that the allies hoped to accomplish. They did so and empowered an equally brutal dictator in Stalin in the hopes of doing so.

Point is, blaming citizens of a nation's political agenda is a joke. By that token, American citizens deserve the terror they've encountered from the middle east due to the US destroying its diplomacy with the middle east since with its foreign policy since recent vintage. The world views us as an imperial power that disrupts the stability of geographic states by asserting its western influence. While that logical may be irrational, the sentiment surely exists and there are Americans who disagree with our foreign policy that has gotten us to that point. That doesn't mean we should be held unilaterally as proponents of that policy making.

My impression is that this is more an issue when a country cannot externally devalue through a lower exchange rate - for example, European periphery countries right now cannot externally devalue as they don't have their own currency. Hence the need for internal devaluation to restore competitiveness, which is a slow and painful process. But easier with some inflation. 

 Then there's the ZLB on nominal interest rates too - inflation allows real rates to go negative. This is a separate concept.

5,"Well after some research, it would seem I mostly disagree with the concept of soft power as more than a cop-out than an actual concept with which to evaluate geopolitical forces. 

It doesn't imagine for one second that there might be a soft power different from the ""soft"" coercion the US has been exerting over the world since WWII over the pretense of being the good guy. The US is really the world police : Whenever you run into them, you're guaranteed a bad time. Its movie industry ? Deals were made to kill local production. Its attraction ? Sure who wouldn't want to be part of a country who lives on the back of the rest of the world, overconsuming, protected by a Navy that controls all the seas. Legitimate policies ? What the actual fuck. The list of what the US has done that gives them bad press is so fucking long. And they can't even close one of the most prominent and infamous example of their wrongdoings aka Gitmo. 

The US is an Empire, they behave like an Empire, they sell their model like an Empire ( The Pax Americana which Western Europe or Japan didn't really have a choice to accept ). And now this guy is saying that it's hard to undo that which the US has had 70 years to solidify ? Thanks a lot. When he says soft power, what he thinks is : ""America has won, what does it do next ?"". Only thing to do is assimilate culturally the rest of the world. True maybe but it rests on the notion that ""America has won"". In reality, the tide is shifting heavily, economically mainly but the rest will follow. 

This attack at Russia and China is one more delusion for US citizens trying to believe in it. First, he's so caught up in his own ego that he doesn't realize that they don't mean the same thing when they talk about soft power. Second, they're not yet behaving like Empires so there is a component to their attitude and foreign policy that is nationalistic and self-asserting in a way that the US can afford not to be. Again this is an inheritance of the past that the US should not be too confident about. When you are China and you come out of your slumber and you find youself encircled by hostiles or countries heavily influenced by another superpower, it's not soft power that will get you what you want or break the other country's influence. They talk about soft power as a way to sugarcoat it but they know it's gonna take money, people, incentive and the right amount of threat. Soft power to them is ""everything that's not war or too heavily threatening"". But it's not all. 

China's soft power is actually way different than what the US could ever dream to achieve no matter how much they spend or how many movies and shows they sell. It rests on its innumerous diaspora and its flush coffers. Chinese migrants are everywhere and Chinese students that are currently in the top universities in the world will provide plenty of trade secrets and influence to China, and by the sheer numbers that they represent they have a lot more potential than any other nations ever had before.

Same with Russia, they may not play the same game since the USSR has fallen but they sure have a lot of soft power still.

2,"&gt;  until American soccer is integrated into the global game and operates in a similar manner, it will lack credibility with fans of the global game. basically, what draws many americans to soccer is not it's similarity to other american sports, but its differences.

Except I'm that person you're describing and I couldn't disagree with you more.  I've been watching soccer for as long as I can remember  (Italian-Irish background) and the credibility in the game here is there.  I'm also an avid hockey fan.


Look, I know this may seem hard to believe to those of you who DON'T live in either Canada or the US, but things are done differently here and it works.  It's really that simple.  


The current model has been in place in many professional sports here for almost 100 years.  Why should it change in order to suit an outsider's opinion?  I don't see a thread labelled, ""Do you think European clubs should adopt salary caps?"" Why?  Because it's been that way since day 1 and no one questions it even though they know the current financial system is completely ridiculous.  Your league has 2-4 teams that win every single year?  Big deal.  Spend.  Spend.  Spend.  No wonder the relegation battles seem to exciting.  It's all a club like QPR will ever have.


Bottom line.  There's no reason to adopt a promotion/relegation system over here simply because the concept just doesn't exist and trying to cram it down our throats is just arrogant.",0,c9q3st1,1431365013,False,t3_1deuu6,53,,onlynickleft,0,t5_2qi58,1367381152,t1_c9pwanu,soccer,,False,0,Toronto FC,True,t1_c9q3st1,2
1,"1. Downtown the city works pretty hard to make sure everything is clean... fairly different in the outside parts of ottawa though. and we don't compost if you live in an apartment yet... so that's weird. because downtown is fill of businessmen and is the main touristy spot it is always kept clean though, and people are pretty good about putting garbage where it's supposed to go.

2.everyone busses here. Compared to my hometown, no one has a license even if you like in an outer part of town because the bus system is quite good here. Plus there is no parking downtown... 

3.college students do what college students do... There are a lot of pubs here, so everyone goes out for drinks and goes clubbing. the clubs are not fantastic and are usually full of shady old people, but when you are drunk it doesn't matter. But pubs are always full almost every night of the week. 

4. There is a surprisingly large ska scene here which is cool.

5. Personally I don't care about the University level sports here, I'm sure other students do though. 

6.there's a good amount of political science students, the largest faculty at my school is communications though. And my school had a very good business section which draws many students in. Not a huge amount of political science students. I find that a good amount of people who are interested in politics are in other programs though and learn what they wish about politics on the side.

7. Ottawa tries and does very well at it, almost everyone who's first language is french though does speak English so it's not nessicary to speak both languages. I would say that most people who speak French grew up with it as their first language or went to a French school... probably 30% of the people here do not speak French though. Middle Eastern languages are actually spoken here more than french is due to our large middle Eastern population. 

8.everyone is pretty much expected to go to college, but there was a pretty high drop out/incomplete rate in my regions high schools. It's okay to go to a technical school, but it's not really acceptable. Our high school classes are set up by what post secondary you wish to take (eg. College level English vs university level English vs applied(trade jobs) level English), so you have to decide fairly early which is best for you depending on how difficult you find school or not. Like if you take all university level courses you can do anything in post secondary, but if you take applied courses in high school you can only to trade work or apprenticeships as post secondary. 

9. I have never been to hollywood or LA, but I don't think there is. My friends who have visited those cities say there is nothing like them in Canada. Toronto would be like our NY but it's not super close, people like it because it's a typical city with a mix of cultures and districts and a fairly decent night life and some decent entertainment agencies and such. I think Vancouver would be like LA, they seem to have a similar vibe, and it's way warmer in Vancouver than in other parts of Canada. Ottawa is a ""Big City"", but it feels like a small town when you live here which is really nice, if that makes sense. Montreal and Quebec City are also really popular if you want more of a European vibe and some good artsy activities, Montreal has a really good night life also. Most of our media would be in Toronto, that's where the television stations and head quarters are along with the major modeling agencies and advertising companies. 

10. You want to go to the National Art Gallery because it is beautiful. But what I find best is just walking around and looking at things as if you were a local. Anything up by Sussex (this is a cue to Google maps things) is gorgeous and there is a really nice park behind the Fairmont that is gorgeous. The byward market is a typical tourist place but it's always crowded and is not a place to go after dark, most locals avoid it. The grounds around the parliament are gorgeous and are cool to wander around. Bank street (especially the southern bit) has some cool shops and is a place many locals go for food. Sparks street is lovely. But all in all just general walking around is cool, many of the buildings are historic and tell you who lived there and it's neat to see all the international embassies around the city. Along the canal is a lovely path for walking or biking. There is also surprisingly good food here: Bowich (organic and delicious sandwiches on Bank street), three Brewers ( a really neat pub/bar where everything is brewed there located on Sparks street), the Tea party (tea house near the market with awesome food and is quaint and adorable), and a bunch of others listed in the Ottawa sub reddit :)

1,"I've noticed this different attitude from Vietnamese. I live in an immigrant rich area, and I've talked to people from a lot of different cultures about sexuality. The Vietnamese have a very different attitude towards all manners of sexuality, to begin with, and I wouldn't say that they're outright the best or most mature when it comes to same sex relationships, but they're pretty damn close. For example; I often ask people about their perceptions of neighbouring cultures and countries, and with the Vietnamese I'll often ask them about the Thai, who openly celebrate transgender and same sex culture ... and the Vietnamese I've spoken too don't find this offensive, in fact they tend to just laugh a little bit about it in a good natured way, but they see it as something for Thai's and that, if you're Vietnamese this doesn't apply.

The contrast I find most interesting is between them and Indian's. This group tends to be quite ignorant of it's existence or prevalence unless they are actually gay themselves. Once they find out about this, they are curious, and will joke about it a lot, but it's hard to tell how they actually feel about it.

I personally wonder though; do European based societies really have a right to claim that we're 'better' on this matter?

That and it's a safe bet there's going to be a rise in real EU scepticism in Europe in the European election, and the leader of UKIP is also president of the leading EU sceptical voting bloc - which is why Farage gets to sit at the front and why we see so much of him.

E.g. I was sitting across from a friend of mine at the local coffee shop, we were next to a window that looked out to a not very active street, she was talking about the art project she was working on (I was a business major and had no knowledge of what was going on with her classes), before she got a chance to tell me what the project was I stopped her mid-sentence and said, ""Is your project about weaving a pattern and you were thinking about making it out of the twigs from the park down the street?""

I think a large portion of science fiction fans by their nature don't like Earth as it exists right now--they want something different (futuristic!). So, authors blow it up.

It's also an easy way to establish a new history with two advantages:

1. The author can assume that we know what humanity is and basic tenets of Earth culture (marriage/family/children, drive to explore, the capability of good and evil within each person, etc). aaaand...

2. No baggage from Earth's actual history.

Because as much as I'd love to see a company that embraced the cheaper manufacturing to china to bring us better quality and fabrics and design, I just don't see it happening...I see a company that uses all the same stuff that they would if they made it locally, and pockets the difference. 

Which, don't get me wrong. That's their right to do. If that works for them, then great. But since we're comparing shirts of equivalent price here, I'd rather support American or European manufacturing, because it both keeps jobs at home.

In the United States, no particular sport is a year-long sport, so multiple sports have a valuable niche. Without other sports to go into, people will have less incentive to develop athletic skills, and you may not have as many elite athletes as are currently in the United States.

Officers had a standard issue *kyu-ginto* sword, which was a very simple western-styled saber.  However, some chose to carry the more traditional blades.  From the text, 

&gt; The traditional 'samurai' blades as used in feudal Japan, though rarely dating from earlier than the Edo period, were sometimes carried into battle by modern Japanese officers.  There were two types: the longer *katana* or *tachi* of 24-36 inches (the difference indicating whether it was slung edge-up or edge-down respectively), and the *wakizashi* of 12-24 inches, both of which might be carried together at the hip by a samurai warrior.  Ancient examples of such blades were revered not simply as family heirlooms; many Japanese believed that such objects embodied a spirit and had mystic significance.  The rise amongst the Army's younger officers of nationalistic fervor based upon traditional values lead to calls for a 'traditional' sword the replace the European pattern.  These demands were answered by the introduction in 1934 of the Type 94 *shin-gunto* or 'new military-sword' - a modern manufactured version of the *tachi*.

It goes on to discuss the difference in colors for various ranks but I'll leave that to you.  This would suggest that all officers had swords, signifying rank - many in the samurai style. However, the modern manufactured *shin-gunto* was probably much more common than family heirlooms that might signify noble lineage.

1,"Just a few more things. Sorry if this is weighty, I just want to be clear.

Progress-with-maturity is part of the Western/Europe-American narrative which uses exploration through job/work/wealth to achieve some sort of mastery or skill and is un-Christian, Did I get that right?

And because of this narrative we can not have ""fun"" due to the box we've created through the narrative.

&gt; Within every moment is the press toward sin too, but the (sort of) Tao of even more Life ... more freedom and bigger places is the straight path and not the poor imitations. 

Interesting.

&gt;In that way the art of perfection in a walk with Christ is not to kill off all activity or useless/pointless/hopeless misdirection.

Zen is also not a ""killing off of all activity"" it is simply living life. A great book called Zen Mind Beginners Mind sums it up quite well.

&gt;In our practice we have no particular purpose or goal, nor any 
special object of worship. In this respect our practice is somewhat different from the usual religious practices...

&gt;You may think that if there is no purpose or no goal in our 
practice, we will not know what to do. But there is a way. 
The way to practice without having any goal is to limit your 
activity, or to be concentrated on what you are doing in this 
moment.

&gt;I think some of you who practice zazen here may beheve 
in some other religion, but I do not mind. Our practice has 
nothing to do with some particular religious belief. And for 
you, there is no need to hesitate to practice our way, because it has nothing to do with Christianity or Shintoism or 
Hinduism. Our practice is for everyone. Usually when someone believes in a particular religion, his attitude becomes 
more and more a sharp angle pointing away from himself. But 
our way is not like this. In our way the point of the sharp 
angle is always towards ourselves, not away from ourselves. 
So there is no need to worry about the difference between 
Buddhism and the religion you may believe in.

This quote may be taken quite out of context, if we don't read the whole book. If you have time I would read a least portions of it. Again, [Zen Mind Beginners Mind](http://selfdefinition.org/zen/Shunryu-Suzuki-Zen-Mind-Beginner's-Mind.pdf) was written by one of the first Zen Buddhist Monks to come to America in the late 60's SHUNRYU SUZUKI.

I think that you make some compelling points- especially when you talk about the faith bit there- and I am on-board, give or take, but the characterization of Zen might use some work. Or rather lack of work. I think in less words /u/michael_dorfman said something enlightening:

&gt; I think that (1) Nirvana is not rest, and (2) any relationship between a statement by the Pope and Buddhist doctrine is accidental and superficial.

He simply looks at the current budget, how much more we need, and adjusts taxes and expenditure as if they exist in stasis. He completely ignores the other side of the accounting ledger - that for the government to close the deficit, the non-government has to stop running its surplus. It's the government's budget - full of things outside of its control, automatic stabilisers - against millions of household and business budgets. The government is always going to lose this game, if households/businesses are insistent on net saving, a deficit is inevitable, for the government's deficit, by accounting definition, is the non-government's surplus.

Just ask the UK or PIIGS. They're continually making it harder for people to save, finding new fees to charge ([150EUR](http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/978261-financial-genocide) just to file a police report in Greece!), more taxes, and cutting spending - but they find no matter what they do yet another deficit is run and all they have to show for their efforts is a lower GDP. Eventually the government *may* get to the point where they've completely broken the backs of households, made it impossible for them to save and the government may extract its surplus - but is this really something we want here? An arm wrestle with the government, where it keeps on raising taxes until eventually we're so destitute that we admit defeat?

2,"&gt; I don't think that 'freedom to reject pay' constitutes any sort of real human right.

You don't think the freedom not to be forced into labor constitutes a real human right?  If you're not free to choose not to do some labor then you're being forced into it, regardless of how much money your master may choose (not offer, mind you, because an offer requires voluntary acceptance) to pay you.  How is ""paying"" a conscript with money substantively different than ""providing for"" any other kind of slave with food and housing?  Is currency somehow inherently different from other forms of compensation?  It's actually not been uncommon for slaves throughout history to have been able to earn money (and in most cases buy their own freedom, since slavery has traditionally arisen out of debt).  None of that has changed the fact that they've still been slaves.

&gt;  if a nation conscripting soldiers from its population for a single year minimum of paid military service constitutes slavery, it's such a trifling injustice that it does not quite justify using the word slavery.

Tell that to the men who were forced against their will to commit atrocities, to take the lives of others or lay down their own in Vietnam.  Tell that to the men who were shipped from the United States to Europe in WWI to fight and die over a European dispute that they had no need to intervene in.  And those are just a pair of examples from my own country's recent history: if you look back through history and across the world you'll find much, much more destructive applications of conscripted militaries.  

Slavery is never a ""trifling injustice,"" even if it's ""only"" for a period of a year.  I don't know why you're so insistent on setting these absurd criteria for what types of slavery justify using the word ""slavery"": the word has a definition and it's completely appropriate to use it where it applies.

Square Enix announced another round of layoffs in its European sector as part of a company-wide restructuring on Tuesday.

The Final Fantasy publisher is the latest game company to undertake widespread job cuts due to disappointing sales and revenues. Other major videogame publishers, including Electronic Arts and Activision, recently undertook massive layoffs for what they call part of organizational restructuring.

The move comes after the company suffered an ""extraordinary loss"" for the financial year ended March 31.

""We are reviewing our business in Europe to ensure we have the right structure, content, and skills for the changing entertainment landscape,"" Square Enix says in a statement sent to MCV UK. ""We do expect changes to the UK office, which will affect personnel. We will update you when the time is right, but our priority right now is for the people within the business.""

The company confirmed its layoff plans, but did not specify who or how many people will be let go. The job cuts come a little less than a month after the company announced significant layoffs at its Los Angeles office, where it said redundancies were made ""as part of the corporate restructuring.""

Square Enix' President Yoichi Wada stepped down in March after the company announced an expected 10 billion yen loss for the 2012-2013 financial year. The disappointing sales of some of its big-budget titles, including Tomb Raider, Hitman: Absolution and Sleeping Dogs (despite being well-received critically) in the North American markets have added further misery to its financial woes, prompting the company to initiate a major restructuring involving significant job cuts.

But **not all** denominations fall under the umbrella term 'Protestant'. It's definitely wrong to say that every non-Catholic Christian group is Protestant.

Protestant denominations are **only** those that follow in the line of the Protestant Reformation that happened in 16th Century, in Germany; led by a Roman Catholic priest called Martin Luther who wanted to help fix a lot of things he thought the Catholic Church was doing wrong. He ended up being kicked out of the Catholic Church and so he started his own movement. They ended up spreading out all over the world, and many more were born along the way by people who agreed with his same basic philosophy/theology.

But there were plenty of separate splits throughout the 1500 years before the Protestant Reformation. By far the biggest and most well known is the one that resulted in the split into the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Catholic Church (which has an estimated 225–300 million adherents) [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church might be worth a skim over if you have time.]

Are the glitches at all game breaking?
How large is the player base? # of servers? One thing I can say that I absolutely loved with EVE was the scale.
There are a few things about this game that seem a bit dated, like the gathering. Personally I'm not huge into clicking a mouse forever to gather lumber but if it's not vital for my PvP abilities I think I could bear it.
Can good form alliances ala EVE or is it more just understood friendship ?

It's a sandbox, so everyone on NA is on one server, and EU another.
There's no game breaking glitches, but this game is new. It's going to crash, it's going to bug out, but it's launch is cleaner then WoW vanilla was, or D3!
The gathering system is a nesisicty, but to perfect it, you need a clan. It would be impossible (nearly) to get enough mats to level all your crafting. Most people join a clan and then donate their mats to crafters and the clan for clan related things like walls on your city and whatnot. Then they give you gear.
In EVE, you can survive alone. In this game if you don't join a clan, you will die. You will never progress. Being tight with your clan is the only way to get anywhere. Voice coms are a must.

My concept for Australia would be a floating seastead farming station, on which the air compressor, generators, water heaters and other support equipment are mounted for an undersea habitat below which makes possible saturation diving. A small community of the workers and their families would live onboard and take two week shifts saturation diving from the habitat to tend to submerged fish farming enclosures like those manufactured by the Oceanspar corporation and used today by Kampachi Farms. Following each shift the workers would decompress inside the habitat (as is done post-mission in the Aquarius Reef Base here in the US) and then return to the seastead above as their replacement crew swims down to take their place.

This would be coupled with a nationalized deep sea mining program closely matching China's, using a neutrally buoyant nuclear powered 33 man habitat floating at 300 feet depth to escape the influence of storms. From this stable platform the occupants can operate the tethered ROVs miles below which do the actual mining. Given the embarrassment of wealth found in deep sea metal deposits there is no time to be wasted in staking a claim for Australia.",0,c9q5vni,1431364033,1367389066,t3_1dgtkk,,,Aquareon,0,t5_2qh8e,1367388468,t3_1dgtkk,australia,,False,0,,True,t1_c9q5vni,7

-6,"The truth is that it's a hot topic in popular culture because it's found its way into high society and the cartels are being careless. This is basically just publicity to get you to patronize your local drug dealer. This stuff isn't just available in Columbia. It's on the streets of America and in Europe. It's the cartels ace-in-the-hole and everyone's new favorite party favor. You will only encounter it if you've gotten close to a king pin and you likely won't even know it's been used on you. By serendipity alone you might be unlucky enough to remember something about the encounter.

They use it for information from people who know something they aren't supposed to for whatever reason. Coke dealers are notoriously paranoid psychotics and if you've even made eye contact with them walking down the street before you know it they're in your house asking questions like ""who are you? what do you know about me? Who are you working for? Are you a federal agent? What is the password to your computer so we can rifle through your files?"" They get off on the sense of power it gives them and think what they're doing to you is hilarious and some will even rape you. What's most humiliating is when you can remember them making fun of you and laughing at your expense. At least the black ops are nice about it ... 

I only know about this because I started regularly dosing myself with an antidote which has actually tipped some of them off to my knowledge of their operations. That makes me their biggest threat besides Anonymous hackers who all likely dose themselves the same way I do. It doesn't stop the hypnosis but it helps you remember things your mind blocks out from the amnesia. For whatever reason some information is retained.

So many different groups of people have used it on me that I I think I'm actually building an immunity to it and my memories from the attacks get more vivid each time it happens. One such incident the assailant had no idea how familiar I was with the drug until he noticed I was coming to. I remember he made fun of me and made me feed myself another dose the way an anesthesiologist would if you woke up in the middle of surgery. 

I've been attacked by drug kingpins, rapists and even government agents all wanting to know what i know about them, about others, who I'm working for, what's on my computers, etc. I have no control but when I come back I remember just enough to know it happened and why.

I frequently feed myself antidote now. The best defense is to sleep away from the door. If you're not on the first floor you can sleep next to an open window. The air blowing in will cut down the dose you receive. They know to only attack you when you're in a deep REM sleep because by the time you'd wake up naturally from the noise they're making the drug will already have taken effect and will wipe your memory clean of the intrusion. Someone who attacked me fairly frequently was doing it so often that I would naturally start waking up as soon as I could hear him bump the lock on my door so he'd have to knock me out with a blow to the head just to administer the drug. The bruising was always pretty mild which is how I knew he had a lot of practice. I got away but I'm sure he's doing this to other people. 

I'm fairly certain that the government agents who are doing this to me are doing it for a good cause. Thankfully they're the same agencies who analyze everyone's internet traffic. They know who's attacking me better than I do and I'm hoping that this message which likely sounds insane to anyone else reading it has been received and aids them somehow in putting the bad guys to justice. Unfortunately, I'm just being naive about this. Like any other drug that's big on the black market there's only so much they can do to control it and they have bigger fish to fry than the people attacking me. I suspect after I've been dosed enough times they might try to utilize my immunity for something but I don't know what and don't want to.

I'm guessing if you're a drug lord and you get caught using this stuff you'll have everyone after you for being careless. Everyone answers to somebody and your superiors will make you disappear. If they don't the government will do it for them. Not only are the cartels trying to keep this a secret but our own government is covering it up both because it would create a massive panic and because they need it for their intelligence operations. They don't have to worry about me spouting off about this on reddit ... I'm just another crazy person to them ... no one listens to crazy people, not even other crazy people.

41,"That first one... seems.. highly inaccurate in many places. The first stat alone seems highly misleading.  It outright admits that over 30 000 deaths a year are attributed to guns, but disguises it saying that guns save more lives than take.   Are they saying that every time a police office draw a weapon, it saves a life?

And the one it says 200 000 women are saved from sexual abuse if they have a gun.. yet America has an extreme high amount of rape charges compared to other countries.  http://www.indexmundi.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/19/rape-statistics-by-country/ granted this is the reported rate which is highly inaccurate, but still America falls ways behind Canada and most of Europe where gun laws are more often stricter.

And the Britain stat? It says Britain has more violent crime. Yet America's homicide rate is 4.8 per 100 000.  England's murder rate was 1.4 per 100 000.    So perhaps murder is lower because England is forced to use less lethal means like knives and bats?  It is also says, in the article it references, that some European countries classify some crimes as violent, which others countries, like America, do not.  

Also the stats? Comparing highest gun ownership to countries with the highest murder rate? That is just... randomness really. They only took five countries.. and don't even tell us how many gun are in the highest murder rate countries.  Why not use the countries with the lowest murder rates?  Japan, Iceland, Singapore.  Which all have very strict gun laws.

2,"Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. The highest point in San Francisco, California, is called Mount Davidson, notwithstanding its height of 300 m (980 ft), which makes it twenty feet short of the minimum for a mountain by American designations.[citation needed] Similarly, Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma is only 251 m (823 ft) from its base to its highest point. Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography[2] states ""Some authorities regard eminences above 600 m (2,000 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.""

In the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high,[3][4][5][6][7] whilst the official UK government's definition of a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 600 metres or higher.[8] In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, typically 100 feet (30 m) or 500 feet (152 m).[9] For a while, the US defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (304.8 m) or more tall. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.[10] [[File:GaldhøpiggenFromFannaråki.jpg|thumb|left|Jotunheimen in Norway with Scandinavia and North Europe's tallest mountain in the middle Galdhøpiggen

Elevation of at least 2,500 m (8,200 ft);
Elevation of at least 1,500 m (4,900 ft), with a slope greater than 2 degrees;
Elevation of at least 1,000 m (3,300 ft), with a slope greater than 5 degrees;
Elevation of at least 300 m (980 ft), with a 300 m (980 ft) elevation range within 7 km (4.3 mi).
Using these definitions, mountains cover 33% of Eurasia, 19% of South America, 24% of North America, and 14% of Africa.[12] As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous.[13]",0,c9q6ad2,1431363841,False,t3_1dftrp,,,Spaztic_monkey,0,t5_2qqjc,1367390515,t1_c9q5nma,todayilearned,,False,0,,True,t1_c9q6ad2,2

3,"In a nutshell, the Japanese empire came about first, heavily influenced by the chinese. The ""king"" at first just collected resources from the different scattered communities. All-out armed conflict often occurred between these communities. Later, with the assistance of the Chinese empire, the nation of Japan formed in the sense of a more powerful central government that kept the different clans operating each community in check, led by an emperor.

As part of this government, a court was formed that included representatives from each clan. Over time, the power of these clans grew. While the emperor had substantial power over the country in the year 600 (the emperor of that time period brought buddhism to Japan, for example), by the 1100s a period of political instability caused by the clans fighting led to more and more powers for warriors fighting rebellions, such that eventually the samurai became a powerful political class, and the shogunate was the real head of state. Judging from all this, and from the fact that the shogunate gained its power legitimately by slowly annexing powers, it seems to me that the emperor remained intact because to depose the emperor would be to overthrow the government, and to do that would remove the legitimacy of the shogunate. 

Some European constitutional monarchies still have kings and queens as heads of state despite the parliaments being the center of power for this same reason: The democratic parliament was established to protect the monarchy from being overthrown, even though the effect is that the crown is powerless.

Now, going back to these clans, they never went away, and were constantly part of politics. The thing is, even though Japan was a whole, it wasn't really unified. The infighting never stopped, hence the need for the police and military powers of the shogunate.

Essentially, the shogunate became the ruler of the nation because Japan became a militaristic police state, and the samurai became the aristocracy for the same reason. However, the fighting didn't end because the shogunate was established.

Around the 16th century, the sengoku period of total war took place, in which nearly every able-bodied farmer was a soldier in one institution or another. Through alliances, wars, political gambits, and other methods, one group came to unify Japan such that under the shogunate, the country saw relative peace for hundreds of years until Admiral Perry's black ships sailed into Tokyo Harbour in 1853.",0,c9q6ddw,1431363801,1367391614,t3_1dedx5,,,[deleted],0,t5_2ssp3,1367390960,t3_1dedx5,AskHistorians,,False,0,,True,t1_c9q6ddw,3

10,"The swastika is a very old symbol that was unfortunately adopted by the German party so now we think of Nazis when we see the symbol.  I can easily see how a kid would think it is neat and want to copy it.    Below is what Wiki has to say about it.

The earliest archaeological evidence of swastika-shaped ornaments dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization as well as the Mediterranean Classical Antiquity. Swastikas have also been used in various other ancient civilizations around the world including China, Japan, India, and Southern Europe. It remains widely used in Indian religions, specifically in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, primarily as a tantric symbol to evoke shakti or the sacred symbol of auspiciousness. The word ""swastika"" comes from the Sanskrit svastika - ""su"" meaning ""good"" or ""auspicious,"" ""asti"" meaning ""to be,"" and ""ka"" as a suffix. The swastika literally means ""to be good"". Or another translation can be made: ""swa"" is ""higher self"", ""asti"" meaning ""being"", and ""ka"" as a suffix, so the translation can be interpreted as ""being with higher self"".[1]

The swastika is a Chinese character, defined by Kangxi Dictionary, published in 1716, as ""synonym of myriad. It is used mostly in Buddhist classic texts"",[2] by extension, the word later evolved to represent eternity and Buddhism.",0,c9q6exd,1431363781,False,t3_1dfth4,,,benignlurker,0,t5_2qh1i,1367391198,t1_c9q4369,AskReddit,,False,0,,True,t1_c9q6exd,10

The examples were poor not just because they're ""the old guard"", but because we simply aren't playing in a double pivot system. You seem to think we are playing in one which is mind boggling. Do you even know what a double pivot is? Not every midfield 2 is a double pivot system. We've been playing a system where Carrick stays back nearly all the time to cover the defence. 

I see Jones' future in a midfield 3 in **big games**. We can play a midfield 2 without him just find in most games, but he is immensely useful attacking and defensive wise in Europe and against top 4 PL opposition.

3,"It is a confusing topic, both were pretty much the same event in some respects. I would say the most significant difference was that the Italian Renaissance was more driven by the revival of the pagan aspects of Classical Antiquity. The driving force of this was the Academy of Florence, it's founding father Marsilo Ficino, and in particular its visiting professor (so to speak) George Gemistus Plethon. Plethon's ambition was a Pagan revival which would Christianity, and all other religions into it. Oddly enough one his chief supporters was the Papacy. Rome had the ambition to reabsorb the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire, and above all the Orthodox Church. Plethon, a Greek Nationalist and an opponent of the Orthodox Church was a natural ally. Northern Europe was not much interested in this project. The Nation State was emerging with its own nationalisms, and the new scholarship was drawn into the conflict between the Nation States and the Papacy, otherwise known as The Reformation. The consequence of these long forgotten struggles is that Botticelli earned a good living painting Roman gods and goddesses and Hans Holbein painted Kings.

I mean, my favorite band is The Decemberists. My radio is tuned to NPR. If you disqualify me because I happen to love jambalaya that's your loss. 

I'm not American, I don't know what either of these things are (jambalaya is a spicy dish from the south?). I don't judge people based on likes and dislikes anyway. It's not what kind of music you like, or what you like to eat. These are superficial things. 

But how you view and treat other people, your values and beliefs often stem from your culture and upbringing and it's hard to change what has been ingrained to you since your childhood. Obviously not everybody from a certain culture will think exactly the same, that's ridiculous. That is why I wouldn't turn down a guy just because he isn't from my culture. There are plenty of guys from where I'm from that have completely different values and beliefs than I do even though we grew up in the same city. But it is something I keep in mind.

Also, I believe Americans have more or rather different stereotypes than Europeans do. For example, there are very few black people where I live. That's why there is no stereotype of black people here. The ethnicity most linked to the proletariat are the Turks. I also don't know about any stereotypes for Asian people. Sure, we are aware that Americans consider them as uptight and intelligent but I don't think they are regarded like this here.

I'm not saying different is bad. In the contrary, different is good. I mean, after all I am metaphorically the love child of different. Bit different can also be strenuous, difficult and challenging. Exploring different enriches you and makes you more open and tolerant. Building a home with different is hard work. It can be done and it can be done well, I'm just not sure it's what I want.

Plus, even at that unobtainable speed, the trip from New York to L.A. would take almost a day of actual travel time — as opposed to a few hours on a plane.

In Europe if it's not faster then 200mph, it dosen't count as high speed rail - does Europe (and Japan, and China) have a monopoly on good engineers?

And it might take a full day to get fom NY to LA, but compare travel times from NY to DC or the Austin, Houston, San Antonio triangle.

2,"This is a question that has risen between historians and revisionist historians for some time, and we are now getting to the place where we can reasonably say that the atomic bomb was dropped more for the benefit of the Russians than the Japanese, who were defeated soundly but had not yet surrendered (and even in this they essentially had, they only refused to give up the emperor, but that's a different debate).

But this had less to do with outright intimidation of an enemy as it did with being a serious play with an eye towards post-war security.  1943-44 saw the first serious efforts at postwar security in the United States, which for the first time presupposed hegemony in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  Yalta and Potsdam conferences were specifically geared toward setting up a postwar world, but the U.S. did not trust Stalin.  The USSR already held most of Eastern Europe and promised to allow elections, and was poised to enter the war in the Pacific by August if Japan had not surrendered (3 months after V-E day).  The U.S. now found itself with an enormous amount of power and responsibility along with a searing lesson in the futility of static defense (vis a vis Pearl Harbor) and was anxious about it's own security.  Thus, its expansion became a de facto expansion of the Monroe Doctrine.

American forward strategic frontiers also extended well beyond earlier boundaries, as naval power and strategic bombing range became paramount assets for conducting warfare - and bombers needed forward operating bases to be effective strategic assets.  Experience from two world wars also dictated that no one power should control the Eurasian landmass - a tipping point that the USSR was coming dangerously close to achieving (and more so if it were allowed to take large swaths of Manchuria - a region where its imperial ambitions had already been stymied in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905).

So, the bomb was employed to make the Japanese surrender more quickly and to warn the Russians that the U.S. wielded the ultimate power to prevent a serious land grab in Europe.  Stalin already knew of the bomb, and while it restrained Soviet aggressiveness in the immediate interwar years, it also led him to develop weapons to counter the threat, thus leading to the Cold War.

5,"- The Chinese languages use characters to represent words/sounds unlike English which uses a mostly phonetic alphabet system - which you probably know already. Anyway my point is that the Chinese characters for transliterating Australia are: 澳大利亚 (澳大利亞 - traditional characters) in Mandarin-Chinese is pronounced Ào-dà-lì-yǎ (Ow-dah-lee-ya). One thing to take note, however, is that the first character also has a secondary pronunciation of Yù. Okay so what does Yù have to do with the Vietnamese Úc? 

- There is no one Chinese language. From the ancient tongue arose dozens of variants much akin to the languages that sprung up from Latin (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian etc.). Yes once upon a time the Latin speaking peoples settled elsewhere in the modern day nations of France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania etc. 

- Well historically-speaking Mandarin-Chinese (which is the official and most commonly spoken Chinese language in this day and age) was actually one of the most divergent of the many Chinese languages in terms of pronunciation. For instance it only has 2 consonant endings (-n and -ng) whereas most other Chinese languages kept the -k's, -m's, -p's, -t's and so on. What does this have to do with Vietnamese? Vietnam was a state annexed by China for nearly 1000 years and as much as 60% of the modern day Vietnamese vocabulary derives from Chinese. This is similar to how as much as ~50% of the English vocabulary is French or Latin derived (France ruled England for 300 years). Every Chinese character has a nativised Vietnamese reading.

- Interestingly enough both the Chinese languages and Vietnamese originally (in ancient times) did not have tones. This feature was believed to have developed as various consonant beginnings and endings were dropped (sl-, kl-, ml-, -s, -x, -r, -l...). Anyway the entirety of the Vietnamese kingdom/state was only the northern part of what is today's Vietnam and Cantonese is spoken in the areas to the very south of China bordering Vietnam. Aha! This explains why so many Chinese words when borrowed into Vietnamese sound a lot more similar to Cantonese than any other Chinese language such as Mandarin.

- Back to the characters: 澳大利亞 (I prefer to use traditional characters because they're more historically appropriate). 澳 has 2 pronunciations in most Chinese languages and also in Sinospheric languages (Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese). Mandarin: ào, yù. Cantonese: ou3 juk1 (yuk1). Vietnamese: áo, úc. Korean: 오 (o), 옥 (ok). Japanese: おう (ō), おく (oku). As you can clearly see the 2nd pronunciation in all of the languages listed apart from Mandarin-Chinese has a -k ending. -c in Vietnamese is pretty much a -k ending except for when it's -uc, -oc, -ôc in which case you close your mouth as you're uttering the -k.

- 澳大利亞 would be either Úc-đại-lợi-á or Áo-đại-lợi-á. We, Vietnamese, chose the first and dropped off the 4th syllable to end up with Úc-đại-lợi. Áo was interestingly chosen to represent Austria. Hoa-thịnh-đốn [North VN: Hwa-ting-don, South VN: Wa-tuhn-dohng] (华盛顿/華盛頓) is Huá-shèng-dùn (Hwah-sheng-doon) in Mandarin, Wa4-sing4-deun6 in Cantonese. As for why there was a shift from Sh/s into Th/t in Vietnamese that's a little harder to explain. 

- An easier way to make it seem more familiar would be to compare German with English as English is originally a Germanic language! The word tide in English originally meant time. In German the word time is still Zeit (Tide). Some more examples include: Zehn (Ten), Zu (To), Zähre (Tear - as in to tear something), Zoll (Toll) etc. The Z is pronounced like the end of da**ds**. So here you have a z-t counter-part in German vs English while there's (in some cases) an s-t counter-part in Chinese vs Vietnamese. Z and S are for intents and purposes the same sound but with Z your teeth touch. 

- Finally Ba-lê is from 巴黎 (Bā-lí, Ba1-lai4). The L replaces R since no Chinese words ever started with R and L is the closest alternative. There are some exceptions though like 日[rì (ruh)] but that's Mandarin being funny :) ... Believe it or not that character is pronounced jat6/yat6 in Cantonese, nhật (NV: nyut, SV: nyuhk) in Vietnamese, にち (nichi) じつ (jitsu) [and a dozen other ways depending on the context!!!] in Japanese and 일 (il) in Korean - the very character for Kim Jong **Il**, words ending in -t in Chinese borrowed into Korean nearly always end up as -L in modern Korean pronunciation. Why? Say **it** and then **ill** out loud... your tongue is in a very similar position. 

- Beijing used to be transliterated as Peking and Chongqing was Chungking/Chunking. Why? Actually the pronunciation transition from k- (a more hissing sound) into j- was only quite recent (over the last few hundred years). It is very possible that at the time of the transliteration Beijing was actually pronounced somewhat like Beiking.

- As for **gook** it's most likely a result of Americans misinterpreting the Korean pronunciation of America - 미국 (Mi guk). Perhaps Americans thought they were saying ""me gook - I'm a gook"". In any case the word comes from... *drumroll* Chinese transliteration. 美国/美國 (Měi-guó, Mei5-gwok3, Mỹ-quốc) is ironically an abbreviated form of 亚美利加/亞美利加 (Yà-měi-lì-jiā, A3-mei5-lei6-gaa1, Á-mỹ-lợi-gia). They took the syllable 美 (the -me- in America) and added onto it the word 国/國 (guó, gwok3, quốc) meaning nation/state/country/kingdom. It's interesting to note that the lone character + 国/國 happens a lot especially when referring to more well-known European countries like France (法國) and Germany (德國) and the lone character used to represent the nations carries a positive meaning too. 美 means beautiful, 法 means lawful, 德 means virtuous.

1,"Okay, let's say discrimination led to the bad science. That doesn't change the fact that there were still racist scientific studies that in turn fueled more discrimination. As far as evidence of its popularity, there is some on [the Wikipedia page for scientific racism]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Interbellum_to_World_War_II): 

&gt;Before the Second World War (1939–45), scientific racism remained common to anthropology, leading to programs of eugenics, compulsory sterilization, anti-miscegenation laws, and immigration restrictions in Europe and the United States. The war crimes and crimes against humanity of Nazi Germany (1933–45), discredited scientific racism in academia — but racist legislation based upon it remained in some countries until the late 1960s.

And this view of science and peer review is rather idealistic:

&gt;The scientific process eventually weeds this stuff away while religion encourages it. Sure science can be poorly done, but that's what peer review is all about.

I suppose the quality is higher than it would be without peer review, but peer review does not ensure high quality. Academic journals contain a lot of garbage. Really. I mean it's not all garbage of course. There are plenty of good papers out there, too.

&gt;And if you are suggesting that all arab states have the same culture then mate you are really ingnorant.

Yes dude, Arab states are soooo different from each other. How could we possibly coexist? It's not like we share the same language, religions, traditions, etc...oh wait, we actually do. Culture is not monolithic my friend, however it can be overarching. Just because a New Yorker and a Bostonian have different accents and ethnicities doesn't make either one any less American.

&gt;The arab world is vaster than Europe and yet you claim that we should unite, even in a relatively small country such as Belgium there is conflict about culture, speaking the same language does not justify the formation if a country.

So it is more logical for Europe to have a union even though they don't share a common language, culture, or tradition? That's not far-fetched to you, but it boggles your mind how Arabs who share all aforementioned traits could possibly form a union for free movement of human capital and goods regardless of 'ethnicity'?

1,"The message that I get from all of the recent bee-related emotion is that we do not actually know what is going on, but that the main issue is connected to commercial intensive bee raising, not to the wild population. It seems to vary wildly between countries and regions. There does not seem to be a parallel recent, off trend die - off among wild populations of bees, or among other insects. So one is looking for something that impacts on commercial bee production in Europe and the US. 

Bees were fed on sucrose - table sugar. Corn syrup appeared as a cheap substitute and pushed it aside. I refer readers [to this 1977 text.](http://www.beesource.com/resources/usda/considerations-in-selecting-sugars-for-feeding-to-honey-bees/) Quote: 

&gt;Sugars which poison bees when fed at low levels in sucrose syrup include galactose, arabinose, xylose, melibiose, mannose, raffinose, stachyose, and lactose (Barker and Lehner, 1974b; Barker 1976a). Pectin, agar, and many gums are toxic or can hydrolyze to toxic sugars. [...] The reasons some sugars are poisonous at low dosages are unknown; conflicting theories have been published. 

In other words, improperly hydrolysed corn starch may well contain all manner of poisonous polysaccharides. Not pesticides, just sugars.

0,"You're not quite getting it, and it goes beyond a private / public funding matter. Of course you could make an argument, but just because it's made doesn't mean it even holds on its own merit. The question is a rather existential one. As much as any person wants to have they're heartstrings tugged by a harrowing story of a girl being saved through advanced medicine, there is an inherent acceptance of death and suffering that is not consistent with a principled position but rather skewed and perverted by racism and national an socio-economic supremacism. 

It's a rather deeply rooted psychosis in our culture as evident in our self-congratulation over advanced medical breakthroughs we feel superior about over, e.g., Europe, where there is far more emphasis on broad medical care, universally and also staggeringly more effort and resources allocated for improvement of circumstances in other parts of the world. It is, in essence the same problem that, e.g., causes us to bandy mythologies of how great and wise our Founding Fathers were when most of them were slavers.....that had slaves. Re-read that and let it sink in how psychotic it is to honor and exalt those kinds of people. Every sadistic monster we like to hate in our feel-good version of history also did good things, but that's no reason to value them.

I got off on a bit of a tangent, but the point is that there is merit in principle that simply does not exist in exception, no matter how much we want to feel good about it.

Our culture and society has a long history of rationalizing and justifying horrible actions which we condemn others for in a heartbeat.

Well, it's nice for them to put what it's really about in the first paragraph.

They're not concerned about us Europeans or our abilities to defend ourselves, they're concerned about the fact that we don't share America's interest in pissing our wealth down a giant military hole.

NATO is outdated now, it was made as a counterpoint to the USSR, back when there were only two global powers. It needs to accept that that world has passed, and either change to fit the current one or fade into the past as well.

Besides, because we're all cutting our military does not mean we're less of a threat. The UK is the 4th biggest spender, France is 6th, Germany is 9th and Italy is 10th. Those plus all the other EU countries spending, adds up to a pretty large amount, which will at some point (assuming the EU integrates further and doesn't fall apart) all be consolidated together into one military force.

I think the problem here is that America looks at its military budget compared to everyone else's (it's bigger than the next dozen countries *combined*, and instead of thinking 'Ours is so high, what's up with us?' they think 'Everyone else' is so low, what's up with them?'",0,c9q7svi,1431363127,False,t3_1dgzz7,UKGB,,Mantonization,0,t5_2qh4j,1367401566,t3_1dgzz7,europe,,False,0,United Kingdom,True,t1_c9q7svi,30

&gt;**With that addition to the party, it seems to be lurching more off to the right with every interview I see or read.**

And yet there's a contradiction at work there somewhere, because they're not attracting just the typical right side of the Conservative Party.  It's safe to say the coal mine industry isn't fond of the Conservatives, nor the coal mine communities - yet UKIP by breaking away from where the Conservative cabinet has gone - is actually making inroads with these communities.  Even though Farage describes himself as a bit of a Thatcherite and was keen to wrestle with Boris for the passing on of the handbag.    Farage has been and spoken to these coal communities and received a good welcome.   It's simple really:  they advocate coming out of the European carbon emission policy which are closing the last coal power stations down, and keeping them open.

They're currently doing rather well in South Shields which is the strongest of strong Labour areas dating back to 1935.  They won't win the by election, they didn't even run a candidate in 2010 - but they've gone there and all the trackers are showing that they're turning life long labour voters on the basis of controlled immigration.

You say they're right wing.  The Direct Democracy and Localism addresses that, but the people that they're winning over that wouldn't usually be Conservative voters are identifying them as something else.  Commonsense, of the people, and letting them get on with it and deciding how left or right they are: that's not right wing.  That's POPULIST.

&gt;**Personally, I believe that pulling up the draw-bridge to Europe is not in this country's interests.**

Neither does UKIP and this is a common misconception.  The UK already has a free trade deal with the EU states, signed outside the EU in 1992 that still stands.  This UKIP calls is its fall back.  They want a better 'Swiss style' deal, but the EU not only allows but stipulates that the EU must make a trade agreement with a country leaving under Article 50.   

10% of the UK GDP comes from trade which goes through the Europe Union or the European Free Trade Association.  None of that need be at risk.

By leaving the UK could expect to reduce EU regulations by around 90% (Icelandic levels) and still have access to the EU market.  The Bruges Group worked around a figure that just a 75% reduction would boost the UK GDP by 4.5%.   Again, that's just a 75% reduction - so low balling it.

There is no drawbridge being pulled up.  Not only would the UK still be trading with the EU, it would be so much stronger in the private sector, especially if they also drop the 2008 Climate Change Act which costs £18bn a year and use that to build nuclear.  It could still hit the carbon emission targets by not being part of them - but at the same time be investing and trading MORE with Europe with its new found enterprise and resurgence.  

We could help Europe and the UK MORE by being on the periphery and looking in, rather than locked in and losing competition.

&gt;**They're an important trading partner,**   

That won't change.  It's a Federalist that's used fear to tie you into that argument.  UKIP does not, and has never, advocated stopping trade with the rest of Europe.

&gt;**most of the best food in the world comes from there**

That won't change either.

In fact, being outside CAP, will actual mean your weekly food bill will go down, so you'll have more to spend on those nice European luxuries.

&gt;**pissing on your own doorstep is never a great idea**

Nobody is pissing on anything.  Norway doesn't piss on Europe.  Switzerland doesn't piss on Europe.

If anything the problem the EU has is the changes it wants it can't do because there is a UK with a veto and a 2011 European Union Act that means there has to be a referendum each time there's a treaty change that draws more power - and everybody knows the UK is predominantly EU sceptical.  So either against more power going to Europe, or just outright wants to leave.   

No UK referendum for further integration is going to pass which means there's currently a stalemate position, and it's understandable why some Europeans get fed up with the UK from time to time.  THAT'S pissing on the doorstep.

Not pissing on the doorstep is allowing them to do the changes they want whilst simply going down the trade route for ourselves by leaving.  

If we want to sign up to exchange programmes or research programmes later on, and to contribute financially in those, then there's nothing stopping that from outside the EU either.  Just as Norway agreed to contribute to the new European Union Battle Groups.

&gt;**We can trade and forge meaningful links with BRICs (for example) just as easily with Europe as our chums as not.**

Unfortunately, as nice as it would be, we cannot.  We have a somewhat unique economy in terms of our services and finance sector.  When we went to India with Europe all the Indians wanted to do was talk finance and services...the meetings continued to stall because before that could be settled the EU had to address the pressing issue with other EU countries, namely agriculture and textiles.  

Switzerland has a trade deal with Canada, who shares the same monarch as us, the same language for the most part, much of the same culture as us, but the UK doesn't because it has to go through the EU and it's so large and clumbersome.   

Iceland is in final talks with a trade deal with China, the country that buys its machinery from the UK which it then uses to make the stuff it sells back to Europe.

If you're doing something which very few other countries can do as well, then you can arrange a deal without having to be part of some clumbersome bloc with too many regulations.

1,"Sorry, I wasn't clear, it's voting intention of all the areas which are voting, which is what I meant the first time. The point still stands that this translates very poorly into council seat share due to the nature of the system and vote concentrations. It is conceivable that UKIP could come second in terms of number of votes but still be fourth in numbers of councillors. I think this is the best they can hope for.

So, let's set aside the fact that this is one, unsupported poll and think about what it might look like if it were 100% accurate. First looking at approximate figures for the last time these councils were up for election- 

Councillors: TOTAL- 2393, CON- 1435(1st), LIB- 482(2nd), LAB- 272(3rd), UKIP- 14(5th)

If we then look at the number of councillors each party got for every 1 percent of the vote they received- CON- 33, LIB- 19, LAB- 21, UKIP- 3.

As you can see the UKIP vote was very inefficient at actually getting councillors elected. So if we consider the best case scenario for UKIP with this poll, I think we'd see something like this: CON- 900(1st), LIB- 320(3rd), LAB- 650(2nd), UKIP- 300(4th).

In reality, I expect to see something more like this: CON- 1000(1st), LIB- 400(3rd), LAB- 700(2nd), UKIP- 70(4th). And many would consider that still overly generous to UKIP.

But returning to the original context, these are almost all rural conservative shires, I don't think anyone will be surprised if they vote eurosceptic. Hence, I can't see anyone changing their European policy over it.

MLS is growing, but a lot of football fans in America would rather watch the Premier League than their own league because of the lack in quality. 

Without promotion/relegation, there is no real competition in MLS. Poor teams get no punishment, and when a playoff place is guaranteed the rest of the league matches are as good as worthless. Also, bad teams can continue to be bad because, fuck it, they're still in MLS. 

I'll say with certainty that MLS will die if it doesn't even table promotion/relegation within the next 25 years. MLS survives at the moment because of designated players, and the fact that it's still a lucrative market for European teams to play in. In ten years time this will probably change. Players will find a better market to retire to, and teams will push their tours elsewhere. Where does this leave MLS, apart from with a league that cannot grow in quality and contracting profits?

6,"&gt; 30 years ago, the EU didn't exist.

30 years ago was 1983. The EU was established with the Treaty of Paris in 1952 (although with a different name). The institution we know as the EU is 61 years old this year.

&gt; It's not warmongering to suggest that this peacetime might not last forever.

The reason it's completely unrealistic is that there is no imaginable scenario where anyone would have anything to gain from another European war. Time is infinite, the Earth has a good few billion years to go, so of course there will once again be war on the soil we know today as Europe. But it will not in our lifetimes, nor our children's, or our children's children.

War doesn't happen the moment it becomes unprofitable. We are much more entangled than you Brits seem to realise. Half your groceries are likely produced in some other EU country, and *all* of them have certainly had elements of their production influenced by products from other EU countries.

&gt; Whereas Europe has been at war with each other almost constantly until the end of WW2. How many empires have risen and fallen here? Hundreds? How many times have the borders changed as countries merged, became independent or were conquered?

How many of those empires have been liberal democracies? How many of them have valued trade over conquest?

&gt;  I'd say that the 3rd largest economy leaving would present a significant problem for the EU.

Yes, but it also isn't going to happen. It would be *catastrophic* for the UK economy. No less. The core EU countries have no motive to cater to the interests of a UK not in the union, and it's likely that most financial activity would be moved from London to Paris or Frankfurt am Main.

3,"After graduation from a University I was handed a sign-on bonus and flown out for two weeks of training with my companies new-hires from across the country. Included in the group were additional new-hires from my office, some of which I had known from school. 

We were put up in a luxury hotel, each having our own rooms, ten hours of training every day accompanied with mandatory socialization in the evenings. Open bar provided, of course. 

I spend the first couple days observing. Striking up conversations, getting to know people. Assessing what options are out there. I'm not particularly looking for anything, but a closer connection with someone from the group would make the two weeks more interesting. I rule out many of the options before identifying someone in the group I might be interested in. 

&gt; **The Challenge:** Somehow find a way to pursue without tipping off my co-workers, who have the advantage of knowing me prior, or alerting her co-workers in order to avoid bringing stories of the hook-up back to our respective home offices. And do this within the confines of strict group interactions from 8am to 7pm every day. 

Once sights were set finding opportunities to get closer and strike up conversation proved scarce. We're split into random seating during training hours and she's across the room from me. She is studying for an upcoming professional exam after training sessions and becomes scarce whenever we have free time. Have one chance to strike up conversation during a break.

Nearly a week goes by. Finally on Friday we get more free time than usual and I find her and a friend ordering food in the hotel bar. Sit down to join them and order myself a drink. Engage them in conversation for a bit before a friend I was waiting on meets me, I get distracted and leave to check something out with him. 

We go out to bars as a group about 20-deep, each of us with sign-on bonus money to burn. Everyone is fighting over who gets next round all night. She meets us after we've been out for a couple hours and first thing she does is come up to me incredulous that apparently when I ordered my drink at the hotel bar earlier, I left without paying, leaving her with my bar tab. Oops. I wish I had planned that. I play into it kidding her that it's like she's never bought a man a drink before. She's come straight to me now that we're out and I take advantage of the opportunity to entertain. I promise to make up for the drink and buy her one in return, which I don't, we move locations. Next location she's resettled near her co-worker who's actually a pretty cool guy and doing a great job of entertaining that side of the group. After a while I wander off to the bar to order some food and in the meantime strike up a conversation with a girl at the bar. My target comes looking after a while and finds me there, I turn attention away from the other girl back toward her and have some opportunity to kino a bit away from our main group. Reminds me I owe her a drink and I deflect as another from our group has just purchased another round. Night winds down, everyones trashed, I take control and coordinate cabs to get everyone back to the hotel. The group plans to post-party on her floor of the hotel, she excuses herself for the night and as we have a third wheel I restrain myself to not draw attention. 

Next night we go out to the bars again. I'm a little more direct this time around trying to make sure I've got her attention. Move locations to a dance club. I've had some competition from other guys in our group. Turns out the girl is a dancer. As is one of the guys into her. And I'm more on the terrible but like to have fun side of things. No one knows each-other all that well and keeps switching partners. Finally while dancing I remind her I still owe her that drink and we move off and press into the bar where I get more opportunity away from the group. 

Night winds down, she's hammered. Give her my hand and lead her to get a huge glass of water from the bar. Rest of our group is hammered. I take control and arrange for cabs again. Manage the situation to split her co-worker along with my last-standing co-worker in one cab and her next to me in mine. Help her get to her room, she's completely trashed. I've got no interest in pushing anything further with someone in that state. Come in and hook her up with more water. Order room-service to bring up a fruit-platter to get some vitamins in her, your typical hangover-management provisions. Meanwhile she goes to the bathroom and gets sick, totally embarrassed. Chat a bit. Make sure she's taken care of before heading to my room. She cuddles up and asks me to stay, felt nice, went ahead and fell asleep next to her. Woke up early the next day, exchanged numbers, I slipped out and returned to my room. Lots of immediate flirting through texts. 

Sunday night our group parties in hotel rooms. Her co-worker is paired near her almost all night. I'd like to redirect her, but can't as I don't want to raise suspicions. Finally she says her goodnights for the evening and leaves. I figure what do I have to lose and text her, playfully inviting myself over to her room. (Apparently not directly enough as she totally missed my meaning, as I would find out after-the-fact. Additionally apparently she tried giving me some sort of clear look, or indication that I should follow her out and I totally missed the sign.) Whoops. Just hung out and socialized for the evening. 

Monday. Back to training. Go shopping with few other people, one of my female co-workers takes the opportunity to suggest she noticed I'm into someone at training. Whoops, I've been noticed. Necessary evil to get initial attraction going. Typical evenings are social dinner -&gt; group to the hot-tub until 10 -&gt; group party in someones hotel room. This one is no different. After dinner my target is on the fence about studying or hot-tub. I kid about walking up to her room and carrying her down, flirt a bit, she comes down. We keep the flirting to texts. One of the other guys who has shown interest keeps hovering. I slip inside-jokes like references to fruit-platters casually into conversation, she has a hard time not laughing throughout. The main group goes to watch a movie, we opt out and I walk her back up to her floor. See the opportunity and go in for the kiss, her eyes go wide, grabs me by the hand and drag me further down the hall closer to her room. Finally I kiss her. We make out in the doorway a bit, then I discretely take the stairs conveniently located by her room down to my floor. 

Flirt a bit more in text. I express wanting to keep things discrete, she's on the same page and wants to keep it secret from her co-workers as well. I make a game out of it. The objective is to escape notice from anyone else. We don't eat at the same tables at dinner, we don't sit next to eachother during training. Only passing comments in public. She loves the idea of the game. I invite her over to my room for the evening. She says tomorrow night. 

Secret Ops Rendezvous is a go. She has a hard time not laughing every time she looks at me, which is perfect. I use that to my advantage to occasionally drop into a conversation she's in and tease her. She's into the secrecy of the whole thing, go so far as to suggest alternative names for her which I put in my phone so people around me don't see who I'm texting. I've already figured out the stairwell option allowing us to bypass elevators and stay out of hallways. We spend the rest of the trip slipping into eachother rooms then back to our own in the mornings. One final meeting before we went off to the airport and flew back to opposite sides of the country. Later got a text asking permission to send an account of the hookup to one of Cosmo's Sex Stories columns, made me feel proud of the effort I put in. 

**TL;DR - Discretely enlisted mutual new-hire for secret ops fun during company training, and kept it hidden from co-workers**

Things I feel I did right:

* Accidentally leaving her with my bar-tab had a great result. We'd all just received signing-bonuses so really money wasn't an issue. She was absolutely shocked that I would do such a thing and didn't know what to make of it. Ensure that when we did go out she came straight to me and didn't get distracted by any of the other guys trying to hit on her.

* Making a game of the need for secrecy worked well. She absolutely loved playing the part. I've adapted this in other situations since. I made a game of making the most of every minute of every day with my current girlfriend in the time until she took a month-long vacation in Europe two weeks after I met her. 

* Not making a move and just taking care of her when she was drunk was big. She disclosed later that this is what convinced her I was a good guy and lowered her walls, that she probably would not have slept with me so quickly otherwise. 

* Being aware of the situation in terms of group dynamics at all times and having the patience to take my shots when opportunity presented itself. Having to work around not alerting co-workers was an interesting twist on my usual approach that left me winging it more often than not. I was concerned about being too discrete and never having a proper chance before the trip was over. 

* Not necessarily something I did, but the situation was right. She was far from home with less risk of being judged for her actions. We were all flush with cash excited about a new job in a high-end hotel for two weeks. Adding alcohol into the mix I'm surprised there weren't many more hook-ups happening during the trip.

Neither does the head of any church in the US.

2,"Well, everyone but Native Americans (""Indians"") are technically immigrants, but there have been waves of immigrants over the years, and the Irish immigrants were the first major ones after the initial formation of the country, so Irish are seen as ""new"" to the country, whereas Protestants who have ancestors going back to colonial times and the founding of the country are seen as the settlers of America.  

For the vast majority of us, WASPs are not seen as immigrants.  In fact, they have roots that go back many, many generations more than most other groups, so those of us who can only trace our origins in this country for a century or less, WE are the immigrants who came to THEIR country.  The interesting thing to note is that African Americans didn't have an immigration wave in the 19th century or 20th century, so they also are not seen as immigrants.  Most of the time, immigrants are seen as European or Asian or Latin, who have been here only a small fraction of the time that the U.S. has been here.  Italians, Irish, Polish, Russians, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mexican, and Indian are among those that can be considered widely as part of an immigrant group, although these days most of the immigrant groups come from only a few places, and most of them are not Caucasian.  

Again, the foundation of the country by white, slave-owning, land-owning, rich males makes that the default norm for our society and anything that deviates from that is different and needed a breakthrough to be recognized as equal to the Founding Fathers.  

I studied a lot of this in history courses in college, so I think I'm more well-versed about the changes in our society through the years than the average American.  Which means that perceptions about who is an immigrant can vary widely.  If you're from Boston and have family spanning back to the 18th century, everyone seems like an immigrant.  To the Irish, Asian-Americans can seem like the real immigrants.  And to some Asian groups like Japanese who see very little immigration today, immigrants from the Phillipines and China and Mexico are the modern immigrants.

It's all very relative, and the farther back you can trace your roots, the more closely tied you are with American culture rather than the country of your immigrant group.  Most English-Americans don't identify with the United Kingdom very well and consider this firmly their home.  Many Irish have only a vague sense of identity to Ireland and it may only get brought up during St. Patrick's day or other similar times.  Most bilingual people had family (particularly their immediate parents or themselves) who were born in another country, so there is a strong sense of cultural identity with that country in addition to being an American.",0,c9q8tll,1431362647,False,t3_1dgyzb,,,yakusokuN8,0,t5_2qh1i,1367409811,t1_c9q8mlh,AskReddit,,False,0,,True,t1_c9q8tll,2

That doesn't mean that there aren't still big differences or that there isn't still often a disproportionate christian influence - there definitely is.

1,"Thanks for going into this in so much detail. 

For the sake of defending my point, I am going to be incredibly meticulous in the details here.

I think it can be said in the age of the internet that the vast majority of child pornography is likely to be shared either (a) on a website or forum, (b) using p2p software such as limewire or, (c) using torrents.

In the case of 'a', that would form a feedback loop similar to how you suggest in the second and third paragraph of your comment, that an adult pornographer might make porn involving tall women. The nature of the feedback loop in this case is makes it possible for people to make incredibly specific requests. In the case of 'c', leaches on a torrent are measurable so it would be reasonable to suggest that downloading via this method does create a feedback loop which may influence the producer or incentivise him to create more images - although not to the same extent as 'a'. With 'b' however, due to the nature of this form of p2p software, once a file is copied from the original producers computer, there is no way for him to track how many times the file is being downloaded as he will not be able to monitor the number of downloads of that file from the computer or a person who has copied it from him. The network distribution relies on things like geographic proximity - so if a producer is in American, and shares the file with a person in Europe - other people in Europe will most likely download the file from the person in Europe rather than than original producer. 

You do make a good point about the commission of these images through social encouragement - and I believe it would be fitting to actually create an additional offence of inciting to create images.

Ultimately the only point I am attempting to make in my post (nothing more, nothing less) is that a person who is in possession of an image, or whom downloads the image on p2p networks (which will most likely be 'b' rather than 'c' due to the fact torrents can be remotely traced) cannot be said to be culpable for the harm that is caused by the original abuse, or the re-victimisation through distribution, and so should not be caught up in any sort of prohibition.

0,"&gt;You mean the christian democrats, who never thank God in public statements, never deny evolution or the big bang, have explicitly said they do not aim to repeal abortion, gay marriage or euthanasia laws?

You seem to be obsessed with symbolism.

&gt;Look i'm not saying that there's some black and white difference between the US and Europe where one is a secular utopia and the other is a medieval crusader state.

Really? That seems to be exactly what you're saying. If that's your position I'd consider the argument to be over. 

&gt;What I am trying to say is that while in the 18th and 19th century most European states were very unitary religious countries with a huge church influence, since world war 2 there's been a steady secularization of politics and every year religion is less important than the year before.

And that is true in the US as well.

&gt;This in contrast with the US, whose politics were much less religious during the 18th and 19th centuries, but where the importance in politics has risen so much since WW2.

Bullshit.

&gt;Thing like changing the pledge of allegiance to include god, putting god on money and buildings

Mere symbolism, and symbolism that is dwarfed by it's European equivalents. American currency doesn't declare a hereditary monarch to be ""defender of the faith"" and installed ""by the grace of God"".

&gt;When you look at this I don't understand how you can say the US is not lagging behind Europe in the process of secularization.

2,"&gt; marijuana smokers (who include tobacco in their joints)

I don't include tobacco in my joints. That's actually a lot more common in Europe. Not so much in the states. 

What's the sense in including tobacco when the discussion is about weed anyways? It's not like it's a secret that cigarettes can cause cancer. I mean, you're telling me people who smoke tobacco with their weed are at higher risks for cancer. Well no shit, they're smoking tobacco and removing that tobacco would clearly lower your chances of getting cancer. If weed can cause cancer, then keep the discussion on weed instead of trying to use what we know about tobacco to form similar opinions about weed.

&gt;marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70% more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke.

Yeah, while that is true, it doesn't necessarily prove anything. It's just a statistic regarding weed. It doesn't even go on to say that this means weed can cause permanent damage to the lungs. Someone reading it would just assume that this must mean weed is worse. It just says weed has more carcinogens. It doesn't say those particular carcinogens cause cancer. It doesn't say thc or cbd causes cancer. It doesn't say *anything* in weed specifically causes cells to mutate permanently... 

You also fail to mention that tobacco smokers light up packs and packs a day which means they are still getting more carcinogens into their lungs than weed smokers who might only smoke a joint or two in a session. This is probably more important than anything else I've said. Everything around us has a potential to contain carcinogens. Even food can sometimes contain them. Being exposed to those carcinogens in itself isn't gonna cause cancer unless the levels are high enough. So what's my argument here regarding weed and carcinogens? People don't smoke enough weed to actually get cancer from the smoke. There's also the simple fact that tobacco is grown using radioactive materials.

Even with proof that weed has more carcinogens than tobacco, no one can forge a definitive connection between weed smoking and cancer. It just isn't there. There aren't hospitals out there full of former potheads dying from throat or lung cancer. There aren't published journals out there that state weed is a cause of cancer. Can the same be said of tobacco?

You don't even seem to fully understand exactly what a carcinogen is. Carcinogens themselves don't always cause cancer. At least the ones in marijuana won't. Here's something you need to understand. Tobacco and weed are two incredibly different drugs. They are made up of different chemicals and are grown using different substances, like Polonium, which is used when growing tobacco. This means when either substance is burned, and those carcinogens are introduced to your lungs, they have entirely different effects on the body.",0,c9q9fsh,1431362356,1367414460,t3_1dgf9i,,,DamnManImGovernor,0,t5_mouw,1367413133,t1_c9q8rnt,science,,False,0,,True,t1_c9q9fsh,2

7,"One of the biggest problems for figuring out the Book of Mormon **geographical support** is that *almost all ancient place names were lost, when the Americas were colonized*. Historians estimate that many native populations in the Americans decreased around 90% within the first 100 years of colonization. As a result, there are vast troves cultural and geographical information that was lost through rapid population compression. Colonizers then changed more place names as they ""enlightened"" the natives. This is in stark contrast to biblical geography where place names have been relatively constant for thousands of years. 

Without a reliable geographical understanding of where the events of the Book of Mormon took place, finding **archaeological evidence** becomes near impossible. However, in general it is very difficult to verify the existence of specific events and people through archaeological finds.  Shards of pottery and grain grinding slabs tell us much more about people's day-to-day lives than about the inner workings of their government and religion. Even in cases where the geography is understood, it is difficult to find archaeological evidence. For example, no reliable archaeological evidence has been found to support the presence of over one million Jews in Egypt as described in the Bible ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Egypt#Genesis_and_Exodus)). 

Because of the inherent challenges in finding archaeological evidence, the best support for the authenticity of the Book of Mormon comes from within the text itself.  The **Literary Evidence** is actually quite significant. The widespread use of the chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is merely one example. It is highly unlikely that Joseph Smith, a farm-boy with only a few years of formal schooling, would know to include this unique form of biblical poetry that was only just being rediscovered in European academic circles.

4,"Yeah, my main issue with it would be it being done in people with no symptoms. I have an issue really with any investigation or medical care which has no foundation in evidence. I think this is more common among younger doctors, because we came through med school with 'evidence based medicine' as our main teaching foundation. Whereas older doctors came through med school with the 'its always been done that way' method of teaching. I think more things will change over the next few decades as 'evidenced-based' becomes an essential criteria for all treatments. Hopefully a comprehensive database of medical research will be developed at some point as well so it's easier for the general public to see what the current evidence is. Right now you'd need to subscribe to UpToDate or similar and it's extremely expensive. 

Some things are REALLY hard to change despite the evidence, because the reality is the evidence comes up with an illogical sounding conclusion. A good example is that patients having heart attacks are always given oxygen because of the theory that the MI is causing decreased blood flow to the heart, and therefore decreased oxygen, so giving oxygen will help reduce the damage to the heart muscle. However it's now starting to look like the evidence shows that giving oxygen causes blood vessels to constrict MORE, and potentially results in poorer outcomes. But, people still get oxygen, because no-one is brave enough to not give it, despite the evidence, *because it just sounds wrong and dangerous*. 

Unfortunately the same thing applies with routine pelvic exams. It sounds like a reasonable statement to say 'well it can't hurt, better safe than sorry'. But the evidence shows that in fact it DOES hurt. America has one of the highest levels of unnecessary surgery and hysterectomy in the developed world, and does NOT have better detection/treatment rates/survival rates for ANY of the conditions that pelvic exams are supposed to find. But because logically it *sounds like* doing an exam more often would be better, it's very difficult for people to understand the concept 'But the UK, and Australia, and most European countries DON'T do routine pelvic exams and only do 3-yearly pap smears and it makes NO difference to how often they detect or treat gynaecological conditions, or how many people survive or are cured of those conditions. In fact their rates of many of them are slightly lower than ours, and their rates of unnecessary investigation/surgery and side effects are *significantly less*. So however unlikely it seems, maybe it DOES get better results to examine and investigate less. 

I dunno, sorry for lecturing, I've just been thinking about this a lot and kind of got on my soapbox. :)

They aren't mysterious.  Tax havens, the places where the money actually is, have deliberately constructed their tax system to attract foreign 'investors' looking to dodge tax in their own country.

As sovereign legal entities they are completely allowed to set their own tax policies, even if that intends to 'beggar thy neighbour' so to speak.  

If you want to know why a big country (e.g. France or the US) lets their citizens move large amounts of money to foreign tax shelters at all, it's because their politicians and people who own the politicians have written laws deliberately allowing it.  And that's assuming it's not a deliberate way of funneling money to a friendly strategically important location without officially funneling them money (e.g. Ireland and the EU).

As to the money and life goals... you seem to be doing well for yourself.  Are you maxing-out your Roth IRA each year?  I would suggest doing that - Vanguard makes it easy, but any decent investment firm can get you started.

Also, your parents seem to be far more financially distressed than you are... and you're living with them... this may be an odd suggestion, but do you pay them rent?  Perhaps that might be a nice gesture to your family.  Not *full* rent like $1,500 or what a studio in the boroughs might cost you - but a few hundred maybe?  Perhaps it's unnecessary, but you're doing well (and they don't sound like they are), and living with them is probably a big reason why you're able to save so much.

Being 27, you've probably only got five years of experience, maybe less.  That's enough that you might be able to leverage a higher-paying job, but if you're happy, you can ride-out a bad economy where you're at - i.e. if nothing's wrong, and you're happy, why change?

That said, perhaps you can find some meaningful life experiences?  It sounds like you're more depressed on a personal level than in financial trouble.  Money can't buy happiness, but it can open doors to things that you might enjoy.  Can you take a month or two off from work without major repercussions to your career?  If so, go backpack Europe for a few weeks.  If you can only take 1-2 weeks off, maybe go on a vacation with friends?  No friends?  Try a service trip, I've done a one week trip with the Red Cross to New Orleans and Haiti, and two week trips with Habitat for Humanity to Mexico and Central America.  Especially with the Habitat trips, nobody knows eachother - you sign up as individuals and fly into one location, domestic or international, and volunteer for a week - no experience required.  They only cost like $5,000 and most of it is your flight and a donation for supplies/materials, not overhead.

&gt; Ancient Persians used 'ariya' derived from Sanskrit 'arya' (compatriot) to refer to themselves. Sanskrit speakers in India also used 'aryan' or cognates of it to refer to themselves.

Old Persian 'ariya' and Old Indic 'arya' are cognates, not a borrowing from one language to the other, indicating that the term predates the split between the Indic and Iranian branches.

Racial apologists have tried to link ariya/arya with Eire (name of Ireland) in order to show that the term arya goes all the way back to the original Indo-European family.  The connection is highly dubious.

Arya is still used in modern Hindi in the honorific 'aj'.

2,"&gt; I asked about the objective brain activity, not anecdotal accounts. I take it's not feasible to convey for some reason?

Original post, I gave you a link which lists dozens of sources for dozens of conditions. If you want specifics on comas and vegetative states, go to wikipedia, that's where I drew my information from. So, let me summarize my position, since honestly, I'm kinda tired at this point.

There's world-class evidence that a huge variety of conditions impact basically every function of the mind.

From this, we give a simple judgement call - the brain is the mind. This is not a judgement call that is certain(then again, nothing is and it's hardly an argument to point this out), but it's pretty much as well established as anything can be. If there's any part of the mind that's not affected by physical damage or injury, then it's so small or so unnoticeable that no one has found it yet.

Now, if you want to say that this is not a rational, scientific or empirical judgement... Then you need world-class evidence of your own. Not just philosophical arguments, not just semantics and word games, not just ""oh, you're not omniscient and you don't know everything yet, suck it induction"", not drawing a map of Europe from your armchair, but actual, real, world-class evidence of your own. 

You can believe whatever you want to believe, but please don't try to pretend like ""brain = mind; therefore it's destroyed when the brain is destroyed"" is an irrational, unscientific, non-empirical judgement call - because it is the best judgement we have, given what we know so far(maybe someday we'll find a listener, just like maybe someday we'll find the Loch Ness monster, but for now, it's not unscientific to say that they don't exist). *That* is my main objection here, the rest, I pretty much don't care much about.

2,"&gt; Western swords were not that sharp 

Swords that have been recovered are, in general, sharp. They aren't sharp like a razor, but they'll take an arm off. 

&gt; were pointy with a heavy pommel to balance the weapon at the hilt for better point control.

I33 documents a style of fighting that seems to involve a lot of cutting and thrusting. This trend continues throughout the medieval period. 

Cutting swords need the balance back towards the crossguard to help cut. Remember, cutting with a sword isn't swinging like a baseball bat. It's a lot more elegant than that. 

Likewise, European swords aren't really that heavy. 

&gt;  Turkish swords are long and curved for slashing

I can't speak for early forms of sabre fencing during the crusades, but if we look at Sutton Sabre as a reference point, we can see plenty of thrusts - even with deeply swept blades. It's also probably important to say that swords are kind of like backup weapons for mounted combat.

 In Sunny Beach, Bulgaria there's a couple of guys walking around handing out cherries and ask you to taste. They're almost throwing them at you and they really want you to taste their amazing cherries.

If you accept, 5+ thugs will step surround you and they want you to buy a bag of cherries for like €50, if you refuse they demand like €20 for the cherry you ate.

I wouldn't visit the strip clubs in Sunny Beach either. A couple of friends thought it would be cute to go with their SO, and they were told by the bouncers it would be free to enter.

Where ever I go I'm always wary about cab fares, and try to research and negotiate the price before I enter the cab. A common trick among cab drivers is to cover the meter with something (some passenger seats can fold over the meter), and they just say ""we don't use meters here"".

Basque were (and are) quite abundant in Spain and took a major role in the reconquista; hell, even the new Dutch queen has a Basque surname.

If you check Celtic history you will realize that they come from centre Europe and that the considered Celtic nations are actually the places where they survived as a culture, not necessarily the places where they were more influential through history, you can check wikipedia page about this, specially the map:

But you are right, a lot of believers are not dick heads. Most actually. My mother is one of them. I told her one day; ""Mom, I just don't believe in what Christianity teaches anymore."" Her response; ""That's okay hunny. There is more than one path to be a good person. Want some coffee?"" MOST people are like that. It is the people who aren't that are loud and they make themselves seen as so huge! They are technically a minority in the grand scheme of things.

In the long term you are right. People will always have beliefs that cannot be proven nor disproven by science. While some of us might consider them stupid for believing such a thing, they are more then welcome in North America, the European Union and various parts of Asia at this time to be who they want to be. Hopefully the Arab and African area will become more forgiving in the future.

2,"Creed was on it's biggest world tour to date. They have been playing shows in Europe and Asia for the last few months, and now they were flying back home, over the big pond of the Atlantic Ocean.    

Lead singer / lead songwriter / lead lyricist Scott Stapp was casually eating pickles in his comfortable, large seat on the left side of the business class, pondering on how much he hated his band mate Mark Tremonti: - ""Gee golly, I hate that turd Mark Tremonti. How can he possibly think he can sing better than me. And all that guitar wiggly waddle, just covering my powerful singing. What a mansausage"".    

Meanwhile, Mark Tremonti, the lead backup singer / lead guitarist / lead second songwriter was sitting in a little less convenient buisness class seat, situated in the last row, on the right side of the plane, almost immediately next to the bathroom. Mark was busy working on his fingertips, rubbing them very hard against the floor, so that they would get ultra stiff, for ultimate guitar shredding. Then a pale man went out from the bathroom, with a delicate scent of poo following him like a very unpleasant, yet relentless ghost. That reminded Mark of Scott Stapp, and their recent argument on how to pronounce the word ""kumquat"". Mark thought inside his head: -""Darned Scott Stapp, that pickethroat, I bet he's eating pickles right now. I really don't like him."", and then he rubbed his fingers against the floor even harder and eventually he lost his friction ridges. Now he couldn't unlock his modern portable pc computer, because he didn't leave any fingerprints, and the realization of this thought made him super pissed.  
The rest of the band, consisting of two, or three mostly unrecognized members, was travelling in the luggage compartment, together with the rest of the instruments.    

In the meantime the whole economy class was screaming in terror, when mongolian terrorist Chan Albaatar was screaming from the top of his lungs, that he is now taking this plane over, and that they are going back to Ulan Baatar, to impress his ex-fiance with barrel rolls in mid air.    

At the same time Scott Stapp decided he had to use the toilet, but as he was passing next to Mark Tremonti, they got into a fight. Super hard, calloused fingers of Mark's left hand left red marks on Scott's giant nose. They fought, and rolled down the narrow stairs into the economy class. The combined lead creedball / lead egoboulder came down fast and knocked the mongolian terrorist over. When the three man regained their balance, Chan, the terrorist, shook his head in awe, and couldn't believe his eyes. He said: - ""You are Creed! I can't believe my eyes! My ex-fiance loves you. I will take you to her and win her back, after we barrel roll in mid air!""   
 
Stapp and Tremonti decided to work together like never before, and proposed the would-be terrorist to come with them to America and become the lead third singer for Creed. Chan eventually agreed, and the flight went on uninterrupted, and Scott Stap has peed his leather pants, because he forgot to go to the toilet. -""Stupid Scott"" thought Mark.  
   
Soon after that Chan was deported, because he didn't have a valid visa, and Creed split up, because Scott and Mark decided there wasn't enough lead positions available in the band anymore.

I wish I knew....At first I was planning on researching for a year and then start the actual writing but its been like pealing an onion.  The deeper I look into things the more I find that needs research.  At this point I have over 800 pages of small text notes and Im nowhere close to being finished.

One think Ive done to make it easier to manage is that Ive decided to split the book into two volumes.  Vol I is going to deal with Iron Age era up to Early Modern era an Vol II is going to be about 18th Century up to present times.  Im happy with the decision.

&gt;As for myself, one off the top my head that I have been curious about, is why mead never seemed to have become a major drink for the more southern areas of Europe?

I don't know enough about bee keeping to know why, but the sources Ive read mention that honey production was most efficient in Scandinavia.  That would have certainly explain why it was more popular in that area.  Mead does seem to predate wine in Greece though and the archeological remains of early alcohol production show that a type fruit/honey/grain grog concoction were the first types of alcohol that we know of being manufactured by humans.

Grape wine is strong in alcohol and easy to produce.  Beer is cheap to produce.  It simply could be that Mediterranean people preferred these alternatives to mead/grog once they had the option.

Read: ""Before the declaration of war, at the Armenian congress at Erzurum, the Ottoman government requested the Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion among Russian Armenians against the tsarist army in the event of a Caucasus front.[31]:136[39]""

Read: ""n the summer of 1914, Armenian volunteer units had been established under the Russian Armed forces. As the Russian Armenian conscripts had already been sent to the European Front, this new force was uniquely composed of Armenians who were not Russian or who were not obligated to serve. An Ottoman representative, Karekin Bastermadjian (Armen Karo), was also brought into this force. Initially they had 20,000 men, but it was reported that their number subsequently increased. Returning to Constantinople, Enver Pasha publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians in the region having actively sided with the Russians.[30]:200""

The Ottomans felt the Armenians had sided with the Russians and viewed them as a fifth column within their ranks. 

THIS DOES NOT EXCUSE WHAT THEY DID. However, surely an idiot even like you can see that it has nothing to do with 'being muslim' and had to do with empire.

1,"Thanks for your comment on my post. As wikipedia points out quite rightly ""Cernunnos is the conventional name given in Celtic studies to depictions of the horned god of Celtic polytheism"". Only one inscription links this name to a 'horned god' depiction. Other depictions include one in Cisalpine Gaul. There is also a Celto-Iberian depiction. Depictions have also been found in Italy, associated with early Celtic migrations.  In fact out of over 60 depictions found all over Europe, only one can truly be attested as 'Cernunnos' - from the 'Pillar of the Boatmen' in Paris. Perhaps the most famous image of a 'horned god' is on the Gundestrup Cauldron found in Denmark, probably made in Thrace. This figure is commonly referred to as 'Cernunnos' both by academics and non-academics alike. 

As to Britain and Ireland: Encycloclopedia Britannica states ""Cernunnos was worshipped primarily in Britain, although there are also traces of his cult in Ireland."" 

I make no claim as to his attributes in the article but point out that the figure is often associated with other animals (for example, not in the article: God of Etang-sur-Arroux who holds two snakes). The Welsh connection (note: not necessarily originally from Wales per se, and remember an early form of Welsh was spoken in what is modern England and Southern Scotland), is the parallel between the character Gwrhyr and assorted animals with whom he is able to converse. One of which, an Eagle - 'pecks at the stars' . The point of all this to to suggest that the Cernunnos figure may be cognate with an early view of the constellation 'Ophiuchus', which may have been surrounded by animals, including a stag and a boar. At no point do I suggest that the Picts recognised Cernunnos, but use the iconography of Cernunnos to suggest the possibility of a stag and boar constellation in the past in the night sky of northern Europe and possibily beyond.

55,"The American revolution was the end of what some call the first British Empire, the second British Empire (the big one), came about as a consequence of that loss and the Napoleonic Wars which hurt our European rivals more than ourselves.

Without these two wars, Britain would have been more focused on America, and France and Spain would have been freer to retain or expand their own empires. India may have been divided between France and Britain, Spain might have hung onto South and Central America.

However American expansion west* would have been curtailed by Britain wanting to honour treaties with the Native Americans, and then French and Spanish possessions.

There probably would have been a series of 19th Century conflicts between Britain and France, culminating perhaps in a First World War with an alliance between Britain and Germany, or Germany and France. This would make it difficult to predict exactly what territory would be British/Commonwealth today, but I think we'd have seen an end to much of the Empire by the year 2000 anyway.

Assuming no revolutions, America and Britain's political relationship is probably easier to predict.

0,"&gt; Not wanting someone in your personal space and not giving a crap about how others feel are completely different. Insisting that your children are polite and respectful is one thing, and will be appropriate at all ages. Insisting that your child participate in touching

Oh please. *""Participate in touching""*. 

People use their main senses to communicate. We communicate orally, sometimes visually and sometimes physically. How exactly depends on the culture. Japanese for instance touch very little. Latin people typically communicate quite a lot with touch.  

Point is, it's about communication. And if it is normal in your culture to hug your aunt, phrasing it as *""participating in touching""* to make it sound almost abnormal makes no sense. If they refuse to speak that's also not very nice. 

&gt; However, forcing

Again you're dramatizing.  The word ""forcing"" is pretty strong. There's plenty of leeway between telling her she should do something, and physically grab her and make her hug a aunt while she screams she doesn't want to. 

&gt; your child to show affection intimately because that's what people do if they aren't self-centered does not provide a good lesson, and, furthermore, that sort of behavior isn't really demanded of adults. 

Forcing while she screams, no. But the options certainly aren't just that,  or completely ignoring it and letting her do whatever she wants with no interference. 


&gt;  We do not expect our teenage or adult children to cuddle or kiss their relatives, and it would be strange and inappropriate for them to do so to the same degree that small children are prompted to do.

Again depends on culture. Here in Europe I certainly am expected to kiss my aunts all the time. And hugging is pretty normal too particularly if I haven't seen them in a while.

**Edit:** Looks like 3 out of the 4 comments here so far confirm my suspicions- 2 of the 4 started w/ BF3, 1 w/ Bad Company 2, and me w/ BF2. Interesting.

Further, I've had **A LOT** of conversations here with people suggesting things for BF4 that were done in BF2 or 1942, and I've had a lot of conversations with people asking about gameplay and factions in BF2 w/ astonishment - example: European Union forces in Euro Force, British SAS troops in Special Forces, Commander Mode from Battlefield 2, etc. etc. 

As for me- long time Battlefield player. Started w/ 1942 back in like 2004 after it had been out a couple of years. Really took off in 2005 w/ Battlefield 2, when, at 19, I opened a LAN center in a small town in Missouri, w/ 6 gaming PCs I built for it. My friend and I would play through the night 'til 2:00 or 3:00AM, drinking Bawls and Arizona Lemon Tea.  Good times. 

I've played them all, but I didn't like 2142 much (the cold aesthetic and odd futuristic gameplay didn't sit as well with me as the ""here and now"" realism of Battlefield 2, with its bright outdoor, realistic maps). 

I got Bad Company 1 on the Xbox 360 and then Bad Company 2 on both platforms. I still play BC2 sometimes on PC. There's a special feeling you get when you play Arcade Fire's ""The Suburbs"" while defending the ""Suburb (C)"" control point of Oasis. 

Battlefield 2 is still my favorite, and I am disappointed by what I've seen so far of BF4- it looks beautiful, but still too dark, along the lines of BF3. 
I mean, look at [this Battlefield 2 trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8W5TGUVK1A), all done in in-game footage!

1,"You mentioned the 2008 incident, now you changed it to 2009. I can imagine death camps aren't mentioned everyday in Germany, since you have a penalty of up to 3 years of prison for public display of nazi symbols. People try to not talk about it, therefore my rough estimate is that these were maybe 20 out of 50 times death camps were mentioned in German public news in 2009. Let me remind you that you claimed to read everything in German due to your profession and claimed it only appeared once in 2008.

""German stereotype"" - I don't see how it could be read differently than ""a stereotype popular in Germany"".

The expression ""polish death camp"" appeared in English version of Die Welt in 2008, the one you're referring to. If German media aspire to deliver news globally, they should angle their news globally - they learn it on the first year of journalist school.

Nazi exploatation lead to such weird language constructs, I leave it to people to ""figure out"" because there is not even a single human being who wouldn't know who the nazis are. Contrarily, nazi-fanboys seem to spring out of nowhere, for example in Bollywood (""Hitler"" became a coloquial name for a badaqss). I believe it is also part of German PR, and damage control - we are not going to pay for it though.

There is a bit of confusion on the European collaborators with Nazis - hence the need to be as clear as possible, unless you want it to be interpreted as trash-talking.

I am ""accusing"" you of helping to cover up the truth about the holocaust close to zealously, and I am simply using the same stylistically flawed tools you claim to be okay. 

""conquest of the aztecs"" ? Someone aztecked of conquestors? Your speech just turned into a meaningless word salad. Rules of grammar aren't as plastic as you seem to think.

I am against German PR aimed at sharing the blame with Poland, their politicians also do some trash-talking implying it wasn't all their fault. They also paid for highly controversial movie called ""poklosie"" which is a thriller showing how Poles used nazis as an excuse to murder (richer) Jews in their villages.

I find your ignorance ironic. Barack Obama (president of the free world) used the term ""polish concentration camps"" addressing a war-hero posthumously in 2012.

The list is endless. ""heated emails""? There's polish lobby organization working on calling it ""German extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland"" Obama used this expression in his apology and uses it since then.

To choose between Liberty and Equality is a false dichotomy, the one can not exist without the other. Equality does not need to be ""enforced""; it means the lack of injustice based on race, class or wealth. This is not a choice between two options; how can you be free when society doesn't protect you against someone else chaining you and making a slave out of you?

Considering ""The Jewish masters""; I agree with this speech:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=i0ljxQsgUM4

And considering Haïti; the country was put in debt peonage, like so many third world countries are, embargoed for many decades until a dictator decided the people will work for hunger wages for the benefit of foreign capitalists; Jewish and white.

The race theory always has problems explaining reality; for instance, why is Bermuda such a rich country? And even if what you say would be proven; namely that negroes are on average inferior to whites; I would still refuse to act on it the way you or any white nationalist does because to me it has no ideological value.

5,"I've owned my '09 for 4 years so expect: 

A somewhat lengthy break-in (detailed on tdiclub) where you can't use cruise control for the first 5k miles. It's not a huge deal (no revs past 2500 while cold, no revs past 3.5k for first 500 mi, etc.). 

The smell of diesel ... every month or so (some don't like it, I do, but you don't have to refuel that often). You may also want to get used to the smell of cetane additives, US Diesel isn't quite as good as Europe's and can use a little help. 

A considerable amount of torque for a grocery getter / commuterbox. HP as a measurement of power is biased against lower rev motors like diesel, so don't take that '140' to heart. 

Obscene fuel mileage if you drive moderately, pretty darn good mileage if you drive it like you stole it. I get 38-42mpg per tank (weather dependent, it likes warm more than cold) and have a mostly highway 15 mile commute with 55 and 65mph limits, with serious traffic coming home in the mornings. I'm also about a mile above sea level. JSW will probably get a little lower mileage than my sedan. 

Yearly oil changes (1y/1k mi) that cost as much as 4 jiffy lube stops. The first 3 were free on mine, not sure what they're offering now. Next one will be ~$150. You can't buy the oil at stores (though probably online) but I've seen plenty of guys on tdiclub buy the oil from the dealer and do the change themselves. Some other maintenance is very TDi specific but I haven't hit any of that yet. I'm sure with a BMW you're used to either dealerships or you have a good German car shop to go to. 

Generally good build quality and pretty nice features for the price/class. While it is fine German engineering and design, VW's North American cars are built in Mexico. There have been reports of hit and miss quality in the past but mine is great (other than a loose glow plug wire that threw a CEL within a month of getting it) and most of the stuff I've seen says the last several years have been good. I found it to be above average on the luxury feel compared to almost all American and most Japanese cars in the same price range, but it won't be as nice as your BMW of course. This detail, is of course, not TDi specific. AFAIK the TDi engines are still built in Germany and shipped to Mexico, but don't quote me on that. 


As for 85 or 90 on the highway, I can't speak to that specifically. I know it tops out at about 135, between gearing/redline and a limiter. I know that at 70 the turbo is really pumping and it's easy to drift to nearly 80 without thinking such that Kansas State Patrol gives you a warning at 3am on a Saturday night in the middle of nowhere. I now have the speed warning set at 75 ;). Just like your BMW this car was designed to cruise on the Autobhan, so it hums along at highway speed just fine. 


If you do go test drive another TDi, wind it out to 3k before shifting, you'll feel it. Hell, I can get on the highway with a cold engine winding it to 2.5k and be passing cars on the highway before I'm at the blend line... still in 5th gear.

3,"**Nicolai Abildgaard**  
From 1772 Abildgaard spent five years in Rome thanks to a scholarship granted by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. It was while in Rome that he created this depiction of the legendary hero Philoctetes, whose screams of pain caused by a festering snakebite made his comrades-in-arms abandon him on a Greek island during the Trojan war.

**Challenging neoclassicism**
The dominant and deeply rooted movement within figure painting at this time was neoclassicism with its emphasis on self-command and calm. Abildgaard challenges this pattern with his depiction of a body convulsively curved around an axis of pain; a body that feels like it is forcefully restrained within the picture field with its tense musculature and twisted limbs.

**Avantgarde, pathos and Weltschmerz**
The 1770s brought with them an increased emphasis on grand passions among the Northern European ”avant-garde”, and this new outlook also left its mark on Abildgaard’s circles in Rome. The interest in pathos and Weltschmerz is clearly evident in his works from this era.

In this case he used a principal work of classical sculpture as the basis for his rendition of Philoctetes’ tormented state: The Torso Belvedere in the Vatican museum served as the model for the plastic and mannered rendition of the hero’s upper body. With this move, Abildgaard’s stylistic innovation was imbued with features of a work canonised by neoclassicism – without, however, reducing the tensions in the painting.

115,"&gt;Last year we bought 1,443 of those things, to add to an air force that could already hold off every other air force in the world plus a few alien spaceships. And the people who procured the F-35 purchase couldn't even answer the question of who we were expecting to fight with these things.

It's not about ""who we're going to fight.""

The simple fact is that a global military hegemony creates a [unipolar power structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_(international_relations), which is inherently more peaceful than a multipolar one. For almost 70 years the globe has been unipolar/bipolar, and from a historical/relative perspective, the only conflict we have seen is minor skirmishes. Or, as we've come to call them, ""security actions."" 

In a multipolar system, [States are forced to compete with one another in the realm of military equipment, training, and funding.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) This leads to arms races, destabilization, and eventually full out war. It's hard to fathom in the modern world (especially for the younger crowd), but [Europe was a seething mess of perpetual internal violence for more than a thousand years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe) (right up until the dawn of this unipolar/bipolar system). 

A unipolar system makes arms races irrelevant and a waste of resources. What does it matter to England any more if France introduces a new battalion of tanks? The big boss on the global scene won't let them use it anyway, so there's no use in building up English forces in defense. And that, in turn, makes France not even bother in the first place.

By maintaining a total hegemony, the U.S. not only encourages global peace, but also frees up resources in other countries - [allowing them to divert what they would have otherwise spent on larger armed forces into social programs.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Military_expenditure_by_GDP_2008.png) The U.S. hegemony is, in effect, the largest global social subsidy the world has ever known.",0,c9qet4k,1431359753,False,t3_1dhbfn,,,The_Law_of_Pizza,0,t5_2cneq,1367429661,t1_c9qcs16,politics,,False,0,,True,t1_c9qet4k,115

When I was in high school, I went on a trip to Europe as part of my German class. It was supposed to be a trip through most of Western Europe culminating in a stay with a host family in Austria. We toured around, spending a few days in some major cities - London, Paris, Venice, Munich, all around - and spending a lot of time in the small towns in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. We finally got to our host family's village and met up with them. Each family had a kid that was about our age that we got to hang out with - it was actually a really cool experience. I got to stay with a *very* nice family. I remember the dad even made his own Peach Schnapps - that shit would have stripped the paint off a WWII bomber in about 7 seconds. It was fucking *fierce.* 

So, the day we get in, I get settled, and the next day after school (we went to school with our host families as well) their son and his friend ask me if we want to cut class and go get a beer. Being American, fond of the drink, and tired of school, I eagerly agreed. We went and had one of the better hefeweizens I've had in my life, then we had about 4 more. We went to a liquor store to get some more fuel for the evening. Being American, fond of the drink, and inexperienced in *what the fuck I was doing* I decided that the best thing to drink was cooking wine. It was cheap and in my hand - perfect. We traded slugs of this stuff back and forth until, finally, we ended up laying in the grass chugging this cooking wine in front of the local fire station. Well, when I say ""we"" it could very well have been just me - I don't remember, there was a lot of cooking wine involved. The entire time, I was simultaneously throwing up, crying about being torn between my then-girlfriend back in the U.S. and a girl I had met on the trip, being comforted by these two fifteen-year old Austrian kids I had just met, and drinking more cooking wine. After about an hour of this, we adjourned to a local drinkery to keep it going.

There, I discovered the *magic* that is drinking Diet Coke mixed with wine (the regular, cheap variety) in a 50-50 mixture when you're fifteen years old. Yeah, you read that right. It was fucking *delicious,* the ambrosia of the gods when I was 15 and *seriously* drunk after the entire afternoon spent with a bottle of cooking wine. Things got...out of hand. We headed back to my host family's house at about 4 in the morning, where we adjourned to our respective rooms for a little rest. 

The next morning, I awake to the sounds of hip hop and the smells of breakfast emanating from the kitchen downstairs. The second thing I notice after this is the *overpowering* smell of urine and a deep, permanent sense of shame. Apparently there had been a miscommunication between my bladder and my brain during the night; they had fought, and the bladder had gotten upset and simply given up. To say that I had wet the bed is an understatement. The Amazon river basin was drier than my sheets. Not only that, but it was the kind of mess that only drinking astounding quantities of cooking wine, shitty red whine, and diet coke can generate. Now, being fifteen *and a fucking idiot,* I calmly got up, changed into clothes that weren't destroyed, and went downstairs. The mother of my host family - did I mention how *lovely* they were? - was busy making what I can only surmise was her approximation at an American breakfast experience. There was hip hop playing over the radio - apparently, they thought *all* Americans love hip hop - and she was making probably one of the better tasting breakfast spreads I had had in all my fifteen years. While the father, older son, and my partner in crime from the night before chowed down and half of us nursed our hangovers, the mother went upstairs to make beds and pick up - being the generous hosts they were.

The bedspread hung like a flag of shame on the bannister as we walked out the front door to head out to school. There could be no doubt. To this day, the look on the mother's face - a mixture of embarrassment, confusion, shock, horror, outright disgust, and just a tinge of anger - is etched into my memory superimposed on top of the bedspread, practically dripping on the bannister overlooking the front door. Yeah...when I think back on that, every time, I remember that somewhere in Austria is a family whose one impression of an American might be that we are incorrigible drunks and frequent bed wetters...though, I suppose that's not *too* inaccurate.

Once you decide to work with some currency aside from ""credits"", you're opening up a huge can of worms that doesn't necessarily move your story forward. Even using the currency of ""dollars"" in a science fiction story that takes place in the USA is problematic, because of having to calculate possible future inflation. It will needlessly confuse the reader if not handled cleverly. There's also the factor that having to invent a new fictional currency for every single science fiction story would be tiresome. 

Funny to think that the ""Euro"" is the currency across much of Europe today, introduced less than fifteen years ago. It must have seemed very science fictional and futuristic like ""credits"" from the point of view of Europeans in the late '90s, when they were phasing out their old national currencies for it.

9,"There is a difference between deep ancestry as given by haplogroups and actual ""perceived"" genetic composition, i.e. what is called autosomal. A map like the above (or like [this one](http://i43.tinypic.com/14xj7r.jpg) with the same topic but with slightly different results, just to give an example of how sample size is relevant, or [this one with mtDNA results](http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/102BAE79-9942-4105-BA33-1EF86929B267/0/LondonResultsMtdna_b.jpg), which is shows an even more homogeneous spread all over Europe) mainly deals with ancient origins, and is useful for that, but bear in mind that throughout the centuries and different historical processes, climates, etc. populations specialise and adapt, and this changes are not really reflected in the haplogroups since they are mostly unchangeable in nature, while other more visible characteristics have a higher change ratio and are more easily influenced by environment, mutation, etc.

This is why the genetic map of Europe show a [geographic relation](http://www.molecularecologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/journal.pgen_.1002886.g002.png)  ([another one](http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0960982208009561-gr1.jpg)), even if the haplogroup distribution favours a more East/West split base on R1b/R1a (and J/I), which in this case shows similarities between Iberia and the British Isles due to specific pre and proto-historic events that had a certain Atlantic affinity (e.g. [megalithism](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Megawal31.jpg) and the Celts, mostly, also LBK (see [The European Mesolithisation of a Caucasian Neolithic, or the Origin of the Indo European Language family](http://rokus01.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/mesolithisation/) - nice [map](http://rokus01.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/lbk-genetic-correlation.jpg) -  for a typical exploration of this complex matters, i.e. the continuity or discontinuity of the Neolithic)

Both (haplogroups and autosomal) are interesting, but have different strengths and applications. Some caution is needed since many of this maps vary (sometimes drastically) and many revisions have been made in the last decade (there is all sorts of trends involved, from ""we are all from the Ice Age"" to ""we are all Neolithic""). Also, having the same haplogroup doesn't mean populations always looked the same - each haplogroup has different haplotypes, which are more restricted and generally have a narrower geographic scope.

Also note that this intra-European differences are noticeable but are extremely small when compared to anything beyond Europe.

I see your point about the new system being theoretically good for the upper class as well in the long term (since capitalism becomes unsustainable if a large proportion of people cannot consume). 

However, in the short-to-medium term their real tax rate would go up considerably, and there's no chance they'd allow that to happen.

55,"Ahhh, that is the big question. The part no one ever talks about.

It would be easy to say arrogance, something about the British seeing themselves as the most powerful country on the planet &amp; being able to destroy anyone they want. Maybe say something about the US [manifest destiny, and the idea that god is on our side or something like that].

But I don't believe that's it.

I suspect what it was really all about was battleships.

The whole theory behind battleships was that if you make a giant ship, it becomes a gun platform you can then use to destroy things [other ships, coastal cities/ports etc]. But big ships are sloooow, they're big targets so they're easy to hit with something, and they're really expensive so you never want to loose one.

So a battleship needs, by definition, to be covered with absurd amounts of armor to keep it alive. This is supposed to make a battleship indestructible. Our WW2 era warships were able to survive atomic bombs. Sure, the crew would die from radiation, but they are *that* strong.

But then what happens when a battleship fights a battleship? A stalemate that goes on until they both run out of shells or get bored? To solve this problem the AP [armor piercing] round was developed. Its a heavy shell with a special cap that allows it to punch threw naval armor. But, the AP round only works effectively at point blank range [shhh! don't tell anyone, this was seriously classified back then]. Battleships did engage each other all the time, and usually could not harm each other because AP back then was worthless. It was even less effective against coastal fortifications! In the Spanish-American War the US Navy could not destroy any of the coastal defense forts at Cuba, nor could we sink the Spanish fleet at Cuba. We tried. What we ended up doing was setting fire to their ships, forcing the crews to abandon them. Even then, the ships would not sink. In the Russo-Japanese War the Russians had a fleet at Port Arthur. The Japanese fleet tried to destroy them over and over again, neither side could get anywhere. The shells would literally bounce off without doing any damage.

As long as the big ships were indestructible, the navy was happy because they could keep building bigger &amp; better ones. The legislators, who order contracts were happy because it created jobs &amp; made a lot of people really really wealthy. The tax payers were happy because they had jobs, and felt safe &amp; secure. The army felt happy because they could any time they wanted to, put a section of naval armor on shore 10 yards in front of a cannon, destroy it with an AP shell in front of reporters &amp; congressmen, and then get to buy more cannon. It didn't matter that it was a big farce!

But then HE came along. Unlike AP, which only works at point blank, HE doesn't care what the range is because the explosive power does all the damage. The shell doesn't even need to hit the ship to damage it, it just has to get close enough for the explosion to do its work. HE can also be packaged anyway you'd like. Want to put it in a mine and just throw it overboard for someone to sail into it? You can do that. And it won't even cost much. Want to shoot it out of a cannon? You can do that. Want to fire a torpedo from a small, cheap boat or a submarine? No problem. You could even get someone like General Billy Mitchell to throw some bombs off the side of a plane and do some damage. Planes are cheap. Battleships cost fortunes! Worse, HE gets even more effective if the explosion happens underwater because water doesn't like to compress. 

Battleships you see, are only heavily armored where AP rounds are likely to hit them. In other words: the gun turrets, the bridge [of later ships], or the sides +/- a few feet of the water line. It doesn't matter if an AP round pierces the ship elsewhere. It'll be too far off the waterline to cause it to sink, and AP rounds have to be so strong that they carry little explosive, so there's no worry of it doing much once it punches threw a noncritical part of a ship's superstructure.

Which means if a submarine launches a torpedo and it explodes near the ship's bottom, its fucked. The water won't compress, the full force of the explosion will rip apart the hall and it will sink. FAST. If a plane drops a bomb on a ship, it will breech the deck, where there isn't much armor, and explode deep inside the ship. If it explodes deep enough, the hull will rip open and it will sink. If it hits the magazine the ship's done for [See: Pearl Harbor]. So HE is a big risk to battleships, its flexible, and its cheap. Very cheap.

Oh, and did I mention every navy on the planet is deeply afraid of explosive compounds? Yeah, see there was this problem back then where stored explosives like gun cotton would spontaniously detonate and destroy a battleship. That's likely what destroyed the USS Maine, its what destroyed the Japanese warship Kawachi, and every nation has some story about how its bad news. If you switch from AP to HE, you have to carry more of the stuff.

If congress knew what HE could do, then they'd question whether or not we should buy all these expensive battleships. That makes the navy unhappy. The steel industry, that makes these ships, gets unhappy and have to lay off their workers. Now, the taxpayers, who elect congress, are unhappy because not only are they out of work; they're afraid some European country like France, England, or Germany will show up and start destroying New York City because we have nothing that can survive HE. Chaos, society falls apart, the economy crashes, total anarchy, people start eating their children to survive.... no one wants that.

So all the key players end up in cahoots with each other, due to their own selfish interests. This doesn't effect Russia, because most of their ships they bought from Britain anyway. No loss of jobs, no big deal. Same for Japan. Germany doesn't care, because they know if they turn to HE first they'll have first strike capability and be able to quickly defeat anyone they want to. That's part of what made the '14 offensive such a big deal even in the United States. Germany went against the honors system and opened pandora's box.

Technically Japan did, at the Battle of Tsushima where they destroyed the entire Russian Navy. But, we were letting that one fly because everyone saw the Russians as weak and backwards back then, and its not like the Russo-Japanese war upset the power players [Germany, France, England] or their economies.

1,"&gt;Is there a plausible hope to revert back to an actual limited government

I think it's not only plausible, but that it's inevitable. If you truly believe that less government produces better results than more government, either various experimentation over time should naturally result in less and less government or you have to believe that people will consciously want to have a government that makes them less well off.

Secondly, the general trend of humanity has been towards less and less government over time. Transported to nearly any other place and time in history, the political views of the average American or Western European would make them an utterly extremist libertarian. In the past, governments were limited by their ability to control people, not their desire. Libertarians and an-caps often get too focused upon new restrictions that never existed before.

In order to get a fair return on the money they've lent to the southern countries, the northern countries would extract wealth from the southern. Where you have a country which has a wealthy central area (think London in the UKP) then this will gravitate to Germany/Holland/France and poverty will increase in the southern states.

Defence would remain as is. Trident would be an absolute certainty as the UK moved closer to the US. EU defence would be unaffected.

Immigration to the UK from the EU would be cut. The UK could then control immigration policy and try to ensure the 'right' immigrants came. This also of course reduces 'good' immigrants, so it's unclear if it would be a good thing. It does avoid the Romania/Bulgaria problem - however nobody knows if it's going to be a real problem or not.

The decades long split in the conservative party in the UK would be over. UKIP would have no purpose and would end up joining the tories - who would shift to the right. There's a reasonable chance that some tories wouild go to labour or libdems. It might cause a shake up. 

The Eurosceptics within the EU - the wise countries like the Scandinavians, some of the Baltic states, the Czech Republic would be doomed to break from the EU themselves or continue to be sucked towards union. Without the UK's influence they'd have much less weight behind them.

4,"quotes from the survey to shed some light

&gt;The survey – which involved more than 38,000 face-to-face interviews in 80-plus languages
with Muslims across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa – shows that Muslims tend to be
most comfortable with using sharia in the domestic sphere, to settle family or property
disputes. In most countries surveyed, there is considerably less support for severe
punishments, such as cutting off the hands of thieves or executing people who convert from
Islam to another faith. And even in the domestic sphere, Muslims differ widely on such
questions as whether polygamy, divorce and family planning are morally acceptable and
whether daughters should be able to receive the same inheritance as sons.

 

                 


&gt;At least half of Muslims in most countries surveyed say they are concerned about
religious extremist groups in their country, including two-thirds or more of Muslims in
Egypt (67%),



also says that the sample size for egypt is 1,798

statistics on death penalty for apostates on page 55

This is not really true. Wages are set by the replacement cost of labor and the marginal profit from adding another worker at that wage. Business doesn't care what it costs to ""reproduce labor"" as long as enough workers come back in the morning. These workers don't have to be the same people who were employed the day before.

Desperate people care about feeding themselves or their families for that day or week much more than taking care of everyone in the future. When you have a large supply of people like this, they are willing to work for very low wages. This makes the replacement cost of their labor very low. Western Europe and the United States the 19th century and Bangladesh today prove the point that people are willing to work for very low wages in potentially deadly conditions.

3,"I'm not asking about the nations as a whole, but specifically about the cities themselves. I'm writing a paper on Venice right now, and when the city was threatened with complete defeat in the War of Chioggia (Genoese galleys blockaded the harbor, Paduan ships blockaded the rivers, and both Geonese and Paduan soldiers were besegieng all the surrounding towns and castles), the population of the city made an extraordinary effort for their city. Almost the entire male population of the city volunteered for military service, they didn't need to be conscripted. Trenches were dug in the city itself to prepare to defend it to the last. In other cases, the common people of a medieval would of course not want to be conquered, but if they were staring defeat in the face they would rather surrender, and possibly mitigate the brutality of the following sack. Specifically in the 4th crusade, when the Crusaders besieged the city there was no comparable outpouring of support for the soldiers defending the city, and when the crusaders finally breached the wall a delegation of nobles and clergy went to surrender to the crusader leader and crown him Emperor, while the common people lined the avenue in the traditional way they welcomed new emperors.

Regarding the greek city states, I understand that the wars were influence wars, not nationalist in any way, but reading the works of the philosophers from Athens there is a clear sense of intense civic pride, which I assume was similar to the pride in other greek cities.

5,"Arabs also forced Jews off of the land that Jews inhabited, purchased, and lived on. All Arab countries expelled practically their entire Jewish populations, and stole their land in the 1900s. Baghdad's population was 30% Jewish at the start of the 19th century, for example. Some of those middle-eastern Jews had been living in those areas for over 1000 years. In the case of Baghdad, over 3000 years. The amount of land Jews from around the middle-east lost during those expulsions adds up to larger than all of Israeli land today. And those expulsions started before Israel re-gained independence. During Israel's war with Jordan, Jordan kicked all Jews out of its territory, and committed atrocities against them. 

Jews and Arabs can bicker over who screwed over who more, and who owes who what, and it won't lead to anything. What will lead to something is putting the past in the past, and living in peace. 

The reason Jews can't stand the ""Palestinians as Native Americans"" myth, is because it paints the Jews as ""invading foreigners"" like the Europeans in North America, when in actual fact Jews are Natives to Israel.

But all that aside, I have a question for you in particular. I recently saw a documentary about Palestinian Muslims of Jewish descent.

8,"Going into WW1, generals expected a rapid and mobile war which would be over in a matter of weeks, and they had good reason to--the major European wars of the 19th century had taken this shape, and even the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5, which was in many ways a foretaste of WW1 with trench lines, artillery and machine guns being very important, was still won by the Japanese who were on the assault. The war was going to be rapid, and even if it wasn't, as far as generals of the time could tell, the assault would always defeat the defence eventually, even if it was expected to require high casualties. It's arguable that the focus on the offence was short-sighted and based on an incorrect assessment of warfare at the time, but the important point is that by little fault of their own, generals were unprepared for the type of war WW1 turned out to be. When the war bogged down at the end of 1914, they had no experience to draw on, because such a stalemate had never really taken place, certainly not on such a scale. On top of this, the politicians still demanded a quick victory, although stocks of shells were far too small and armies had none of the specialised equipment trench warfare demanded. The generals were nevertheless very rapid in adapting to the new situation. The British were developing modern grenades by January 1915, trench mortars by September and had produced tank prototypes by January 1916, and they would be used in September; the Germans made use of both flamethrowers and gas by June 1915. Artillery doctrine and assault techniques also developed, although unavoidably slowly.

As stated above, tactical development was extremely difficult because generals were faced with huge challenges, commanding unprecedentedly large armies with woefully inadequate communications. The success which they did undeniably achieve was what one would expect from men given extremely difficult goals with none of the equipment or doctrine required to achieve them. Despite all their difficulties, the British were able to launch successful offensives at Messines, Arras and Cambrai by 1917, supported by artillery firing effectively in complicated barrages, tanks working effectively with infantry and with an increasing role for aircraft too. At Cambrai the Germans employed storm troopers using infiltration tactics, which were also instrumental in achieving breakthrough and breaking the deadlock in the German Spring Offensive of 1918. In the battle of Amiens and the Hundred Days Campaign in 1918 the British showed that they had created a successful system for conducting modern warfare. The generals were active in seeking solutions to the tactical problems presented by the war and to a large extent had succeeded in this by 1918.

4,"Look a the map again.  Africa and India *aren't* linked; India is properly depicted as a peninsula, with Sri Lanka (Taprobane) to its south.

Ptolemy's actual text says of Africa that it is simply unknown beyond 16.65° or 17° degrees South.  (In Stevenson's English translation, ""Toward the south from the inhabited land to the south pole the degrees are not definitely known 73°35 or a full 74°.""  Book IV, Chapter 8, ""Location of Interior Æthiopia.""  I'm told the translation is in many ways terrible, but as I can read neither Latin nor Greek, it will have to do.)  Note that Ptolemy uses the same coördinate system we do; on an accurate map, that would place the limits of Ptolemy's knowledge roughly at the latitude of the Angola/Namibian border.

[Here's](http://www.mapforum.com/02/1478worl.jpg) a different version of the same map that makes it a bit more clear that that's a map edge and the unknown.

Ptolemy absolutely did say that there had to be a Southern continent, but he doesn't actually seem to have *put* it anywhere.  Ptolemy was of the belief that the Earth became fundamentally uninhabitable past a certain distance south, so everything in the far South is unknown and hypothetical.

1,"No, it's why you speak *English*, and not Cherokee, Ojibwe, Algonquin, etc.

American culture is not self-derived from a natural lifestyle which is what makes it very different.  Nearly all white American culture came from Europe, and black culture came from Africa (albeit forced).  Nothing in American would exist the way it does without influence from Europe.

An incredibly small fraction of American culture, some places more than others, have anything to do with indigenous ways of life which developed prior to settler's arrival.  The reason that this is worth mentioning is because indigenous culture was nearly always seen as inferior as years progressed, and as people were prohibited from participating in society in their own way.

What you do not seem to understand that in most North American indigenous cultures, particularly west coast, Northern, and plains Indians, there is no concept of ownership of things that mother nature provides.  They lived wealthily in their environment.  That was all changed when settlers who wished to impose their self-anointed vision of cultural superiority on the Indians, rather than considering mutual integration.

In any case, speaking towards why the definitions we give to, ""Native Americans,"" is given the context that it has, is because colonialism was a brand new thing and imposed a problem to many cultures which had never existed before.  Before ships could take people to any shore in the world,  people could only interact with the other people who were around them, who would generally be quite similar to them.

Furthermore, can there really be immigrants in a society who was first ever to settle? As there is no other culture to distinguish immigrants from non-immigrants.  As far as I am aware, the word immigration has always existed in a context of a person from one inhabited place, moving to another.

5,"&gt; Ours? Not to the benefit of the Finns, that is for sure. Why should we prioritise the Greeks above the Finns? 

Because if economic activity slows down elsewhere, demand for Finish products will also go down and then you also fall into recession. 

It's the same principle that you help people outside of your immediate family, only applied to countries: it makes the whole system smoother. 

Besides, you keep putting words in my mouth. Who said to prioritise Greeks over Finns? The only thing that guy suggested was that the ECB takes some extra risk by issuing some bonds on its own. Finland's financial position is not worsened except in the very worst case. 

&gt; There is no such thing as a temporary solution, because it is not like one can transfer X billion to Greece for example, and then they can stand on their own to feet.

You keep misrepresenting my views. Not once did I say ""send X billion to Greece now"". EU cohesion funds are making a difference but you can hardly expect all regions in the continent to have the same capacity for economic output; that is impossible. 

&gt; They have not bended the rules, not even once - they did everything right.

It's not that Finland has been doing their work and everyone else hasn't; it's mostly a matter of circumstance. You do have regions that are underperforming economically in Finland, don't you? You should be able to grasp the concept that no matter how much money you transfer some regions are more likely to remain less productive than others.

&gt; Second - short term risk sharing a) it is not short term, it is long term. As I said, the problem with the lack of competitiveness of the south for example will not go away. And, risk sharing is money transfer. The Finns will have to pay for your risk, your interest rate - for a long time.

You did not understand what the proposed solution entails. Under that solution, Finland does not pay even one eurocent unless everything comes tumbling down in an unorganised manner. If after we solve the current thing we decide that we don't want fiscal transfers, it should be pretty straightforward to transfer the risks back to the national central banks and we each go our separate ways.

6,"Another thing to keep in mind is that looking back at the recent past at that time, the wars that they had to consider were very very quick, even from today's vantage point. A lot of political and military leaders thought it would be a quick war, one way or the other. Their tactics had worked in those wars.

Franco-Prussian war was something like 65 weeks. The Prussian-Austrian war was a few months long. The Balkan wars being fought around Turkey had started and stopped within a few weeks. The only exception to this really was the American Civil War, and that was the one furthest in the past. Add to that that European countries still viewed the US as something of a backwater, and they get the impression war will be quick.

Immediately previous wars and their timeframe:
**EDIT** I hate the formatting on reddit...

*Austrian-Prussian: 8 weeks.

*Franco-Prussian: 9 months (practically over in Jan 1871, though)

*Russo-Turkish war: 10 months

*Serbo-Bulgarian war of 1885: 2 weeks.

*Greco-Turkish war: 7 months (to armistice)

*Italy-Turky/First Balkan War: year and a half

*(maybe the Japan-Russo war counts here too -- it was longer but mainly due to logistics)

1,"&gt;You mentioned the 2008 incident, now you changed it to 2009.

Because the ""incident"" happened in 2008, but most of the discussion and press about it happened in 2009.  I didn't ""change"" anything.

&gt;People try to not talk about it, therefore my rough estimate is that these were maybe 20 out of 50 times death camps were mentioned in German public news in 2009.

You are talking out of your ass.  Every single day you can find many documentaries and shows about the war on TV.  Or some new nugget of information in Geo or another magazine.  Or some kind of debate on the radio.  I (as a Canadian) am constantly amazed how *much* ""war talk"" goes on every single day in Germany.  You quite clearly have no idea what goes on in Germany regarding the press and WW2.

Every time I walk into a cafe or bar where there is a big TV there is either 1.) football  2.) A documentary about how the world will end  3) Some kind of show about Hitler and the war

&gt;I can imagine death camps aren't mentioned everyday in Germany, since you have a penalty of up to 3 years of prison for public display of nazi symbols.

You can obviously talk about these things without flashing a swastika, so I have no idea what you are trying to say here.

&gt;Let me remind you that you claimed to read everything in German due to your profession and claimed it only appeared once in 2008. 

Putting words in my mouth here.  I speak and read fluent German but I never said I ""read everything"" in German.  My reading is split between German and English and French.  I did talk about the ""one big incident"" I knew of.  You said that Germany regularly refers to the camps incorrectly.  You haven't provided one bit of evidence to back that up yet.

&gt;People try to not talk about it, therefore my rough estimate is that these were maybe 20 out of 50 times death camps were mentioned in German public news in 2009.

I really give your ""rough estimations"" about German media and WW2 very little regard.  Come back when you have some real numbers.  Right now I am sitting in a cyber cafe in Berlin.  Out of curiosity I just went to the magazine rack.  A totally random collection of about 15 newspapers and women's magazines and DJ guides.  I found 5 stories/articles about the war.

&gt;""German stereotype"" - I don't see how it could be read differently than ""a stereotype popular in Germany"".

This must be because you are not a native speaker then.  So ""The Female Stereotype"" is a stereotype popular with girls?  But it's not your native language, so no bad.

&gt;The expression ""polish death camp"" appeared in English version of Die Welt in 2008, the one you're referring to.

But ""Polnisches Vernichtungslager"" is the German phrase that gets used the same way.  And if you Google that you will find several cases of German press apologizing for different uses.  It is pretty obvious that when this phrase gets used, people notice, and apologies are made.  It is not the ""secret epidemic"" that you describe.

&gt;I believe it is also part of German PR, and damage control - we are not going to pay for it though.

And this is where you are wrong and dishonest.  And confrontational, like the young teenage boy who always thinks you are ""putting him down"".

You think somewhere there is the über-boss sending instructions to his servants in press, radio, and print around the country?  ""Hey.. make *sure* you say Polish Death Camp instead of German Death Camp Located in Poland.  If we do it enough WE CAN CONVINCE THEM!  MWAH HA HA!""

Perhaps once in a while some neo-nazi is using the phrase like you imagine.  Most of the time I believe it to be people using a (completely appropriate and acceptable) phrase that they have no idea has a ""troubled backstory"".  And then after they use it they have to go through the meetings with the boss, and the letters, and the emails from the Polish Embassy, and the apologies and corrections.  It must be a real pain in the ass!

&gt;""conquest of the aztecs"" ? Someone aztecked of conquestors? Your speech just turned into a meaningless word salad. Rules of grammar aren't as plastic as you seem to think.

Don't take on an attitude when you have no idea what you are talking about.  Yes.  ""Conquest of the Aztecs"" - the conquest of the Aztecs by the Spanish.  The argument here is that english (and other languages) has this ambiguity built in to it.  ""The Discovery of the New World"".  Was that something that the New World discovered?  It's not all a plot!

&gt;I am against German PR aimed at sharing the blame with Poland, their politicians also do some trash-talking implying it wasn't all their fault. They also paid for highly controversial movie called ""poklosie"" which is a thriller showing how Poles used nazis as an excuse to murder (richer) Jews in their villages.

I acknowledge that Poland worked with the Nazis **a lot** less than most of the other occupied countries.  Also that most of the ""Righteous Among Nations"" at Yad Veshem are Polish.  This is something to be proud of.  But reality is not black and white, and there were Poles who worked with the Nazis as well, and who profited from the situation.  Do you deny this?  Can it not be spoken of?  Is it against the 2006 law criminalizing the “slandering of the Polish nation by accusing it of participating in communist or Nazi crimes.”  It is now **illegal** to say that Poles worked with Nazis at all?  Talk about historical revisionism!

.. Israel Gutman (a Polish Jew who survived Auschwitz and edited Encyclopedia of the Holocaust) wrote that “Although denouncers came forth in most Nazi-occupied countries, only in Poland did bands of thugs and zealots make Jew-hunting a ‘profession.’ ” 

There was a very real antisemitism in Poland (that's why my family left!) ..  Szmalcownicy, Krakow, Kielce,  etc..  This is also reality.  I'm sorry not every story that came out of Poland during the wartime was a story of brave Poles heroically resisting the Nazis and defending the Jews.  But that is not 100% true, is it?

&gt;I find your ignorance ironic. Barack Obama (president of the free world) used the term ""polish concentration camps"" addressing a war-hero posthumously in 2012.

Why now accusing me of ignorance?  Of course I'm aware of Obamas goof and I even already mentioned ""presidents"" earlier, but you didn't seem to notice.  Ironic.

Do you know that even when Obama used ""Polish Death Camp"" he was accused of ""bad intentions"" by the Polish Foreign Minister?  That is crazy.  Obviously Obama just goofed -- he is one of the most politically sensitive presidents the US has ever had! Do you really think he is part of the ""conspiracy""?  And yet here he is being accused of his ""intentions"" in using the phrase.  That behaviour is obviously bordering on paranoia.

Here is something interesting.  On the website of the Polish embassy in the US they talk about this issue and have stats for the number of ""cases"" of ""Polish Death Camp"" they have found and fought against in the USA.  In 2010 it was 103 .. two years later in 2012 it was down to one-quarter of that.  Just 23 cases!  So there is the reality for you.  There is no conspiracy of ""bad intention"".  It is just people who realize that Poles really don't like it when you say ""Polish Death Camp"" .. and so they are not saying it anymore.

Conspiracy solved!

&gt;The spread of ignorance works well, you can tell by how teachings of Goebbels among German diaspora still echo in form ""polish jokes"".

We had plenty of ""polish jokes"" in Canada as well.  This was not the work of Goebbels.  This is a fact that every group who immigrates in large numbers somewhere will end up having jokes about them. We had Italian jokes, Irish jokes, black jokes, Jew jokes, Mexican jokes.  Get over it.  I have heard many more jokes about Bavarians while I have been living here than jokes about Poles.

&gt;The list is endless. ""heated emails""? There's polish lobby organization working on calling it ""German extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland"" Obama used this expression in his apology and uses it since then.

I think that's exactly the situation.  I think that around the world people use the phrase ""Polish Death Camps"", because it is appropriate and correct to do so and carries no other ""propaganda weight"" *in itself*.  But then someone from one of these lobby organizations hears of it and writes angry letters saying that the phrase is insensitive and hurtful because it ""could"" be misinterpreted (even though nobody is actually misinterpreting it) and then whoever has used it issues an apology and tries to remember not to use it again in the future so as not to get another angry email from a Pole sitting in an office on the other side of the planet.

&gt;You're not assuring me, you're assuring yourself and that my friend is called denial. Peace.

I don't even know what you are accusing me of denying.  Do I deny that there is a widespread campaign to rewrite European history through using the term ""Polish Death Camp""?  Yes.  I deny that.

When the phrase comes up it is the result of careless proofreading and mis-speaking.  When it happens, people apologize and try to watch their speech in the future.  This is proven by the *extreme* 75% reduction of cases (I only have USA numbers) between 2010 and 2012.

So keep on doing what you are doing.  If you want to make sure everyone says ""German Death Camps in Poland"" from here on, that's fine.  But don't try to spread the lie that anyone who says ""Polish Death Camp"" has a ""secret agenda against the Poles"".

Because that is just like something Goebbels would do.  :)

As far as *safety* is concerned... ECE R22-05 – Developed by the rather lengthily named United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, this is the most common helmet certification internationally, required by over 50 countries worldwide. It is approved for all competition events by AMA, WERA, FIM, CCS, Formula USA and the big one – MotoGP. It, much like the DOT standard, favors a more impact-absorbent helmet allowing a maximum of 275g’s (the ECE R22-05 anvil is either flat or “kerb shaped” depending on the test). The ECE R22-05 is arguably the most up-to-date helmet certification standard, it’s wide use in a variety of high-level motorcycle racing classes is reassuring to many. The ECE R22-05 has more in common with the DOT standard than either the Snell M2005 or M2010 standard, an ECE R22-05 certified helmet are likely to pass the DOT test and vice-versa.

There are certainly some attested cases of philosophers who only had minimal accomplishments, and probably would have been more productive if they had had happier lives. Peirce wrote many striking essays, but never was able to finish the projects he projected due to problems with alcohol, women, and money. Many members of the Frankfurt School were able to survive Nazi persecution and go on to flourish in America and post-war Germany, but Walter Benjamin was not. So there are exceptions.

I was 17, it was the beginning of summer and I was in east europe, visiting my grandparents. Long story short, I was at a party with my cousin in a rural area, over 5 miles away from my grandparent's home and here I was staying. I drank quiet a bit of alcohol, mostly gin and whiskey.  It was like 3 A.M and some of the girls wanted to go the a club around where I was staying. My cousin was even more drunk than I was an he let me borrow the keys to his brand new Mercedes ML. He specifically told me not to dent his rims. The road towards the club had a lot of potholes, being east europe and all. I remember violently swerving from side to side to avoid them. Those drunk girls who were with me thought it was funny to film the whole thing. The video was mosty about them talking on camera but it included me driving like a mad man. It was uploaded to the the social network 'hi5'. But it was removed after me and my cousin had a chat with them. And yes, we arrived at the club fine.

1,"I will agree with you: Israel is in the wrong.  West Bank settlements, displacing and abusing the Arabs is all very wrong.  There should be a Muslim Palestinian state, on good terms with Israel, for those wishing to keep to their traditional lifestyle, and those Arab Muslims who want to assimilate into the western lifestyle in Israel should be allowed to do so and gain Israeli citizenship.

But what led Israel to be in the wrong? The Middle East conflict is extremely difficult to explain, as the two “sides” are actually split into different factions. But let’s start with the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.

Upon its creation, Israel was completely (and still is partyl) surrounded by hostile states, and it contains a people that were traditionally despised not only in Europe but also in the Arab Peninsula; with the rise of both Arab nationalism (Nasser etc.) and Islamism, it became even more unsafe to be a Jew in an Arab country. Hence, Operation Magic Carpet, to get Arab Jews into Israel, is win-win; Israel gets more Jews to populate their new country, and Jews are kept safe.

The result of being surrounded by hostile states is, however, nationalism and a desire to fight, often violently, for your existence. Israel gains the West Bank in 1967; it wins the Yom Kippur War in 1973; it invades Lebanon. Nationalism thrives on conflict, and indeed, Adam Curtis cites this as a reason why Hamas and Israeli nationalists need each other in order to survive; if Oslo had been a success, things may have turned out differently.

But to cut off a country diplomatically is bad news, the worst thing you can do to a country and it is the absolute last resort. The result of cutting off Israel would be a ramping-up of all the abuses and tensions that are currently a problem. North Korea is a good example of a country becoming even more unruly as even China tries to distance itself from it.

2,"&gt;Actually, back in the real world Christians are being beaten, kicked out of their homes and persecuted today, particularly in places like gaza.

Sure.  But you've repeatedly claimed some sort of equivalency of Jewish anti-Christian stuff, which is ridiculous.

&gt;I haven't exaggerated my persecution because I don't have to. In fact I haven't even mentioned it: you're the one pretending that because jewish people you've never met have endured horrors you have not shared or suffered, everyone has to walk on eggshells around you.

Let me get this straight: a tiny minority of Christians who you've probably never met entirely unrelated to you who live thousands of miles away gives you licence to bring up Christian persecution.  Yet when I myself hear the name of my group used as a derisive verb, even in the halls of government (as happened last week), had my grandparents (who I have, in fact, met) forced to compete for limited spots in college because of Jewish quotas, were forced to leave the countries of their birth because of threat of violence (countries they were only in because crusaders chased them from Central/Western Europe, where they only were because the Romans brought them there), and had their own native language nearly destroyed because the majority of the speakers were murdered, I still had no licence to bring up persecution of Jews?  When my friends' grandparents meet up to speak in their native Romanian Yiddish because they can't find anyone else to speak it with?  When a sizeable proportion of the older population in my town are the sole surviving members of their family because the rest were killed?  It goes without saying that all those things were done by Christians, some Catholic, some Protestant, some Eastern Orthodox.

Clearly, it would be absurd for me to expect you to take responsibility for those things, because you quite obviously didn't do them.  Kind of like it would be absurd for a religious group to blame another for thousands of years for their distant ancestors supposedly killing their messiah.  I wonder what religion would be so silly as to do something like that.

What I do think is reasonable is at least a bit of historical self-awareness, about how Christianity has been used to forment those ridiculous things I listed above, and how those attitudes have been rife in Christianity for thousands of years.  But it seems that's too much to ask.  If you'd prefer to claim that some other people persecuting Christians thousands of miles from you and some Jews making mean jokes centuries ago somehow make it unnecessary to deal with Christianity's history of antisemitism, enjoy your mental gymnastics.",0,c9qi0sd,1431358168,False,t3_1dfdvm,david,,gingerkid1234,0,t5_2qh6c,1367437594,t1_c9qgzrr,Christianity,,False,0,Jewish,True,t1_c9qi0sd,2

It does, but on maps it just means 'unexplored.'

Anyway, those citations in Ptolemy. All of this is going to be from Stevenson's translation, which apparently is notoriously poor in quality, but is also the only complete English translation I have access to—and I can't read Greek or Latin.  [Here's a link to book 7.](http://archive.org/details/PtolemysGeographyBook7)

From 7.3:

&gt;It [Sinae/China] is surrounded from the East from Cattigara by unknown land, and bordered by the Prasus Sea as far as the Prasum promontory, from which, it is said, begins the bay of the encircling ocean connecting the land from the Rhaptum promontory and the southern parts of Azan on the northeast coast of Africa.

7.5:

&gt;The part of the earth which is inhabited by us is bounded on the east by the unknown land which border the eastern races of Greater Asia, namely the *Sinae* and the *Seres,* and on the south by the likewise unknown land which encloses the Indian and which encompasses Ethiopia south of Libya, the country called Agisymba, and by the Western ocean bordering on the western-most parts of Africa and Europe, and on the North by...

All I see in 7.7 is this:

&gt;The known part of the earth is so situated that it is nowhere entirely walled around by the ocean, except only in the case of the land of Raptis, which belongs in part to Africa and in part to Europe, according to the testimony of the ancients.

6,"Oh, that is just *sick.* I'm glad the police took the restaurant owner's side.

Regarding this part:

&gt;Umm, last I checked 10-year-old boys don't have large C-cup boobs and plump butts.

You might want to visit /r/abrathatfits or measure yourself according to [this guide](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/How-to_determine_bra_size) and try what it suggests. Cup sizes are [relative to band sizes](http://i.imgur.com/6KJjw.png) and the letters don't mean anything by themselves. A 38B has a much larger volume than a 32B, for instance.

A woman with normal-to-large-sized boobs wearing a 34- or 36C is a real red flag. The band size should indicate the underbust measurement (*do not add any inches*), and the letter indicates the number of inches' difference between the underbust circumference and the bust circumference.

So an actual 34C, for example, would have a 34"" underbust measurement and a 37"" bust measurement, with about 1.5"" of boob tissue per breast. Most women are wearing the wrong size - too big of a band and too small of a cup to compensate. I went from a 36D to a 28G when I remeasured.

You might enjoy [The Bra Band Project](http://www.brabandproject.com/), lots of pictures of women wearing their properly-fitted sizes.

And here's a couple quick image montages for you:

**[Actual, properly-fitted D-cups](http://i.imgur.com/SnbJ7jh.jpg) (NSFW)**

**[Actual, properly-fitted G-cups](http://i.imgur.com/dmOnJjj.jpg) (NSFW)**

Edit: Note that the G-cups have European band sizes. 60 = 28, 65 = 30, 70 = 32, etc.

Edit 2: If you want to downvote me because you don't believe me, head on over to /r/abrathatfits and do some reading. The American bra market is genuinely fucked right the hell up and most women are wearing the wrong size.

If you want to downvote me because you think I'm being rude to OP by presuming to tell her that her bra might not be the right size, keep in mind that the 80%+ women who are wearing the wrong size *firmly believe they are wearing the right size*, because they've been told they are by Victoria's Secret and a generation of women who were also sized incorrectly. Victoria's Secret does this because it's substantially cheaper for them to produce 25 sizes and invent a measuring method that forces most women into one of them than it is for them to produce and stock **250+** actual sizes.

For me, and for many other women, wearing a bra with a too-big band and too-small cups caused back pain, shoulder pain, neck tension, and boob soreness. It can cause breast tissue to migrate from the breasts into the armpits, underbust, and even back. I've known women who have permanent dents and red marks on their shoulders and breasts from wearing, for example, a 36C when they should have been wearing a 32FF. When I got my first 28G after years of wearing a 36D, it was like angels cradling my boobies. If I seem obnoxious when I bravangelize, I'm not sorry at all. If it saves one woman *a single day* of pain, it was worth it.

3,"from the [Condom FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/13v7cu/a_condom_faq/):

**Q. Which brand of condom is the SAFEST and least likely to break? Do condoms break? Why?**

All condoms sold in the EU/US (and other developed countries) have to undergo normalised testing during manufacture (as dictated by the ISO and other regulations, which also dictate what sizes/thickness they can be).

So if you're buying condoms that are legally available in your country, you can rest assured they have been tested to a high standard and will be safe to use. Over large enough sample sets, all brands/variants of latex condom are of statistically equal reliability, although I can understand why if you've had a particular type break (can be quite traumatic) you might think otherwise.

**It's a myth that 'ultra thin' break more often than regular condoms do. In clinical studies this isn't the case, and when you understand that the difference in thickness between ultra thin condoms and standard ones is approximately 1/5th of a human hair (20 microns), you start to understand why. One study found that extra thick condoms fail just as often as regular condoms too.**

We don't fully understand (as an industry) what causes breakage. Secondly, we witness, consistently, ""breakers"" - that being people who experience much higher than average breakage rates (average being about 1.5%). We don't fully understand that either, the best theory is something to do with their technique.

and

**Q. What are redditors favourite condoms?**

Quite a few threads about favourite condom:
[1](http://tinyurl.com/bvtrz5e), [2](http://tinyurl.com/bo3sl88), [3](http://tinyurl.com/ct3l9m7)

I'm biased, but make the condom fit and that's most of the battle won. Think about shoes - your favourite shoes to wear aren't the ones made from a fancy material etc but the ones that **fit** you the best. It's extraordinarily similar when it comes to wearing a condom &amp; your dick.

4,"&gt; Because the guy talks about Greece and the Finns have an AAA rating plus have followed the rules every year. They have already have to borrowed more to pay of the bailouts that the Maastricht treaty forbids, and now you want to raise their interest rate to, and possibly even ask them to shoulder Greek debt. Why should the Finns pay for anything of Greece, above what is explicitly stated in the treaty? 

You are misrepresenting my views again. I'm not going to repeat the same things again and again. I never said anything about temporary fiscal transfers. That economics professor made a suggestion that entailed ECB issuing its own bonds; that does not directly affect the interest rates of Finland or their budget. 

&gt; Well, that is then the choice of the Finns to make, not of the Eurozone or the EU, since it goes against the rules. So, then it should be made on a country, voluntarily basis then? 

I did not say otherwise. 

&gt; And, that could be a claim that one makes for the whole world. I mean, I might personally prefer to help Bangladesh or Brazil since my money might have much more of an impact there and Brazil is really much more of a new emerging market than south of Italy for example. 

&gt; So, that argument don't really stand, does it? Why should southern Europe be prioritised with tax money, above what they are already receiving? And, for the ""no country is an island"" argument - why should southern Europe then receive more money than other interesting regions?

That's an interesting proposal and yes I do think that such a scheme should eventually be expanded to cover the whole world. I agree that Bangladesh deserves it more than Greece. Still, we need to extinguish the little fire in our own back yard before we make an attempt to save the whole world. 

&gt; the worst case that has happened over and over again? Everyone knows that there is no way in hell Greece can even pay back their own debt, and they even got a debt shaving in 2012. 

Greece falling behind in competitiveness was the obvious outcome of the currency union in hindsight, not the worst case. I was talking about the worst case under the proposed scheme. Are you saying that ""since the worst case happened once with Greece then it will happen again?"" That's not a logical argument.

Greece indeed cannot pay its own debts unless someone constantly guarantees it. That's what the scheme above does. The ECB pays some of the debts of Greece and then Greece slowly repays the ECB the difference. Everyone wins, no money is lost by anyone.

&gt; C), you are dodging the fact that the Finns because of this will pay a higher interest rates, as will the Dutch etc which translates to billions of Euros, in transfers to the south. 

I'm not dodging that, I'm denying it. Under that specific plan, this thing will not occur at all. The magic of shuffling numbers around. 

&gt; It goes against the treaty - You do not seem to care that the treaty states that each state takes care of its own shit basically. 

&gt; I do grasp that, I think everyone does. However, that is why the treaty explicitly states - no transfers, since transfers, within and without of the country is an endless source of irritation etc.

&gt; Don't you think that should be respected then? It is a the demcratically decided treaty which you think should be ignored - how can you ignore democracy? 

&gt; You can not just ignore the law because it is inconvenient at the moment! How would that look - as I said, Denmark decides not to pay the fee because it is inconvenient, France shit on the nuclear treaties, and Sweden decides to try capital punishment ""just because it suits us better"". Is that the world your advocating? If not, why is it OK to break the law in your case, but not any other? 

This is all correct. However, the treaty was ill-conceived and the rules it imposed were arbitrary. Nevertheless, I don't mind bending the rules if it means less people will suffer, I acknowledge that. According to the treaties, the thing we are experiencing was impossible to happen. We are treading unknown territory.

Suppose you are using a computer programme and for some reason or other something occurs that is outside what the programmers had coded as possible. Now, the state of the software becomes increasingly corrupted because its internal assumption do not hold any more. In this situation, adhering to the original programming is pointless. You need to forcefully go around it. 

This is, regrettably, the state of affairs in the EU. We can stick to the original programming, it sure is possible and perhaps noble. But it's irrational, it will end up hurting us all. 

&gt; So, why have the happened to the money that the EU cohesion fund have spent on southern Europe in the last 25 years? Why isn't southern Europe more competitive? Estonia has made greater strides in a decade, than Greece for example in 25 years. All regions are not alike, but I can expect them to improve in the same rate, but that is not the case, not at all. So, if southern Europe want more money, I'd like to know what has happened with the money from the last 25 years, and why they haven't made the improvement eastern Europe has.

What makes you so sure that the improvements in, say, Greece are negligible compared to the improvements in Eastern Europe? I don't see much of a difference really. It just happened that Greece was the weakest link in the eurozone. What is your evidence of all that?

&gt; The ""thing"" as you call it is not something you can solve quickly? Just for fun, how are you going to get Greece, Portugal and Spain competitive in 2 years, which is generally what one mean with short term. Pay off the debt? So, fiscal transfers for two years and then out? Do you honestly believe that yourself? 

Of course they won't become competitive in the just a few years. As for the rest, you're forcing me to repeat myself: that guy's proposal never was fiscal transfers for two years. It was a ECB-facilitated lending. The debt obligations would be easy to be broken up if we broke up the euro. The debt obligations would simply be transferred to the national central banks like all other assets of the ECB.

&gt; Second - it is not up to you to decide if you want fiscal transfers. It is up to the transfer countries, and the people of the EU. We have a right to vote about it, since it is against the treaty. 

For the umpteenth time, I did not ask for fiscal transfers and I did not say any scheme would be unilaterally decided by the debtor countries. Good grief! 

&gt; You said temporary fiscal transfers. I doubt people will vote yes at all and I think you are right, there is a real tiredness and unwillingness for more bailouts, transfers etc. Since the competitiveness is hardly magically going come back, my advice would be to leave the Euro - decades more of what is happening now in southern Europe is hardly a fun prospect. Better to take one's destiny in one's own hand then, not let it be controlled by Euro bureacrats. I honestly think that is southern Europe's best shot, because this crises isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 

I agree that it's a possible way. It's backwards because I'd really like the world to become more united but it sure is better than the current situation. It would be best in the medium term, hell in the short term and disappointing in the long term for everyone involved.

http://www.meforum.org/2646/worldwide-trends-in-honor-killings

Read the following list, and note how many are Muslim:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing#Europe

But the real ignorance here is from you, I'm afraid. You said it was a cultural problem, I said Islam is a culture, you disagreed, I proved you wrong. Now you're saying it's not a religious problem, it's a cultural problem. I don't even...

&gt;Your statement does not become true by virtue of you just saying it, you have to find evidence for your claims to back them up, try using google again, good luck! ;)

I gave you a few links. But I know that no matter how many times I point out an Islamic connection you will just ignore it. But here are a few.

http://www.policymic.com/articles/33145/gul-meena-attempted-honor-killing-don-t-blame-islam

Don't blame Islam they say, but here's what the article says:

&gt;True, Meena was Muslim, but this honor killing stemmed from cultural norms – norms that span the globe. Look to Pakistan's neighbor [India](http://www.ibtimes.com/caste-council-explains-honor-killings-while-india-still-reels-gang-rape-tragedy-1019686), and you'll see Hindu villages committing the exact same violence in the name of honor. Look to [Israel](http://www.dailylife.com.au/life-and-love/real-life/stoned-for-having-short-hair-20130130-2dkd1.html), and you can read a Jewish rabbi's strict instruction manual for appropriate female dress code, starting at the age of 3. Look to [America](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/new-hampshire-man-ernest-willis-guilty-raping-teen-church-member-tina-anderson-article-1.146895), and you'll find Christian churches forcing rape victims to publicly ""apologize"" for the ""sin"" of getting pregnant from their rape.

Don't blame the religion they say, and to support that claim, they use *other religions* as evidence that religion causes abuse. Do you not get that? This is what religious culture causes. Why are you defending a religion on r/atheism? 

http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/04/30/Jordanian-kills-sister-to-cleanse-family-honor-.html

The Kingdom of Jordan, based on Sharia law. Murder is indeed a crime, but:

&gt;Murder is punishable by death in Jordan, but in “honor killings” courts can commute or reduce sentences, particularly if the victim's family asks for leniency.

In the Muslim world, honor killings carry less of a penalty.


These cases are legion. They are a part of Islamic culture. 

&gt;Your statement does not become true by virtue of you just saying it, you have to find evidence for your claims to back them up,

Which is funny, because you said:

&gt;If you look further into cases like that, rather than assuming merely because of the religion those people hold, you'l find that the reasons for those acts are cultural not religious, in the religion of islam such acts are not allowed let alone recommended.

With absolutely nothing to back it up.

5,"So, this is my app, it's also a big wall of text, but hopefully not the same as any other one.
Small intro about myself: I'm a laid back guy living in the Netherlands, a small silly country in Europe. My first language is not English, but I do practice it a lot and I talk with people from all over the world every evening, due to my current occupation as one of the big guys at a very  large Minecraft community. After a year or so, my English is a fluent as my Dutch. I also speak quite some words French and German, and a few loose words of Spanish, altough you shouldn't rely on me for the latter. I've been playing Smite since june 2012, just after the horrific Guan Yu patch.

**Do you have any past moderator experience (both on and off Reddit)?**
I have gathered quite some moderation experience, mostly from being an administrator for over a year on a Minecraft server network with an estimated playerbase of 5-15K people. I spend the majority of the time on PR, and messages on the forums. Giving a link is considered advertisement, but I can hand out any verification details in private if needed. Here is a quote from the person I have worked with for over a year (I still work with him, by the way). I did never ask him specifically to make anything like this, but he voluntarily posted this on the anniversary of the server on the website, without announcement. He's an 18 year old guy from Boston, and he studies International Relations. I thought I'd put it in, trust is hard to find on the internet, so hopefully this could be some verification. Once again, I can prove that I did not make this myself if needed. Anyway, I will not hold up any longer. It ment a lot to me. C:
&gt;*Marik: Of everyone I have met in my time on New Liberty, you are perhaps the greatest man I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Where I am dedicated to the server as a matter of dogma, and reliant on it to occupy my time, you have my eternal respect for your truly earnest and altruistic interest in the New Liberty community. You are motivated by a pure interest for the community and the project, rather than any competitiveness or desire for personal success. You are a truly good person, an exemplary man. You are kind, empathetic, moral, and eager to learn. You are unwavering in your support for the New Liberty team or community. In many ways you are a role model; you are an example of a truly good person, and you are a dear friend to me.*
&gt;*Marik has devoted himself to the success of New Liberty. He has a practically impeccable track record in his time as a staff member, persistently exercising the appropriate professionalism, caution, and judgement. It is hard for me to pick out specifically things he has done for the server because in every venture he contributed to, he was roundly successful and helpful. He has built Horde maps and countless other essential projects, trained staff members, caught countless hackers, and always displayed a truly admirable measure of dedication.*

(For if you didn't know, that is my other nickname.)

On Reddit itself, I do not have a whole lot of experience in moderation, and I recently joined after lurking on the website for ages. I'm a quick learner though, and I'd really like to give the Smite subreddit page a try, mainly because it is not too large, and because I have a  vast knowledge of the game itself.

**Why do you think you'd make a great moderator here on /r/Smite?**
I think I would be up for the job because I would enjoy helping people out. I am not doing it for power or status, but sincerely to help out and organize the /r/Smite page. As I stated before, I love helping out people, and I also love Smite. The subreddit is vastly growing, but it is not too big, in terms of being chaoticly large.

**Do you have any skills that would benefit the moderator team (CSS, Graphic Design, Other)?**
I have a moderate level of Graphic design, and you should not expect any miracles. I do have a lot of general knowledge of the aspects in Smite, mythology, and how the game (in technical terms) works, and the same applies for Reddit. I can provide a lot of management ond organisation for the subreddit.

**If the rules of /r/Smite didn't allow for the posting of streams, but a special charity stream wanted to be posted that helped a very sick member of the community AND they asked for previous approval would you allow it? Why?**
I would discuss the case thoroughly with the other members of the staff team and come to a good solution, rather than acting on myself. Maybe work on some more clear policy in the future where even the exceptions are included in the policy itself, so no confusion can exist. There would be a ""simple"" rules sheet, and a more detailed and explained policy that has to be read prior to posting. If it's feasible, I think it would be a good idea.

**If the rules of /r/Smite didn't allow for duplicate posts and a community fansite posted the patch notes minutes before HiRezBart did AND they are exactly the same. Who's post would you delete? Why?**
As /r/Smite is a community website, and not an environment controlled by HiRez studios, the first person to post it should be the one whose post may stay. If this were the HiRez forums, different rules might apply - but hey, this is still a fan community, not an officially representative website.

**If approached by a HiRez Staff Member asking you to remove a post from /r/Smite which violates NO RULES would you do it? Why?**
As mentioned before, this is a fan community, and as long as the content is not in violation with the Terms &amp; Conditions of HiRez Studios, it may stay. If it would indeed be in violation with the terms (such as pirated content, bypassing payments, glitches, hacks, etc) then I'd say remove. If there is something that is in the grey area inbetween legal and illegal, I'd consult my other staff members.

**What do you feel needs to be improved here on /r/Smite (visually, functionally, or moderator functions-wise)?**
I would definitely love to see some more community-esque improvements, maybe have some sort of ""Tip of the Day"" with a useful tip for certain gods or god combinations. Some link to the most viewed livestreams would also be a lot cooler than the links to other MOBAs, in my personal opinion. Also, if there is indeed going to be a more expansive rule system, there should be a link to it from the sidebar, obviously. Overall, it is already very good, with the rotation and MotD included, but it could use minor improvements.

1,"1. Uesian language

2. The Uesian language is spoken by the people of Uesia, an isolated and tribal island civilization in the Atlantic ocean, north-west of the Azores archipelago.

3. Uesian is almost completely removed from the rest of the world. However, thousands of years ago, it originated from ancient ancestors of the romance languages.

4. In ages past, the Uesians had relationships with western European countries, as well as the Roman Empire, but they broke off entirely around 500 CE for unknown reasons. They were rediscovered in the early 1950s by Germany, and the UN kept things under wraps as Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada all claimed it as their own. The UN occupied the island, and by the time the language had been completely unravelled in the late 1970s, they had granted it full sovereignty. The UN never did leave, though.",0,c9qjne8,1431357401,False,t3_1dgiqh,,,MonThrasher314,0,t5_2red7,1367441614,t3_1dgiqh,conlangs,,False,0,,True,t1_c9qjne8,1
1,"I am aware the extent of records kept by Germany but that does not disprove my point. Even though Germany released millions and millions of records since 1996 the estimated number of Jewish people destroyed is still always about 6 million. This includes after they reduced the claim of 4 million dead at the various Auschwitz complexes to around 1.1 million as archived [here](http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/ftp.py?camps/auschwitz/press/death-toll-estimate-reduced). The link goes on to quote a very similar but more specific death toll of 5.86 million. Wikipedia also states that most historians came to the number 6 million independently of the erroneous Auschwitz claim. But even though Germany has released the very specific aforementioned records, several years after the publication date of the link i provided, many historians still insist on the 6 million figure. The real problem that I have with that number is that it, depending on the source, includes Jews that were not exterminated, or died as a result of being Jewish. Often Jews that died fighting in the war or Jews that disappeared in the diaspora(skewing census figures.) Those individuals technically should not be part of that number. While it is still a great shame what happened to these people, millions of others also died in concentration camps. I will finish my point by stating that Raul Hilberg, author of *The Destruction of the European Jews*, often claimed as the seminal work on the topic of the Holocaust, places the estimate at between 4.9 and 5.4 million. 

While it is very easy to defend and embrace the number six million, we should either use a more accurate number when specifically mentioning Jews OR simply include the other millions of non-Jews and use a number closer to 12 million to include all people that suffered directly as a result of the *Final Delusion*.

5,"If you're going to have the balls to claim to be any kind of authority by calling yourself a historian and political scientist, you're going to get called out. You have the spelling and grammar of a 5 year old, frankly its an embarrassment to both fields. It reflects very poorly on any opinion you have to share almost from the outset. History and political science are fields which are heavily indebted to the process of reading and writing, if you are not capable of articulating yourself in a cohesive, well prepared manner, then you probably haven't done enough of both. Ad hominem aside, lets get to your point about decline.

The narrative that America has been in decline has been spouted on and off for the last 40 years, since Japan was expected to overtake American manufacturing and become the next super power in the 70's. Then the 90's hit and guess what? That bubble burst. Then focus shifted to the EU, and again people decided that this was the beginning of a shift of power away from the United States, the strength and value of the Euro was seen as proof of this. Now the Euro zone is in trouble, and the dollar, as well as the United States, is once again is seen as the safest investment. Now people point to China and say that it is the final nail in the coffin. I'm sorry but im just not convinced. Sure China is booming, but they have a lot of internal obstacles to overcome before they reach the level the United States is. You can argue that their growth rate is artificially inflated, one only need look at the ""ghost cities"" China is building to keep their numbers high to feel the calamatous bubble approaching. China's rise is also closely tied with America's prosperity, if one does bad the other does too. The difference? The American political system is robust enough to withstand the shock of economic decline, as it has done numerous times before. Who knows what will happen in China when the main opiate of the people, economic prosperity, is taken away and they are left with the dismal realization that they have to fall back on a corrupt, authoritarian regime which grants little political freedoms. 

In 5 years, the United States will become the top oil producer in the world, overtaking Saudi Arabia. Of course there are problems, but the U.S. has shown time and time again to be able to weather these problems and move forward, even as the speculation of decline has been rampant. Don't be so quick to just write America off, you'll be falling into the same trap people have been for the last 40 years.

Including David Tovey, chief editor of the Cochrane Library and Ben Goldacre, famous for his Column in the Guardian, and his books, Bad Science and BadPharma.

8,"If someone needed the results vs Barca to validate Heynckes as a mastermind, they need their head examined: He's completely dominated the Bundesliga this year, silenced the best midfield in Europe (arguably) against Juventus, took apart Arsenal in the Emirates and (let's not forget) made it to the CL final last year by going through a Real team most pundits didn't think they were capable of matching up with where they only lost on penalty kicks.

I suppose this two-match sequence makes the fact COMPLETELY undeniable, though",0,c9qkfnx,1431357030,1367467551,t3_1dh2ax,7,,Schveen15,0,t5_2qi58,1367443675,t1_c9qj2v3,soccer,,False,0,United States,True,t1_c9qkfnx,8
6,"CLG derived their 3 TP + Promote strategy from Korea, didn't they? It was a different take on the split push and objective control strategy that Korea is so known for, but it also strayed from the Doublelift Protection strat that they're so known for; it was also deemed too much cheese. I think that it gave them ideas but CLG simply isn't the type of team to overtake lanes individually. Their primary focus is teamfighting.

Dignitas, on the other hand.. it may have helped their game knowledge but I don't think they really follow the Korean meta? I'm not a huge Dig follower so sorry if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that Scarra's only Korean champs are Diana and Kayle. Kiwikid has a tiny champion pool due to being relatively new to top; he is not a bad player but I don't think he's found his niche playstyle yet. Crumbzz is.. idk I feel like Crumbzz is struggling a little. And their bot lane.. Qtpie and Patoy are really good, but apparently Regi thinks that Qtpie throws games a lot.

IMO EU teams adapt a lot better. They don't just play what the Koreans play, they adapt Korean strategies to their own. While NA teams do that, I think they still need more time to adjust.

tl;dr NA teams still need more time, EU teams have already explored multiple comps and strategies and have fitted it to their own meta.
