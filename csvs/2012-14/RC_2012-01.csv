t5_2qh1i,"Hah, my apologies, ""entire semesters"" is definitely an exaggeration on my part. I will say this however, having gone to private and public schools in America, that certainly a disproportionate amount of time is spent in history class memorizing the facts/dates/atrocities of the holocaust, when far-greater crimes and murders were committed by Lenin/Stalin/Pol-Pot, and they are merely glanced over.

I firmly believe that the holocaust DID happen, but I also believe that the number 6 million is absolute and total bullshit. Fun fact, did you know that holocaust-denial is a crime in most Western European countries? Spain recently repealed their laws, joining the U.S. as a country where it is legal to have a differing opinion about history. If  6 million people really did get rounded up and exterminated by the Germans, then why go through such great lengths, jailing men and women throughout Europe, to make sure NO ONE dissents?

t5_2qi58,"I found that argument rather odd and weak though. Basically they are arguing that Suarez is a liar because 2 sources (I will count Comolli and Dalglish together since Dalglish only knew what Comolli told him) gave similar interpretations of what Suarez told them was said. In the conversation with Kuyt, the exchange was in Dutch, how do you translate a phrase like ""Por que, negro?""? maybe ""zwart"" (the term Kuyt says he used) is similar, since it is used for this [friendly fellow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet), but when the case in front of you relies on subtle differences in language, translations into and back from a third language just make things much trickier. Sidenote: funny that so many people say Suarez should have known better about acceptable racial relations after being in Europe for so many years. I guess it is easier to condemn others than look at your own failings.

Anyway, the other conversation was with Comolli who says he has a working knowledge of spanish, but the committee seemed set making sure that he was known as ""fluent"" as shown by this strange, circular paragraph:


&gt;287- The referee recorded in his report that Mr Comolli spoke fluent Spanish. Mr Comolli
&gt;denied in evidence that he had told Mr Marriner that he spoke fluent Spanish, telling us
&gt;instead that he simply told Mr Marriner that he spoke Spanish. However, we do not think
&gt;that Mr Marriner would have recorded in his report that Mr Comolli speaks fluent
&gt;Spanish unless Mr Comolli had told Mr Marriner that he did. Mr Marriner did not know
&gt;who Mr Comolli was when he entered the referee's room, so it is unlikely that Mr
&gt;Marriner understood from any other source that Mr Marriner spoke fluent Spanish. Mr
&gt;Marriner says in his witness statement that Mr Comolli told him that he speaks fluent
&gt;Spanish, and Mr Marriner's witness statement was accepted by Mr Suarez. We accept Mr
&gt;Marriner's evidence that Mr Comolli told him that he spoke fluent Spanish.

So even though Marriner only met Comolli for a few minutes, he knows better than Comolli himself what level of Spanish he speaks, and it is not possible that he could take something like ""I speak Spanish"" to mean ""I am fluent in Spanish""? Not to mention that they wrote the statement to be ""Tues negro"" which should be ""tu es negro"" which should really be ""tu eres negro"". Wouldn't someone ""fluent"" have gotten that right? Is it possible that there could be a miscommunication between Suarez and Comolli on something as similar as ""Por que, negro"" and ""porque es/eres negro""?

t5_2qqlo,"Alright, fine. This just turned into a sourced debate.

&gt;Animals can turn very low nutritional food/waste/food we can't digest into protein. Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food.

Indeed, they can! which has prompted factory farm owners to feed them everything from [plastic to manure to their kin to ludicrous amounts of grain.](http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/science_and_impacts/impacts_industrial_agriculture/they-eat-what-the-reality-of.html) You seem to be implying that we eat the good parts of what we farm, and give the stuff we can't eat to the animals, who eat it and enjoy it and are healthy for it. Totally untrue.

My original point was that the plant food we give to animals needs water and fertilizer and land to be grown. We could use these same resources to grow food we can eat. Your point actually hurts the pro-ominvore side, given the reality of the situation detailed in the source above.

&gt;I mean it's kind of like saying ""you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food?! We don't need to be eating plants! We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly!"" (we can't)

Dude, come on. It's not like that at all. Humans&gt;animals&gt;plants&gt;non-sentient life forms (and yes, I know I'm leaving some groups out.) You can't go down a level and consider it a good analogy.

The antibiotic thing is a problem because it creates [very drug resistant germs.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=our-big-pig-problem) It's also probably not good for the humans who are eating the animals treated with these drugs. I should have been more clear about that. It's an issue of scale, not of percents.

&gt;These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product.

Source? Because mine says that [51 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock farming.](http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf) So shipping and literally everything else COMBINED doesn't compare to what's being given off at factory farms. If you have a source to counter mine, btw, I'd like to see it. But even if this one is wrong (I don't think it is, but hey, maybe) it's still a huge problem. I'm sure future generations will be very happy to know we had taxes when they deal with the fallout from our meat addiction.

While we're on the subject of the government giving/taking money from livestock farms, it may be worth mentioning that [63 percent of government farm subsidies go to meat](http://www.pcrm.org/search/?cid=2586). Billions and billions of dollars spent by the government to make sure you can get a $1 double cheeseburger at McDonald's. And less than one percent to fruits and veggies. Yikes. 

&gt;Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer.

Sometimes. Most of the manure is actually collected in what's known as a [waste lagoon, which is exactly what it sounds like.](http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/nspills.asp) These pollute water supplies, release toxins into the air, and are extremely generous for everyone working there or even living near the farm. 

When the waste IS used as fertilizer, it's known as ""sprayfielding."" Maybe it works as fertilizer, but it definitely releases even more toxins into the air. Keep in mind, this is [A LOT](http://www.karmicbs.com/The_Scoop_On_Poop.html)of shit we're talking about (tl;dr on the source: Iowa produces as much shit as China's human population, because of their farms), way more than we could ever use for fertilizer.

&gt;None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier (in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions).

Better, but not by much. The health effects are still debated, except for when mad cow outbreaks happen. 

Try to remember that these are sentient creatures we're talking about. Treating them like that at the rate of 50 billion animals per year is morally wrong. I don't see how you could argue against that, but if you'd like to, I have plenty more sources and philosophical points.

&gt;There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you (e.g. plants modified to be resistant to bacteria).

Why did you use modified plants as your only example? I'm the one who's arguing for plants, you're supposed to be arguing for meat. Stick to your own side if you're trying to sway me.

I was talking about the whole breeders vs. boiler chickens thing and all that, but I'm just gonna skip it. You didn't make a point for me to argue against.

&gt;Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does. Without these sources of food many people would starve.

No they wouldn't. They'd just have to eat less meat. The human species [eats 5 times more meat than it did in 1950](http://www.foodispower.org/exporting_factory_farms.htm) Believe it or not, meat used to be kind of a luxury. Most of our diet was fruits, veggies, grains, and what not. You know, things that we didn't have to raise feed and slaughter in order to eat, or, if you want to go further back, didn't have to find and kill with a spear to eat.

That's the real issue here. Everyone could stand to eat less meat, especially in America. Most of the people in other countries already do. Cruely-free fish means fish that isn't raised in tightly packed conditions in fish farms. There'd be more space for every fish if they didn't need to raise so many to meet demand.

I'm glad you can make moral choices on the basis of a single anecdote though. Must make decisions really easy for you.

&gt;They don't see our factory farms as cruel, they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology. We have the audacity to take that for granted.

You're making one of those American generalizations, that every other country is full of poor folks living in huts who can't do anything but live day-to-day. And yet you somehow seem to know how all these people (who live in the vast expanse known simply as ""poorer countries"") think.

The reality is [much](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/oct/16/deforestation-europe-cheap-meat) more =[complex](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/534). I urge you to look into this if you're going to try to have strong opinions about it. Because right now, you're totally off base on pretty much everything.

EDIT: Downvoters, seriously tell me what's wrong. Is it my somewhat smarmy tone? That's whatever. But if you have a counter-opinion, please tell me. I really would like to hear it. 

If you're downvoting just because you don't like hearing it though, that's sad. Really sad.

t5_2rske,"I'll use double quotes when citing you and single quotes when citing papers.

&gt;&gt; But as he said, we don't gain weight from eating too much, we eat too much from gaining weight. Therefore, logically, you don't lose weight by eating too little (calorie counting), you eat too little from losing weight. 

You lose weight because you're not as hungry; you eat higher volume food with higher satiety. The extra satiety is because the food has less calories, more volume - the higher volume of the food gives a higher distention of your stomach which triggers the release of satiety hormones (not insulin, not limited to low carb diets, Gnolls.org has a good article series on satiety/satiation called [""Why Are We Hungry?""](http://www.gnolls.org/2304/why-are-we-hungry-part-1-what-is-hunger-liking-vs-wanting-satiation-vs-satiety/)), the rate of gastrict emptying is lower as protein and fat is preferentially broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. The small intestine has a lower capacity compared to the massive carb-digesting ""herbivore legacy"" large intestine, The BBC has an interesting documentary called [""Did cooking make us human?""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nq1yBKowz4) that investigates the amount of energy we get from food and various sorts of  processing (and how meat allowed our bodies to divert more energy to our brain).

The key player in this is really protein, which has an [insulin response similar to pasta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_index), but still manages to be more satiating that both fat and carbs, [short term](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10953755) as well as [long term](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403587).

If you eat just carbs the ""high GI"" ones gets digested in the small intestine (broken down to sugars by enzymes) and the harder-to-digest carbs (like digestible fiber) get passed to the large intestine to get broken down by bacteria. Either way high refined carb digestion is rather fast compared to a mostly protein/fat meal. Low carb people eat vegetables with lots of fiber (volume) that helps satiety, and when combined with slower gastric emptying (protein/fat) it's a really good thing for weight loss as you eat less.

The wikipedia entry [""Small intestine""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine#Digestion_and_absorption) is interesting.

&gt;&gt; My point is, that if your hormones, particularly insulin, are at low enough levels then your body will not crave as much energy, and will naturally expend more energy at the same time.

Fortunately there are simple ways of controlling this, like diabetics with zero insulin still getting hungry, insulin/leptin getting raised by eating carbohydrates but carbs being just as satiating as eating the same calories of fat:

&gt; Leptin response was significantly correlated to insulin response (r = 0.51,P &lt; 0.0001). 

...

&gt; Short-term regulation of postprandial satiety and food intake is not influenced by circulating leptin. 

*Romon M, et al.* [""Leptin response to carbohydrate or fat meal and association with subsequent satiety and energy intake""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012) *Am J Physiol. 1999 Nov;277(5 Pt 1):E855-61.*

Insulin doesn't affect your metabolic rate, insulin resistant people (and fat people) have a higher metabolic rate despite higher insulin levels:

&gt; REE was inversely related to age (P=0.001) and the respiratory quotient (P=0.03), and positively related to BMI, lean body mass (LBM), fat mass, and percentage fat mass (all P&lt;0.0001).

*Camastra S, et al.* [""Effect of obesity and insulin resistance on resting and glucose-induced thermogenesis in man. EGIR (European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance)""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10643689) *Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 1999 Dec;23(12):1307-13.*

It also seems like the metabolic rate increases as people get fatter/sicker:

&gt; These findings indicate that increases in RMR and decreases in IIT occur early in the development of type 2 diabetes, and that both changes are related to the progressive metabolic abnormalities that occur during the development of the disease.

*Weyer C, Bogardus C, Pratley RE* [""Metabolic factors contributing to increased resting metabolic rate and decreased insulin-induced thermogenesis during the development of type 2 diabetes""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10426380) *Diabetes. 1999 Aug;48(8):1607-14.*

&gt;&gt; When your insulin levels are low you can trust your body to tell you when you're hungry.

Insulin is just the symptom, swings in blood glucose is what's making people get cravings and [make bad (food) decisions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424042), high calorie refined carbs makes your body spike insulin (comparison: [standard apple, apple puree, apple juice](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/10/2775S/F4.expansion.html)) which makes your blood glucose crash as the insulin secretion continues even after the carbs have been digested (as there isn't any fiber to slow digestion). As discussed above carbs will also get digested faster (once again mitigated somewhat by fiber) than protein/fat and leaves you more hungry than standard low carb meals.

&gt;&gt; People can certainly force their body into an unnatural state by starving themselve (calorie counting) and will likely lose weight; but their body will fight them every step of the way if their carbs/sugar intake is high enough, and this is why calorie-counting based diets fail in the long run. Calorie counting is self-defeating and best avoided.

Any fat loss is due to a caloric deficit, your body requires more energy than you supply and it uses the fat stores to compensate for the lack of energy. So any fat loss is due to ""starvation"".

Christopher Gardner did an interesting study comparing different diets where he noticed that people had different success rates on the different diets depending on if they were insulin resistant or not, he discusses this in talk [""The Battle of the Diets: Is Anyone Winning (At Losing?)""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eREuZEdMAVo&amp;t=43m) (at 43 minutes) and how it affects the success rate. He also cites three additional studies that shows the same thing, and roughly 50% of the people in the studies are insulin resistant. Interestingly the *insulin sensitive* people have similar, or better, success on regular high carb/low fat diets.

The eventual goal of the EU is to create a federal superstate run from Brussels. A single currency, a single flag, a single anthem and a single nationality.
Why on earth would I, a proud Englishman, with my traditional English values want to join a state that has a fundamentally different culture, political ideology and national interest?

England/Britain has managed to survive as an independent state for over a thousand years. The United Kingdom is still a very powerful and wealthy nation so I'm sure we can stay independent for at least another thousand years.

&gt;However the people who want it to leave seem to have no idea how the real world works and the situation Britain would be in if it did.

In my experience people who support Britain's integration into the European Union have a poor understand of the different treaties and inner workings within the European project, as well as a poor understanding of UKIP's position.

t5_2t9dp,"No, I can't start a communist commune in capitalism, not one that can provide it's inhabitants a normal 21st century standard of living. I want to have computers, I want to have cars, I want to have cell phones, ... but I can't produce that in some ""local communism"" inside a capitalist society, because the capitalists possess the means of production.

I can't start my own communist cell phone network because I had to use frequencies that some capitalist company has the ""right"" to use for their profits and I if I would use that, the police would enforce these ""rights"" of the capitalists and deny me to build this new cell phone network (And why has some company the right to those frequencies anyways?)

I also can't create cell phones in the first place (or cars or computers), because capitalists control the means of production (metal resources, silicon, ...); If I just go to some iron mine and want to take some iron the police will come and deny that to me, enforcing the rules of capitalist society on me, although I don't want to be part of this capitalist society.

And that's the problem with capitalism: Why should iron mines be private property of someone? Why should frequencies be private property of someone? I couldn't even start a communist commune that would be able to keep people alive, because for that I need at least some kind of farmland, I have to buy that from some person the land belongs to (for some obscure reason).

To get money to buy this land I have to be part of capitalist society at least for some time; I have to sell my labour power to some capitalist that gives me money in exchange; but not as much money as my work is really worth because the capitalist wants to make a profit, so he steals some part of my labour power; he can do this because he has control over the means of production (this does not have to be an iron mine or control over silicone resource this can be ""just"" money).

So I need money to be able to do anything (and to survive), and the only persons that have that money are capitalists, so I have to work for them. Modern capitalism gives the illusion of freedom because I can choose where I work, but in the end I have to work for some capitalist to survive and this effectively is the same as slavery.

Yes, I get money in exchange for my work, but a slave also got something to eat and a place to live as exchange for his work.
But if I produce a chair and this chair is worth 20$, the capitalist won't give me the 20$, he will give me 10$ and keep the rest as profit. That's where profit comes from: exploiting workers.
And if 5$ is enough for a worker to survive, the capitalist will give me only 5$ and keep 15$ as profit, because that's the aim in capitalism: making profit.
So in the end a worker in capitalism gets enough money to survive, so it's effectively no different from slavery, except that you can choose who enslaves you.

And why do those means of production belong to some person in the first place? Because sometime in the past they stole it, and now they use it to steal more from the people.

That's a bit of a simplified view and in modern western capitalisms it's not so obvious because those systems are more complex.
But in third world countries it's pretty clear how capitalism effectively enslaves people (even children).

In our western capitalism we don't have child labour, and depending on the country we have relatively good working hours (compared to third world countries) or social security systems that don't directly force people into work (as explained using the comparison to slavery).

But that's not capitalism; social security systems, relatively good salaries and working hours are the success of workers movements and strong unions in the past. Without these movements the broad population would not have the standard of living it has nowadays.

And because of these movements the capitalists had to accept those things that repel pure capitalism in some areas. And that's why there's propaganda against immigration, because if people from Africa just could come to Europe they would have to get the same higher wages and that's not something that capitalists want (because that cuts their profits).
They have to give these things in western societies because there was pressure from the streets, so better to give the raging mob something than to risk loosing capitalism alltogether, right? And in third world countries we can still exploit the people properly, yeah!

And now they are trying to take those advancements previous generations have fought for away again, because unions are weak all over europe, this weakness has to be exploited: the euro crisis is used to force austerity programs over european countries, cutting social benefits, enforcing higher working hours, lower wages, ...

t5_2qqlo,"Actually, Napoleon invaded Russia not to conquer it, but because it violated the Treaty of Tilsit by engaging in trade with the UK, and then, more importantly, planning an offensive war (invasion) of Warsaw and Danzig, which were Napoleon's allies. Napoleon then invaded not to occupy the country, but simply to force another peace treaty. He invaded with the largest army ever assembled in European history, hoping to force a large, decisive battle that would then lead to peace. Unfortunately, the Russians didn't play along and because of Napoleon's unwillingness to cut and run, his army starved and froze to death, changing the course of history. 
The truth is, the only reason Napoleon ever invaded a country (Russia, Spain, Egypt) was to undermine British authority. His ultimate goal was not to take over the world, but simply defeat France's ancient foe--Britain. All the other so-called ""Napoleonic Wars"" were wars of defense on Napoleon's part, usually funded or instigated by the UK. By winning these wars through military genius, he took war indemnities in terms of money, men, and the land that became the French Empire, buffer states, and client kingdoms. 
Again, Napoleon knew that he could never control, conquer or make Russia part of the French Empire, like he had other lands (it was just too big) he was just trying to force peace, ironically, through war.

t5_2sxbf,"To facilitate our eastward progression it will be essential to develop a support network, organized and disorganized.  The term coined for this network is the ""Railroad.""  The Railroad could be made of individuals, organized groups of individuals, businesses, occupations, and organizations that are sympathetic to our cause.  Railroad participation could be on a local, state, or national level, who knows.  I've heard of occupations getting free software from Europe.  The railroad could provide the march with campsites on front lawns, permits, route information, and resources, such as cash, food, and more.  In return marchers can provide teach-ins, support for local rallies, and provide man power for community service acts.  

Camps being broken down into groups of approximately 100 individuals will allow for flexibility in many areas.  March order/chalks and dispersed campsites, resulting in less disruption to environments, are just two advantages.  The Executive Council (XC) will help coordinate physical movement activities and resting points.  Each camp will have a kitchen, sanitation, and waste disposal facilities.  Currently, Army Field Sanitation standards are being considered as a baseline to build from.  We are also looking into how the Rainbow Family does their thing as another way to build a baseline.  

Plans are in the works for a ""Citizens College"" which will be similar to a direct action committee but will have a different interaction process with march level representation.

An example would be say getting a job in Google, Microsoft, or Cisco that has a branch in Thailand.

You should also keep in mind that the salary you may be used to earning back home is going be a lot different in Thailand. Possibly a lot less, considering that you have the locals to compete with.

t5_2qh1i,"We were supposed to slip in, collect our data - and maybe a few useful artifacts - and slip away just as stealthily as we had arrived. Uninvited and unwelcome, our group circulated through the one-level home like white blood cells hunting for infection, each of us under deadline to complete our tasks; our little piece of the scientific puzzle. None of us had ever been there before, but it had the homey, familiar atmosphere we had all been trained to expect. It was a rambler style home, with a central living room, a small kitchen, a den and a laundry room. The bedrooms, which we did not investigate, were in the basement. The living room, which reeked of canine and tobacco, was full of sentimental curios: a statuette of the chubby Budai, a few matching glass ashtrays, an old cathode ray tube television in the corner, an ornate ceramic crucifix above a hutch full of fine china. The carpet was shag and green, thatched with dog hairs, and the furniture in need of re-upholstery. The ceiling was flat and low, and there was a big picture window, framed with nicotine-stained yellow curtains, facing the rear of the house. There were a mix of anachronistic architectural and interior styles, ranging from the art-deco lintels girding the ceiling, to a modernist sun-ray clock on the far wall with sixteen stations, its numbers strange. It was a lower-middle-class domicile, no more elegant than its owner could afford. And it gave the feeling of living in comfortable poorness.

All of the science team wore paper masks, making them look very cautious and secretive. I was the only one not wearing a mask; was the only one who wouldn't need one.

“This is amazing,” sighed one of the technicians. “Isn't it?”

“Sure is,” I answered with as much wonder as I could inject into the tone of my voice. “One for the record books.”

“The binary systems don't work here. The lepton valences are too tight to pass current.”

“That's fascinating,” I demurred, earning me a sharp look.

“It can't be good, whatever it is,” the senior engineer replied. “Fire up the light banks.”

As soon as we had arrived, a weird barking like a cross between a goose and an elephant had risen from the basement. We absolutely could not risk being discovered, and for many more reasons than the obvious. The technician dispatched to handle the threat had returned with a bitten hand, but the barking had stopped. He was shaken by what he had seen, and warned the rest of us not to go down there under any circumstances. Normally, such an interdiction would only invite curiosity. But we all knew the drill: avoid too many quondam displacements and concentrate on the work. We couldn't afford to lose precious time equivocating on how familiar and how strange this place seemed. It was a trap out of which there was no exit. I still couldn't shake the sense that I knew this place, which, of course, was impossible. As the psychologists had trained us to expect, the feeling of deja vu was only a manifestation of the Gestalt law of similarity. Everything could be expected to be out of place, the usual frames of reference we drew from our normal environments so radically displaced  that we would latch onto any sense of familiarity or deja vu in order to avoid going into psychological shock. I drew a measure of comfort from knowing that everyone in the project was experiencing the same degree of disorientation. We were like rats, thrust into a maze too difficult to navigate. Like those rats, we all risked going into a catatonic state, eventually refusing to go on.  In short, our brains, caught in an alien environment, were simply trying to make sensible connections out of the indiscernable. It was an impossible task, because our quantum makeup was utterly alien to this place. The quarks, gluons and leptons that made up the solidity of our bodies were unstable in this reality, limiting the length of our exposure to this world and putting us all at risk for sudden mental illness or complete madness.  And if you think about it too long, you just get yourself tied up in knots. I tried to put it out of mind, because lurking just below that sensation was the reality that reality itself was jumbled together. I was afraid if I looked too close I would realize that everything was radically out of place. People had gone into psychological shock because of this phenomenon, unable to orient themselves to the strangeness, running headlong down an endless path toward madness. Myself, I had absolutely no trouble performing my role without succumbing to the pareidolia The fact was that none of us belonged there. Strange that such an obvious statement was also a scientific certainty. But in addition to that, I was unsettled by the feeling that our presence was wrong, that simply by being there we were violating some basic principle of existence.

The first notable displacement was a lack of any technology advanced beyond the transistor stage. No wireless networks in a ten mile radius, no quantum computing of any kind, not even a tablet or a laptop. It was as if time in this particular house had frozen during the early 1970's and been mixed together with various styles from the early 20th century. The appliances in the kitchen were solid state, the clock was analog, the radio functioned with miniature vacuum tubes, and the microwave, we were quite certain, was a rudimentary design that emitted trace x-rays.

Except for the technicians who had arrived before us, the house had been empty when we emerged through the wall in the gloomy den. We wasted no time in setting up our equipment, for there was little of it to spare. Our lead technician, Pavel Shkradnolov, had already set up the wireless transtator and connected the emitters through the computer mainframe. One of the techs handed me a tablet upon my arrival. I could not read most of it, as it was, I suppose, a germane mix of base code and quantum formulae. I handed it back to him. I did not need to know such things. That was not my job. I just nodded dispassionately and handed it back to him.

The mechanics team leader, Francis Forsman, had lit up the air outside the portal leading to the kitchen with real-time statistics, telemetry data, and a countdown in large numerals. He turned to me with a look of panic on his face.

“We're almost too late! We'll barely have time to set up the entaglement field.”

“I take it no one is home,” I asked him.

“Not yet,” said Frank. “But we need as much information as we can get.”

“Explain to me again how you zero in on these people.”

“The maths are a little complicated Serge,” Forsman replied. “And it obviously didn't work, did it?”

“Are we in the right alternity?”

“Yes, we're in the right alternity! But we were supposed to home in on the subatomic signature of a particle collider. We've arrived in some poor sod's living room”

Same as always, I thought, giving myself a bracing dose of cynicism.

When the detectors set off the perimeter alarm, we all jumped  into place. When the red warning lights painted the walls, everyone froze. It was like preparing for a surprise party, the surprisee in store for more than he bargained. As soon as the door opened, I reached my forearm around the jamb and collared someone by the neck. A sack of groceries spilled inside. Soup cans, frozen dinners, dog treats, detergent and bandages and a carton of cigarettes, among other things. He wasn't a small man, so when he wrested out of my headlock I was forced to spin him around over my leg and flip him onto his back. The techs slammed the door shut before he could open his eyes and see what we had done to his home. I was kneeling on his groin with the heel of one palm on his solar plexus, and the other arm over his windpipe.

One of the scientists kneeled down next to the poor man, scribbling and ticking on his tablet, recording body proportions, skin temperature, brain waves and muscle tension.

He did not look like any human I had ever before seen. Two eyes too close together to look normal, a long, thin nose, a narrow mouth. He had big round ears sticking out from a mop of bushy hair. He would have been caucasian back home, but the proportions of his face were too thin, too horse-like to look European.

He started burbling disconsolately.

“We are here to help you,” I told him.

He thrashed his legs around under mine, and I applied more force to the nerve bundles just below his solar plexus. His eyes bulged, darting all around the room. I pressed the edge of my hand hard beneath his nose, eliciting a whine.

The technician with the biopad averted his eyes. Apparently his idea of passive submission was different than mine. Fine, because, unknown to the rest of them, I had been on these unholy excursions before. This rumpled tech most certainly had not.

After a long minute, he seemed to get the message, and calmed down.

I tried to hold his gaze, steepling my eyebrows in a calculated, sympathetic expression. I spoke in a calm, high voice.

“We are here for something important,” I told him. “All right?”

He looked me square in the eyes. I could see the horror crashing around in his head. His too-thin head and bulbous ears were revolting to me. I knew this man was a person just like the rest of us, with a job, responsibilities, loved ones. Consciously I knew that he deserved more dignity than I was allowing him. But my head screamed that he was an abomination, looking like a severely handicapped mental patient. This kind of person could not exist in my reality, not in any meaningful or productive way. Some part of me insisted that he deserved the treatment I was giving him, and no better.

“We probably look just as strange to him as he does to us,” said the tech feebly.

I just squinted at the medic. Sure. He was right.

t5_2qh9a,"clipped from article:Ignoring the sound of gunfire encapsulates the world's reaction to the atrocities in Syria to date. As so often, leaders who have said ""never again"" after the last genocide do nothing to prevent the next. But perhaps their indifference won't last. The ferocity of the regime's violence has pushed the Syrian National Council, an umbrella group for much of the opposition, from calling for civil disobedience and passive resistance to begging for outside help. As Ammar Abdulhamid, a Syrian dissident, put it to me: ""In the fight of tanks against bare chests, the odds are not exactly even and bravery can only get you so far."" The Syrian incarnation of the ""Arab Street"" we used to hear so much about now wants Nato planes in the skies.

Turkey has gone from being Assad's ally to his enemy and is talking of regime-change. The French foreign minister has called for Nato troops to protect relief workers. Syrian opposition leaders are discreetly trying to persuade sympathisers in the Obama administration to support the revolution.

The motives of foreign powers are not entirely humanitarian. The reason why is best explained by Michael Weiss, a remarkable man who is worth a column in himself. He is a combative and unstoppably talkative New York intellectual with a loathing for totalitarians and their apologists in whatever form they come. Somehow, he ended up in the London offices of the Henry Jackson Society. The pro-democracy thinktank does much serious work but even its best friends would say that it is not always at the forefront of global political debate.

From this backwater, Weiss compiled a report (http://www.henryjacksonsociety.org/content.asp?pageid=35) on how American, British and French air power might combine with Turkish ground forces to create a safe haven in northern Syria, where mutinous troops from the Syrian army could build a fighting force. Nato officials have studied it, while Burhan Ghalioun, chairman of the Syrian National Council, described the report as a ""crucial resource for understanding how a humanitarian intervention in Syria can still be carried out responsibly"". When I asked why a weary world should bother to help the Syrians, Weiss quoted from Czeslaw Milosz's ""Child of Europe"", one of the greatest satires of the fascist and communist era. The supporters of dictatorship, Milosz says, must:

    Learn to predict a fire with unerring precision
    Then burn the house down to fulfil the prediction.

The lazy talk about the Middle East being a unified ""Arab world"" or a part of a unified ""Muslim world"" ignores the real divisions. The region is a mess of competing sectarian and ethnic interests. In Syria, they have combined to produce an apartheid state, in which Assad's Alawite Shia minority controls the police, army and intelligence agencies. The first weeks of the revolution were joyously anti-sectarian as the Syrian National Council refused to become a weapon for the avenging Sunni majority.

To beat the opposition and survive, Assad has to play his equivalent of the race card. He has to rally the support of his tribe by telling the Allawite and Christian minorities that they must unite behind him or face extermination. To make certain his prediction comes true he burns down the house just to make sure. He is organising the sectarian cleansing of Sunni neighbourhoods and trying to turn his desperate bid to hold on to power into a Sunni-Shia civil war.

As in the Spanish civil war, when Britain and France preached non-intervention while Hitler and Mussolini sent arms and men to help Franco's fascists, so the ""international community"" does nothing in Syria today while Iran and Hezbollah pour in Shia troops to slaughter civilians. Contrary to Syrian state propaganda, Sunni terrorists from al-Qaida are not in Syria to fight back against the regime just yet. But I cannot see them staying out for long.

Intervention to stop a regional war carries vast risks. But we should be honest about the consequences of acquiescing to Assad. A failed state and nest for terrorism will sit on the edge of the Mediterranean. Foreign mercenaries and Alawite paramilitaries will continue to massacre a largely defenceless population and the conflict may spread into Iraq, Israel, Turkey and Jordan. As the news that escapes the control of the Syrian censors reminds us every day, those who say we should do nothing also have blood on their hands.Comments will be switched on at 11am [ read more at link]",t3_nyebb,1325402825,0,False,t1_c3cwv08,,True,worldpolitics,t3_nyebb,False,1428105982,1,0,WendyWyatt,0,,c3cwv08,,1
t5_2cneq,"It would take a book to adequately address this question. I'll just briefly focus on the education issue, since it's one of the ones you mentioned.

Ron Paul represents an essentially *free market* standpoint. It's true that northern Europe has a better education system than we do, but it's because it's actually *more free market* than ours. 

In both the US and the countries you've named, primary and secondary education is free for all students who wish to attend. However, in the US, there is virtually no school choice at all. You must go to the school assigned to your district, based on where you live. As far as I understand it, this is not true in most European countries. European students and their parents are actually able to choose which school they attend. The mechanism of choice is a free market mechanism that allows better schools to be rewarded with more students (and thus more money), while the worse schools are punished because fewer students want to go to them. It creates an incentive for the schools to improve that does not exist without school choice. If anything, the relative success of education in northern Europe as compared to the US actually *supports* Ron Paul's free market position.

An entire case in the supreme court could be based on what you call 'he-said-she-said', with less evidence than is being presented here.

Precisely how much more evidence from various impartial persons and/or highly educated experts on various subjects with will it actually take for you to accept the FA's decision?

In many previous posts [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/mfv48/one_word_with_many_meanings_cnn_suarez_v_evra/c30o8go) [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/mfv48/one_word_with_many_meanings_cnn_suarez_v_evra/c30ls3e) [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/mfv48/one_word_with_many_meanings_cnn_suarez_v_evra/c30nnmt) you either claimed or perpetuated the notion that the words which he chose to use, words which would be considered in almost all European languages as racist, were just a cultural misunderstanding; despite the fact that two independent experts were bought in the case who have been studying linguistics for decades have informed the FA that there was no way the word was used in a non-racially derogatory way. 

&gt;In our judgment, Mr Suarez's use of the term [negro] was not intended as an attempt at conciliation or to establish rapport; neither was it meant in a conciliatory and friendly way.

Your room is small, but it's easy to fit five+people in one room at any given time, and most of your time on ship will probably be spent in classes, at meals, or hanging out on deck somewhere (or at least mine was.)  Additionally, most of the time you're out in port exploring, coming back in only for meals and sleeping.  

-it was as safe as anything I could imagine.  You do have the option to go exploring for yourself, and that can be as risky or as safe as you make it.  But most of the time you'll be with friends, and that's safe as can be, and if you're really worried, you can go exclusively on SAS-sanctioned trips which will make sure you get home safe and sound.

-the only time the water was really rough was on large open-water crossings, especially around cape horn and crossing the pacific.  If you went on a voyage that focused on South America or Europe, you'd avoid most of that.  A lot of people got sick, but most got over it within the first couple of weeks.  Even my friend who could never get her sea legs managed to get along.  The biggest swells we saw were 20 feet, crossing from Japan to hawaii.  I'd consider it a worthwile sacrifice.

-The classes are pretty general ed.  There are business and literature courses and other globally-focused humanities, but there's very few hard sciences.  Sometimes they'll offer voyages with a theme for Engineering or such, but they don't really have any science classes that aren't marine biology, because there's no room for a lab on board.  That just means that you should do it earlier in your university career, if you still can.

-The money is the biggest hurdle for most people.  I paid for it by being on scholarship at my university and being a spoiled brat at the mercy of my parents.  I don't know anyone who said they regretted the financial sacrifice.  The thing about it is that even though it might cost you a significant amount of money, it gives you the truly valuable motivation and experience that very few other experiences could give you, and that most employers will value.

I played two games  of HoN but didn't really want to relearn all the DotA items and found the graphics TERRIBLE. I downloaded LoL sometime during my Senior year, soon after it had been released into Open Beta. That was like three years ago. All I can say now thank God I'm in the US now and my ping is 50-100 instead of 280-450. Playing with 300+ Ping is a really, really bad idea. 

TL;DR: Played DotA, tried HoN, thought it sucked, played LoL, decided it didn't suck. :D",t3_nxyfj,1325409605,0,False,t1_c3cxf25,,True,leagueoflegends,t3_nxyfj,False,1428106224,1,0,toastymow,0,,c3cxf25,01 team,1

t5_2qh41,"Speaking as someone who has been to every populated continent, I enjoy Africa and Asia significantly more than Europe and South America, but there are different stokes for different folks.  Europe is basically liberal, less ignorant America, with a few thousand extra years of history.  Latin America is Spanish America, if it were still the developing world, and crossed with Europe.  Africa and Asia are entirely new worlds.  The cultures have next to no similarities to the social norms you know, and the challenge and surprising joy of being able to get along in a country where most signs don't even have the same alphabet as english is exhilarating (that only really applies to Asia, and places like Greece/Russia, but in Africa, you'll see different ways of using westernized languages.  One thing that kind of exemplifies Africa to me is ""in America, you have watches.  In Africa, we have time"")

I can tell you that my favorite countries are Spain/Italy, Vietnam, South Africa, and Japan, for their landscapes, people, culture, and/or way of life (Sometimes despite crippling social problems, as in South Africa.)

Another thing to consider is that Africa and Asia are difficult and expensive to access via ""traditional"" travel, with the average plane ticket averaging 1500+ dollars, versus 8-900 for Europe, or 300-800 for South America.  Additionally, I've found Europe significantly easier to travel on my own- they're used to Americans there, whereas China and such are a bit more difficult to get around in without prior experience or local guides (this especially holds true in Africa).

But most important of all is to go where intrigues you.  I've never been particularly interested in medieval history, but I've been fascinated by eastern religion and culture, and I've been pretty apathetic towards South American history for most of my life.  My interest in all of these places has surged tenfold since visiting, and now I feel a lot more knowledgeable about them, but you'll be able to get more out of a place if you already understand or want to understand some of its history, traditions, or culture.

t5_2stfn,"That's never happened in Europe, there was a trial about using the GRU I think, I remember looking forward to it because my team had a really good heavy. 

As for replacing scouts with heavys, it would work on some maps but not others. Granary would be an awful map due to the massive advantage that soldiers have. I would also be inclined to switch out a soldier instead of a scout at mid fights. The reason is two fold: firstly, scouts are neccessary to protect the demo and I don't think that a GRU heavy gets to mid at the same time a scout does (120% speed vs. 100%). Therefore the scout and demo would have to play passively (or the demo be extremely quick all the time) in order to survive. At mid fights the demo needs to exert his presence and not have to worry about scouts; the demo can make or break a mid before the combo gets there.

Secondly, during the mid fight everyone on the team gets damaged. Imagine that you did swap a scout for a heavy, your team would look like this:

**Scout** - 125 *(185)*

**Heavy** - 300 *(450)*

**Soldier** - 200 *(300)*

**Soldier** - 200 *(300)*

**Demo** - 175 *(260)*

The first thing you should notice is that you now have four heavy classes instead of three, this increases the amount of health that the medic has to heal from 860 to 1310. This makes it harder for the medic to keep people at reasonable health, let alone overheal them. Furthermore, it increases the chance that someone will have to be sacraficed so that the medic can keep the demo alive. 

Assuming that you do win the mid fight, your push could be slowed because a heavy on his own is vulnerable to being ambushed by scouts due to the spin up time of the minigun, if he did go down then you have lost a player which makes it harder to push. Assuming that you did swap out a scout for a heavy then it could hinder the push onto second. Badlands spire springs into mind; it is hard to cap it with just one scout, the heavy wouldn't be as useful as a scout on this point, plus the time that he would take to get anywhere. 

I doubt that it would have lasted even if the GRU were allowed, of course that is map dependent, and I am talking about it from a European outlook.

t5_2qh2u,"&gt;I don't think Japan should be aiming to emulate the tax structure of Europe, especially when you consider the dramatic differences in gov't services between much of the EU and the meager services provided (in comparison) by Japan.

Well look, Japan has bigger outlays than any of those countries, as can be seen by the fact that they have a much higher debt to GDP ratio (200%+) than any of them. You note that they have meager services in comparison, so you may wonder how this can possibly be so; if they're not spending the money on better services, why is the debt so high?

While I don't doubt that there are many places to trim fat, one of the main contributors is that fact that taxes are considerably lower in Japan; low income contributes to debt just as much as high outlays. Like it or not, it's high time Japan brought its taxes in line with its spending.

&gt;I don't think you understood what I wrote/meant. In many countries (USA for example) small business is one of the big factors that drives employment and innovation. Exceedingly high corporate tax levels, high fees, and crazy amounts of regulation make it much more difficult to set up a business here.

Your points about regulation, etc are taken, but I was proposing tax increases for higher (personal) income brackets, nothing more.

t5_2t011,"Name: Holden Moskalenko

Height: 6'0""

Weight: 235 lbs.

Physical Description: 

Holden Moskalenko is third generation Canadian from a Ukranian background.
He has short blonde hair and green eyes. He frequently has a light layer of stubble and bags under his eyes. 

He's modelled his physique after former ECW and WWE wrestler Rob Van Dam. He's of the same height and weight but not nearly as muscular. He's able to maneuver around the ring with agility and speed. However, he capitalizes on holds, slams and suplexes over high risk spots. However, he does throw in the occasional top rope elbow drop to pander to extremists.

Description of style and attire: 

Moskalenko wrestles in black biker shorts, black elbow pads, black knee pads and big black boots.  On the back of his trunks are three white ""X""s. These ""X""s also appear on his right elbow pad, his left knee pad and on the back of his signature black hoodie. These ""X""s signify targets. The ones on his pads are for signature manuevers. And the target on his back signifies his paranoia.
Moskalenko is an avid music fan. At larger live events, he tries to recruit a local band to play his theme music. He frequently appears to have lost sleep due to his habit of going out and seeking ""The Next Big Thing"" in the local music scene after events. As a face, he leads sing-alongs to the ""Whoa-oa-oa!"" bridge of his theme music and allows audience members to finish his catchphrase. He jumps into the crowd after victories and kisses the foreheads of females in the front row. As a heel, he is paranoid of the success of others. From observing the music scene, he's afraid that some new up-and-comer will take his ""rightful"" place on top. He feels the target on his back is not metaphorical.

t5_2r9vp,"Lol. Thanks for the upboat:

Some clarification:

Portgual *decriminalised personal amounts* of all drugs. 

This means that **all the drugs are still illegal**, but that if you are caught with a small amount you cannot be sentenced to jail - you only get a fine and probably no criminal record. However if you have a larger amount, or if you are caught selling them, then you are still considered a dangerous criminal and could go to jail and you will get a criminal record.

This has helped A LOT: Portugal went from having the nearly worst heroin problem in Europe to the least bad; usage of cocaine and methamphetamine is down. Use of cannabis by minors is down, but in adults it is up (very slightly). Less people are in jail, more people are in treatment, more people are productive members of society.

(Mexico did the same thing in 2010, but they're still fighting the cartels so any good they could do by decriminalising drugs is overshadowed by the 40,000+ people who've died in the last 4 years or so.)

This is a step (or three) in the right direction, however it's not what i'm suggesting. I want to actually *legalise* all illicit drugs and set up perfectly legal ways to obtain them (but strictly controlled for some of the more dangerous drugs) so that people don't have to deal with criminals, and become criminals by using drugs. If we did this, the black market for drugs would just about disappear. 

Please note that just because I want drugs to be legal doesn't mean I think they should be sold at 7/11 to 12-year-olds or anything like that.

The US congress does not have the legal authority to violate the Constitution at will, which it did twice over. The Constitution requires a declaration of war, and the 5th Amendment declares:

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

&gt; The counterargument is that Afghanistan was harboring terrorists. It is not clear cut that aggression is unwarranted in that case. This is certainly not clear cut.

No due effort or good faith was exercised in exhausting diplomatic negotiations, nor even close to it. The military started ramping up for war before it was even sure which country to target, and many powerful diplomats and generals argued against even asking the Taliban to hand over OBL as it would betray weakness in their eyes. It *is* clear cut that the US invasion of Aghanistan was aggression. Only the blind deny the sun.

t5_2qm4e,"&gt;Question 1) How do we know this? 

Tool sets.
[Mousterian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousterian) tools were used by Neanderthals and are quite distinctive. 

[Homo sapiens use Aurignacian.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurignacian).  All Neanderthal usage of Aurignacian appears after anatomically modern humans appear in Europe.

&gt;**How do we know neanderthals died out** as opposed to being absorbed by the dominant and more successful breed? This seems far more likely on its face to me. 

Well to answer that first part - because they're all dead.  Moreover, the genomic contribution of Neanderthals to the European genome is pretty small.  As to what happened to them, we dunno. Obviously there was some interbreeding, but for a 4% contribution of European genomic DNA, that doesn't really tell us how widespread it is.  We'd still have to know what % of DNA the Paleolithic humans contribute to modern European DNA (as opposed to Neolithic farmers from the Fertile Crescent that moved into the area after the last glacial maximum.) 

But, iirc, there was a paper not too long ago that claimed that the previously speculated Neolithic intrusion into Europe wasn't as bad as previously thought and most Europeans can be traced back to Paleolithic populations.  In which case, Neanderthals were probably still out-competed and/or killed as opposed to being absorbed wholescale. 

edit: a quick google finds this article:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20087410
That says that them paleolithic folks got their genetic asses handed to them by neolithic folks.  So if that were true, the 4% contribution to modern European genomes doesn't really tell us much.

But Wikipedia:

t5_2qh2p,"&gt; The US congress does not have the legal authority to violate the Constitution at will, which it did twice over.

As you probably know, the intervention in Afghanistan was not classified as a war - probably for this very reason. The legality of this is up for debate - that is my entire point. I'm afraid lawyers can be found that will argue any side of any issue. 

As to Congress, as I said before: vote them out or run for office. The only revolution conceivable in the US will have to go through the voting booth.

&gt; It is clear cut that the US invasion of Aghanistan was aggression.

For sure, and it is a straw man to suggest that anyone would deny *that*. The question is whether it was *unwarranted* aggression.

&gt; There is no scheme, only the natural evolution of power. The US and Europe hold half the world's wealth about evenly between them. It is a fact of nature that the rich act to exploit the poor.

I feel it is illogical to postulate that the rich and powerful would do something as far-reaching as starting wars for profit. This assumes these people are short-term thinkers. If anything, wars are disruptive -- the current sad state of the US economy is in no small part due to the enormous costs of waging decade-long wars. If anything, I would feel that the rich seek to not rock the boat.

Then again -- I am neither rich nor powerful.

t5_2qjto,"&gt; What do you guys even argue about, politically?

There are a wide range of political beliefs in Denmark, including the belief that Denmark would be better off if it was like USA. Before our change of government a couple of months ago, we had 10 years of rule by political parties which are supported by big (although not USA big) corporate sponsorships, which want to lower taxes for the rich and which want to break down universal health care and replace it with a system like in USA.

&gt; Does the rest of the world seem batshit crazy to you?

The rest of the world? No. USA? Most definitely. Not only USA, but since that's where you're from, that's what I'll mention hre. Everything from your two-party system with a representational representational democracy that makes sure to waste as many votes as possible, where the two parties would both belong on the [edit: Danish] right wing, with oh so very obvious nutcases such as Palin or Bachmann to your extreme religiousness and your blind belief that USA is the best country in the world, thinking that being patriotic is a positive thing, to the fact that you just leave poor people to die - and the fact that you have such a huge amount of poor people, despite being so rich on average. There's also that you allow people to drive a car when they're 16 years old but won't let them have a beer or gamble till they're 21. Your sick, sick justice system also springs to mind, with death penalty and things like a sex offender registry, and related to that the fact that you have for-profit prisons that strive to make as many people criminal as possible, as it would increase their profits. I don't even know where to stop, so I'll just stop here.

&gt; What major problems are left in your society to solve?

If we have any major problems, it would be economy. But due to globalisation, it's also the one thing we have the least control of. Our biggest challenge right now is avoiding that the global banking crisis drags us down as well.

Secondarily I would say big company lobbying and special interest groups. EU makes it easy for lobbyists to buy laws, and for every year it becomes more and more like USA that way.

With respect to Wall Street, It seems fairly clear to me that while our Congress is sociopathic, that the scions of Wall Street take that sociopathy/psychopathy to an entirely different level, such that it's not entirely clear to me , that Goldman-Sacks' and their aligned interests on WS, aren't in charge of financial policy making in this nation.  So while we still retain the semblance of a representative government, that in theory could regulate the marketplace, it seems more likely that's not [going to occur](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089/)

With respect to the President's views on drug legalization, for me it's a non-issue, I don't smoke or drink, but I do feel that legalization of marijuana is a productive idea, for two reasons. Legalization and pharmacological regulation of cocaine would be potentially helpful as well. 

1. It defunds the vast majority of drug money coming into the country and crashes the economic structures of the drug cartels.
2. This in turn helps to stabilize the government and society of Mexico and other countries along the drug supply chain.
3. It allows us to tax and regulate these market-spaces, AND allows us to refocus our economic priorities away from militarization of our government.

Which brings me to the great disappointment of the Obama administration, which you correctly point out, is a major problem, the rampant support, tolerance or disregard for corporatist legal maneuvering and related designs on our civil rights as citizens.

As I pointed out in my original post - however, I am fascinated by the question of to what extent is the more totalitarian tendencies of corporatism, inherent to our republic at this time. 

With respect to the people of the United States, I think by and large Winston Churchill hit the nail on the head, when he said that ""Americans never fail to do whats right.....after all other options have been exhausted"".

The question one can ask is how long it will be until we start getting our house in order. Personally I suspect that the EU and or Japan/China/Korea will simply start to move along, rather than wait for the US. 

Ultimately, I think that shortsightedness of our political class, will lead to a major reformation of the US political process is in the offering, when US firms start to be dominated by their European and Asian counterparts, technologically or from a manufacturing perspective, politicians will be forced to make sensible policy. 

Some policy decisions have been SO horrifically counterproductive that many Americans really have stood up and taken notice.

If not, I would like to point you to all the current labor laws. Those are there because unregulated industry decided that people are interchangable parts. 

As for prices rising, isn't that a natural occurence ? Didn't the value of money change even when the dollar was pegged to gold? Consider this, the total market for gold changes based on the supply of gold. So instead of a nation controlling the rate of inflation, that rate would be controlled by any gold-consuming entity. 
Everyone can mine for gold, theres plenty of it. Its a common element with industrial value. So then the value of gold ,and thus money pegged to it, will fluctuate as the industry and gold supply does.

Anyways, your contention seems more reactionary than anything based on valid observation. Your statement that ""prices rise in every industry that the government gets involved with"" seems fool hardy and even duplicitous, perhaps attempting to garner some sort of negative response from me or others.

t5_2qh13,"Actually a lot of it is  what racism is all about.

EG: Take the black vs. white. Those of African linage are born with traits brought on by evolving in a massive and very sunlit continent. They are born with dark skin to ward off UV radiation, very tall to see far in a plain and jungle environment, and a natural ability to run vast distances. Those of European linage are marked by light skin (no need for all that protective pigmentation), more body fat (protection from the colder climes), and a natural tactical mind (because unlike the Africans of the time, the Europeans were already in the habit of killing each other off). The Africans, BTW, were the *only* race that managed to keep its dick in its pants and stay ""pure"". Everyone else discovered and proceeded to fuck the Neanderthals out of existence.  

Now to actually point out these facts, that the various races are as different as the race stats in a DnD manual is considered to be very racist in itself. But in the great melting pot it is the Africans who are the track stars, the football stars, the basketball stars, while it is the Europeans who are the computer program writers, the tacticians, the accountants. 

(Yes, there is racism involved in all that, but in this case it is beside the point. Please listen further.) 

There is a distinct evolutionary reason that despite racists generals putting them in direct line of fire, in WW2 it was the black troops who made the most kills with the least losses [even when flying airplanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen). They evolved in some of the most hostile environments encountered by early man. They were the prey as often as the hunter whereas all the other races had it comparatively cushy. All of this turns the average African into a natural can of whoop ass making Mike Tyson, and Shaq types much more prevalent in the race than the Steve Urkle types.

Now swing to the other side of the spectrum.

The Asians are arguably the brains of the human species. Having not only invented gunpowder centuries before anyone else realized that something other than wood could burn, but also the smarts not to use it for weaponry. This is an ability bread from constantly having to outsmart volcanoes, earthquakes, typhoons, and the strange urge to canoe across 3000 miles of ocean. What an your average Asian lacks in size, he/she makes up for in raw analytical powers and intellectual prowess. This is why Asian combat techniques are such one does not need to posses great body strength to master an opponent. Where as a black man (or even a white man, for that matter) may pick you up and hurl you across a room, with a seeming flick of the wrist, the Asian would have you do all the hard work for him.  

In today's world the Asian is the electronics expert and the economizer while the African is the Football and Basketball star.


Note that everything I have just said is considered to be extremely racist to even contemplate. But the cold hard truth is that the difference in the races are just like those on the DnD stat sheet.
 And just like in DnD there are those who defy the odds, but most are going to fall within their races bonuses/nerfs in the stats.

And just like in DnD, we send in a warrior (worker), a rouge (the manager), and a mage (the owner/banker) when we need them all. The difference is that in DnD everyone splits the pot equally. In real life the warrior, who is in the most danger, gets the least. The thief, who sells the take and greases the wheels, gets a bit more, and the mage, who may be needed for key bits but is essentially along for the ride, gets a disproportionately large size of the take. 

The warrior (now the African) is thought to be worth less because he is better a swinging a sword than he may be at balancing the checkbook.
That is racism.


TLDR; The act of racism falls not in understanding the advantages or disadvantages of a race, but in thinking any are of more or less value because of those advantages/ disadvantages.  ",t1_c3cz3f3,1325441857,0,False,t1_c3czn2q,,True,worldnews,t3_ntgry,False,1428107340,1,0,Abomonog,0,,c3czn2q,,1

t5_2qh68,"There are two very different sides to this debate. One is the enviromental, and the other is economic. Unfortunately, most mainstream discussion completely misses the point on both of these topics. The enviromental groups focus on the very small part of the extraction that is surface mining, but this is neither the most important nor even the most damaging part of extraction. Water and power use are what make the oil sands such heavy greenhouse emitters, and the regulations on those are relatively minor since people are so obsessed with a small section of forest being maimed.

In terms of economics, it is absolutely vital that we extract as much of this resource as quickly as possible, since the estimated lifespan of it even with rapid increases in production (see my other comment) means that it is entirely possible that oil refined from the tar sands will no longer become nearly as economical or valuable in the next century. However, this comes with the caveat that said extraction should be giving back more to Albertans. The current royalty scheme is pretty much a joke unfortunately.

As to the 'ethical oil' debate you hint at, it's important to keep in mind Canada is still the number one external provider of crude for American markets. I think it's a fools errand to think you can possibly hurt the dictators in the wallet with Canadian oil of course; if the US doesn't import it you can be damned sure Europe or China willl.

t5_2qh2p,"&gt;If I may restate your point as what I think you are saying; you are claiming that a raciest is by definition neither logical nor reasonable, and therefor his words and actions cannot be accepted as reasonable or logical. Please correct me if this is not what you are arguing.

Yes, that is the case.

&gt;I would disagree with your position (as I have stated it above) simply because one can be reasonable in some things but not in others. Ben Franklin believed in a god (deism, so minimalist, but god nonetheless) but he invented many useful things, and discovered electricity.

Franklin may have believed in a god, but every choice he made was not as a result of that belief.

*Everything* Lovecraft was and did was built around his racism. It was as much a part of him as the hair on his head and the teeth in his mouth. His entire ego was fortified in his own mind because of his belief that he and his genetic fore bearers from Europe were superior to all other races.

Comparing Franklin and Lovecraft in this way doesn't cut it, in my opinion. I see the point you're trying to make, but I cannot understand it.

&gt;Lovecraft, while astonishingly racist, even for his time, was clearly capable of interesting thoughts. I see no reason to dispose of his useful thoughts along with his useless and/or harmful ones. After all, the man who wrote ""all men are created equal"" also owned slaves, and had children by one of them. While there is the ever-so-slight possibility that the slave really did love him unreservedly, it is far more likely that the writer of the Declaration of Independence was a rapist, though he likely never thought it of himself.

You mean the man who borrowed ""All men are created equal"" from one of his neighbors owned slaves. 

&gt;“The great doctrine 'All men are created equal' incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson. A few alleged scholars try to discredit Mazzei as the creator of this statement and idea, saying that ""there is no mention of it anywhere until after the Declaration was published"". This phrase appears in Italian in Mazzei's own hand, written in Italian, several years prior to the writing of the Declaration of Independence. Mazzei and Jefferson often exchanged ideas about true liberty and freedom. No one man can take complete credit for the ideals of American democracy.""

I don't have any good European sites to buy from, but for example:

[Intel i7-2600k 3.4Ghz 4-core](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115070) is $300 (Or roughly, 230 euros.)

Solid mobo to go with that, [Asus P8Z68](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131790) is around $200 (150 euros.)

[8GB of ram](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233170) is $80 (60 euros.)

Either the [EVGA 560Ti](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130604) which comes with a good rebate (Again, not sure you could snag a rebate from Europe) or a tiny bit more (If you can't get the rebate) for this [OC'd 560Ti from EVGA](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130657).

[A nice and beefy power-supply](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006) since your parts will be drawing a good bit of current will run you about 100 euros.

t5_2qzb6,"Hello there, thank you very much for your thought-provoking question.

I'll have to give you a little bit of background. My family and I moved to Italy when I was 3, so all I knew before Ethiopia was Italian life and culture in our (fairly) small town. We flew to England for the summer holidays, but my brother and I only ever saw the UK from a tourist's perspective.

When we (my brother and I) lived there, we and other expatriate children I met were very uncomfortable living in Addis. It's only in retrospective that I'm able to appreciate what a valuable experience it was. Being from other countries of origin (mainly Italy), we were used to certain amenities and comforts that are freely available in a European country, but that seemed like futuristic technologies in Addis. Bearing in mind this was over 10 years ago, I am sure many things have changed since. I'm referring to things as basic as ATM machines, a highway code that was enforced (when I was there, people drove like madmen and pedestrians risked their lives), walking over to your school-friend's house by yourself (without having to cross the city and go through armoured gates and walls), being able to brush your teeth with tap-water... It was a frustrating and difficult environment to adjust to, but it soon became daily life, as with all things.

I never formed any strong friendships in Italy, so moving to Ethiopia wasn't traumatic in that respect. I formed some wonderful friendships in Ethiopia, but was also still subjected to petty schoolyard behaviour, so I don't think my experience would be a far leap from daily life of a kid in the UK.

Ultimately, I was a child. I just went along with what my parents decided, and didn't really know any better. I wasn't world-aware, I didn't really think of life outside my own home and its daily challenges. I don't know if I missed out on things, because I simply wasn't aware that there were things to miss out on. Children are incredibly versatile and adaptive. 

When we moved away from Ethiopia, we moved to the UK. That was a(nother) new experience, it wasn't so much going from Africa to England that was an issue, it was the fact that we moved to an English-speaking country having spoken only Italian, and having very basic and sketchy English lessons. We had to learn the language from scratch and make up for the fact that I 'missed' the 11 years that everyone else had enjoyed. I never went to primary school, or read the same books everyone else did, so I overcompensated by throwing myself in my work, read widely and became aware of influences working around me.

Everyone I've met since, who has also lived, grown up, or at least spent some time in Africa, I have found to be very level-headed, driven, modest, compassionate and determined individuals. They seem to appreciate what's important, let go of the things that are not, and on the whole they tend to be very influential and positive people for those who surround them.

If you are thinking of having children, I think it's helpful to not consider them as helpless babies and the challenges that accompany them. Think of them as individuals, as people, as peers that can affect and change the world around them. Ultimately, you will raise them to have values which you hold dear, and Ethiopia is as good a place as any. Personally, it's made me able to tolerate a lot more discomfort than my UK friends, and made me much more thoughtful as to how my actions may have consequences (be they good or bad).

I wish you luck with anything you embark upon, and a happy new year!

**History &amp; Examples**


* [**Admiralty law**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_law) (also referred to as maritime law) is a distinct body of law which governs maritime questions and offenses. It is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities, and private international law governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, marine navigation, shipping, sailors, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. Admiralty law also covers many commercial activities, although land based or occurring wholly on land, that are maritime in character.
* **[Lex mercatoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_mercatoria)** (from the Latin for ""merchant law"") is the body of commercial law used by merchants throughout Europe during the medieval period. It evolved similar to English common law as a system of custom and best practice, which was enforced through a system of merchant courts along the main trade routes. It functioned as the international law of commerce. It emphasised contractual freedom, alienability of property, while shunning legal technicalities and deciding cases ex aequo et bono. A distinct feature was the reliance by merchants on a legal system developed and administered by them. States or local authorities seldom interfered, and did not interfere a lot in internal domestic trade. Under lex mercatoria, trade flourished and states took in large amounts of taxation.
* [**Medieval Iceland and the Absence of Government** (Free Market Perspective)](http://mises.org/daily/1121)  *""The history of Viking Age Iceland has lessons to teach. One is the importance of a decentralized enforcement power. Iceland's decentralized legal system managed to keep its leaders on a short leash for much of its history. Chieftains only had power if they could convince people to follow them, without the use of coercion. This minimized the principal-agent problem. Who wants to voluntarily follow an incompetent or evil leader? And even if an evil leader did sucker a few free farmers into following him, in the long run he would lose credibility.""*",t1_c3d1vta,1325457866,0,False,t1_c3d1y07,,True,occupywallstreet,t3_nyper,False,1428108422,2,0,JamesCarlin,0,,c3d1y07,,2

t5_2sokd,"A fascinating thread, particularly as the fiat system faces challenges from the excessive use of debt - it seems we are now exploring the far corners of the debt envelope.

A pertinent example is Hungary - with the Euro countries dominating the headlines lately, it has slipped below the radar, but...

it's government has implemented  ""unorthodox"" solutions to its debt problems, few of which have gone down well with the IMF, nor with the money markets. In particular the independence of the Hungarian Central Bank has been compromised. As has been suggested:

""the thing that ""prevents"" the central bank from flooding the economy with money is the deceptively simple fact that you don't let your central bank be run by idiots. The person you put in charge of your central bank is responsible for overseeing the macroeconomics of your country, setting and executing monetary policy, controlling the money supply and influencing the cost of capital to moderate economic growth. You don't give those reins to somebody who doesn't know what he's up to.
•	permalink

 As a result of this the Hungarian Forint has lost value significantly and the debt problem (a large portion of which is denominated in CHF) has only become worse. The last bond sale a few days ago raised less than half of the amount targeted - and that at an interest rate of 9.7%. It is rapidly approaching the point where raising money on the markets will no longer be tenable.

And the IMF and EU have walked out of talks aimed at finding a solution.

So what happens next? Is this the ""perfect storm""? What happens when a country has a hard default? It could be here, it could be elsewhere - but when the money runs out, what happens next?

There is no doubt lots of currency, but as far as international institutions are concerned there might be no money. How does a country still continue in our globalised economy? How does it buy oil - or any other kind of import? Is barter the only answer?

These days it is also the self-entitled douche bags that have been raised in the country lately;l which believe all is theirs, and if you even blink at them its a violation o their rights.

You talk about morals and integrity?  Well, eat your own dog food.  How about some manners along with that integrity?  At no point in time is it appropriate to engage this type of behavior on a public transit system with other passengers around.  It is the equivalent of playing a radio inside the train.

And if you're going out to Williamsburg on the J-train. It was probably the wee-hours of the morning and 400 drinks later, and that cop probably had his limit for the night dealing with drunk douche-bags.

You would rarely see this type of behavior in most places in Europe.  Even so, if it did occur, you would not need the cop to tell the person to stop.  The passengers would most likely tell the person the STFU or GTFO!

Imagine your a waitress and you just worked a 16hrs shift serving all day/night, assholes like the guy singing, and all you want to do is get home and rest.  However, you have to listen to this drunk asshole next to you try and quit his day job for the duration of your 45min ride.

Under no circumstances could a team go by ""Zulu"" or ""Africans"" or ""Black People"" in this country (unless, I guess, if the team were actually made up of Zulu people in the first case). For a variety of reasons we aren't anywhere near as sensitive about Native American issues.

&gt;How is Black People not equivalent to Redskins?

Like you said, ""Black People"" is just a name. I'm kind of baffled that this point is being argued. It's perfectly appropriate to refer to a black person as, well, black. If we elected a Native American president no one would call him ""the first redskin president."" A closer equivalent to Redskins would probably be something like Negroes* (which obviously wouldn't fly).

&gt;could a team be called the Europeans?

Once again you're trying to compare groups that are historically targets of persecution in this country to groups that aren't. It's different.

*in case there are any Redskins fans on here, I understand that this is a major simplification and that there are a lot of unique circumstances regarding the Redskins name (I lived in DC for ~9 years). But the point is that ""Black People"" would be more of an equivalent for ""Native Americans"" than ""Redskins"".",t1_c3d276l,1325460325,0,False,t1_c3d2anj,,True,CFB,t3_nyxmf,False,1428108588,-2,0,sixsevenfiftysix,0,Washington Huskies,c3d2anj,washington,-2

&gt; High ping for every european player. I mainly played Spy and half my kills felt pretty cheap because of that, and also my deaths.

Yeah, that's how the Australian players feel as well.  Unfortunately, there's nothing I can really do about that, short of opening up another server over there, which isn't feasible right now.  Not only do I not have the money for it, I don't think they player base is large enough for it to work.

&gt; Got banned for 1 day because I jokingly played Civilian scout during for a round during a normal day.

It was a day.  A few other people got the same punishment.  It was to set an example; Sepulchritude is for regular people who want to play the game.  Space is limited, and by going civilian, you're not only putting your team at a disadvantage, but you're wasting a slot on the server.  

&gt; A number of players who went there hated fun for some reason, every time some of us decided to go one class for a round or something like that (in my opinion one of the most fun parts of TF2 is doing stuff like that for the laughs) someone would enter the server and threaten to call an admin or just complain and rtv.

It wasn't that they ""hated fun"", per se; they wanted to play TF2 as it was meant to be played, not stack one class and then tauntkill only.  You may think that or going civilian is fun, but you were basically saying ""fuck you, I'm gonna have MY fun at YOUR expense"" to everyone who just wanted to play normally.

In any case, most of the ""fun haters"" (who made up most of the server's die-hard regulars, ironically) have either quit playing or moved on to other servers.

You can see some lists [here](http://xtreme-jumps.eu/demos.php) and also [here](http://kzmod.com/page.php?8).

I've made my own maps and have helped further development for the Kreedz Climbing mod on the Source Engine, which has been featured on television in Germany, has had spots in magazines.. and yet it never really caught on.

It's always been a little niche community, never really caught on as an eSport. It's just sort of thrived within itself, and now it's slowly losing players as interest has waned in the last few years.

t5_2qh1i,"During 2011 (and sort of 2010) I realized that many things (in society) have already happened at some previous time in history, recent history even. Our collective memory is just really shitty, so we resort to reinventing the wheel or setting us up for an identical crapfest regularly.

For example: When the finance crisis hit and action was needed to deal with the banks, people were discussing whether they should be nationalized or not. ""SOCIALISM!"" was heard chanted, and also Sweden's swift bank bailout in the early 1990s was sometimes used as a (successful) example of nationalization during a crisis (I think 10ish key banks were nationalized within 10ish days. BAM!). IRONICALLY this ""action model"" was based on shit that went down and dealt with in a banking crisis in.... wait for it.... TEXAS in 1983!!!

Lets pause here for a second and look at this:
* Texas - In my eyes as a European the representation of anything opposite of socialism, at least value-wise.
* 1983! - It's not like it was dinosaur material. Its just a couple of (2.5) decades ago! Yet - afaik not exactly frequently brought up in journalistic analysis, but I am just going with gut feeling here, I wasnt exactly scanning the media, but watched and read a lot :)

There seems to be a book about the Texas events btw:

Makes them look more expensive. Thus that part won't change until you outlaw it as deceptive marketing.

E.g. in Europe you saw lots of the same until most countries passed laws that require VAT/sales tax to be included in any advertising targeting consumers, and in some countries allows consumers to demand to buy the product at the stated price regardless whether or not the store tries to claim the price is excluding tax (thus creating a de-facto fine of up to 25% depending on country for not complying with the law - very effective, haven't seen any misleading prices like that since I was a child).

t5_2qyt6,"Most of the events are historically supported but a lot of the motivations are, as would be expected, pure conjecture. Probably the worst part of all that Protocols of Zion crap (well, aside from being used as an excuse for the Jewish extermination efforts) is that it touches the truth in just enough places to make actual investigation of the very real association of international banks seem like lunatic ravings. (in a way something of the Dan Brown fiction of its day)

Various Jewish families probably do represent a larger fraction of what might be called the post-national elite than you'd expect from global demographics, but that's really only the luck of the draw as to who was where and which nation states won out in the various highly unpredictable wars 1750-1945. Any delusions of manufactured detente are shattered by the devastation of various ""old money"" families as the tides of wars came and went. The notion that a small group of bankers had any control over what families kept their holdings in the aristocratic apocalypses of the Napoleanic period or WW1 for example, that saw huge swaths of nobility forcibly divested from untold money in assets, is ludicrous. That's not even touching on the death toll itself.

That doesn't mean that individuals who happened into a position of taking advantage weren't the heartless opportunists you'd expect. But don't get caught up thinking the Rothschilds are magic, it was simply very good luck that Britain has not been invaded since what, like 1500?, or the list of families that held onto their assets for so long would be a whole lot shorter. Apparently really big moats do wonders for asset preservation.

We don't get much of it in modern history reviews, but reading on the age of revolutions in Europe (roughly 1750-1918) gives you a much better understanding of how long the popular resistance to plutocratic control has been going on, and that only could exist if there was plutocratic control to begin with.

t5_2qk5q,"&gt;Is this relevant to climate scepticism?

From the article:

We are left in an equally insoluble mess by the ebbing away of what we can now see was the greatest and most damaging scare-story in history: the belief that the world was threatened with catastrophic warming by human emissions of carbon dioxide.

In the 20 years since the scare was launched, global man-made CO2 emissions have risen by 50 per cent. But at the end of 2011, global temperatures measured by Nasa satellites stood barely a tenth of a degree Celsius higher than their average throughout the 32 years since satellite measurements began – far lower than the projected warming. The computer models on which the scare relied have proved so wrong that it is incomprehensible how they were ever taken seriously.

Hardly surprisingly, in 2011 any attempt to get global agreement on drastic meaures to meet this supposed threat finally expired, as the third mammoth UN conference in as many years fizzled out in Durban. There is no chance that China, India, Brazil, Russia or even the US will agree to a replacement for the failed Kyoto Protocol – not when China alone, with its coal-fired power stations, is increasing its CO2 emissions each year by an amount greater than the UK’s entire annual output.

On all sides, mad schemes dreamed up to meet this imaginary crisis are falling apart. The EU’s carbon trading scheme is collapsing, The dream of solar power is disintegrating, as country after country slashes its subsidies, and firms set up to cash in on the bonanza close in droves (5,000 in Germany alone). Evaporating likewise is the fantasy of “carbon capture and storage” – CO2 from power stations being piped away, at vast expense, and buried in holes in the ground.

More and more, this leaves Britain isolated in a mad little bubble of its own, the only country in the world committed by law to the completely unrealisable goal of cutting CO2 emissions by 80 per cent within 40 years.

On this very day, January 1, the EU is imposing a tax on airline flights which, on top of the Air Passenger Duty, when George Osborne raises it yet again in April, will bring the tax for a British family of four flying to Florida to £344.

Next year, Mr Osborne is to impose a “carbon floor price” of £16 on every ton of CO2 emitted by British industry, when the price of “carbon” under the EU’s emissions trading scheme has collapsed to just £5.40. Not only will Osborne’s tax do serious damage to the competitiveness of British industry, it will add £3 billion a year to the cost of our electricity. This will rise within eight years to £5 billion, which alone will add 25 per cent to all our bills.

Meanwhile, utterly lost in his own green dreamworld, the man supposedly in charge of energy policy, Chris Huhne (below), babbles about chequering thousands of square miles of our countryside and our coastal waters with a further 32,000 crazily expensive and useless windmills. It is a vision so insane that one cannot imagine why men in white coats have not already hauled him off – rather more expeditiously than the Essex police who, we are told, wish to see him prosecuted for perverting the course of justice over an alleged traffic offence.

Even if Huhne’s pipedream could be achieved (it is technically out of the question), he still has not grasped that it would be necessary to pay billions of pounds more to build dozens of grown-up gas-fired power stations, as essential back-up for those still days that render the energy contributions of windmills all too frequently derisory.

t5_2qh1s,"The article just points out that financial services count for more of the GDP.  Whether you think of financial services as ""production"" or ""consumption"" is not mentioned there.

When our economy added jet air travel, the percentage of the GDP on jet travel went up, but we got something for that -- a much more mobile society; we were buying more stuff.  When our economy added AIDS in the 80s, the percentage of the GDP spent on AIDS treatment went up, but that was a negative thing -- we spent money on trying to keep people alive that should have been spent on other stuff.

So the mere percentage of the GDP that is devoted to a thing doesn't inherently signal it's usefulness or goodness.

One area where the financial industry is probably providing a new and productive service is the credit card transactions that allow for internet commerce.  However, I think most of that growth in GDP is a negative waste or friction on the economy, more like AIDS than jet travel.

In no particular order, here are some supporting observations:

* Other first-world, industrialized economies such as Australia, Japan, or Western Europe, have financial services as much smaller part of the GDP, but still have lifestyles roughly similar to ours.

* Automation such as computers on the back-end and ATMs on the front-end should have reduced the overhead needed by the financial industry, not increased it.

* Aside from the example of credit card based internet transactions, we don't seem to get much more benefit from the financial industry; qualitatively speaking, it seems that in the 50s and 60s insurance was cheaper, banks paid more in interest, etc.

* Insurance companies used to commonly pay out more in insurance claims than they took in via premiums, because they made so much investing the money before they paid it back out, and they used to advertise that fact; now, all insurance companies that I know of pay out less in claims than they take in.

On the whole, financial services and insurance seem to be an expensive bubble.  Contemplating the size and damage of it, particularly the effects on the health care system and housing market are considered, can be pretty depressing.  Rather than occupy some park and whine, here are some actions that may be more practical and productive:

* Avoid the use of credit cards or even debit cards as a transaction medium whenever possible - you have to use them on the internet, but the merchant fees amount to an additional sales tax, and by using cash with your local businesses, they get to keep an additional 2 to 5 percent.

* Avoid over-insuring; insure your car and house enough that you can get the most basic replacement, not replace the whole thing.  Have enough fire insurance to pay for a single-wide or a year in an small apartment, not enough to rebuild your MacMansion; have enough car insurance to by a six year old corolla, not enough to by a new car.

In reference to figuring out whether the growth in financial services is an advance or regression, I think some of the clearest thinking on this is in Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations"".  It's a long read and can be tedious working through the 18th century language, but was very worth it to me.

t5_2qh2p,"&gt;when did you know and feel that it was right to call yourself one?

I suppose I never really believed that the Bible was literally true.  My parents (both Catholic, both teachers, but not Catholic school teachers) taught me about the morals and teachings of Jesus, more than the supernatural stuff.  They also taught many secular morals and fables (good Samaritan, Aesop's fables, etc).  When I was about 12 my aunt committed suicide due to postpartum depression.  The two things I heard (not just from priests but like guidance counselor's and public school teachers) were that 1) Everything that happens is part of God's plan, and he works in mysterious ways &amp; 2) If you commit suicide you go to hell, since you've murdered yourself and cannot confess.  And suddenly the whole idea that you would be sent to suffer in fire for eternity for something you did not even have a choice in was so obviously insane.  It was the first crack in the dam, and the more I poked at it, the more obvious fallacies and inconsistencies I found.  I stopped going to church, and my dad followed soon after (upset by the fact that the Catholic church had spirited molesting priests away to Rome so they couldn't be touched by American justice system).

I have only recently become a ""new atheist"" since the more my life goes on it seems the more that the insanity of religion is spreading.  I don't just feel that fundamentalists like al-Queda or the IRA are the ""bad ones.""  Earlier this year the Catholic charities in Chicago (my home town) threatened to turn out their orphans to become homeless rather than follow the law and treat civil unions like marriages.  Any person that believes it is more moral to make a child homeless rather than let a couple which has a union adopt them has earned my contempt.

&gt;Also, I see that many of you guys have constant arguments with people of christian faith so I would imagine that you guys have read and understood the bible.

Part of that is since the demographics of reddit are mainly from the US and western Europe, a lot of us were raised christian.  We know lots of people who are christian, work with people who are christian, pass people on the street who are christian, and have to suffer with older family members who are christian.  I would assume that most of us have more familiarity with the Bible than the people who try to argue us back (or into) christianity.  ""Know thy enemy"" as it were.

&gt;However, have you guys also taken to consideration and done your research on other religion such as Islam, Judaism, budhism, to name a few? Have you actually read the torah or the koran? Spoken to imams or priests? If so, what made you still decide to be atheist?

Me personally, not really.  To be honest, the claims made aren't really that different.  There's a desert dwelling god who was worshiped by this dude named Abraham, and if you don't do exactly what he says he'll torture you for longer than a billion years.  Longer than all the stars burning out in the sky.  Oh, and that's how you know he loves you, obviously.  There's really been no evidence or claim that I've heard which isn't nearly identical to this, so I don't see why I should bother researching the 30,000+ Christian sects or 2800+ other deities to see if one of them seems more reasonable.  

As a few others have said, Jains seem to be the winners with the most ""palatable"" religion.  It's pretty good, and has probably the best teachings, but I don't think it's true.  Non-supernatural Buddhists probably take a close second.. Once again, some good morals to take, and certainly the world might be better of if Abrahamic religions would take some pages out of their book, but still.

&gt;As a muslim, I have a hard time in the United States sometimes but I know that if I do embark on this, I would have a hard time here and in the Middle East because you can not be openly atheist there. I could actually lose my family and friends over this subject because religion there has somehow injected itself to our culture.

Well, as an atheist in the US, I can certainly understand this point.  On the upside, you might have an easier time than we would: ""Oh, I'm atheist, because I don't believe in Allah.  But hey! At least I'm not a Muslim!"" :p

&gt;I do not have atheist friends, so also just general knowledge would be helpful too.

Well, here's a good repository.  I'd check out the ex-muslim sub on the right column. and the FAQ at the top has a lovely intro with good links if you're interested in learning more.  Standard caveats: if you're beginning your journey and not yet on your own, don't pick fights with family and friends, and learn to love your internet browser's incognito mode.

Not really, though it's certainly not poor. Anyone who has ever stood in St. Peter's Square in Rome and watched a prince of the church (the colloquial name for a Catholic cardinal) emerge from a black Mercedes sporting Vatican license plates could understandably find pleas of tough times hard to swallow.

Yet the wealth of the Catholic Church is usually exaggerated. The Vatican, for example, is rumored to be swimming in loot, but its annual budget is less than $400 million. For comparison, consider that Harvard University's is more than $3 billion. The Vatican's portfolio of stocks, bonds, and real estate comes to roughly $1 billion. For a slightly whimsical frame of reference, Forbes estimates that Oprah Winfrey, all by herself, is worth $2.5 billion. The great artistic treasures of the Vatican, such as Michelangelo’s Pietà, are literally priceless; they're listed on Vatican books at a value of 1 euro each because they can never be sold or borrowed against.

Around the world, dioceses and parishes are sometimes large landowners, and the church operates a vast network of schools, hospitals, and social service centers. That infrastructure can generate some impressive-sounding numbers. In 2001, the annual revenue of Catholic programs in the United States came to $102 billion. Yet most of these programs either barely break even or operate in the red, in part because they often serve low-income and minority populations. Outside Europe and the United States, most dioceses and parishes get by on shoestring budgets, to say nothing of missionaries who often live in desperate poverty in remote areas.

Catholics -- from the pope on down -- routinely suggest that the church should adopt greater ""simplicity,"" and it’s eminently fair to expect any organization that demands justice for the poor to practice what it preaches. Popular images of bags of cash stockpiled in the church basement, however, are misleading.

Bankers the world over are reaping the reward for the crisis they engineered.  It's almost like there is a conspiracy among the hyper-rich against the rest of us.  

&gt;Default is on the debt. People wont get what they are owed or have in savings and or bonds.

First of all, I'm not going to watch an hour long video to understand your point.  If you want to cite to it that's fine, but give me a time stamp, don't just point me at a hours worth of material.  For some odd reason, you RP supporters always feel the need to include lengthy videos or link in place of articulating your position. 

Secondly, I understand that ""default is on debt.""  My point is just that the CONSEQUENCE of defaulting is that our credit rating will decrease and it will cost more money to borrow, in other words, future debt would be more expensive.  There is no country whose credit rating is so bad they can't get money; it just costs more.  It wouldn't affect anyone's savings.  But people holding t-bills may not get paid; but it wouldn't render their investments worthless, just worth a bit less. 

&gt;It will when it defaults on who lent it money. IE bought treasuries.

I don't understand how you think that the government defaulting on its debt will somehow hurt the value of people's savings accounts (unless your position is just that it would hurt people with t-bills, which is obviously true). 

&gt;But the debt we have and the unfunded liabilities we have, www.usdebtclock.org, will have us in a downturn for decades. That is if the central planners keep controls.

We had lots of debt before the downturn, debt can limit growth but only when it's really massive.  Ours is getting there.  And I absolutely agree we should reduce the debt.  But I don't know what you mean by ""central planners.""  Do you mean the fed or the government or both?  And what are you advocating, ending the fed? If so, that wouldn't really reduce the government's ability to spend more than it can take in.  Going back to the gold standard?  Again, we could still incur foreign debt.  

&gt;The higher taxation in the US will drive jobs out of this country. 

How would higher *INCOME* tax drive jobs out of the country? 

&gt;you see that less intervention and the gold standard is where we were richer.

Just so you're aware.  Peter Schiff is an investment banker who runs a precious metal investment company.  So a return to the gold standard, would dramatically benefit him and his interests.  Second, he's an adherent of the Austrian school of economics which is non-mainstream in academia.  Moreover, the Austrian School rejects empiricism.  While the rest of the science of economics makes predictions and tests them with data from observation, the Austrian School relies on deductive logic to determine how the economy works.  Any perspective that rejects the scientific method should be immediately suspect to a rational person. 

&gt;Wives didn't have to work. The men made lots of money so wives didn't have to.

Back then our economy was supported heavily by the fact that our chief economic rivals, Japan and Germany, were flattened by our bombs.  And the top tax rate back then was 90-70%, I bet you aren't convinced we should have those taxes just because it was like that back then. 

Also, this was before American companies could take their manufacturing overseas to save money.  Part of the reason the middle class is disappearing is because there are fewer and fewer manufacturing jobs. 

&gt;We still need courts to settle market disputes. I'm not a purist. I want much freer markets. 

Ok, what about government regulation?  Should we force companies to put the ingredients on food labels?  Should we inspect meat-packing facilities? Should we monitor the health claims of drugs? 

&gt;And, abandoning central planning will greatly reduce the chance to another prolonged national collapse. 

Again, are you simply advocating ending the fed? 

&gt;You think we can elect and or appoint Angels.

We can and have. There have been hundreds if not thousands of good-hearted, non-corrupted politicians working for the public good.  Many of them have become president.

Jefferson's phrase ""entangling alliances"" is, incidentally, sometimes incorrectly attributed to Washington.[2]
In 1823, President James Monroe articulated what would come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine, which some have interpreted as non-interventionist in intent: ""In the wars of the European powers, in matters relating to themselves, we have never taken part, nor does it comport with our policy, so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded, or seriously menaced that we resent injuries, or make preparations for our defense.""
After Tsar Alexander II put down the 1863 January Uprising in Poland, French Emperor Napoleon III asked the United States to ""join in a protest to the Tsar.""[3] Secretary of State William H. Seward declined, ""defending 'our policy of non-intervention — straight, absolute, and peculiar as it may seem to other nations,'"" and insisted that ""[t]he American people must be content to recommend the cause of human progress by the wisdom with which they should exercise the powers of self-government, forbearing at all times, and in every way, from foreign alliances, intervention, and interference.""[3]

t5_2qkib,"i would say the main things you need are Storage, Autonomy and Perseverance.  
  
Storage because a lot of your best choices for food are going to provide you with a sudden bulk of far more than a single person could eat before they spoil, this might mean buried earth storage for things like carrots and potatoes or making preserve's to store berries and fruit as a jam.  
  
Automation as in high tech modern means of preparing foods for storage and harvesting produce - with a community it's possible to get everyone to pitch in occasionally to perform tasks, that you're alone means you'll always have a work rate of one.  As said with storage, nature has a habit of rushing you all at once with work then leaving you alone with nothing to do - if you're going to collect all the autumn fruit then you're not going to be able to use the slow way.  Serfs of old (the slaves of medieval europe) actually had huge portions of the year free because there was so little work to do, you won't be so lucky...  Take the time nature gives you spare to plan and built tools to help you during busy periods, get storage solutions and materials ready in advance so that you have enough good jars to fill with pesto, enough cool dry shelves and etc.  Get a labelling system and maybe even a stock taking system, a well stocked pantry will allow you to take best advantage of the year round harvest; also if there are other people in the area with like minded principles you might be able to swap some pesto for some marmalade or a jar of honey.
  
Finally you'll need perseverance because doing it alone means doing it all, this means if you want mushrooms you'll have to learn about mushrooms even if it's a subject you're not entirely at kin with. Everyone has jobs they hate be it weeding or digging but you can't shirk off and let someone else take this one because there isn't anybody else.  From planting, harvesting, preparing and serving its all part of the meal; killing, plucking and gutting if you want home butchered meat.  Busy periods will give you an endless list of jobs and it'll be upto you to do each and every one, that alone's psychologically daunting if nothing else.  
  
Assuming your half acre is good and you're willing to put in the effort then i should imagine you'll be able to live very well off the land, make you you have plenty of production inside the house (food tubs, mushroom shelves, germination areas and seedling starting spaces), good records of whats going on where and with what, a sensible approach to growth choices, meal choices and storage choices so as to maintain a balanced meal year round.  
  
Finally and probably most importantly; CHEAT.  There's no reason not to.  If you want to keep chickens then not having a cock can be a really good thing at 6am (from someone that sleeps 6feet from some chickens let me assure you the hens can be loud enough!) there's bound to be someone nearish that breeds chickens (maybe even a permacultralist) who you can buy or trade chickens from should you decided it's a good time to kill and eat one of your flock.  This will allow you to keep a small handful of birds and stop you having to worry about neighbours (neighbours do not want to hear your cock and may even call the police if you show it to them) or the dramas involved in cock ownership.  Ideologically a permaculture future relies on community and interconnectedness, a single unit survives best by interacting in positive ways with others - trade of help, expertise and resources is vital to attaining the highest functioning existence.  Find something that others require which you're able to produce in excess or a skill you can master; be this high tech gadget making or trenching, then trade for something or some help from friends and like minded folk.

Also, if you're playing a Researcher in *Pandemic* and another player is a Scientist, your first reaction is probably to follow him around and give him all your cards.  This isn't a bad strategy, but don't forget that the other players can get cures, sometimes easier than the Scientist (depending on the luck of the draw) so don't just focus on one player.

This isn't really a strategy but it does make the game more fun in *Zombies!!!* if you allow multiple zombies to share the same space.  This allows you to kill your opponents easier, and it makes the game more challenging.

In traditional *Risk*, when setting up, try not to put any of your men anywhere near central Asia, Europe, or Africa, no matter how tempting it might be.  These have the biggest bonuses but they are also the hardest to hold onto.  Instead focus on troop placement in the Americas and Australia (Although most times, everyone goes for Australia, but South America is just as easy to capture and gives the same amount of troops.)  Siam, Kazakistan, and Iceland are also very important spots that are wise to hold onto, they are major bridges from one continent to another, and the person who controls the bridges has a lot of power.

In *Scrabble* look up the list of two letter words, it's floating around the internet, it helps immensely.  As does solving crossword puzzles.

In Fluxx, the three easiest ways to win are the Goals Peace not War (requires only one Keeper, provided that the Creeper War isn't on the field), 10 Cards in Hand (really easy to get if you play a Hand Limit 0, remove it, and a high Draw card, like Draw 4 or 5), and All You Need is Love (One Keeper: Love).  Also, the Take Another Turn card is extremely powerful and with multiple plays can be used devastatingly.  Save it for when you get a strategy.

t5_2qh2p,"Ehhh, I only half agree. They've let poor countries into the EU before, just look at what's going on now with Greece. I think there are multiple reasons. Turkey's wealth is one, although that's quickly becoming irrelevant as Turkey's economic growth is outpacing the rest of Europe. Then there's the makeup of the Turkish economy, still largely rural, which would put it at competition with other Mediterranean EU states (see Spain, Italy, Greece). Then there are political objections based largely on old animosities, coming from Greece and Cyprus. Then there are the cultural reasons, Turkey being a large Muslim country among predominantly Christian Europe, and along with these I'd count the political objections of genocide denial, freedom restrictions (although if you're looking at restrictions on freedom, France just made it illegal to deny the Armenian genocide, which is kinda fucked up, too), and lasting issues with Cyprus and the Kurds. Finally, I'd say one of Turkey's biggest barriers to EU acceptance is how fucking big it is. At 70 million, it would place it as a power contender within EU politics between France and Germany. It's tough enough getting those to to play nice as it is, it would start getting awful crowded when you throw Turkey in the mix, specially with Erdogan's style of politics.

Possibly, but unlikely.

Japan's military mobilization had been well documented, as has their military influence over government policy in that era.

Assuming they had won a reasonable victory in China, one would assume they would move to other areas throughout the pacifi, specifically those areas that hld the resources they needed so critically (oil, steel).

They had confidence, and momentum, I think it is quite consistent with their cultural system that they wuold take this as a sign, a divine blessing of some sort, that they were meant to expand farther.

In the end, all systems that rely on growth to sustain themselves, collapse if growth cannot be sustained or increased.

OTOH, Germany might not have declared war on us, and may have remained moderately neutral in the Pacific, beyond some technical support, which we would have protested, and then would have been answered by ""Yeah well, you traded a great deal of technology with Britain during the interwar period!"".

A purely pacific war could have turned out much differently for the US. On the one hand, our mobilization would have been more limited (imho), focusing more on naval supplies then air and armor. I think it also would have taken longer, because there would have been more opposition to the war from a political sense, with more pacifist and other groups interested in limiting government scope, along with opposition to the new deal policies, and an expansion of the war (after passions had cooled following Pearl Harbor), as a smaller war, confined to the Pacific would feel less threatening than a global war ravaging Europe and all other continents.

Just a theory though. Still think the allies would have won, but in this case Russia would have been in a far better position, as the invasion of Normandy would have been put off for years, along with Italy, leaving most of Europe relatively vulnerable to the Red Army once German resistance fell.

OTOH, at that point I would imagine we would have joined the war, if only to counter the rising power of Russia, and to claim some spoils out of the peace negotiations.

Cold War might have been more dicey though. Nuclear weapons would have been made later, but likely used in peacetime as a show of strength against the Russians, in some smaller client state (probably pyongyang), and the acceptance of nukes as an acceptable deterrent would have made things more ugly for a decade or two.

In virtue of this establishment the Parliamentary Council, represented by its President, issued and proclaimed the Basic Law. The Basic law is herewith being published, pursuant to Article 145 Paragraph 3, in the Federal Roll of Laws:

...though that's more of an editorial opening, but gives more detail than you ever wanted to know. Then follows a preamble (changed after reunification, before that it cited the goal of unification):

&gt; In its consciousness of its responsibility before God and Humankind, besouled[1] with the will to serve, as an equal  member in a united Europe, the peace of the world, the German people gave themselves, by means of its constituent powers, this Basic Law. The Germans in the States Baden-Württemberg, Bayern, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Hessen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Thüringen did complete in self-determination the unity and freedom of Germany. Thereby, this Basic Law is in force for the whole German People.

...and the first Article, in full, reads:

&gt; Article 1

&gt; 1. Human dignity is inviolable. To esteem and to protect it is obligation of all state authority.

&gt; 2. Therefore, the German people avows itself to inviolable and inalienable Human Rights as basis of every human community, of peace and justness in the world.

&gt; 3. The following Basic Rights bind legislature, executive and judicature as immediate law.

Historical note: There's a [draft constitition for the GDR, dating 1990](http://www.documentarchiv.de/ddr/1990/ddr-verfassungsentwurf_runder-tisch.html), that contains a virtually identical Article 1 Section 1. The first bit of constitution of the GDR before unification read:

&gt; The German Democratic Republic is a socialist state of the workers and farmers. She is the political organisation of the working in city and countryside, lead by the working class and its marxist-leninistic party.

t5_2qhb9,"In the 80's Ireland was economically depressed. We had very little to be proud of. Even things that a German might take for granted like a good road and rail network. It used to take *hours* to get anywhere. We didn't really get motorways until the 1990's/2000's. We still have a very slow rail network. 

Many people still lived a basically subsistence farming life. We saw ourselves as backward in many ways compared to other countries. But tourists saw this as our charm.

The Irish language was seen as something backward too. When it was taught it was all about hard farming life on islands 100 years ago, the curriculum didn't change with the times or with our aspirations. The addition of newer technological words like television (teilifis - pronounced tele-feesh) was clumsy and awkward. It showed how old-fashioned our language was. And the grammar was all back to front and complicated, it was not easy to learn and we had few incentives to study hard at it.

The Irish language was nearly embarassing when I was a kid. There was a definite backlash against it that I find really curious now that I'm older. Maybe it was because those people who espoused it also espoused the other aspects of Irish culture; that screechy music, that stupid looking dancing, the irrational dislike of England, the [GAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association), the catholic church, the tweed jackets, the [flat caps](http://www.dinglenews.com/images/image/102509majackie%20healy%20rae.jpg), all that stuff. You couldn't really just learn the language, you had to learn/become everything else too. But I didn't want all that, I wanted the future not the past. I resented my time being spent on something that I felt had no use in the modern world.

This was heavily influenced by Britain and US culture ""importation"". We wanted to be like them, not like our poor grandparents who worked themselves to death farming sheep on shit land.

That's also a big part of why we went crazy in the Celtic Tiger. We finally saw ourselves as equals on the world stage. We were being progressive, not backward. We weren't seen as quaint little Ireland, we were a tiger! We were buying up half of London and Europe, it was a great feeling to be part of ""the modern world"". But we had no experience with managing all that and we fucked it up.

t5_2qh63,"Yes **he even foists blatant lies,** for example:

&gt;The debt from World War II was never repaid; it just became increasingly irrelevant as the U.S. economy grew, and with it the income subject to taxation. 

Ummm, no.  The debt from WWII was owed in gold coin. The US quite literally and blatantly *defaulted* on that debt in 1971 when it ""suspended"" (purportedly temporarily) the redemption of dollars for gold.

Preventing people from cashing checks you have written, and saying that you will from there on out only ""redeem"" them in the form of yet MORE checks is in fact just plain old ""default"" and arguably ""defrauding"".

---

And then there is the *asinine* old bromide:

&gt;Second — and this is the point almost nobody seems to get — an over-borrowed family owes money to someone else; U.S. debt is, to a large extent, money we owe to ourselves. 

Yeah. Not true at all.  All of us owe money to SOME of us (we are not all equal holders of treasuries are we?)  Quite a lot of it we owe to others.  And those amounts we owe to ourselves?  Yeah, well eating your seed corn and leaving an IOU is not really going to work out come planting time, now is it?

---

Then of course he entirely ignores inflation:

&gt;In particular, the debt didn’t prevent the postwar generation from experiencing the biggest rise in incomes and living standards in our nation’s history. 

A rise in income (in inflated currency) is entirely separate from -- and NOT correlated with a rise in living standard.

But of course he *dare not say that* because then the fraud inherent in the whole scheme would be laid bare.

Yet I do wonder at times if this dipshit even understands WHERE an actual increase in real wealth and growth comes from. It is NOT merely an increase in population as he seems to indicate (if it were only so, then the various African nations would have been rich decades ago). 

He so often ignorantly equates nominal increases in things (GDP, etc) with increases in wealth, that I often think he *really IS* ""as stupid as that.""

And of course, he (like so many others) entirely misreads China\*, and come to think of it Britain as well (amazingly he actually *lauds* Britain of the post WWII years -- Britain, the proverbial ""sick man"" of Europe for very nearly the entire 2nd half of the 20th century; sick again now after only a decade or so of temporary ""recovery"").

\*China really doesn't give a crap about it's American treasury holdings -- oh, no doubt they *will* eventually make good use of them -- but they never expect that they will be redeemed (indeed not, I think they expect to use them as a form of economic ""nuclear weapon"" -- they can foist them off onto the purported US ""corporate owners"" of the so called ""joint ventures"". China can at any time ""slam"" the gates and nationalize those operations, and then can {via the WTO} offer to pay ""fair compensation"" to their American ""partners"" in the form of US treasuries {our own ""coin""} ... laughingly taking possession of all the modern machinery, technology, tooling, and manufacturing operations {the only things they really ever wanted} and letting GM and the various other corporations try to redeem the ""Treasuries""; leaving the US corporations and the US government stuck between a rock and a hard place, or else hoist by our own petards!)",t1_c3d5o5b,1325494352,0,True,t1_c3d72v6,,True,Libertarian,t3_nzfmm,False,1428110920,5,0,LWRellim,0,,c3d72v6,,5

Arabs are only useful to them if they are pro-Israel or Druze then they belt out: ""see even Muslims hate Muslims!"" Also if I try to show anything to my Kahanist family saying that Jews in Arab countries lived well until Israel was created. ""Lies, all lies."" I say to them: ""but then why did the Jews from the Arab countries have 3600 year old communities?"" ""how come a Pasha sent a letter to Queen Isabella saying thank you for expelling your Jews, they will make fine subjects in my kingdom. And proceeded to send ship to take Jews and Moors from Spain back to the Ottoman Empire (I can find you the article if you'd like). Worst of all my family think all of history involves people trying to kill Jews. Nevermind Catholics and Protestant massacring each other. And the Spanish inquisition damned Muslims not just Jews.To my family its all lies. 

I wanna post some more rages as my life as a Jewish truther if yous are interested. FYI: I was once a Zionist and I have read most of Kahane's books (for free my uncle has storage lockers full of unsold and thankfully never will be sold copies).

t5_2qh13,"I understand that Israel is held to higher standards because it is a first world Western democracy, unlike its neighbors, but there's an inherent problem with that. Because it is more highly scrutinized, it garners more international attention and is more highly condemned. So at the end of the day, even though Israel has a far better human rights record than Saudi Arabia or Jordan or Egypt or any other nation in the Middle East or Africa, Israel is actually more harshly condemned and more widely hated than **any** of those nations as a result.

* There are no annual ""Libyan apartheid"" weeks on college campuses across the world.

* The UN Human Rights Council hasn't made Algeria a permanent topic of discussion for every session.

* European polls don't list Yemen as the biggest threat to world peace. 

* We don't see endless topics condemning Morocco every single day on Reddit or on countless other message boards across the net.

And so on. Those things are specifically reserved for Israel. Surveys show that Israel has the **[worst public image among all the nations of the world](http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=10395)**.

If a Harvard graduate stole a candy bar from the local 7/11, should he be more severely punished than a heroin addict who robs a bank? You obviously expect more from the Harvard grad than from a heroin addict but crimes need to be dealt with according to their severity. The world's intense obsession with Israel only serves to allow the real criminal regimes to do what they do with impunity.

Of course Israel is far from perfect and *absolutely* deserves to be criticized for the problems it has but these problems are often dealt with internally through the intense political discourse that happens within the nation on a constant basis. This gender segregation issue is a perfect example of that. There's not need to make an international issue out of it.

The international community should focus its attention on the far more pertinent and far more severe human rights violations of the world before moving to much more minor issues like this.

t5_2qhba,"&gt;The fact that many 12 year olds are pressured by their families and agents to enter the industry, or are poached from problematic situations in economically suffering countries, compounds these problems.

The same can be said of 18 year old models from around the world/Eastern Europe, in addition to tweenage girls who go into modeling with the support of their parents and healthy mentoring within the industry. I'm not sure where you were going with that. I brought tweenage models because somehow 10 year olds shouldn't be photographed, and yet Karlie Kloss can become a sensation at 13.

&gt; Fashion photography is a very different animal from portraiture/fine art, however artful the photography may be. 

That nude model was on the cover of an publicly-funded, and publicly available art magazine. Sure, it was in protest to other censorship, but is using a child's body to convey your message of protest any more ""pure"" than using a child's body to sell a product? You can bullshit yourself, but you can't bullshit me.

&gt;The industry is based on enhancing sex appeal and buyability of a product.

Also, art is it's own product. I wouldn't be surprised if some of those portraits were for sale at the gallery. 

&gt;Even if the photographer's intent were 100% ""pure,"" you have to be aware of the audience you're releasing your work into.

Who's the largest buying demographic of fashion magazines? Women. 

&gt;Legitimizing imagery that sexualizes children because the photographer ""didn't mean it"" makes it more okay for other instances where the child was coerced, abused, exploited.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your speedy horses. In no way shape or form am I [legitimizing](http://feministactivism.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/creepy-sexualization-of-children1.jpg?w=490) anything that blatantly [sexualizes](http://www.feministfatale.com/tag/sexualizing-children/) children. 

I agree with you when you say that the work we do doesn't exist in a vacuum. However, we can't go about blowing things so dramatically out of the water that you lose perspective of what we're actually dealing with here. This model isn't being coerced into this because there's waaayy too much publicity on her. If she was really doing these things against her will, she wouldn't be doing them for long. Everything else you describe is CP. I don't think **anything** legitimizes CP. 

&gt;You can't look at these photographs like they magically exist on their own and ignore who they were made for, who will see them, and how it relates to everything else on the market.

I'm curious to know who you believe will be the primary viewers of these images? They're made to be viewed by the target market, women if the images are published in a women's fashion magazine. In her glamorous photo shoot the underlying message was fashion's obsession with youth. Placing a child in adult's clothes only shows how ridiculous the situation is getting in the industry. 

I get it. I do. It's fucked up when little girls are made to look and act like they're much older. There's plenty of time for that later. But implying that a photo of a kid with messy, tousled hair, a blank expression, and an open mouth will suddenly launch the ships of a thousand pedos (because this is what *everyone* is concerned about, even me to a small degree) is so remarkably hilarious **because pedophiles will salivate over any attractive child.** Weird huh? We're all concerned. But let's be a bit more reasonable about this *particular* situation.

My background is a bachelor's degree from Europe (European by birth), a J.D. from Columbia, and I currently work for (and have since graduation) a V10 firm in NYC. Because of my European background, I get to work with a lot of ""Cross-Atlantic"" issues, which is an added bonus. Also lots of travel.


1) Salary, prestige, always liked to work with analytical issues. 

2) I'm a corporate lawyer. I generally advise corporations on SEC compliance, mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, some white collar crime and financial transactions. What I studied is what I work with.

3) Well, I graduated in 2004, so no recession-problems for me. Right now, at least in the US and UK, the main problem is over-abundance of lawyers compared to the jobs that are out there.

Back in my time, the hardest thing was the Socratic method. I've never liked to be humiliated in front of 100-150 of ""my friends"", so that part kinda sucked. But it's something you adjust to.

4) Varies from 1 to 10 all the time. Some projects (especially M&amp;A) is very interesting, other tasks are just tedious and makes you feel like a glorified secretary. The work hours can be brutal (75-90 hrs is a pretty normal week). The focus on billable hours, and having to log every minute of my day is annoying. 

The most enjoyable part to me is that you get to learn a lot about businesses you work with. The salary is pretty enjoyable too, should end up in the ballpark of $1.2million in 2012. Not bad for a guy ""around 30"", I think.

5) The hours, and the 6-minute-logging system. As a corporate lawyer I also barely ever go to court, and I kinda miss that. ",t3_nzo4a,1325506410,0,False,t1_c3d7w1y,,True,IAmA,t3_nzo4a,False,1428111301,2,0,[deleted],0,,c3d7w1y,,2

Thank you for your email regarding the price of the Super Star Destroyer set.

I would like to explain that the Company has not historically changed retail prices as local currencies fluctuate, and recent developments with the Canadian dollar have not dramatically altered the fixed costs of doing business in Canada.  With headquarters in Europe, the LEGO Group reports its financials in Danish Kroner, and maintains a manufacturing cost base fixed in Euros.  The prices of LEGO products vary around the world, and are determined by careful evaluation of local factors such as government taxes, transportation costs, exchange rates, market conditions and the cost of doing business.  It is, therefore, inaccurate to look to U.S. pricing as a means of measuring anticipated Canadian price equivalencies.

Again, thank you for contacting us about this situation. I want to assure you that the LEGO Group does everything it can to deliver the best possible quality, value and play experience to our consumers at competitive prices in all of the 130 countries where we do business. We wish you many more happy hours of creative building with LEGO brand toys in the years to come.

 I actually studied in Sweden last year in Jönköping! Loved every bit of it and love Swedish people! Which uni are you studying at? 

I dont know which School you're at in Sweden but from my experience the social life in Sweden was far greater than here for students, but part of that was because jönköping is such a small town so it was very easy to mix with everyone from the School. Also there were a lot more School organized activities. 

I study at La Trobe and from what I can tell they dont organize a lot of activities in the same sense that my Swedish School did but I am also not an exchange student. Melbourne night life is good but not as good as Europe's, but personally I find it much better than Sydney's and Queensland.

If you want a surf type lifestyle all you swedes think we have maybe gold coast or Perth might be an option haha but for more urban culture Sydney/melb are good but of course we have some good beaches to such as Bondi beach in Sydney and melbourne has St Kilda and also Bells beach where they hold huge world wide  surfing completions.

Following decriminalization, Portugal had the lowest rate of lifetime marijuana use in people over 15 in the E.U.: 10%. The most comparable figure in America is in people over 12: 39.8%. Proportionally, more Americans have used cocaine than Portuguese have used marijuana.

&gt; The Cato paper reports that between 2001 and 2006 in Portugal, rates of lifetime use of any illegal drug among seventh through ninth graders fell from 14.1% to 10.6%; drug use in older teens also declined. Lifetime heroin use among 16-to-18-year-olds fell from 2.5% to 1.8% (although there was a slight increase in marijuana use in that age group). New HIV infections in drug users fell by 17% between 1999 and 2003, and deaths related to heroin and similar drugs were cut by more than half. In addition, the number of people on methadone and buprenorphine treatment for drug addiction rose to 14,877 from 6,040, after decriminalization, and money saved on enforcement allowed for increased funding of drug-free treatment as well.",t1_c3d8513,1325516134,0,False,t1_c3d8jr4,,True,worldnews,t3_nxnku,False,1428111614,1,0,darkscout,0,,c3d8jr4,,1

t5_2qqjc,"I think it's the motivation and proximity to our own (in my case English, but there are close ties between Germany and America too) culture is why we set Hitler apart. He targeted and systematically disposed of specific groups of people that had more power to speak out after the war if they survived, Germans look pretty much like the rest of us European white people, and the dude bombed the shit out of a lot of us.

Stalin on the other hand, was a foreign dictator in a culture very different to ours, who played an important part in winning WWII. He lived long after the war, it's impossible to invade the mass of land he controlled, he maintained a strong cult of personality and culture of fear, and unlike the Nazis, did a pretty good job of destroying/manipulating history rather than recording it immaculately. So when you look back, you're faced with a silent fearful people who don't speak a Germanic/Latin based language, don't really live like we do and don't always have the proof to show that these people he killed even existed. 

You can apply the same logic to Pol Pot and Mao, and to a certain degree, the Japanese in WWII.

t5_2qkhb,"If you've spent any time in Stockholm this might be a useful comparison for you. Of all the cities I saw in Europe (including Berlin, Kyiv, Ljubljana, Kharkiv, Lviv) I found Stockholm was the one that not only reminded me of home the most but so much so it kind of bored me. I wouldn't have been able to say that if I'd come from a different Australian metropolis. That said there is a string of key differences.

Public transport and city planning is terrible in Australia compared to Stockholm. Melbourne is the best we have to offer for that and really it's pathetic if your point of comparison is Swedish. Think Berlin, but much bigger with less train lines.

Culturally, Melbourne is more diverse then anything you can experience in Europe. As far as I'm aware, we're the most culturally diverse city on the planet. I heard someone make the claim that New York held that honour with 33% of the population born in other countries but Australia's average is 26% and it's heavily weighted towards Melbourne &amp; Sydney.

I'll cover this, since, I had mixed impressions of Swedes attitudes to multi-culturism. In Melbourne this is a very positive thing. The people who will give you problems are basically a forgotten caste we affectionately call the bogan. They're white, working class and live on the outskirts. They drink a lot and the worst ones are typically on ICE. You can easily avoid them as an inner city student.

This brings me to crime etc. Melbourne is the least safe metropolis in Australia, one of the safest countries in the world. I bet it's crime rates are lower then Stockholm. But there is a more noticeable class divide. It's nothing like the US ... but as you no doubt know, Sweden is a rare gem when it comes to equality. The class divide however isn't always straight forward, since the country is pretty rich in general. Plenty of poorer people are actually really well educated or enlightened and interesting people. They just have an aversion to the economic sectors that make Australia so rich.

Back to what I was saying about the size of the place; Once you start asking people about what suburbs to consider try to consider the relative scale Australian's are used to. I stayed in hammersly gard (sp?) in Stockholm and my friends there complained about the long commute. To be fair they were near the edge of the city. In Melbourne that would be a SHORT journey. From West to East expect 2+ hours by train and over an hour by car. If suburban living is your style ... get a car. Your licence is valid until 3 months after you get pulled over for the first time.

That said, don't live in the outer suburbs. They're boring, no cheaper then a slummy but cosy inner city sharehouse. Very few of us have our own apartments and moving from room to room is pretty fluid. Nothing like the waiting lists in Sweden. A sharehouse will give you an instant social circle, parties &amp; cheaper living.

The nightlife of Melbourne is structured in a pretty similar way to Stockholm as well, although you might find it a bit lacklustre at times. There are a lot of great, small bars, some bigger nightclubs etc. but the latter is populated by the afore-mentioned bogans, not the classy types I saw at Swedish clubs. There are ways around this though but it'll take research / good advice because the better options aren't the obvious ones, unlike in Stockholm.

Hrmm, what else. Cost; you think you've got it bad in Sweden? Think again:

You'll be paying $400+ for a room. Consult Reddit before you think about accomodation. Use www.gumtree.com.au to find a room. There is some pretty serious exploitation of international students.

It'll cost $8 for a CHEAP beer at a reasonable bar. Our bottleshops have wide selections ... usually as good, if not better then a Systembolaget but they're more expensive. Buying in bulk from the bigger ones will save you a lot. If you like wine ... even better.

I know this one might fly in the face of your logic but eating cheaply means eating Asian food. A traditional Australian pub meal will cost $20+ but a weightier meal at a good Thai restaurant can be half that if you know where to eat. Same deal for cooking at home. Fresh food is comparatively (to income) cheap and much higher quality then what you get in Sweden.

Oh and one last thing, to end my rant. We don't use centiliters. I just noticed my beer uses them and this was kind of confusing when in Europe.

t5_2qhb9,"First and foremost thank-you for your interest. I was debating with myself about posting here and finally decided I would i'm not sure why but here we are. My parents were both Irish and I was born in Ireland but I spent my early childhood in London which I think is largely responsible for some of the views I am about to express. 

When I arrived in Ireland at about 10 it struck me as a strange place. this was just before the celtic tiger and the country was just beginning to be modernized. Ireland is a polarized country in my experience and I believe the difference between my Mothers family and my Fathers serves to highlight this. My mother's family is very traditional and republican, The declaration of Independence hangs on the wall in many of their kitchens and all too often I hear comments that disgust me regarding our neighbors across the water and many of the eastern Europeans who have recently immigrated to our country. While my Father's half of the family is very modern right up to his grandparents. They are very proud of what Ireland has achieved and believe we have a major role we could play on the international front in new countries as a mediator of sorts. 

When I first arrived I lived in a city (Limerick) and experienced curiosity in my English upbringing but soon after we moved to a rural area and my childhood in England and South London accent became something I learned to hide. This attitude to the English is dying out though thankfully and I believe the youth of Ireland for the most part are fully embracing the multi-cultural place Ireland is becoming. 

You ask why you get such a positive vibe from the Irish and that is easy. We are an incredibly optimistic country, we love to make jokes and do not mind being the butt of the odd joke our entire culture is almost based on humor something which having now traveled extensively I realize is not true of the world in general. Trying to explain to my Asian GF why me making a joke (slagging her off) does not mean I hate her can be a difficult exchange. 

The Irish language is dead or dying depending how you look at it and that is either something you care about or don't. I learned Irish as a kid but always wished I could just have an extra English class from a young age I realized Irish would be useless to me and the way they teach it is ridiculous. So we are losing our native tongue but the Irish are an artistic race and I am proud to say that we have done more with the English language then the Britts and Americans combined. The greatest English literature will often have an Irish author. 

Being an artist was encouraged in my childhood by school and family alike. Nearly everyone in my school played some instrument and if they didn't you could be sure they were fantastic writers or sportsmen. This is the reason I want my kids to be educated in Ireland. 

I believe Ireland could do more politically then it currently does we have a massive political influence given our size with huge lobbies in America and England. We could use that power to stand up more for the things we believe like a free Palestine. I believe our current government will do great things on the international forum. 

You cannot talk about Ireland without bring up the biggest of it's dying traditions, the Catholic church it shaped countless generations with fear and violence and stifled our growth thankfully though its power is waning and I hope that when my kids are in school they will be secular.

Lastly but not least to be Irish is to be curious about the world and you will see a lot of Irish people all over the world. This is not just because of the recession but it certainly intensifies the process. I left a good job  to travel I don`t know why but it struck me as the thing to do. This urge to explore is something that shapes an Irishman or Woman from an early age.

I left Ireland now several years ago but I long to return i'm not sure why exactly but the place is romantic, you fall in love. I do not know how or when it happened but Ireland seduced me and not being there is a sad affair I will be returning later this year and I am literally counting the seconds.

t5_2qh03,"Hello! 

Seeing this is somewhat jaw dropping as I find there is a lot of kindness behind it. I figured I'd give it a shot. These are what I'd like:
Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time collectors edition
Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest for booty
Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction
Soul Calibur IV
Devil may cry 4
God of war trilogy ultimate edition (only sold in europe).

Here's the reason why:
The Ratchet and Clank series has always been good and more-so for my brother. He has always enjoyed them, and I have yet to get any of these for him, to give him the chance to play them. He's always ended up loving each game, and I figured this would be an amazing chance to gather them so that he may play them and hopefully enjoy these. :)

I see Soul Calibur V is coming out and after watching and almost finishing the Tower of Druaga: Sword of Uruk anime, the main character has a weapon just like Ivy uses in the game. It makes me want to play a Soul Calibur game again. Acquiring this would ease that want and especially drive me to possibly look into purchasing the next one. 

As far as Devil May Cry 4, its always been like a @_@ love for me. Its a game, to me, that hasn't been matched and I would love to try the bloody palace again to try and best my past and actually beat it. This would give me a chance to overcome part of my past, haha.

Finally, the God of War Trilogy, falls into something I've always wanted to enjoy, but never got the chance to. Especially on the PS3, I figured this would be the chance to find out what everyone has been talking about for years when it came to this series. 

Thanks again for the opportunity on this. Regardless, your kindness is pretty amazing, and the fact you're just giving these out is pretty fantastic. ",t3_nzulh,1325523452,0,False,t1_c3d9dc8,,True,gaming,t3_nzulh,False,1428111997,3,0,Cyframerex,0,,c3d9dc8,,3

i started over fresh in the us servers taking full advantage of RAF and slamming as many toons as i could to level 80 with the same names, classes, roles, slightly different professions.

even after all the phone calls (more sitting on hold for more hours than i would like to admit) emails, post, and begging - offering to pay any fees to transfer my toons, still blizzard would not allow this as the EU and US are 2 totally different businesses........

Ok let me change that to developed countries in the same position as the US. I thought it was pretty obvious that a third world country wouldn't be comparable to the US but clearly you think that it is.

&gt; That you would repeat this widely held nonsense demonstrates your ignorance of economics.

You do realize that inflation comes from the need to increase the supply  of money to an ever increasing population right? That if you were to freeze the money supply everyone would get poorer as the same amount of money has to be shared among many more people? It is much more harmful in the long term.

&gt;  goods and services becoming less expensive in terms of dollars as we become more productive.

And everybody ends up with less money to spend on those goods and services so the reduction in price is a reflection of the reduction in personal wealth.

You call me ignorant yet you don't seem to have a grasp of simple supply and demand. More demand with the same supply = less products for people at a higher price. So money is worth more value but everyone has less of it.

At one instance in history the currency is valued at $1 and every person has an income of $15,000. If the population doubles and the amount of currency in circulation is constant then every person's income halves to $7,500. Is that what you are arguing for? Because what you are saying has this result. If you didn't realize this then you are the one who is ignorant of economics.

It was an overstatement but accurate that he sees the majority of problems in the Middle East being attributed to the US, including all of the problems surrounding Israel showing a clear lack of knowledge on the subject.

Ron Paul voted for the war in Afghanistan. He supported military action against Al Qaeda. He doesn't understand how severely his actions would affect relations with other countries. How do you think foreign relations with the EU would be if he pulls out all troops from Afghanistan abandoning them with all of the responsibility for a war that he personally voted for, and they entered to support the US? How do you think South Korea, an American ally that was instrumental in preventing the spread of Communism, would react to a complete withdrawal of US troops from their military bases? How long would you give it before there was a hot war on the Korean peninsula yet again? How do you think Israel, and most of the developed world if I'm being honest, would react to him suddenly dropping all internationally agreed sanctions against Iran? He promises so many things in terms of foreign policy of which a large majority of them would harm foreign policy more than help it.

It isn't like he got turfed out on his arse over children overboard, and it also isn't like he was some kind of lone minister playing sheriff with the tampa. It was a government decision to lie and this has been revealed rather consistently over the years. 
Howard emphasised European\American\Western ties more than anything throughout his leadership, mainly to provide contrast against the overwhelming effort made by Keating, Harke and Whitlam in Asia. That isn't to say that he was anti-Asia while he was Prime Minister, or that he didn't make great strides to build relationships with Asian leaders or countries later in his leadership but in no way did he do more than what Keating or Whitlam achieved individually in relation to Asia (Hawke not as much).

t5_2qmah,"I'm an ethnomusicology student at UCLA. 
As the other posters have said, Theory is a way for musicians to communicate, with themselves or with others. It's important to think of it as a way of DESCRIBING music ...theory results from music, not the other way around (in the same way that math is a way of describing the universe, but there are many ways in which math fails to describe the universe [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's_paradoxes#The_dichotomy_paradox]). 

When you reach the limits of what theory can account for or what theory says is ""correct,"" it's a great idea to push those limits. In fact, I'd argue that for most of us musicians, the places in which those limits are pushed are our favorite parts of music. 

Lastly, in the debunking of the godlike reverence many here in America have for theory, remember that it's a distinctly western construct: there's nothing empirically ""correct"" about theory, it's simply Europe's way of talking about music. For example: Hindustani classical music (Ravi Shankar, etc.) is non-harmonic—they have no concept of chords.

[I might add-- if that actually happens (ending up in emergency rooms)-- because the Harvard School of Public Health recently found that 40,000 Americans die annually due to lack of health insurance; my own stepfather was one of them in 1999-- even after working for IBM for 20 years, after he quit he didn't have health insurance; died of heart attack at age of 59 because he didn't have money to address his heart disease; see http://www.petitiononline.com/forpiggy ]

PNHP Research: The Case for a National Health Program

Over the past two decades, PNHP research has “framed” the debate and focused it on the need for fundamental health care reform. Some of these findings have become so well known that new members of PNHP (and most members of Congress) may not know that we are the source:

1. Administrative costs consume 31 percent of US health spending, most of it unnecessary.
(Woolhandler, et al “Costs of Health Administration in the U.S. and Canada,” NEJM 349(8) Sept. 21, 2003)

2. Medical bills contribute to half of all personal bankruptcies. Three-fourths of those bankrupted had health insurance at the time they got sick or injured.
1. “Illness and Injury as Contributors to Bankruptcy,” Himmelstein et al, Health Affairs Web Exclusive, February 2, 2005.
2. “Medical Bankruptcy in the United States, 2007: Results of a National Study,” Himmelstein, D.U., Thorne, D., Warren, E., Woolhandler, S. (2009), Am J Med, 122, 741-746.

4. “Medical Bankruptcy Q&amp;A,” Himmelstein, D.U., Thorne, D., Warren, E., Woolhandler, S. (2009).

3. Taxes already pay for more than 60 percent of US health spending
Americans pay the highest health care taxes in the world. We pay for national health insurance, but don’t get it.
(Woolhandler, et al. “Paying for National Health Insurance — And Not Getting It,” Health Affairs 21(4); July / Aug. 2002)

4. Despite spending far less per capita for health care, Canadians are healthier and have better measures of access to health care than Americans.
(Lasser et al. “Access to Care, Health Status, and Health Disparities in the United States and Canada: Results of a Cross-National Population-Based Survey,” American Journal of Public Health; July 2006, Vol 96, No. 7)

5. Business pays less than 20 percent of our nation’s health bill. It is a misnomer that our health system is “privately financed” (60 percent is paid by taxes and the remaining 20 percent is out-of-pocket payments).
(Carrasquillo et al. “A Reappraisal of Private Employers’ Role in Providing Health Insurance,” NEJM 340:109-114; January 14, 1999)

6. For-profit, investor-owned hospitals (Cite 1, Cite2, Cite 3, &amp; Cite 4), HMOs5 and nursing homes (Cite 6 &amp; Cite 7) have higher costs and score lower on most measures of quality than their non-profit counterparts.

2. Tyrance et al. “US Emergency Department Costs: No Emergency,” American Journal of Public Health; Vol 86, No. 11, November 1996

8. 45,000 annual deaths are associated with lack of health insurance1. That figure is about two and a half times higher than an estimate from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2002. The uninsured do not receive all the medical care they need — one-third of uninsured adults have chronic illness and don’t receive needed care2. Those most in need of preventive services are least likely to receive them.

9. The US could save enough on administrative costs1 (more than $350 billion annually) with a single-payer system2 to cover all of the uninsured.

I keep remembering the fun times we had, and her picture I set to my phone background, so anytime I check my phone, I could smile. I forced myself to delete it. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. Ever.

The thing I did that started closing the wound up fast for me was to cut off any contact I had of them. The only time I can actually talk to her is in one of my classes, but I asked the teacher to move me clear across the room to evade awkward situations. (She is a senior, I am a junior, we're both in high school.)

If you've cut off contact already, I do not recommend reestablishing it. That would open cut the wound open to it's previous pain.

Alongside the ""no-contact"" rule, I decided to focus on getting better grades in math, and other computer electives. My main goal in life is to move to Europe and start racing as a professional. My backup is to have the grades to get into college for a 4-year degree in software engineering, a favorite thing of mine to do.

Enough of me blabbing on about myself incessantly. The main thing is to do ""no-contact"" and take your mind off it. Don't even look at them.

t5_2qh1i,"[Wikipedia has a pretty thorough breakdown:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday#Position_in_the_week)

&gt;In the Judaeo-Christian as well as in Islamic tradition, Sunday has been considered as the first day of the week. A number of languages express this position either by the name for the day or by the naming of the other days. In Hebrew it is called יום ראשון yom rishon, in Arabic أحدal-ahad, in Persian and related languages یکشنبه yek-shanbe, all meaning ""first"". In Greek, the names of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (""Δευτέρα, ""Τρίτη,"", ""Τετάρτη,"" and ""Πέμπτη"") mean ""second,"" ""third"", ""fourth"", and ""fifth,"" respectively. This leaves Sunday in the first position of the week count. The current Greek name for Sunday, Κυριακή (Kyriake), means ""Lord's Day"" coming from the word Κύριος (Kyrios), which is the Greek word for ""Lord"". Similarly in Portuguese, where the days from Monday to Friday are counted as Segunda-feira, Terça-feira, Quarta-feira, Quinta-feira and Sexta-feira, while Sunday itself similar to Greek has the name of ""Lord's Day"" (domingo). In Vietnamese, the working days in the week are named as: ""Thứ Hai"" (second day), ""Thứ Ba"" (third day), ""Thứ Tư"" (fourth day), ""Thứ Năm"" (fifth day), ""Thứ Sáu"" (sixth day), ""Thứ Bảy"" (seventh day). Sunday is called ""Chủ Nhật,"" a corrupted form of ""Chúa Nhật"" meaning ""Lord's Day."" Some colloquial text in the south of Vietnam and from the church may still use the old form to mean Sunday.

&gt;A similar system of naming days of the week occurs in Portuguese. Monday is ""segunda-feira,"" which means ""second day,"" also showing Sunday (""domingo"") to be counted as the first day. Modern Latin uses ""feria secunda"" for Monday.

&gt;Slavic languages implicitly number Monday as day number one, not two. For example, Polish has ""czwartek"" (4th) for Thursday and ""piątek"" (5th) for Friday. Hungarian péntek (Friday) is a Slavic loanword, so the correlation with ""five"" is not evident to Hungarians. Hungarians use Vasárnap for Sunday, which means ""market day"".

&gt;In the Maltese language, due to its Siculo-Arabic origin, Sunday is called ""Il-Ħadd,"" a corruption of ""wieħed"" meaning ""one."" Monday is ""It-Tnejn"" meaning ""two."" Similarly Tuesday is ""It-Tlieta"" (three), Wednesday is ""L-Erbgħa"" (four) and Thursday is ""Il-Ħamis"" (five).

&gt;In Armenian, Monday is (Erkushabti) literally meaning 2nd day of the week, Tuesday (Erekshabti) 3rd day, Wednesday (Chorekshabti) 4th day, Thursday (Hingshabti) 5th day. Saturday is (Shabat) coming from the word Sabbath or Shabbath in Hebrew, And ""Kiraki"" coming from the word ""Krak"" meaning ""fire"" is Sunday, ""Krak"" describing the sun by fire. Apostle John also refers to the ""Lord's Day"" (in Greek, Κυριακή ημέρα, ""kyriake hemera"" i.e. the day of the Lord) in Rev. 1:10, which became the Armenian word for Sunday.

&gt;However, in many European countries calendars almost always show Monday as the first day of the week.[3]

&gt;In Persian calendar Sunday is the second day of the week but they call it as number one and it's because the first day that is saturday counted as 00.",t3_nzzh3,1325528984,0,False,t1_c3da6lh,,True,AskReddit,t3_nzzh3,False,1428112382,2,0,[deleted],0,,c3da6lh,,2

On the contrary, one of the big questions in law enforcement is how harsh to be in prosecuting justice and how much the police and courts should protect the rights of suspects. The poor and rich are segregated by neighborhood which makes this process divergent enough even in a democratic process.

Imagine if the rich had their own police and courts to protect their interest by savagely exploiting poor suspects accused of violent crime and property crime, and the poor had their own police and courts which were all but powerless to investigate white collar crime. Actually, you don't have to imagine it, you only have to remember the aristocratic regimes of centuries past in Europe.

t5_2qh1i,"It's a little complicated, but there's a federal minimum wage in the US of $7.65 (it just increased from $7.25 yesterday). This means every state must meet this minimum wage standard. The federal law allows employers whose employees earn part of their wages from tips to pay actually pay less than minimum wage so long as the combined total of tips and wages meets the $7.65 minimum. This is known as ""tipping credit"", however eight states do not allow tipping credit and require employers to pay the full minimum wage regardless of whether their employees earn tips.

To further complicate matters, many, but not all states have their own minimum wage laws. Some states have minimum wages equal to the federal minimum whereas others have minimums higher than the federal level based on a calculated average cost of living. 

Some cities even have minimum wages higher than the state wage. For instance San Francisco's minimum wage just went up to $10.24, because it's a ridiculously expensive place to live. 

I got these figures from here for any one who gives a damn:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._minimum_wages

Personally I think tipping credit is bullshit and unfair to servers and wait staff. Most minimum wages in the States fall far short of an actual livable wage and the whole system is shit. I agree with Europeans, we shouldn't have to be tipped to compensate for low wages, but unfortunately this os the current system we're stuck with. As for tipping in the UK, I have spent time there and know English servers and waiters. They universally agree that tipping standards (for good service) is ideally 10% compared to America's 15%. In both countries the same rule should apply, if you get shitty service tip little or none at all. However it seems us yanks are more inclined to tip generously even for so-so service. I say this as a former server. So if your bill is £60 when you had good service and you leave only a couple pounds rather than £6, you just sound kind of stingy. Although this seems to be culturally commonplace in the UK despite a comparatively low UK minimum wage. Rant over.

In my case it was Amsterdam and after grants it ended up at something like €350,- but some of them are cheaper and some are more expensive. Compared to other places students can live they're not remarkably cheap. I have a much better place now for only €310,- at about the same distance from the city centre. Living in the city centre would, in general, be much more expensive for much smaller rooms and shared facilities. In terms of having a whole house with all facilities (bathroom, kitchen) to yourself, the containers are probably part of the cheaper options available, but I think it's most of all cheap to build, which is needed because there is an immense demand for student housing.

I'm not really sure how the installation of the containers is done, but seeing as I have seen the exact same design in multiple parts of the city I suspect that they are mostly pre-fitted. That would seem to be the most efficient way to do it anyway, especially considering the fact that most of the container complexes are only scheduled to be there for a couple of years, until other building projects get realized on that location. (If you meant it in the sense of 'are they installed when an occupant is found?' then they are pre-installed.

t5_mouw,"June 5: Rare transit of Venus across the sun

The passage of Venus in front of the sun is among the rarest of astronomical events, rarer even than the return of Halley's Comet every 76 years. Only six transits of Venus are known to have been observed by humans before: in 1639, 1761, 1769, 1874, 1882 and, most recently, in 2004.

The next one will occur in the year 2117. When Venus is in transit across the solar disk, the planet appears as a distinct, albeit tiny, round black spot with a diameter just 1/32nd of the sun. This size is large enough to readily perceive with the naked eye. HOWEVER ... prospective observers are warned to take special precautions (as with a solar eclipse) when attempting to view the silhouette of Venus against the blindingly brilliant solar disc.

The beginning of the transit will be visible from all of North America, Greenland, extreme northern and western portions of South America, Hawaii, northern and eastern portions of Asia including Japan, New Guinea, northern and eastern portions of Australia, and New Zealand. The end will be visible over Alaska, all of Asia and Indonesia, Australia, Eastern Europe, the eastern third of Africa, and the island nation of Madagascar.",t3_o05as,1325536418,0,False,t1_c3dbem7,,True,science,t3_o05as,False,1428112958,1,0,melformosa,0,,c3dbem7,,1

t5_2sokd,"Short answer: A lot of people don't like foreigners, and Jews are foreigners in all of Western Europe so they get hate from everyone.

Longer answer: In times of economic hardship, it's good to have money in lots of different currencies in case something bad happens to one of them (like what happened to the German mark just before the Second World War). Or if you prefer, you can own things which are not money, like houses, companies, or gold. Now, people who've moved in from abroad tend to have money in at least two currencies, and a lot of them start their own small companies too. Foreigners do well in times of recession - and Jews, as a rule, are foreigners almost everywhere.

When something bad happens to the economy, people get angry and look for someone to blame. They look at the people who still have money and say ""They're doing all right - they must know something I don't"", or maybe ""There's a Jewish conspiracy against our nation"", or perhaps even ""The 1% are screwing us over"".

t5_2qh1s,"&gt; The fundamental cost of any debt is the consumption foregone because the resources that would have gone into producing the products &amp; services to be used for consumption were instead reallocated into servicing interest.

I think the key thing to bear in mind here is that USD can only be used to transact business in the USA. So while the Chinese hold a substantial amount of T. Bills, we will see all that money get spent here at some point. At which point it becomes revenue again. They won't ever get paid by us in Yuan or Euro or gold. So, yes, there's a cost insofar as we're going to allow the Chinese to direct the output of our economy to a small degree. But, it does not represent ""lost"" productivity in the way that it would for a household.

&gt; Are you trying to argue that debt has no cost? 

No, I never said this, but the costs are over-stated due to the ""government as large household"" analogy. When I pay interest on my mortgage, I lose money. When Congress pays interest on Federal Debt, the dollars are not lost from the US economy, they are just moved around.

&gt; Why not then just issues as much debt as can? Oh wait, the Europeans have already tried that...

It's relevant that investors believe their investments will be paid back with reasonable profits, which is what Krugman meant by ensuring we keep debt balanced with tax revenues. 

Also, the Europeans have not done anything close to ""issue as much debt as [they] can."" In point of fact, they've done the exact opposite-- limiting the amount of sovereign debt that member countries can issue.

t5_2qi58,"&gt; There is more. Someone wrote up a summary of FA withholding evidence from Suarez. 

Thanks, I certainly missed that. But I'd warn you, it does reek of *""OMG, ITS A CONSPIRACY!""* judging by the tone of it but it is not fair to pass judgment for now.

&gt; As for Evra, ""I'm going to kick you"", ""I'm going to hit you"" is two counts of direct violations of Rule E3(1) (threatening), the very same Suarez is accused of. If you believe Evra's version of what happened. If you believe Suarez ""Don't touch me, South American"", he's also guilty of breaking Rule E3(2) (ethnic origin).

I think he should be punished for the earlier insult he reported anyway, I am not sure why he is not charged with it. And again, the reason Evra is not breaking Rule E3(2) is because they concluded that the term South American is not a racial abuse, no?

&gt; It's irrelevant for the point I was trying to make, that Evra was the one winding up Suarez and not the other way around.

But it is relevant, because Suarez was not aware of it, thus it did not wind *him* up. But Suarez did got a reaction from Evra when he used the term ""negro"" and subsequently continued to use it. I do not blame him and it does not make him a racist, but unfortunately the weapon he used was a racial charge term and the FA has been quite clear that this gets no love. 

I can't say much, but here goes:

&gt; 1. Evra speaks good enough Spanish to address Suarez in Spanish using non-textbook phrases like ""Concha de tu hermana"", yet he somehow doesn't understand what ""negro"" means? Come on, even I who am not a spanish speaker, have no spanish friends or colleagues, have never been to a spanish speaking country, know and have known for as long as I can remember, that it means black. Instead he thinks it means ""n*gger""

And 'n*gger' means black as well, when used in a provoking way. When he was asked to repeat what Suarez have said in Spanish, he had no issue using the term, ""negro"" which can be used in various ways, even in affection. This was however not the case.  Again, Suarez have been cleared of using the term 'n*gger' that only *EXIST* in English, but rather using the term 'negro' in an offensive way. I can accept that clarification. Reporting that Saurez used the term 'black' and the term 'n*gger' is still racial abuse, plus it was never the main argument.

&gt; 2. Evra had ample opportunity to explain himself to the referee, but did not when he and Suarez were called to the referee. In fact, he didn't even look upset when speaking to the referee.

He did. *Mr Evra was clearly upset and mentioned that he was being called ""black"". Mr Marriner did not hear whether Mr Evra said who was calling him ""black"" and he did not understand what Mr Evra was referring to at the time. * Then subsequently, he was told by Giggs to calm down and not get sent off because he has just been yellow carded at that time.

&gt; Evra claims in his statement that he could not make himself utter the word ""n*gger"" to the referee, because it was so offensive. Yet, according to Sir Alex, the first thing he said was ""Boss, Suarez called me a n*gger."" (128). Then there is this video. I thought at first it was a fake, but after seeing the the original I think it has to be real (the first clip is 34-35 minutes out)

Really, no relevancy to it. Really, no relevancy to the case. 

But the reason why he changed from telling the ref that he was called ""black"" to then ""n*gger"" should have been (and might have been) called into question. I can only find a few items that calls that:

1. *Mr Evra's answer was that even when he pronounced the word ""n*ggers"", it was not a word he liked to use.*
2. *Mr Evra said that he thought ""nero"" meant ""black"", whereas ""negro"" meant ""n*gger"". This was what he 
thought from his knowledge of Italian,*
4. This was called bull by the Commission, because otherwise the case against Suarez would have been long gone. That was the reason why the focus shifted to the use of the term 'negro' as an affectionate or offensive use in the incident.

&gt; In addition to the Evra has a history of being controversial (as do Suarez, in fairness), and was banned for 4 matches for violent conduct, in which one of the defences (not made by Evra) were that he was racially abused. In the same case he was described as an unreliable witness.

Again, why do people keep bringing this up? The term *unreliable witness* does not call into account his *character content*, rather the consistency in their recollection of the event plus the collaboration to the picture. Evra self admitted that he used an offensive term despite no one else heard it and his story matches consistently. Suarez consistently gave inconsistent answers or tried to evade answering a question.

Also, while you are correct in asserting that this should have been a matter to be considered - *We mention it here in order to make clear that it has played no part in our consideration. This is because neither party suggested that it should. Mr McCormick did not submit that Mr Evra's evidence should be rejected because he had been shown to be unreliable in making accusations or giving evidence on any other occasion.* - Meaning Suarez's legal rep fucked up big time by failing to bring the Chelsea case charge up as a point of consideration thus the Commission have to ignore those.

&gt; Evra spoke on French TV, claiming he had been called a certain word at least 10 times. This was shrugged off with ""it's a figure of speach in French"" (159). Comolli, native French, contradicted this in his statement 

He didn't contradict the statement, he said it was inappropriate to use it in these circumstances looking at how serious the accusation was. The term ""10 times"" is a figure of speech in France (i.e. *He said that if his daughter asked him for a toy for Christmas and she says it five, six, seven times, he might say ""You already told me ten times""*) but this was not a good moment to use it. He also used it on the assumption that this was off the record and wasn't aware that it was being filmed.

So yes, Liverpool fan can sing ""We won the European Cup at least 10 times!"" if it so pleases them to be French.

They're all 'close' to the city and you can find cheap rooms there if you look hard enough.

As for bogans and clubs; to be honest I'm kind of the wrong guy to ask. I may well have clubbed more in Europe then here. There is a big variety of clubs and they are kind of regionalised. There's the strip club section of town. The casino. The clubs nestled amongst high rises. The 2 strips on the higher class end of the city and a couple of pockets to the North East and West. The latter are my semi-educated guesses for good, wanker free clubbing and decent music (if you're not after generic dance music). Those areas occupy a lot of niches, from gay bars to comedy / live venues while I've always been under the impression the other places I listed were of the more generic variety.

There is however a growing underground pseudo hippy / trendoid club culture growing wherever there is a free warehouse and the resources to use it. Also, I would say that our bar culture differs pretty heavily from Sweden's. Some of our pubs, prominently those that have space for live music, are club-like ... with large dance floors. But typically they don't run so late into the night.

As for what to do if you encounter bogans... it's not really so bad. Most are just culturally a bit backwards. I guess they're somewhere between the American stereotype of a jock and redneck. Common sense and their general body language should be enough to keep you clear of a tangle. They're pretty macho and they can be stupid and on bad drugs but they'll stick to their own and won't cause you much trouble unless you knock a beer out of their hand or make aggressive eye contact.

t5_2cneq,"&gt;All the fiat experiments failed. The USA and the EU is near collapse.

Just about every advanced economy on the planet uses fiat currency.  Why do you think the experiment ""failed""?  

&gt;Which ones?

Every large economy since the 80's. 

&gt;If they were easy to produce the price wouldn't be in the $1,500+ range.

I said it was increasingly easier.  And the price is that high because there are a lot of dicks like you who are doom saying about our economy and buying gold.  The price is based almost solely on speculation. 

What are the benefits of changing our economy over to a gold standard?  What is the biggest drawback?  I've never heard anyone articulate why the gold standard is better, they talk shit on fiat currency, but they never articulate the advantages of the gold standard.  

&gt;Just like the US, the rich there do not have the trillions to cover the debt.

You're spinning your tires.  Just admit that the German wealthy pay the lion's share of the taxes, just as the American wealthy pay the lions share of our taxes.  It's a fact, let's not argue about facts. 

&gt;When they talk about taxing the rich in the US, that's just to open the door on taxing everyone to cover SS, medicaid and the public sector retirements. 

Don't delude yourself. No one wants to tax the poor except conservatives looking to reduce the tax burden on the rich.  I'm as leftist as it gets, and I think the poor, middle class, and upper middle class are all overly taxed.  When I talk about increasing taxes on the rich, I mean only the rich.  Are your ideas so weak that they can only defeat straw men?  

&gt;And a fiat dollar makes that much much easier for them to rob from us our wealth.

How? 

Because when I think of how the government takes my money, it has nothing to do with the level of debt the government incurs.  In fact, the country's debt has increased dramatically while I've been alive and I actually pay less taxes now than I did a few years ago.  

The truth is that taxation is based on government tax policy, not monetary policy.  Whether you're paid in gold or dollars, how much the government takes is up to congress and taxes wouldn't be necessarily be smaller in a gold-backed economy.  

&gt;That's because RP types grasp the bigger picture.

If you fuckwits ""grasp"" the bigger picture, you could articulate it, they way I am, rather than relying on links to do the heavy lifting.  In fact, you people use links because you are intellectually lazy, incapable of articulating your argument, and/or completely new to politics.  

&gt;Liberal types can only win on the minutia of an argument. 

Or here, where I win by beating you at every possible turn on the main points, not the minutia.  

&gt;It destroys their fantasy. Open your mind. Watch the video.

Use your fingers.  Articulate the argument you want me to understand.  I'm not watching a video by a crack-pot amateur economist who is arguing a position I already understand and who stands to gain tremendous personal wealth from a return to the gold standard. 

&gt;Fail! Greece. Watch the video and you will understand why.

That's not an argument; you're being lazy.  Fact is that Greece is fine.  They're debt costs more, they have to reduce spending, and the old politicians are going to have to be held accountable for running the country into the ground.  Clearly Greece is going through tremendously challenging times but it's not quite Mad Max over there. Greece doesn't prove the failure of fiat currency, it proves that Greece fails.  No one is arguing that fiat currency cannot be applied or used unwisely.  I'm *am* arguing it is vastly superior to the gold standard.  

&gt;Yes it will. Watch the video.

No it won't.  Explain yourself you lazy conservative. 

&gt;And if their investment is T bills?

Did you read my statement?  I specifically said that those people investing in T-Bill will receive less of a return on their investment should a default occur.  I acknowledge that (that is who, after all, the government is defaulting to).  That is the risk investors take with T-bills; they are almost always completely safe but weakness in the government can increase the risk.  Every investor understands the inherent risk (although minimal) that t bills retain. 

&gt;If the govt cant pay off the t bills, how are they going to back your FDIC insured savings account when your bank fails!!! Watch the video!

I will not watch the video.  And you're right.  If the U.S. government collapses, and banks fail, savings will be wiped out.  If the U.S. government defaults however, the government **won't necessarily collapse.**  You're just saying that if the government and economy completely collapse, people's savings will be wiped out.  That's obviously true.  But you've changed your argument, earlier you were saying that debt generally causes savings to be wiped out.  Which isn't true.  Plenty of countries have huge debt:gdp ratios that have perfectly safe savings and aren't in any real danger of collapsing, namely Japan and the U.K. 

&gt;What is $15 trillion and $116 trillion in unfunded liabilities!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Numbers without context.  It depends on the debt to GDP ratio; and as I've said, we're at the point where our debt load is probably hurting growth.  And just to be clear, we agree that we should lower the debt.  I am not *in favor* of debt.  I just understand that it is a necessary part of a modern economy, just as debt is a natural part of business, just as credit cards are a natural part of a family economy.  

&gt;Who's going to lend us money forever

I'm not arguing that anyone is going to ""lend us money forever."" Try to understand my argument.  I'm saying that if we had a gold backed economy, we could still borrow money from foreign debtors, which is where a huge chunk of our debt comes from as it is.  Having gold money doesn't change a god damn thing; the government still has to be responsible.  Having a gold standard just prevents the government from printing money freely, but we're not really doing that anyway because it causes hyperinflation (we raise money via taxes and selling t-bills).

&gt; Stem cells are not and can't be harvested from aborted fetusses. Stem cells are derived from very early embryonic stages, after very few cell divisions. This is only possible in vitro, i.e. ""in a petri dish"". At that stage a woman wouldn't know she is pregnant (and technically, she wouldn't BE pregnant because the embryo wouldn't have been implanted in the uterus wall at that point - approx. four to five days after fertilisation).

&gt; Additionally, it is illegal in the US and Europe to generate embryos for the purpose of harvesting stem cells.

&gt; The ""stem cells are from aborted babies"" canard is a wholesale invention of the so-called pro-lifers.

And to the article you linked: First, this is only one study. It hasn't been shown yet that these cells really behave like ""true"" stem cells. Second, how do you think research like this is even possible? Without embryonic stem cell research we wouldn't know how to even try that. Adult stem cell research is based on embryonic stem cell research, too.

&gt;Why can't leia transmit the death star plans to the rebels using some unbreakable one time encryption?

Because we don't know that such an encryption even exists in the star wars universe? While this is a minor plot hole, it is not essential for us to know this to understand the plot.

I would imagine they jumped to hyperspace, you know, with the recently fixed hyperdrive? Han himself states throughout the movies that his ship can outrun imperial star destroyers.


&gt;If jabba lives on tatooine, wth was han doing there in the first place, rather than the other side of the galaxy?

Because he didn't know he had a price on his head until greedo came after him, moron. If you are going to look for plot holes, you should at least try to remember the movies more clearly.

&gt;Why did the alliance not just bring in a combat team to rescue General solo?

Probably because he didn't mean that much to them. It's a simple and logical decision.

&gt;Its damned lucky R2 wasn't stuffed in the kitchen peeling potatoes.

I don't even understand what you are trying to say here.

&gt;Why did the emperor, after losing the last death star due to a hole leading directly to the reactor, install a hole leading to the reactor again?

He didn't, you fucking moron. Have you even watched the star wars movies you are ""criticizing""?

t5_2cneq,"&gt;All the fiat experiments failed. The USA and the EU is near collapse.

&gt;Just about every advanced economy on the planet uses fiat currency. Why do you think the experiment ""failed""?

$15 trillion of debt. The EU and USA about to collapse. haven't you been reading the financial news!

&gt;Which ones?

&gt;Every large economy since the 80's.

The ones about to fail because they are backed by the dollar that's now backed by NOTHING!

&gt;If they were easy to produce the price wouldn't be in the $1,500+ range.

&gt;I said it was increasingly easier. And the price is that high because there are a lot of dicks like you who are doom saying about our economy and buying gold. The price is based almost solely on speculation.

No. One ounce of gold gets you what it got you 50 years ago. Only the dollar has lost it's value. Didn't you watch the video! Didn't you see him explain gasoline is now cheaper that it was 50 years ago!

&gt;What are the benefits of changing our economy over to a gold standard? 

The money becomes real and they cant easily rob us of it's buying power. it will always be worth something.

&gt;What is the biggest drawback? I've never heard anyone articulate why the gold standard is better, they talk shit on fiat currency, but they never articulate the advantages of the gold standard.

Precious physical metals makes it harder for them to rob us as they are doing now. Also, prices for things typically went down with gold. We were also richer on it. 

&gt;Just like the US, the rich there do not have the trillions to cover the debt.

&gt;You're spinning your tires. Just admit that the German wealthy pay the lion's share of the taxes, just as the American wealthy pay the lions share of our taxes. It's a fact, let's not argue about facts.

I never said they didn't. I'm saying all the rich in the world dont have enough money to pay off the debts. You didn't watch the video!

&gt;When they talk about taxing the rich in the US, that's just to open the door on taxing everyone to cover SS, medicaid and the public sector retirements.

&gt;Don't delude yourself. No one wants to tax the poor except conservatives looking to reduce the tax burden on the rich. I'm as leftist as it gets, and I think the poor, middle class, and upper middle class are all overly taxed. When I talk about increasing taxes on the rich, I mean only the rich. Are your ideas so weak that they can only defeat straw men?

Doesnt matter WHAT you think. The Progressives KNOW the rich dont have enough money to cover the unfunded liabilities of SS, medicare, and the retirements of the public sector! Just look at the very bottom line of this chart..  http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 

Your just in denial of the real world and NEED the fiat currency to work, eh? www.usdebtclock.org/ 

&gt;And a fiat dollar makes that much much easier for them to rob from us our wealth.

&gt;How?

* Go talk to your favorite professor and ask if he/she has any contacts that might hire you.  This will take care of the connections.
* Find the career office at your school. Ask for help with your resume/CV/cover letter. Ask for internship listings.
* Find some companies that you think are cool and look at the jobs page. If they are a big company, they usually have a internship listing.  If they are small and start-up sized, e-mail the person you think you'd like to work with.  No bad can come of you just e-mailing them.

* Have you thought about international internships?  A lot of really cool companies love having international interns. How about working for BMW in Munich? Or maybe Rolls-Royce in England? VW? EADS? All of them love international interns (especially since you obviously are English speaking). That's how I got some of my internships, plus working in Europe is awesome!
* In terms of making your resume better, try to do some research projects at your school, outside of class time. Shows initiative and expands your skills base at the same time. Good combo!

Our debt isn't the result of our monetary policies.  It's the result of inefficient government programs, unwise spending, and giveaways to the super rich.  Bad policy got us here.  Not bad currency.  

&gt;The ones about to fail because they are backed by the dollar that's now backed by NOTHING!

The dollar has value still.  Stop being infantile.  If you think your money is worthless, give it to me.  And no countries are about to fail.  A failed state does not look like the U.S., Greece, or Iceland.  A failed country looks like pre-invasion Afghanistan, or Somalia.  So does that mean when the world doesn't cave in you'll admit that you're wrong about fiat currency?  At the moment, the U.S. is back to growing, EU is working its way out of the debt crisis, and worldwide we're doing great. 

&gt;No. One ounce of gold gets you what it got you 50 years ago

That's not true; through speculation the price of that ounce of gold has gone up 750 percent since the 70's. [Source.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_otfwl2zc6Qc/TJ9WNLUlewI/AAAAAAAAOdQ/XfeRaJnuo-c/s1600/gold.jpg) 

&gt;Only the dollar has lost it's value. 

No one's disputing the existence of inflation. 

&gt;Didn't you watch the video! Didn't you see him explain gasoline is now cheaper that it was 50 years ago!

Didn't you read my post?  I specifically told you I wasn't going to watch the video. 

&gt;The money becomes real and they cant easily rob us of it's buying power. it will always be worth something.

The ""value"" of gold is based on speculation.  It will always be worth something, but only in that people like to wear gold jewelery and it has modest industrial uses.  Almost all it's current value is based on speculation.  

Also, as I've explained and you have yet to even acknowledge, having a gold-backed currency doesn't stop the government from incurring debt and it doesn't stop the government from heavily taxing the citizenry.  How do you think people are being robbed by fiat currency?  By their money's devaluation through inflation or through deficit-spending that necessitates increased taxation, or both?   You're not being very precise.  

But whatever your argument, you can't avoid debt by backing our currency in gold.  Either way, whether you have a fiat or gold-backed economy, you need to have wise policy.  The only thing having a gold-backed economy prevents is government simply printing money to raise revenues but we don't do this because we know how destructive it is.  

In other words, the only benefit to a gold-backed economy, how it prevents printing-press revenue generation, is irrelevant since we don't follow those policies.  

&gt;Precious physical metals makes it harder for them to rob us as they are doing now

Yeah you've said that already.  Explain yourself. HOW does it make it harder? 

&gt;so, prices for things typically went down with gold. 

[That's absolutely not true.](http://theintrinsicvalue.com/images/2011/03/US-Income-Percentage-spend-on-food-History.png)

As you can see, prices trended down regardless of the basis of the currency.  And have continued to fall despite coming off the gold standard in the 70's.  If anything, food prices are falling more steadily after shifting to a fiat currency.  

&gt;We were also richer on it. 

[That's also absolutely not true.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZCbQN9cL-iQ/TJMGghU8TqI/AAAAAAAAAUg/I8m1K1F1Yoo/s1600/U.S.+GDP+per+Capita+in+Chained+Dollars+over+Time+%282005+Dollars%29.jpg)

Per capita GDP is higher now than when we went off the gold standard and has increase quicker since shifting to a fiat currency.  

You're wrong about these two factual claims.  Do you acknowledge that? 

&gt;I'm saying all the rich in the world dont have enough money to pay off the debts. You didn't watch the video!

I WILL NEVER WATCH THAT STUPID VIDEO.  Understand that.  

And I understand better than most that the rich don't have enough money to pay off the debts.  No one's arguing they do.  

I'm saying that to pay off our debt we need to take a number of actions.  

First, we need to not do the stupid shit that got us into this mess.  Going forward, we should ensure that large spending projects are paid for.  So we shouldn't finance 2 wars on a credit card.  We should slash taxes without any way of paying for it.  We shouldn't pass a massive unfunded prescription drug bill.  

Second, we need to cut spending.  Our inefficient healthcare system needs a rework.  We could save money by changing to a single payer system.  We also need to dramatically cut military spending.  Personally, I'd keep research and development and special forces, and slash all other areas; I'd close foreign military bases, reduce the size of the standing military, and decrease procurement.  

Third, I'd invest much more in scientific research and education. This would increase the ""innovation"" dividend (the increased benefits, production and tax revenues from technological advancement).

Fourth, I'd tax the rich properly.  Go back to the tax system of the 50's and 60's.  Lots of brackets - there's no reason someone making $300k a year should pay the same % as someone making $10 million a year.  And I'd increase capital gains and the estate tax.  I might even add a consumption tax for luxury goods.  

All of that combined will lower the debt and increase the quality of life for everyone.  I don't just advocate taxing the rich to get us out of this.  You and your video are fighting a straw man. NOBODY advocates taxing the rich as the only way out of debt. 

&gt;The Progressives KNOW the rich dont have enough money to cover the unfunded liabilities of SS, medicare, and the retirements of the public sector!

That's true.  I am a progressive and I know that.  Which is why I, and many of my progressive friends, favor a comprehensive approach.  I will repeat, *nobody* favors **only** taxing the rich.  Properly taxing the rich is part of the solution, not the whole thing. 

&gt;Your just in denial of the real world and NEED the fiat currency to work, eh? www.usdebtclock.org/

I'm absolutely not in denial about anything.  I understand the debt is too high and acknowledge that it is probably hurting growth (or at least soon will).  You don't understand why we went to a fiat currency in the first place and you don't understand it's benefits over the gold standard.  

&gt;$15 trillion of debt. www.usdebtclock.org/ Try and keep up!

You are a parrot aren't you? 

&gt;I'm done with you. 

Quitter. 

&gt;You are in such denial of the debt we owe and the ability of the rich to pay for it all! 

You suck at reading.  WE ARE IN LOTS OF DEBT.  THE RICH CAN'T PAY IT OFF ON THEIR OWN.  I KNOW THIS.  Is that clear enough for you?  Are your ideas so weak that you must misrepresent my argument? 

&gt;Don't watch the video. It will destroy the special little world you live in!

Everything in that video I've already heard.  I fully understand the argument for ending the fed and having a gold backed economy.  I'm not going to devote a large percentage of a day to watching the video, when you could just summarize the relevant parts for me (which you've actually been doing the whole time I suspect).  

Walk away.  Remember who walked away.  Remember how lost you felt.  Remember that I remained ready to test my ideas and you left because deep down you knew you could not face the challenge.

Germany was drawn into war by the Jews. They forced Germany to defend itself against international jewery.

Hitler was assassinated in Berlin at the end of the war by a Jewish agent supported by the communists. Hitler had fought to the end, betrayed by his generals, and fled only to be assassinated at a roadblock.

The only reason Germany lost the war, was because the Jews succeeded in plotting first Britain, then America to join the war.

Jews still control everything. From banks to governments, there is a Jewish council behind everything.

1.) The U.S. is not Greece. The reason we're not Greece is -- and this is  the point of the article -- that our net obligations to our debtors are less than our debtors' obligations to us. You're looking at the debt side of the picture without looking at the asset side of the picture. 

2.) If you think Krugman doesn't care about debt, I don't think you really read him that often. Krugman's whole thesis is that in the short term, recession is vastly more devastating to the economy than debt -- not that debt is irrelevant. His point is that if you try to cut the debt during a recession, all you do is exacerbate the recession. This is in clear evidence with European austerity measures. Long term debt is negligibly lower, but GDP is sinking like a rock due to a decrease in production. Debt-reduction is important, but not when you're in a recession with near-0 interest rates.

3.) Gas prices have actually been dropping since Sept 2010. They're currently at 2007 levels. Food prices have been increasing for some time, but not substantially differently than they've been rising for the past 50 years. If debt were such a bit contributor to food price inflation, wouldn't there be some sort of non-linear effect in the data?

I don't know how many of you ever felt like I do, every damn day of the week. What other choice do I have than to do what I always have done, eat.
Yeah exercise and eat healthy foods. Sounds brilliant and it might just work for many(I have a friend who was way fatter than me, his determination eventually lost him almost 60 percent body fat, through walking and eating healthy, I'm proud of him) but personally, I'm a lazy fuck and others have a disorder or whatever other reason. But every time I take that bite I get more and more depressed, I loathe myself for every bit of fat, On good days I can look at myself in the mirror and say, not too shabby, on worse days, I want to end it all.

t5_2cneq,"&gt; Now they are corporate mouth pieces and ""news"" is subordinate to profit, political views and entertainment and what people are told as ""truth"" is actually lies.

This is an oversimplification. The media is not in the business of lying to people. It's in the business of selling airtime. The lying and distortion of new is not an end in itself. It's a just one way of selling more airtime.

So the real question here is, why do the american people not realize that they are being constantly lied to? Why do so many of them consistently vote against their own interests? Why can't they just get off their asses and *try* to validate their beliefs with reality?

I don't have all the answers but I can think of a few reasons. One is religion. Being more religious than most other developed nations means that what the church decrees as important matters more in America than everywhere else. This is why people will not vote for a perfectly good candidate simply because he ""supports"" gay marriage. 

Another is american insularity. An unfortunate fact is that many americans simply don't know enough about how the rest of the world works. The most recent example of this was the health care debate. Socialized medicine is used pretty much everywhere in the world, and works really well. Even ridiculously poorly governed countries like India have [great government subsidized hospitals](http://www.aiims.edu/). Yet many americans believe that ""Obamacare"" will lead to death panels. I can only think of one good reason for holding such a poorly informed belief. They don't fucking care about how anything works anywhere outside America. 

A third might be the belief in American exceptionalism. I often hear American politicians say America is the greatest country on earth. I even heard one republican say that America has the greatest health-care system on earth. There's nothing wrong with this and is, of course, partially true. Yet, the belief that america and americans are great means that americans are less willing to listen to what works in other parts of the world. This is probably the reason why the phone and internet companies in the US suck balls compared to those in Europe.

They've been ignoring the problem for almost 20 years! Portugal bailed itself out when it wasn't even necessary! Does that sound like good economic policy to you? And these countries linked themselves financially, so it's become one giant incestuous cluster fuck. I feel bad for countries like Germany, who have kept up their end of the bargain. You want to pin this on America, but the truth is far less convenient. When you have a mixture of responsible countries (Germany, Austria, Finland) mixed with bone-headedly irresponsible countries (Spain, Greece, Ireland, Portugal), but refuse to put any teeth behind the governing of these countries, you will have serious problems. They don't have the proper backing and teeth to make the (what I would consider strong and good) economic and political regulations that had set up actually mean anything. And it's easy to be irresponsible when you know someone else will have to help you up.

t5_2qj8f,"1.  The vast majority of violists have never heard a Stradivarius in person.  

2.  The Stradivarius is long past being the top instrument for violinists, they are too weak sounding for major performances.

3.  The difference in sound quality in most high-end violins is tiny.  You can even buy (have made) brand new replicas that have identical wear (look identical) as a famous violin and have similar sound quality.  Orchestras do this all time so they don't have the liability of a performer playing an original instrument.

4.   The name 'Stradivarius' is really something non-violinists think about when they think about violins.  The reality is there are many, many makers, both old and new that are comparable in sound and superior in quality to a Stradivarius.

5.  Violins in general are some of the most over priced instruments.  There is a HUGE emotional and status component to the name / brand of the instrument.  Many dealers know this and are notorious for adding fake labels to increase the sales price of the instrument.  In many cases violins from China out perform mature European violins and sell for a tenth of the price, I personally know of cases where European labels were added to Chinese instruments. 

6.  A dealer I know, when questioned about his ruthless pricing said, ""I don't sell violins, I sell dreams"".  This really opened my eyes about the marketing of premium goods.  He makes a very good living selling dreams. 

There is a joke among violin dealers....

t5_2qofe,"It seems to me like you've already made up your mind about Finland, which is totally fine. I would however like to take a stand for my home country. First, a little background: Lived in Finland all my life. Work for a Swedish company, speak the language and have been over more times than I can remember. Have a few close friends who have moved to Sweden. Know quite a few people who have been working in Norway.

**The attitude towards foreigners** - I'd have to disagree with Tommix11 on this matter. First of all, *hostile* is definitely not the word I'd use to describe the average Finn's attitude towards foreigners. Actually, the stereotypical Finn is very curious about foreigners and interested in hearing about what they know about Finland. Especially if you're from Northern America. In reality, I'd say the stereotype is not entirely true, but not very far from either. Yes, there are some people, especially out in the country-side, who aren't very happy about immigrants, but as a rule, you're fine as long as you're a productive member of society. It also depends a lot where you're from and (I'm sad to say it) what your complexion is. Also, don't wear a turban.

Unfortunately, you'll find the same acrimony towards foreigners in both Sweden and Norway as well. Many Norwegians, especially the well educated and wealthy, can be condescending towards foreigners working in positions 'below their own standards' (shop clerks, bus drivers, cleaners, etc.), and from what I've been led to understand, more so than in Sweden or Finland. And even if Sweden probably is the country that is most welcoming to foreigners, there are some that aren't happy about the amount of immigrants and they can be very vocal about it.

**The language** - Difficult but not impossible. People are generally very understanding and happy as long as you try to speak it. You don't have to be fluent to get around. Most people understand English quite well and can speak it to some degree. Proper English pronunciation is generally difficult for a native Finnish speaker though, so it might sound a bit rough.

**The climate** - First of all, it's not worse than Sweden or Norway (can't speak for Denmark or Iceland). Depending on where you stay in any of the three countries, during the winter you'll experience everything from rainy British-style weather to fuck-it's-so-cold-my-eyelids-are-frozen-shut. Summers are generally OK everywhere, albeit shorter the higher up north you go. The worst part of the climate in this corner of the world is undoubtedly the darkness. This goes for all three countries.

**The location** - Sure, we're the easternmost of the aforementioned countries but it's dead easy (and cheap) to get to most places in Europe and people from here really do travel a lot. Low budget airlines will get you to Germany, England, France, Spain, Italy, etc. for as low as 50€ in a couple of hours. The Scandinavian countries are easily accessible through Sweden, to which ferries will take you from either Helsinki or Turku. It's also possible to get to Estonia (and from there to the rest of the Baltic countries) by ferry. Russia can be experienced simply by hopping on a train on the new railway between Helsinki and St. Petersburg.

**Actually living in Finland** - Life is simple here. As with the rest of the countries you're considering, there's a social structure and a safety-net in place to help you in all stages of your life. Living standards are high, crime rates are low, the education is world-class and the infrastructure is good. You definitely don't have to be macho enough to fight bears to survive.

t5_2qh0r,"&gt;Let's face it... Ron Paul is a one term President.

He himself would likely be (because of age), yes.  But a properly selected VP could carry the torch for another 2 terms.

As to him being a one-term President because of the effect of his policies -- on that I think you are wrong.

**Do NOT discount the probability of a RAPID recovery of the economy:** we have at least 3 past US precedents for ""taking your lumps"" (instead of the dozens of examples of Keynesian stimulus = prolonged malaise), to wit:

1. The post WWI Harding administration -- which did very much the kind of thing that Ron Paul is suggesting: dramatic cuts.  The result was that while other nations (which f'ed around with other things) experienced prolonged depressions, the US downturn was sharp &amp; painful, but over within about a year. And while Harding didn't even finish his single term of office, his VP (Coolidge) finished the term and then followed with (alas only) one additional term of his own (had he only stood for re-election instead of giving way to Hoover, the Great Depression and everything that followed probably could have been averted).

2. The post WWII Truman administration -- with FDR being dead &amp; gone, and while Truman didn't eliminate all of the New Deal, he *did* rollback the whole War/Command economy, including the dramatic (huge) return &amp; release of millions of GI's (which Keynesians claimed would lead to economic disaster -- instead we entered one of our most prosperous eras {yes the rebuilding of Europe was also key, but I think not as key as many assume, most production stayed and filled/fueled domestic demand}).

3. The post-stagflation Reagan administration (arguable the ""Volcker"" era) -- initially this meant sky high interest rates and inflation (the ""realization"" of inflation that had already occurred in the LBJ &amp; Nixon/Ford/Carter eras) -- but it DID lead to a recovery (which, alas was then almost totally fucked up by the Bush shenanigans, including the HUGE increase in the payroll tax, and the xfer of advantages to the financial sector).

---

&gt;I'm thirty-seven, so I barely remember Reagan's election, and Ford was either a car -- or something that was written on candy from the gumball machine. 

That is a GOOD parallel to cite.

Reagan had a LOT of similarities to Ron Paul -- both are older, both are/were disliked (immensely) by the ""establishment GOP"" and both were thus characterized as ""outside of mainstream Republicans"" and even ""crazy"".

Reagan also faced a Romney-like ""formidable"", well-funded, and well-connected establishment-favored opponent in George W. Bush.  The entire pre-convention primary campaign was a long one, with one round after another of them going at each other.

Yet despite all of those things, Reagan emerged triumphant over Bush (only to be subverted by the compromise of bringing Bush on as VP {and alas, along with his team; but that is another story}).

t5_2qh1e,"Well before you ride off on your high horse, I think there is more than a simple ""mentality"" in the USA in regards to learning multiple languages.  I absolutely agree with your point that majority of Americans don't regularly speak a 2nd language - however, I don't concur with your ""mentality"" point.

I have spent a decent amount of time in Europe (just over 2 years) and I was initially blown away that most Europeans speak at LEAST a second language and sometimes more like 5 or 6.  However, I found that this was out of necessity due to travel, work or study rather than an enlightened ""mentality"" or higher intelligence. 

For example: By traveling within a radius of just 500 miles from Munich Germany, you would encounter at least 4 or 5 different languages.  500 miles in the United States would get you from Phoenix to Los Angeles.  Beyond Spanish (only really limited to border towns), there just is no necessity to know a number of different languages in the United States.  Further more, due to the geographic isolation of the United States from other countries with diverse languages - even if one were to study a language in school (say French or German), the knowledge is quickly lost without using it regularly.

So again, I agree with a general lack of bi-lingual Americans, however I attribute it to geography rather than a ""mentality"" - but that is just my opinion.

t5_2qh41,"I recommend finding yourself a Rick Steves guidebook of Europe if you can.  Not sure if they are sold down under.

He has multiple guides - best of Europe, regional trips, specific regions, specific countries, single cities.  Depends on what you're looking for.  Walking guides per city, as well as restaurants/hotels/hostels.  I'm sure there are decent Aussie brands as well.

The best places I have been to, in no particular order:

Italy:
Rome of course.  Spent a week there and still didn't see everything.  Saw a lot though, it was great!
Venice was underwhelming, mainly because I didn't know the waterbuses cost way more for tourists...otherwise it's nice.  Murano has awesome glass sculptures/art.
Florence was great - there is a lot of history and culture here.  The Duomo, the Uffizi, the Pitti Palace.
 
France:
Paris.  Because it's Paris.  The museums are here are great, and the history is excellent.  Lots of culture.
Bordeaux:  Eh.  Good for day trips though.  Arcachon was neat.  Largest sand dune in Europe - I didn't even know Europe had sand dunes til I went there (it's on the coast).
If you're into cave paintings, Lascaux II is a recreation of the most famous paintings found in Europe (recreated to preserve the original).
The Riviera.  Cannes, Nice (Matisse Museum), Antibes.  Lots of beaches, better in the summer, better during the film festival.  Monaco was pretty cool!

Germany: 
Munich - great food, lots of fun travelers about, can day trip to Fussen to see Neuschwanstein.
Baden-Baden - if you want to relax, there are two famous bathhouses here.  Otherwise there isn't much.  Three days was too much.

Austria:
Salzburg (awesome castle - Hohenfestung Salzburg, a great mountain - Untersberg), lots of food and fun people.  Very nice city.
Hallstatt (very scenic, but tends to shutdown around any Christian holidays, so be aware of that.  Known for the trout, but only in the summer.
Vienna (great museums/culture, decent sausages), very cosmopolitan. May be on the expensive side for some things. You can get cheap tickets to the opera the day of the show if you don't mind standing room only. 
 
Czech Republic:
Prague was great.  Cheap beer, decent food, lots to see.  I went on a communism tour which included a stop at a nuclear bunker.  Good stuff!  Lots of history here, although not all of it is happy.
You'll probably be approached by homeless people in the old town square if you're eating.  They just want food and won't leave you alone until you give them some.

Hungary:
Budapest was great.  Lots to do, lots to see, decent food, great people.  I recommend airbnb.com - souper apartment Minestrone.  It's about 5 minutes from the opera/main drag and 10 minutes from the main transit hub to all the sites / the airport.  Awesome place, nice and cheap.

I highly recommend either doing a contiki tour if you want to go with a company, or just plan it all yourself.  You can either get a Eurail pass and hop a train whenever you like, or look at bus tickets (even cheaper than the train).  To go from Vienna to Budapest cost approximately $25 US.  Can't beat it.

All the cities I listed are the ones I enjoyed the most. Not necessarily for the things to do, which ARE great, but because of the people I met, mainly backpackers like myself at the time.

t5_2qh13,"&gt; The field itself would do well for itself and its integrity by calling itself what it used to be called, ""political economy.""

Your objection to the field of economics as a whole is freakishly similar to an authoritative criticism of what has become *mainstream economics* by Austrian School icon, and free market hero Ludwig Von Mises.  The similarity is astounding.  It's chapter 38 of his opus [Human Action](http://mises.org/books/humanactionscholars.pdf).  You can also read a relevant page [here](http://mises.org/humanaction/chap38sec2.asp).

&gt; Oh...my. First of all, slavery was a market-based institution.

Oh, my, indeed.  The most radical libertarians view all rights as property rights beginning with the notion championed by Hans Hermann Hoppe that every human being is the sole and exclusive owner of his own body.  Slavery violates this principle.

Even less studied libertarians usually begin with natural rights and the notion that the initiation of force is always wrong (even when exercised by the state).  Slavery is also anti-thetical to them.

&gt; Secondly, laissez-faire capitalism has destabilizes entire societies, moves people off their lands via violence.

Nope.  It takes the government to do that.  You're confusing corporatism with free market capitalism.  In a free market, all a company can do is offer you goods and services.  It takes the violence of government to transfer your taxes to corporations, to squash and smother competition with regulation, to bail them out when they get in trouble, to take you property under eminent domain when they want to build a shopping mall.

&gt; and leaves people with nothing

Capitalism has been the greatest producer of wealth the world has ever seen.  It has ended famine in Europe.  Within our lifetimes, the lessening of property rights abuses by Chinese and Indian governments has lifted hundreds of millions of people from poverty.

Yes, I read Black Swan.  He criticized the chaos of the banking industry.  It is the consequence of decades of government subsidy of irresponsible behavior.  When government bails out every politically connected firm who gets into trouble, we shouldn't be surprised when they begin taking greater and greater risks.

Economics died long before the finance industry took hold of it as depicted in ""Inside Job.""  People who get caught up in the world as portrayed in that film become what Lenin called ""Useful Idiots.""  They advocate more government control as a solution to problems government created.

For a good explanation of the recent economic crisis (whose second wave has yet to strike), I recommend Meltdown by Tom Woods.

For the Austrian Economic criticism of economics, I'd refer to to chapter 38 of Human Action, linked above, and pages xx to xxii of the Introduction to the Second Edition of [Rothbard's Man, Economy, and State].

The free market does not do any of the horrible things you cited.  Government does those things, then it gets people to blame freedom and beg for more control.

Also, strictly to indulge your interest.  For an essay (audio available too) criticizing Marx's rejection of economics, go [here](http://mises.org/daily/4538).

You seem to think that country can evolve only if it sucks life out of other countries and this same country will most definitely become a shithole if someone else decides to occupy it. I disagree. Let's look at the same old Europe. The Baltic states, Slovakia and Czech Republic. Poland and Austria. They all were being occupied and beaten for centuries. Lithuania springs in mind as those guys were right in the middle between the Central Europe and Russians. Crusades kept coming. Then cossacks. Then Russia, during WWI. They literally banned the language for many years. Then Nazi Germans came. Then Russia again. A bit of Poland too. Yet somehow they are doing pretty damn well now.

Some level of minimum wage (e.g. social safety net, or welfare state) is good just as some level of taxes are good to address externalities and such.  Excessive minimum however wage can smother an economy.  Minimum wage is a tax on one group to the benefit of another.  It is no different than levying a sales tax on the products made by companies that employ workers that make less than $X/hr and paying the proceeds of those taxes to the same employees.  Ultimately the consumers pay the tax that benefit the workers.  That may not always be bad in the whole, but the choice of where to draw the line is critical, since the middle class (who bears most of the burden of this tax) must support increase costs without due increase in their own income.  The line is defined by regulation, and not the market, so it is an inherent market distortion.

It is unlikely that the SF minimum wage will have any effect, as the market value of labor is quite high already (due to the high cost of living.)  Exert that same minimum wage on a depressed local economy elsewhere, and watch that economy collapse.

t5_2qh1i,"I am certain this will be downvoted to oblivion but, I've ""*cheated*"" on my current gf who I plan on marrying in a few years.

My reasoning was I felt that I hadn't experienced enough of the opposite sex, I felt like I hadn't really had a ""worldly experience"" so, it just sort of happened organically. I did not want to get to the end of my life and have regrets, and they say you regret the things you didn't do more than the things you did.

I ended up with a Swedish girl, Romanian girl and a middle eastern girl when I was in Europe travelling around alone. The swedish and romanian girls were absolutely stunning, and I'd always had a thing for olive skinned girls so the middle eastern one was a kind of fantasy. They were one night events and that was all I was looking for, it wasn't about love, just indulgence and desire.

Do I regret it? Not really, if I went back in time I would do it again.  But I am over that stage in my life now, given the opportunity I wouldn't today. I've done it, and it's out of my system. I'm not a jerk by any means, and am very considerate of my gfs feelings. I was 100% sure that she would never find out, which is all that I was concerned with. If she has/does cheat on me and I never find out, I don't really care. I can't care if I don't know, so it doesn't matter to me. I don't think about it, or worry about it.

I don't ever plan on it happening again, it was one of those things where, like I said, you want to get it out of your system. People and society (especially the older generations) put a lot of emphasis on monogomy, but it's not really ""natural"" for human beings to be monogomous. I always found it a strange concept, to stay with 1 person your entire life, but as I'm growing older it starts to make more sense.

I'm sure I probably come off like an asshole, but if I can give any advice, if you really feel like you are missing something, like you haven't fucked enough women and you really want to marry your current gf, just go do it as soon as possible, because those feelings won't go away until you do something about it.

Art or beauty is not the problem. The problem is that the Europeans that brought Catholicism to America also brought their medieval tradition of church one-upsmanship.

t5_2qh2p,"&gt; This is not why the war started though. It started because Germany had to pay back all this money because of the treaty of versailles.

That's been a popular view, and certainly argued by Nazis themselves, but it's fallen out of favour with historians due to the available evidence which shows payments were relatively lenient - that the problem was lack of political will in Germany to make those payments (particularly since they didn't accept the war guilt clause).  See:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles#Historical_assessments

AJP Taylor argues that the European war was primarily driven by anti-communism.  Communism was highly popular among many Germans (Bavaria became a temporary Soviet state after the war), and was making political ground in Germany as a whole.  In addition, the the Holodomor terrified the German middle class, which then clamoured for strong government to crush communism.

Taylor's argument is that what Hitler wanted was a German takeover of Eastern Europe (to crush Bolshevism primarily, but also to obtain resources for Germany's overheated economy), and that he mistakenly believed that the West would support him in this (despite what they said in public).

edit: It may also explain the religious message in the belt buckle and in Hitler's speech - if the communists are godless, well, Germany would have god on its side.",t1_c3de7db,1325571938,0,True,t1_c3dgscq,,True,atheism,t3_o0e4l,False,1428115562,1,0,dopplerdog,0,,c3dgscq,,1

t5_2qh0u,"A lot of people love IPAs. They're probably the most popular non-lager style after stout, and have been extremely fashionable for quite a while now. Mass-market beer is virtually all light lager, the yellow fizzy stuff. I brew and like lagers, but more of the European styles. American lagers have practically no flavor, and generally low bitterness.

Bitterness is an acquired taste for a lot of people. One thing I will point out is that there is a big difference between the bitterness of hops and the flavor of hops. Before I got seriously into beer, I found beers like Anchor Steam overwhelmingly bitter. But actually, much of the strong flavor of AS is hop flavor, not bitterness.  AS has a bitterness of 30-35, which is moderate, though MGD is around 12 and Bud Light is 7. So if you're used to light lagers, the stronger stuff does indeed take some getting used to.

IPAs typically clock in at 40-60, but Americans' fetish for cranking up the knobs to 11 on everything has produced an arms race of ever-more-bitter beers. Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA and Stone Ruination are good examples; fantastically bitter.

Try the Hungarian liquer ""Unicum"" some time. Nothing will ever taste bitter to you again after that harrowing experience.

t5_2qhov,"I can understand if you don't like the Dunsmuir/Hornby bike lane because it is personally inconvenient for you, but your dismissal of cycling as a legitimate transportation option is extremely naive and detrimental for good urbanism. Consider the positive academic research and the several benefits North American cities (e.g. Portland, San Francisco, New York) are seeing when planning for bicycles, rather than automobiles. Western Europe (e.g. Copenhagen) speaks for itself. 

Speaking strictly in the downtown context: considering bicycles are great for short to medium-length trips and downtown has the sufficient density and land mix to support these trips, we should start laying down the infrastructure now to support future mode share growth. It costs a hell lot less than SkyTrain expansion/LRT/streetcar in the downtown. Car traffic downtown has been on a downward trend for awhile now. I'm glad you want to see more funding for transit, but improving active transportation in a pedestrian heavy downtown makes sense.

We're never going to reach the goals set out in the 1997 Transportation Plan passed by the NPA council at the time if we aren't serious in changing how transportation works in the city. It's also going to take time, but ensuring the infrastructure is in place is crucial.

The City has already been working on improving the bike lanes based on the findings from the Stantec business impact report back in July 2011. The bike lanes aren't perfect, but at the same time they are not the utter failure some people want them to be. I don't know what kind of numbers you will trust then, since it is virtually the same method any municipality or transit authority would be using to count. If you think the City is fudging those numbers, you should do something about it. Making policy decisions based on antedocal statements like ""empty 80% of the time"" doesn't cut it.

You have already made up your mind on bicycles, so whatever I say isn't going to do much. And note, I'm not a regular cyclist.

t5_2qh1i,"&gt;The only reason we'd have to pay to ""feed, clothe, and home"" them would be if they couldn't find work

Because the farms that can't afford to pay minimum wage to normal americans are going to give the influx of immigrants jobs such that they'll be able to purchase housing and basic necessities. Earning minimum wage nets you a 15k salary minus any type of tax or social security. With one worker in a family of four, that family would be below poverty line. Add in a second worker, and that family sits 8k above poverty line. Who steps in to take care of their kids while they work? 8k a year is insufficient for most to provide the care those kids need (afterschool programs paid for by tax payers normally does the rest). In fact, mimimum wage has been shown to be insufficient to raise a family even with two workers in the family in suburban/urban areas where the cost of living is higher. You can't expect all the immigrants to live on farms?

Where does this money come from? From the unwilling?

&gt;And they pay taxes.

The top 50% of americans pay for ~98% of the income tax. They'll pay taxes, but it'll be entirely negligible if they're unskilled labor.

&gt;Such a change would almost certainly be the result of a vote; in this hypothetical, ""we"" means ""you"".

It is not a hypothetical. It's called reality. The reason the republicans can harp on scapegoats, like illegal immigration, is because it is an issue that starkly divides americans. The nay is much more vocal than the yes. It is reality that we are not interested in more immigrants. It's the hypothetical that the majority of americans are for opening up our borders wider than they already are. If it is then reality that the majority is against it, then it becomes forced charity.

&gt;There would be nothing to stop us from closing our borders again if the number of people became too many to handle. California and Texas were added when we had a much, much weaker federal government.

First prove, or even less, convince people that we need to open up our borders. That is not going to ever be a reality if illegal immigration continues to drive americans away from legal immigration. We, unlike european countries, are not going to suffer from a population collapse anytime soon. Our TFR is enough to replenish our population.

&gt;Keep in mind we do have a minimum wage.

Perhaps you'd like to be a little more specific. I'm saying that if we continue to dilute the wage of unkilled laborers, they'd end up at minimum wage, or even below. It's a reality that employers will pay under the table. And even if they don't, one worker in a family of four who works a single minimum wage job sits well below the poverty line. 18,000 kids are estimated to be homless in orange county, california alone. There's already a lack of normal jobs available for these kids' parents. Where are you suggesting we find this new spring of charity?

&gt;The idea of an American Dream originated largely from the immigrants coming to the United States in hope of finding it. What do we have now holding us together?

t5_2qh6p,"Just responding to your comment on social science disciplines. Having a major in one of those fields this is annoying. There isn't some left-wing conspiracy in these fields, it's annoying to be an American and thought of as left wing simply because I've read Marx and think he made some insightful observations. Many of the most famous sociological works are based on empirical evidence i.e. Durkheim's work on religion and suicide or the Kinsey report. Yes many of these studies cause us to question ""traditional"" values as useful. Instead of just dismissing the entire field as ""left wing trough and through"" maybe you should question why they seem that way and actually read the material with an open mind.

In many ways I can understand why the stereotypical conservative doesn't understand. The sociology of religion will tell you that yes, religion can effect the moral values of society, but that society can also change the values of their religion or reorder their importance or otherwise manipulate them. You can then understand why the social sciences are critical of evangelical politicians then (Rick Perry's video for example) or christian fundamentalists, because in reality religious values are not as iron clad as a preacher tells you (most christian women now have pre marital sex and use BC for example) and extremely fickle and based on what society is worried about. But I understand why conservatives don't understand that and percieve it as ""left-wing through and through"" because they're told that the Bible never changes, when in reality it's simply a scientist responding to empirical data telling them that interpretations of any religious document are apt to change. This is based off of data. For example many European countries have very high per capita GDP's (strong economy/ standard of living) but also many are have the ""happiest"" or ""most satisfied/ content lifeviews."" These stats aren't made up and these countries in the U.S. are called socialist (even though they're soc dem mostly). Meanwhile economic inequality has skyrocketed since Reagan and mental illness is on the rise in the U.S., you look at the data and then wonder why social ""scientists"" question the effectiveness of conservative fiscal policy and it's effect on the well being of the individuals in that society.

As a wrap, I'm not defending how opinionated the social sciences are because it is extremely opinionated, but  these opinions aren't formed like Rush Limbaugh's, they're based off of often times shit tons of empirical data, years of study, and thousands of pages of reading or hours of personal research, this is often why conservatives are ridiculed for being uneducated but when you dismiss an entire field(s) of study so easily you wonder why you're ridiculed.... It's hard to hear your belief system is quaint and antiquated but it's also hard to listen to someone that doesn't know what they're talking about say a field is biased simply because it doesn't agree with their paradigm especially when the only books on their coffee table come from O'Reilly, Beck or Savage.

While drunk I admitted I wanted to ""date"" the women I had one-nighters with, as I knew all of them beforehand and liked them a lot as well so it wasn't ever a usurious situation. Eventually, I met my wife and was married after all that happened that so its not something that has continued since about 4 years now.

All of my former girlfriends were/are not fat, had beautiful faces and were definitely the types an idiot would assume would date ""Jocks"". The were the shallow ""hotness"".

A man wanting women just needs to treat them right and approach it from a different perspective than ""I need to get laid"".

t5_2qh1s,"&gt;How so? What's to stop someone in China from selling his bonds (for some other asset or goods or something) to someone in Australia, or India, or Brazil? USD that goes overseas could theoretically never return.

What kanagawa politely explained regarding the ""pools of foreign currency"", are actually called ""reserve currencies."" The USD is the biggest reserve currency in the world. This gives us a unique advantage when we borrow from and lend to other countries. Consider a smaller country like Pakistan. If you loan money to India, they're going to pay you back in Indian rupees. But why would you want Indian rupees? You want USD. So if India doesn't have enough USD to pay back the loan, they have to exchange their rupees (that no one wants) for USD. They will lose some money during the exchange, and thus it adds to their cost of borrowing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reserve_currencies.svg

Lucky for us, the USD is a reserve currency. When we borrow from another country and pay it back with USD, *they actually want to keep the USD*. Thus, we don't have to pay that extra premium for exchanging currencies. This helps keep our interest rates low. (This was also part of the motivation for starting the euro - it allowed the europeans to borrow from each other at lower rates)

So back to your point - someone in China would not sell US bonds to someone in India *unless* they could get USD for it because they wouldn't want Indian rupees (not a reserve currency). ",t1_c3dbu4v,1325579825,0,False,t1_c3dhk03,,True,Economics,t3_nzr4w,False,1428115925,4,0,winampman,0,,c3dhk03,,4

Dang it President Roosevelt, why didn't we listen when you said not to let the military complex become the staple of our economy?

Which is funny since the military is the one thing we'd be allowed with a truly libertarian government.

That election reform bill you linked to didn't take the money out of politics. I'd prefer publicly financed campaign elections where there would be no corporate financing. It'd be tricky to work out but I believe there are real world models we could look at for inspiration in Europe. Perhaps if you can raise some set number of signatures in your town, say 1500 you can debate locally, once you've debated locally you can debate state wide if you win locally, and from there we could have debates by region. Or it could work out some other way. Adding the ""I'm candidate x and I support this message"" line at the end of a message isn't exactly what I was thinking of. Did you read that whole article? They talk about how it was edited to make it weaker.

Another party or two might not be a bad thing either. And the constant fillibustering by Republicans which has spiked drastically in the past decade (and I actually think just since Obama became President) is clearly an abuse of power.

As the Athenians did, after a politician's term we should evaluate them for wrong doing and punish them accordingly if it has been determined that they abused their power. I'm pretty confident thats what I read today on r/askhistory.

It's certainly an uphill battle but not one that can't be won by the American people. If the system became so corrupt in 20 years it might certainly take 20 years to get rid of that corruption but it can return to its former prominence I believe. 

Unfortunately it requires a slightly more interested populace. I find the europeans to be far more enlightened in that regard although their own systems are going downhill at the moment too.

t5_2qgzg,"There is such a thing as overdoing it. Your $500 is a ridiculous scenario because it would require more money than exists. It is however a fact that top-heavy economies contract and risk collapsing  (See US in 1930-ies, US in 2008-present, Several European nations 2009 - present) due to loss of momentum because demand decreases due to spending money decreasing. Ususally what gets an economy going in those situation is to artificially inject money on the demand side (I.e. give money to the poor) a minimum wage can be one way of doing this. In a country without strong unions the mimimum wage is doubly important as it acts as a safegard against a ""race to the bottom"" during high unemployment periods. Sweden and Germany do fine without a government mandated minimum wage because they both have very strong unions that make sure this race to the bottom never happens.

So what I'm trying to say is that a reasonably set minimum wage can act as a safeguard against overheating and burnout on the economy. Without that and/or other similar safeguards you get situations like Ireland where the country gets called an economical marvel of high year over year growth one year and an absolute economic dissaster the next. It simply burned out. Too much money got concentrated at the top and the bottom fell out of the market as people could no longer afford to keep up demand on goods and services.

You cant invest away a lack of demand. Likewise you cant loan it away.

If people aren't buying your product then no amount of investment will help your business grow and no amount of taxbreaks will make you hire more people.

En fait, le souci n'est pas tant que les Etats payent cher, mais plutôt qu'en situation de crise extrême, la Fed a pris des libertés assez étonnantes. 

En particulier, le fameux taux de 0,01% est suite à une opération de financement de 20 milliards, dans le cadre d'une opération un peu plus grosse de 80 milliards connue sous le doux nom de _ST OMO_ (single-tranche open market operation), qui a servi surtout à donner une bouée de sauvetage à 3 grosses banques européennes pour éviter une crise systémique.

Et le montant de 1000 milliards est effectivement surprenant, mais il fait référence là encore à des facilités de crédit très largement au-delà de ce qui était attendu de la Fed (et qu'elle s'est bien gardée de communiquer publiquement sur le coup, d'ailleurs si toutes les banques avaient été au max de leurs emprunts possibles, ça serait monté à 6800 milliards de dollars.). 

Bref, ce qui est choquant, ce n'est pas tant que les Etats ne puissent pas s'auto-financer, puisque c'est un choix politique qui date de Maastricht et qui est un point non négociable avec Merkel.

t5_2rete,"I absolutely agree with you. I also think it's got to do with the language itself. For example, Japanese is very context-based and indirect language in general so obviously, while using it, you end up using those vague expressions (I think it's also one of the reasons why Japanese is so difficult for the Westerners). On the other hand, I imagine most European languages are far more direct and because of that you end up talking differently.

I do think such abilities come up later in the language learning. In the beginning, it seems that people think up a sentence in their own language and then try to translate individual words and replace them (I think we are all guilty of it at first).

t5_2qh13,"Just an example, i was watching DW-WORLD (German international channel), and it had a report on the new Hungarian constitution. It too had errors. It stated that from the old name of the country ""Republic of Hungary"" the ""Republic of"" was dropped, and now it is only ""Hungary"", and that this a nationalistic move. It shows that they made a report without knowing the Hungarian language and about the actual Hungarian name of the country. The ""Republic of Hungary"" is not an exact translation of the old name, when translated word-by-word to English the old name is ""Hungarian Republic"" (meaning state of the Hungarians). The new name which is just Hungary (""Magyarország"" meaning ""Hungarian Country"") is actually the commonly used one. So their statement that the ""Republic of"" ""was just dropped"" is not true, and its not true that the new name is more nationalistic. When you look at one such report at a time, these are small ""mistakes"", but like the Krugman's article, the media is full of these mistakes, and they draw big (and false) conclusions based on such mistakes. Then there are blogs which collect these conclusions, and build up the image that Hungary is a fascist dictatorship. Even the reporter on DW-WORLD, who reported from Budapest was not telling the truth, but these ""popular lies"".

I can't spend my time correcting people on the Internet. I would suggest reading the document (or even comparing it to the old one), but since you are going to read the English translation, even that is problematic since the precise meaning is often lost in translation leading to ""assumed"" meanings, rather than to accurate ones. What can we do when our language is so foreign to other European languages. 

The reason for all this hysteria is that people judge based on information they get from media organs, who are not obliged to tell the truth. The Hungarian constitutional court, the EU are all doing their job on overseeing the laws. When they object something, the Hungarian government acts, and changes the offending parts. These revisions take months, or years. People on the internet make assumptions based on rash information. For example the EU commission is now trying to make a unified definition of ""freedom of speech"", because there was no such thing so far. But the Hungarian media regulation was accused of ""limiting the media"" on a grand scale, although there is no definition of what that means. The constitutional court objected to specific points in the law, which boils down to words chosen in specific places in the law. The opposition interprets that as ""the constitutional court rejected the law"", while the government says that ""the constitutional court requested more precise wording"".

I agree that the power is centralized, and that servants of the previous socialist government are removed from their positions, but that is the result of the elections. ""Big win, big changes."" When the socialists had win the elections in 2002, they fired 14.000 state bureaucrats, everyone who got their job during the previous Fidesz government. Why wasn't the liberal media shocked by that?

t5_2cneq,"&gt; i guess things like; the huge disconnect between black/white culture and the racism and fear of racism, gun laws - I've never seen a gun except in a police holster, treatment of atheist's and LBGT etc

I lived in Texas and never saw a gun except in a police holster either. To be fair, this was in a city, but there's a difference between gun ownership and the stereotype of the gun-toting redneck.

I get your point about prejudice and racism, but are you really telling me that doesn't exist in Europe? Several years ago in a small town in Germany, eight Indian men were chased through town by a mob (I'm not exaggerating) until the police intervened—only one of many acts of xenophobic violence that have even happened in a fairly cosmopolitan city like Berlin, where I've lived. And while atheists are statistically distrusted, I really don't think you can compare their treatment to that of gays and lesbians. On the whole, Americans are unusually nice people—which makes the fact that many of them vote in self-interest a lot more baffling.

&gt; but broadly speaking, most Americans wouldn't know about large events that are never published that make your country 'sucky' aka, never signing the Kyoto protocol, how many countries you are currently 'occupying', the number of gun deaths, petrol usage and pollution, how the rest of the world runs comparatively

I have the feeling that in the US that the waiter is almost seen as a slave that should refill your glasses and do whatever you wish. I see waiters as people who know about the food they are serving, to their best to let you have a pleasant night and make sure you feel good afterwards, not grovel like a servant that you can treat like a dog and give a cookie(/tip) after they did their trick.

Also, in the restaurant that I quite regularly go to you're expected to spend the whole night, not shovel down your food and be out in half an hour, and with the whole night I really mean a long time, dining from 7pm till 1am is no exception and no-one wants to see you go. 
I've heard so many stories from my American friends that you are welcome in a restaurant up to about an hour, 2 hours at most and then you need to clear the table. We took them out for a couple of meals over here (The Netherlands) and they were almost uncomfortable by staying in the restaurant for hours, until the waiter said ""You are my customers and I'm here to make you feel at home, I'm not going to rush you because I want to see you coming back and I want you to have a great night""

“Anti-Intellectualism” 


WOMAN: Noam, I’ve noticed that in general there’s a strong strain of anti-intellectualism in American society.  


When you say there’s “anti-intellectualism,” what exactly does that mean? Does it mean people think Henry Kissinger shouldn’t be allowed to be National Security Advisor?  


WOMAN: Well, I feel there’s a sense in which you’re looked down on if you deal with ideas. Like, I’ll go back and tell the people I work with that I spent the whole weekend listening to someone talk about foreign policy, and they won’t look at that in a positive way.  


Yeah, because you should have been out making money, or watching sports or something. But see, I don’t call that “anti-intellectual,” that’s just being de-politicized—what’s especially “intellectual” about being concerned with the world? If we had functioning labor unions, the working class would be concerned with the world. In fact, they are in many places—Salvadoran peasants are concerned with the world, they’re not “intellectuals.” 

These are funny words, actually. I mean, the way it’s used, being an “intellectual” has virtually nothing to do with working with your mind: those are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as plenty of people in universities. There are big areas in academia where what’s called “scholarly” work is just clerical work, and I don’t think clerical work’s more challenging mentally than fixing an automobile engine—in fact, I think the opposite: I can do clerical work, I can never figure out how to fix an automobile engine. 

So if by “intellectual” you mean people who are using their minds, then it’s all over the society. If by “intellectual” you mean people who are a special class who are in the business of imposing thoughts, and framing ideas for people in power, and telling everyone what they should believe, and so on, well, yeah, that’s different. Those people are called “intellectuals”—but they’re really more a kind of secular priesthood, whose task is to uphold the doctrinal truths of the society. And the population should be anti-intellectual in that respect, I think that’s a healthy reaction. 

In fact, if you compare the United States with France—or with most of Europe, for that matter—I think one of the healthy things about the United States is precisely this: there’s very little respect for intellectuals as such. And there shouldn’t be. What’s there to respect? I mean, in France if you’re part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there’s a front-page story in Le Monde. That’s one of the reasons why French intellectual culture is so farcical—it’s like Hollywood. You’re in front of the television cameras all the time, and you’ve got to keep doing something new so they’ll keep focusing on you and not on the guy at the next table, and people don’t have ideas that are that good, so they have to come up with crazy stuff, and the intellectuals get all pompous and self-important. So I remember during the Vietnam War, there’d be these big international campaigns to protest the war, and a number of times I was asked to co-sign letters with, say, Jean-Paul Sartre [French philosopher]. Well, we?d co-sign some statement, and in France it was front-page news; here, nobody even mentioned it. And the French thought that was scandalous; I thought it was terrific?why the hell should anybody mention it? What difference does it make if two guys who happen to have some name recognition got together and signed a statement? Why should that be of any particular interest to anybody? So I think the American reaction is much healthier in this respect.  


WOMAN: But I want to point out that you’ve told us about a number of books this weekend which support some of the contentions you’re making: you would not know a lot of these things if you hadn’t read that material.  


That’s right—but you see, that’s a reflection of privilege, not a reflection of intellectual life. The fact is that if you’re at a university, you’re very privileged. For one thing, contrary to what a lot of people say, you don’t have to work all that hard. And you control your own work—I mean, maybe you decide to work eighty hours a week, but you decide which eighty hours. That makes a tremendous difference: it’s one of the few domains where you control your own work. And furthermore, you have a lot of resources—you’ve got training, you know how to use a library, you see the ads for books so you know which books are probably worth reading, you know there are declassified documents because you learned that in school somewhere, and you know how to find them because you know how to use a reference library. And that collection of skills and privileges gives you access to a lot of information. But it has nothing to do with being “intellectual”: there are plenty of people in the universities who have all of this stuff, and use all of these things, and they do clerical work. Which is perfectly possible—you can get the declassified documents, and you can copy them, and compare them, and then make a notation about some footnote referring to something else. That’s in fact most of the scholarship in these fields—take a look at the monographs sometime, there’s not a thought in people’s heads. I think there’s less real intellectual work going on in a lot of university departments than there is in trying to figure out what’s the matter with my car, which requires some creativity.  


WOMAN: Okay, let’s accept that the auto mechanic is an intellectual—then I think on the other side, we also have to accept that those people who deal with books correctly, and aren’t the clerical workers, are also intellectuals.  


Well, if by “intellectual” you just want to refer to people who use their minds, yeah, okay. But in that sense, I don’t think that people are anti-intellectual. For example, if you take your car to a really hot-shot mechanic who’s the only guy in your town who can ever figure out what’s wrong—the guys in the car manufacturing place can never do it, but this guy?s just got a real feel for automobiles; he looks at your car, and starts taking it apart . . .  


WOMAN: She . . .  


Or she, or whatever—you don’t look down on that person. Nobody looks down on that person. You admire them.  


WOMAN: But people do look down on people who read books.  


But look, this guy may have read books—maybe he read the manual. Those manuals are not so easy to read; in fact, they’re harder to read than most scholarly books, I think. But I’m not trying to disagree, I just think that we should look at the thing a little differently. There’s intellectual work, which plenty of people do; then there’s what’s called “intellectual life,” which is a special craft which doesn’t particularly require thought—in fact, you’re probably better off if you don’t think too much—and that’s what’s called being a respected intellectual. And people are right to look down on that, because there’s nothing very special about it. It’s just a not very interesting craft, not very well done usually. In my own view, it’s wrong if a society has these kinds of differentiations. My own early background was in a kind of Jewish working-class environment, where the people were not formally educated and they were workers—like somebody could be a shop-boy, or a seamstress or something like that—but they were very literate: I would call them intellectuals. They weren’t “intellectuals” in the sense that people usually talk about, but they were very well-read, they thought about things, they argued about things—I don’t see any reason why that can’t be what you do when you’re a seamstress.

t5_2sgq6,"That's an interesting subject, I often wonder the same thing. I'm not old enough to remember the first generations of console, I started playing with the Gameboy (and had every single pokemon game which came out in Europe, despite the fact that it was a stupid money scheme as there was little to no real difference between each version) and PC with the Baldur's Gate, Age of Empires, Warcraft, Battlefield and Diablo series.

I know for a fact that I also played huge amounts of shitty games and was often disappointed by what I had bought (I had no access to any review websites or magazines so I was easily lured by any shiny boxes) but I cannot even name any of these games so when I think about the past, all that remains are fond memories of the games that were actually somewhat decent.

And even then, whenever I have a nostalgia attack and try to play any of the games I absolutely loved as a child, I always end up disappointed. Graphics are 10 times worse than in my memories (I won't buy a game just because it has nice graphics but the opposite is unfortunately also true, I won't play an otherwise good game if it has terrible graphics and most of my childhood games haven't aged very well), animations are just awful, cutscenes often seem poorly-made and the many flaws that I gladly overlook at that time (I was inexperienced and had no way to compare what I was playing with previous games) are painfully obvious now.

Another thing to take into account is the number of games that was available to me at the time. I was offered Pokémon Blue version for Christmas and that was the only game I could play with until my birthday a few months later, I played what ? 2-5 games a year, at most. These days, I've a job, I've access to steam sales, my bank account is positive, I don't waste money but I can buy any game I like if I really think that I'll enjoy it, I could play 30-50 games a year and enjoy every single one of these but there is no way i'd remember more than a couple of them a few years later.


Are old games bad ? No, they're not. I have many friends who enjoy playing these but I don't, I would like to, I'd like to feel the excitation I felt even when I was playing shitty games as a kid but I ... don't. My best memories come from older games yet I honestly thing that newer games are much much better than the ones I played years ago.",t3_o02d3,1325591060,0,False,t1_c3dibhb,,True,truegaming,t3_o02d3,False,1428116293,1,0,[deleted],0,,c3dibhb,,1

Of course the American and Western European main stream media chose to go with what the Iranians said ""long range"" because it would make for a better headline. The Iranians are more talk than action.

These missiles are 1960s technology for the US and Russia. They can easily spot them on radar.

That's assuming that the carrier group will just sit there and not take out the missiles. Of course for any of these missiles to actually be effective they would have to launch hundreds of them instantaneously to prevent the carrier group from being able to safely take them all out in time. And so far Iran has only been able to put up one or two of these missiles after significant preparation on the part of their scientists to hit per-determined targets. These missiles can't hit a moving target as far as I know and last I checked the carrier group is just such a target.

I think its borrowing rates are still pretty high and usa's are still pretty low. i'm not sure exactly why this is, but if we assume the bond markets are as intelligent as the rothschilds were during napolean's battles, we might expect America to drastically reduce its borrowing in the future, most likely due to the expiration of bush tax cuts and the cessation of many combat operations in Iraq, but potentially also as a consequence of radical developments like the repeal of some social programs, a ron paul presidency, a balanced budget amendment, a sudden defeat or collapse of syria, iran, &amp; pakistan, or a dissolution and subsequent war inside the European Union.

Incidentally, if we expect a lot of default and turmoil, possibly up to war in the European Union, then we'd expect borrowing costs to rise drastically in those countries the markets expect are going to lose the battle, whether physical or financial. we've seen this happen as rates rise in Europe just as rates decline in the US. this implies there are quite a few smart people betting a lot of money that the US is going to come out on top of whatever shitstorm is about to go down over the next 3+ years. if the mad campaign to liberalize the islamic world magically succeeds and the 'reformed' nations suddenly demand a Wal-Mart on every street corner and are willing to work at a McDonalds nearby earning whatever minimum wage is so they can buy cheap Islamic-themed junk  Say goodbye to the free bmws, entire months of religious holidays, and other welfare benefits funded by state control of
