1380587408,t1_ccijcia,,0,True,False,1429288392,0,"I'm not saying start on a 250. I'm saying avoid the super sports. There are plenty of bikes out there with larger engines that aren't as hyper. Truthfully, unless you really like the style of riding I described, a 250 will definitely leave you wanting more. Part of the other reason I got a 250 is because it was $500 with less than 3k miles. Can't beat that. My first bike was a 1982 Honda CB450T. A perfectly fine beginners bike, if it were in restored condition. However, that bike was neglected to the point of danger and nearly killed me once due to a failure of the rear drum brake. It locked up at around 100 MPH and I skidded all the way down to 50 MPH until the wheel broke free again. I was completely fine and in control the whole time. But someone without my experience (this is one part I'll contribute my over a decade of motocross to saving my ass on the street) of knowing what a sliding bike feels like would've binned it. My friend's dad's (no dirt experience) eyes went wide and he was in disbelief I handled it so well. This is a guy with over a decade of road racing experience and many decades on the roads. 

Right now, I'm on a Honda CB-1. It's a 400cc inline 4. However, it is tuned to have a smoother power deliver compared to its CBR400RR brother (which isn't available in the USA, both bikes share the same engine with differences in the cylinder head, cams and carbs that makes the RR have more power with a more radical delivery). The suspension and brakes on it also aren't as radical as a super sport. However, I would not recommend the CB-1 to a new rider since it is a 24-23 year old bike. It was only sold in the USA for two years. It's a niche and cult bike. Info on them is hard to find and so are parts. Parts are very scarce and very hard to find. Most parts I find for this I have to go online and dig around sites from Europe to find parts. You have to know how to repair it yourself to own one, since nobody will touch the thing or even know what it is. It's estimated there are less than 200 still cruising the streets of the US today and I've seen some estimate less than 100. I like the CB-1 because of its cult status. I like having a high revving inline 4 with enough oomph, but not enough to be stupid fast. I find stupid fast bikes to be no fun on public roads. I could've easily bought a used 600cc with the cash I've invested into restoring my bike so far, but I didn't want a 600cc. I like my small bikes and I like dominating larger bikes with using less power, suspension and brakes. 

And yes, the power can be addicting. Especially to a skilled rider. Super sports make high speeds seem so smooth. I remember the first time I took my bud's CBR 929 out I wasn't looking at the speedo on the highway. Just cruising with what felt right. All of a sudden it occurred to me I was passing cars very quickly when I came up on traffic. Time to check my speed. 120 MPH. Time to get off the highway and give the bike back. 

Definitely try a 250. But try something like a CBR 500, Ninja 500 or a GS 500 too. You'll find they aren't far from a 250 at all in their docile nature. They'll just have a bit more get up and go. Worst comes to worst, you buy a 250, can't stand the lack of power, feel you've outgrown it and you go to sell it for as much as you bought it for if not more. 250s have excellent resale. That $500 250 I had with less than 3k miles on it when I bought it? I rode it for 8k miles over a season and sold it for $1500. Super sports have crap resale. Last year's model is old news.

I'd have to really dig for specific sources, do you need it for a paper or anything specific?  (I wrote a paper on the response of the French in the lead up to the war, and another on the before and after of Munich years ago in university, which is where I picked up the bulk of the specifics.  I'd have to track down old stuff.^1)

You can find general citation stuff [at Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland) though

&gt;The British Foreign Office for its part expressed a great deal of frustration over Hitler's action in unilaterally taking what London had proposed to negotiate.  As a Foreign Office memo complained ""Hitler has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate"".[54]



From what I recall the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden plays a very large role, and the rest has to do with the realities that the Versailles terms had obligations that were nearly impossible for Germany to meet.

Starting with the relaxing of the Versailles restrictions at the Reparations Conference in 1929, and tied to the London Naval treaty talks and the World Disarmament Conference in the early 1930s.  Essentially they realized that the restrictions of Versailles were far too punitive, and instead sought to have more control over Germany by having her as a member in the League of Nations, having non-aggression pacts, and the like. 

The British and French troops in the Rhineland were originally intended to stay until 1935, but left in 1930 instead.  Along with that were some concessions that were intended to allow Germany to rearm somewhat, feeling that Germany had some right to limited rearmament, and trying to prevent German animosity over the Versailles conditions.  There was also the notion that a re-armed, League of Nations bound and influenced Germany might be useful as a counter-balance to the growing influence of Communism and the Soviet Union.

The way I phrased it is actually misleading, and incorrect, as ""Allies"" implies significant cohesion.  ""The British"" would have been more accurate.  The French certainly were not as keen, but France is pretty unstable politically in the 30s.

&gt;can you explain this in more depth? Shouldn't violation of the Treaty be sufficient as casus belli?


They weren't looking for casus belli at all though, they were looking for peace (and a placated Germany) through a fair and reasonably equitable negotiation.

Europe was just recovering from the First World War and had no desire to repeat it a second time, along with dealing with the economic instability that came with the Great Depression.

The possibility of a placated and League of Nations controlled Germany was also, in a round-about-fashion, viewed as a potential ally when it came to the influence of Communism in Europe.   Chamberlain referred to Germany as being ""one of the great pillars against Communism"", or something to that affect.

From the start Germany was doomed, Hitler planned the war as if it would start in 1942, it started in '39 and Germany only switched to a ""Total war"" economy in '43 (which is why despite the more intense Allied bombing, German production was at its top in '44). Germany had too little Oil and industrial power, and the Luftwaffe relied on Synthetic oil, which was inferior to the RAF's oil (forgot the name), the RAF is crucial here because without Air support, the Kiregsmarine cannot even dream of defeating the King's Navy. France always gets made fun of, but people forget that the Germans literally just went around the Maginot line and encircled them, so surrender was pretty much a must; now the Luftwaffe can attack Britain and the Heer can commence Operation Sealion, right? **Nein**, the RAF beats the Lift-Waffle and the Kriegsmarine must now rely on their U-boat fleet to starve Britain (almost worked, but the Brits cracked the Enigma code with help of the worlds first Computer, and they managed to defeat the U-boats) now the Reich turns its attention to.. *dun dun duuuuunn..* **The Soviet Union**, Nazism's worst enemy, since Mein Kampf was written in '25 Hitler mentioned invading the USSR, but even though the Wehrmacht **kicked serious Communist ass** (400,000 Germans dead compared to 1,280,000 Russians) they simply didn't have enough of anything.. Russia never ended, neither did her manpower. Now, why did Operation Barbarossa fail? Well originally it was mean't to start on May, but **Italy** ,the worlds worst ally, was crying for help in North Africa, so the Invasion of Russia was delayed for 1 month, this is *crucial* since the Axis want to avoid Russian winter! Invasion starts off late but its going well, very well, the locals greet the Germans are liberators (that's how bad communism was, Nazis, **NAZIS** were fucking Liberators) until.. Until the Eintzgruppen started literally exterminating them like pests, now the Partisans are sabotaging supply lines and fighting the Germans in the back, thus delaying their advance; now Russian Autumm sets in, okay just don't invade Russia in any season expect Summer, the shitty Russian roads turn into *mud* and the Panzers get bogged down, shit hits the the fan and **BOOM- SNOW FUCKERS, ITS SNOWING BITCH.** The Fuel freezes, the tanks freeze, the oil in the guns freeze, **the men freeze**, Hitler being the dumbass he was didn't send them winter supplies, he was a bit over-confident about the Wehrmacht. Russian spies hear about Japan planning an attack on the US, so they send their Siberian army to counter-attack at Moscow, this is it- Germany fucked it all up, now its gonna be one long Blood bath. Japan attacks the US! Hey, that's their problem right? japan didn't help germany against the USSR, why help them against the USA? Nope, Hitler declares war on the USA, AKA the ""factory of democracy"", Uncle Sam is pumping 1 aircraft carrier a month if he wants to, now Hitler officially fucked his own shit up. Whelp, might as continue scarring the face of the Earth eh? Operation ""Blue"" commences, Germany attacks the Caucasus to capture their Oil, this is where the famous and legendary **STALINGRAD** comes in, everything is going well when.. yep, you guessed it! **Winter**, now Zhukov launches Operation ""Uranus"", he encircles the German 6th army and shit hits the fan once more, this is the icing on the cake, over 700,000 Germans were captured/killed in Stalingrad from August to Febrauary, they unlike the Ruskies, cannot afford this bullshit and have to retreat. Now after 5 months of being Butthurt, German high command launches Operation ""Zitadel"" they attack- Shit are you even reading this? **YOU PIECE OF SHIT READ THIS GOD DAMN ESSAY I'M WRITING JUST FOR YOU, LOOK HERE YOU FUCK, YEAH YOU, YOU BETTER READ THIS YOU TURD**-sheesh. Okay, July 5th 1943, Germans launch an offensive on *Kursk*, the Russians knew about this 1: they had spies, 2: It was fucking obvious- big bulge in the frontline, ""aw gee, where will they attack?"" So Kursk is the most fortified position in History, the fate of the world wat fill be decided here, literally. Germans fail badly and this is when the Reds take a big dump on the Reich, its a full retreat on all fronts from here on, war is over for Hitler- so he decides to make Europe pay with blood.

That's all ignorant people like you are good for.

edit: ""Rushton's book Race, Evolution, and Behavior (1995) uses r/K selection theory to explain how East Asians consistently average high, blacks low, and whites in the middle on an evolutionary scale of characteristics indicative of nurturing behavior. He first published this theory in 1984. Rushton argues that East Asians and their descendants average a larger brain size, greater intelligence, more sexual restraint, slower rates of maturation, and greater law abidingness and social organization than do Europeans and their descendants, who average higher scores on these dimensions than Africans and their descendants.""

""It was organized by Michael H. Hart for the stated purpose of ""addressing the need"" to defend ""America’s Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity"" from immigrants, Muslims, and African Americans.""

""In a paper for the International Journal of Selection and Assessment in 2006, Steven Cronshaw and colleagues wrote that psychologists need to critically examine the science used by Rushton in his ""race-realist"" research. Their re-analysis of the validity criteria for test bias, using data reported in the Rushton et al. paper, led them to conclude that the testing methods were biased against Black Africans. ""

""Rushton prompted controversy for years, attracting coverage from the press as well as comments and criticism by scientists of his books and journal articles.""

""In 1989, geneticist and media personality David Suzuki criticized Rushton's racial theories in a live televised debate at the University of Western Ontario.[51] He said, ""There will always be Rushtons in science, and we must always be prepared to root them out!""

""This is an insidious attempt to legitimize Rushton’s racist propaganda and is tantamount to publishing ads for white supremacy and the neo-Nazi party. If you have any question about the validity of the ""science"" of Rushton’s trash you should read any one of his articles and the many rebuttals by ashamed scientists.""

It just makes the IT guys life harder because they can't troubleshoot accurately.

But you can also get illicit drugs easily and there have been laws banning the manufacture and sale of many substances for years and it has done nothing ro stem the tide of drug use in this country. So please,  continue on how banning guns would prevent criminals from getting them.

Oh, you may also want to steer clear of known gun control advocacy groups when citing statistics. I can GUARANTEE you 90% of Americans do not favor universal background checks.

In response to your comment about assault weapons being designed to ""murder"", that is also flat out wrong. They are designed to be an ergonomic, accurate rifle. Their intended use, yes, is to shoot human beings. But that isn't always murder. Being a shoulder fired gun, they are a more stable platform and the longer sight radius  provides better accuracy. It shoots a small caliber projectile so recoil is less likely to be overwhelming for a shooter of small stature. With soft point ammunition it is less likely to penetrate through walls than a handgun or shotgun (you know shotguns, the thing our current VP recommended shooting blindly in the air if your home is invaded...), and since most home invasion robberies are committed by multiple armed assailants, their ability to accept high capacity magazines allows them to be effective against a larger number of attackers. All that makes them sound like the ULTIMATE home defense weapon. And If kept appropriately stored, would certainly be the best piece of home defense equipment for a single mother.

You say that the gypsies had one single chance at the beginning of their arrival in France to assimilated, and that's it? Now EVERY gypsy has to experience the hatred and discrimination of fuck-wits like you because of the actions of a few? Yes, a few. The vast majority of gypsies are peaceful people living in extreme poverty because equal opportunity for them is essentially non-existent in the hate-filled part of the world you live in, those that do commit crimes are essentially forced to because of the stringent poverty. 

&gt;Most of them do not go to look for jobs. Those who do and dress appropriately have a decent chance of finding a job, start a business, etc.

Most of them do look for jobs. Many of them work as migrant workers in the EU ,especially the younger people. They can rarely ever land a jobs due to racist douche bags like you who GENERALIZE and STEREOTYPE.

&gt;For two reasons: 1. To come to the US a clean background is required, which would filter most of them out. 2. In the US the law is very strict, you can't get away with crime that easily.

Okay, then by that logic, gypsy children would also have equal opportunities to better themselves in Europe, but they still live in that cycle of poverty. Why? Because your racism and hatred only breeds their criminal culture. If the all Europeans treated gypsies the same way as Americans do, then I could gaurentee that the poverty level would be significantly less, and the crime rate would follow too.

You seem to be okay with STEREOTYPING an ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE based on the actions of a few. Yes, they are a few, but just let us pretend that the majority of gypsies were criminals. It would still not justify discrimination and stereotyping because the individual is free from all associations whether they be race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc. You can NEVER judge an individual based on the actions of a group that he may happen to belong to. I think of these issues from an objective standpoint. 

lastly, saying that my opinions don't matter about European Romani because I don't live in Europe is literally nothing, but a petty method to divert the argument that's not in your favor.

I am sure it was a similar concept in Europe. Also, it was not common for someone other than the composer to perform the piece. Many small chamber orchestra pieces were written for the family the composer worked for. I can't say for certain, but as far as I understand it, the payment was similar to today's work for hire contracts.

To begin, and this may sound a bit pedantic, but the renaissance means ""rebirth."" The rebirth of classical thought and reclamation of that wisdom. The Rus never had this classical tradition and were never interested in it. Now why were they not interested?

The answer to that question is multifaceted. The main answer is religion and geography. In geographic terms the rivers that formed the highways to other countries. These rivers run North-South and mean that trade will primarily occur with the Black Sea region and the Caspian Sea area. After the fall of Byzantium, this means that all trade was going to occur with Muslims. Of course, Muscovy at that point did have some access to the West with Archangelsk in the North and their sliver of Baltic coastline, but those travels required long overland routes and were much more inconvenient.

The other reason I mentioned for their isolation was religion. As Orthodox, Russia under the Tatar yoke grew a very distinct religious culture that even differed from their Byzantine models. Medieval (and modern Russians) took a deep pride in their religion, and viewed Catholics, and later Protestants as heretics. ""Why should we take ideas from heretics?"" ran Church and political thinking.
So back to why did Russia not participate in the Renaissance? Well to sum up, geography and distance were prohibitive, and the Russians themselves first had no model to ""rebirth"" and no desire to follow the Western European model. They were happy with the way they did things.

As someone living in wee New Zealand my access to the great masterpieces of Europe is fairly limited. However I would like to point out that these symptoms describe my own reaction to some of the work I see around me. I have found myself breathless to the point of wooziness around several pieces of contemporary NZ art and once cried so hard at the beauty of a show that I had to be removed from the gallery. (I'm not sure if that is something to be proud of or not) The possibility of the Stendhal syndrome does make me a little cautious of hanging around work of the great masters. Perhaps I am just a bit over-reactive but I think it is relevant to acknowledge that massive reactions to art do happen outside of Florence.

I find this article an interesting counter point to the ""Paris Syndrome"" they talked about on QI. The idea behind it being that Paris is set up to be a worldwide center of culture and beauty but some people are so disappointed with actually being there that it can have a serious impact on their mental health. I think it would be cool to see some research done on the context of the people that are reporting these issues, as it posing some interesting questions on what the viewer brings to the art experience. The idea of viewers bringing their own predispositions towards this kind of reaction seems important to juxtapose with prospect that these works have incredible powers of their own.",ArtHistory,1380596458,yagyag,3,3,ccimpj7,t5_2r7pk,t3_1nfhua,0,,t3_1nfhua,

 Love hate relationship. I love being on a plane and at airports, i feel the most home there. But the part of going to places is not fun. Like i am only nearly 16 years old, and i have already traveled all of Africa, South America, Western Coast of USA, and most of Europe. Though i am missing places, once you are on a place EVERY SINGLE BREAK you get from school, you learn to love it but hate it. I never got to spend any time on breaks with the only friend I had. Now a days, i don't even have a friend. like EpochFail9001 said, tourism is sooo annoying. the just clog up the place. Like i learned yesterday that I am going on a Week long vacation to hawaii. So i am happy about it, because i get to be on a plane. Haven't been on one in about 1 and a half. which is extremely long for me. usually it is at least once every 2 months. But i really hate it because it is hawaii and hawaii is a tourism magnet.

* does the phrase ""anchor lust"" versus ""wander lust"" mean anything to you?

No idea what anchor lust is, and google isn't helping, but after googling Wander Lust, i take it that is settlign down? if so, no. i could never settle down. Though Wander lust, exploring new places. Yes. In class, a couple days ago actually, the teacher asked, if you have a month off from school, where would you go? most the class answered with Las Vegas, london, other major tourist places. Then i answered: Any where where there is no tourism. Be it the forgotten reaches of the Himalayan mountains, traveling the Sahara desert, exploring a rain forest in India, but no way in hell would i go spend a month in london or paris or venice or las vegas. 

And yes, live a couple years in a country, and then move to a new one.

* which specific regional culture do you most identify with? Describe it in comparison with other places you have lived.

No where, unless you count airports. or the internet.

* do you gravitate towards other people with a trans-cultural background/upbringing?

usually, but there is only one person like this at my school, Me. so i am alone 95% of the time.

* do you feel like you can get along with most any people you meet?

Not at all. It is extremely rare for me to get along with anyone. but then again, social anxiety doesn't help.

* what characteristics in people are most attractive to you?

Exactly what EponchFail9001 said.

* When you reflect upon the time since leaving your nation of origin, what’s it been like for you?

My nation of origin? are you talking about my passport country or the country i was born in? Because i was born in the middle east, though my family is, genetically, 100% Scandinavian. and if your talking about either one, I spent like birth to 3 y/o in the middle east, and then 3 y/o to like 4 in my passport country. then i started school in southern africa. so i don't know how to really answer to this question.

* Do you think about returning home?

Home where the fuck is that? i live in a house, yes, but that isn't home. if you call the place where the rest of my family is home, then idk. probly never. if it is where i was born, again, never.

* Where do you feel the most like a stranger?

idk. proply in the country of my passport. i don't speak the language well, i speak it at a 3rd grade level. litrually. everywhere else, i can blend in. but there i just stand out.

Now that we’re done with all the information and legalities, here is the subjective part that you won’t find anywhere on the internet. These are some courtesy tips that I picked up, often the hard way, on my journey. 

Stay out of politics. It is unfortunate, but gun politics is one of the few areas of debate where the ugliest and darkest part of American, bipartisan culture rears its head; you’re either a hippy gun-grabbing communist or a racist baby-murdering redneck. The two party system that was pioneered by the United States is so ingrained within society that it is very difficult to find someone who doesn’t have this “them vs. us” attitude. Stay out of the debate completely. Don’t attend rallies for or against gun control. Remember that as a foreigner, your opinions mean fuck all because you don’t get a vote. Adapt to and weave between incoming legislation instead of toting the rights that you don’t have. Leave, and be thankful, the battle of gun policy to nationals. By all means, donate and support them, but don’t put yourself in the frontlines of a fight that isn’t yours. Unless you came from a free European state (Switzerland, for example), even the tightest US gun laws are much laxer than that of your country; be thankful that you can own a gun at all. 

Beware of gun owners. Most gun owners I met, especially those who ran my Hunter’s Ed class, are some of the friendliest and most passionate people you will ever meet. However, they are also, more likely than not, politically adamant and loudmouthed. Additionally, a significant portion of them will be racist, if unconsciously, and as a foreigner your relationship point with them start in the negative. Be nice, avoid confrontation, smile a lot, let comments slide and don’t get offended when they accidentally call your race or country a bunch of thieves/murderers/job stealers/Nazis/Communists.

Beware of everyone else as well. When I first told my friends that I want to buy guns, the first response of at least three of them was, “what, are you going to shoot up a school or something?” Be careful of who you tell about your hobby, and make certain of their political standing before talking about guns (shouldn’t be too hard, they’re quite happy to share them). Do not tell people about your desire for guns or your foreign status unless prompted or necessary. Be especially careful of radicals, on both ends of the political spectrum, and even more careful with the Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) that they might call on you. By reading this guide, you will be more knowledgeable about guns and foreigners than 99% of the population, 80% of gun owners, and 95% of LEOs. Make sure you understand the process of the US legal system and Bill of Rights. 

I hope this is of use to at least one person on the other end of the massive web of consciousness that is the internet, so my efforts are not in vain.

The profits from the products of labor the slaves produced &amp; were robbed of belong to Europe and settler-colonial states that sprang from it (US, Australia, Canada). The profits of this exploited labor were instrumental to the unprecedented hegemony held by Europe and North America for 500 years.

Slavery was a basic fundamental injustice that not only impoverished and displaced huge numbers of people, screwed with internal national economics more or less permanently and ensured the creation of modern racism, but also screwed up international relations to the point of huge wealth disparities between colonized slave states and imperial powers that took all the wealth home.

This is about equality and justice. It is about a non-hypocritical embrace of democratic ideals. 

Further, it's important to note that the indigenous peoples in many of these colonized areas have been so thoroughly destroyed, assimilated or repressed that they have trouble effectively articulating to a wide audience, let alone meaningfully demand reparations for their stolen land and genocide and institutional racism and neocolonialism, etc. The descendants of slaves, however, can help this cause by bringing their own related case to the international community.",worldnews,1380599234,[deleted],-4,-4,ccino0n,t5_2qh13,t3_1nh2y9,0,,t1_cciiwbs,

IT would work fine against 20 vikings, but the vikings would probably split up into bands, 15 left flank, 15 right 15 straight ahead and 5  to circle around. 

the 30 spartans should have to pick a direction for their phalanx leaving the flanks exposed.

the vikings had iron and steel as well as bronze, if we are taking the best armed of each civilization the best armed vikings are going to be technologically superior to the best armed spartan

bronze is a poor weapons against iron or steel, both of which the vikings had.

historically when bronze met iron the bronze users succumbed.


&gt;The Celts had one major advantage - they had discovered Iron. Iron had been introduced to the Celtic peoples in Europe around 1000 to 700BC, thus giving them the technological edge to spread as they did. Iron was a far superior metal to bronze, being stronger and more durable. On the other hand, it required much hotter fires to extract it from its ore and so it took a fair degree of skill to use iron. None of this is to be taken to mean that bronze fell out of use. Rather, iron simply became an alternative metal and many bronze objects have been found that were made in the Iron Age.

i realize the qoute is about the celts, but the concept that Iron is a superior metal still holds.


the other major advantage is a 1.5 to 1 numerical superiority.

20 years of Oslo and preventable Palestinian aid dependency: Aimee Shalan - New Statesman - Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO chair Yasser Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn and signed the Oslo Accords – launching a transitional process towards a permanent peace settlement that was not supposed to exceed five years. (...) The international community has a clear responsibility to ensure that peace negotiations do not continue to provide Israel with the cover to pursue with impunity its illegal colonisation of Palestinian land, which is not only a major obstacle to the health and dignity of Palestinians but is also deepening aid dependency.

MY COMMENT: ""Dependency: A good or a bad thing""? Write a thousand page report and submit by next Tuesday seeking advice from 800 experts enroute. Ooops I ain't got the time so here's a brief stab at it. Dependency needn't be a bad thing especially when it's an inevitable thing but it does have to be reframed to make it a positive thing. I like the notion of universalism because it destigmatises. So universal health and child care, universal pension and basic income. Add in minimum wage and free education from creche to secondary school with an element of grant aiding towards third level to off-set under-representation amongst poorer households. Europe needs to ensure that the dependency it is sponsoring in Palestine is socially enlightened, non-sitgmatising and liberating of potential rather than enabling of vice.

This is perhaps why the EU is hardening its stance. With expectations on the floor where Israeli responsiveness is concerned we appear to be marking time watching another good man sacrifice himself into this interminable process. Make no mistakes this is not going the be about Abbas but rather the failure of the two-state narrative which opens a much longer haul to a post religious, post zionist solution.

&gt;In response to these accusations, a group of clergymen known as ""flaggelants"" were dispatched to clear the church's name, so to speak.

This is incorrect. The flagellants were not an approved movement by the established church. Flagellation had in the past been an accepted method of penance under the church's authority, but the movement during the plague was different. The flagellants, as a movement, arose as a kind of ""guerrilla"" response to the church's seeming inability to do anything about the plague or adequately explain it to the populace of Europe. They were not centralized or organized, and they met a lot of resistance from the clergy. This culminated in Pope Clement VI issuing a bull on October 20, 1349, condemning the movement as heresy and calling for an end to it immediately.

""Who is making all that noise?"" you hear a voice respond out of the dark distance somewhere.

""I am here! I am asking the questions! Hello? Can you hear me? I thought I was alone out here!""

""To whom are you asking all those questions?""

""To...anyone, I guess! Anyone who could hear me and who might know anything about it...Do you know anything?""

""I know what I can see!""

""What do you see?""

""You're standing there with a flashlight and a scroll, alone on a tall, thin spire of rock jutting out of a black void that extends as far as the eye can see in every direction.""

""Well I already knew that! Where are you? Who are you?""

The voice never answers back. Minutes go by. Months. Did you imagine the voice? Was it ""real""? Did your mind fabricate it in some fit of delusion? ""Where did that voice come from?"" is already question #9,472 on your list. Read the question aloud, to the void. Louder.

Why? Why read the list aloud?

Why not? What else is there to do?

[Here is a cool](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-worlds-best-countries-science) graphic that shows some data.  The take-away IMO from that graphic is that China, Japan, and S. Korea are no where especially behind ""the West.""  (I put quotes around ""the West"" because I'd shy away from lumping the US and Europe together.  While the GDP of the whole EU &gt; GDP of the US, in terms of scientific research metrics, the US seems to outpace Europe by a large margin (choose the ""Relative Value"" view).  There are surely noteworthy differences in innovation, research spending, and culture of innovation between these two entities, which would deservs its own whole discussion.  But one would expect the difference between East Asia and the West to be larger than the difference between the US and Europe, so let's move on.)

So, the unfortunate thing lacking from that graphic is ""R&amp;D spending on basic science research,"" which seems to be the metric that we want to know and accept as a proxy for the culture of innovative-ness that a country has.  IMHO, ""number of academic papers published in a select group of journals"" almost measures the same thing.  Pro: it cuts away any basic science research dollars that may be being spent but isn't producing results since reputable publishing pretty much = results.  Con: This probably hurts non-English speaking or non-Western countries a little, since it's likely that ""select group of journals"" will tend not to include the best non-English scientific journals.  Yet, we see that Japan, China, and S. Korea are well in the mix of the top 10 of the world along with other Western countries.  Neither of you have to agree, but I'm gonna go ahead and conclude from this that *even if East Asia has a risk averse culture*, that is not really hurting their investment in to basic fundamental scientific research.  

Now, my next point is on the belief that basic science research is a proxy for innovative-ness.  That may be true, but I'm a bit of a doubter here.  I was honestly surprised to see a lot of Google results for ""basic science research investment by country"" return a lot of articles about how important basic science research is to innovation.  My doubt comes from this question: what do we mean by innovation?  Do we mean revolutionary technologies like transistor radios and computers that are often invented way the hell back in a government or university lab and take a long time before it is applied in the marketplace?  Because that's indeed what basic science research produces.  They produce huge, history-altering results, but the products that come out of that take many generations, the technology spreads world wide over time, and can take a long time to ""complete the cycle"" from invention to monetization.  Or by innovation, do we mean new products with new functions that continuously improve in the marketplace every year like smart phones, e-commerce, social media, green tech?  With the exception of green tech, these all come from incremental advances - the thing Japanese electronics was famous for and S. Korea is famous for now.  Example: ""The internet was a revolutionary technology a few decades ago created by or in conjunction with basic science research.  A lot of innovation in the internet is happening today with social media and new forms of e-commerce.""  Do we call today's internet innovations the results of basic science research or the results of entrepreneurial projects and companies like Youtube, Ebay, etc. that are incremental advances in technology?  I think it's the latter.  

What I'm trying to say is that the innovation that OP's article and Chinese scientists/businessmen/entrepreneurs are worried about is not the invention of the internet or the transistor radio but the innovation of Twitter and smartphones.  It's the incremental innovations that can have monetization potential that they want and worry that China is lacking.  So if we're comparing countries, I guess R&amp;D spending or R&amp;D spending as a % of GDP doesn't tell us enough about that, since China is a big spender there but people think there aren't enough innovative products coming out of China.  I would have thought patents is a decent proxy, but apparently China ranks pretty high in that as well. (I was wondering whether perhaps the Chinese figures are ""inflated"" as in they have a lot of patents that don't do anything and just sit there, and never make it to the market place so I went to the [WIPO site](http://ipstatsdb.wipo.org/ipstatv2/ipstats/patentsSearch) and ranked countries according to ""PCT"" which seems to be something like an international patent application, but China ranks high in that as well.)  

There is [this ranking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index_%28Boston_Consulting_Group%29) by BCG and [this ranking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Quotient) by Bloomberg that ranks countries by innovation using a number of metrics as inputs.  I think these rankings' methodologies are more business-focused, and so they're more about smartphones and less about transistor radios or AIDS research, and they look to me like they show the general public consensus and belief about the innovativeness of countries.  This is where /u/atomic_rabbit is challenging /u/rakshas since they show Japan and S. Korea ranked very high.  

One thing I would additionally challenge /u/rakshas on is why Japan's economy is not doing as well today.  Is is really because now Samsung &gt; Sony and LG &gt; Panasonic?  One could argue that while consumer electronics is losing, Japanese innovation and and R&amp;D in general may have been doing well ""behind the scenes.""  Japanese GDP/capita has actually grown decently (except during the financial crisis) - population decline is a big factor in Japan's overall GDP decline.  A lot of anxiety about Japan's economy is also about its rigid labor system, which is definitely tied to traditional culture.  However, I still don't think you can make the jump from these problems to a lack of innovative culture because I think innovative culture is more about incremental innovation that produces products you can sell, and both Japan and S. Korea are good at that.  Perhaps data on the amount of angel investing, VC funding, growth of small to mid-size tech companies in the last decade for Japan and S. Korea will will be different than the West (as in, Japan and S. Korea may have lower levels of these metrics, which I believe are other ways to measure the culture innovation).

Edit:

What I think many people do not understand is the fact that quite a lot of Germans aren't sad that we have comparably low levels of national pride in public settings. We don't have stacks and stacks of flags in our basement we would love to show, but cannot.

Many of us view too much signs of national pride as a suresign marker of immaturity in politics and civil society (whether or not that is correct, I will not comment on). It might make German politics less flashy, but I hope it takes away one issue that can distract voters.

You might say we fear it, but we do not fear it because it reminds us of Germany's past, in the sense that there's a sudden flash of guilt. It's terrifying because some of us understand how quickly it can move from individual pride to social cohesion. And therein lies the danger.

As another person has said, imagine the US President doing this with an American flag. Can't do it? It's because of social cohesion. I, and many others, do not like this *at all*.

Do you even realize what a picture of Merkel waving a German flag after the best CDU results in recent times would have created? She has enough problems with people accusing her of creating a personality cult by using overly populist tactics (no content, only her persona counts). A media outcry would have occured, to say the least.

So it was wise politically. But I want to believe that I saw actual rejection in her face. Her statement with this action is that she's not going to use nationalism to advertise her position, enforce her politics, or distract from the problems we do have. Very fitting into her overall narrative, and something I will respect even if I did not vote for her. I want my Chancellor to behave like this, no matter the party. It was a wholly individual statemet, not a social one.

Once the dominoes started falling they didn't stop. Elections in Poland led to Hungary seeking the same which led to the opening of a border fence with Austria which lead to 10s of thousands of Germans leaving East Germany and then large enough protests to overwhelm and bring down the wall. When nobody slaughtered the protestors they grew and very quickly reached critical mass. 

The collapse of communism in Europe can be tied to a collapse of power of Russia. It makes sense that the states being controlled would shed communism before the heart of the beast. Glasnost brought rise to nationalism. Gorbachev stopped using threats of violence. Elections were held. Those things along with a weakened Russia emboldened the satellite states.  There was a military purge a few years prior to that which also helped make it possible. All of that combined with the expense of running an empire and having an arms raise with the U.S. made it increasingly difficult to control satellite states. 

The nail in the coffin was probably the coup against Gorbachev. Even though it was stopped, the communists were done at that point. 
2 years is really a very short period of time for all this to go down. So between 1989 and 1991 what happened? Countries left communism.

Even continents follow the same idea.

Europe = Europeans/Europenses, a name that is fairly recently developed to represent the many and disparate European peoples.

Africa = Roman name for Tunisia/Carthage later applied to the entire continent.

The further away from Europe you get the stranger names become as Anglicized names create pretty extreme evolution from any native population's preferred name.

Belgium is a very restrictive place when it comes to powerful cars (good or bad, that's not the debate here) and, except if you are rich, you might want to reconsider and buy a much less powerful car (less taxes, less gas, lower insurance premium).   Also, you might run into paperwork issues if you buy the car from abroad, so I would also think twice about that except if there is really a good reason to do it (if it's from Europe, though, it should be fine but I would still be cautious).

* Page 4-5 taxe de mise en circulation (tax you pay once after buying your car, does not matter if new or used). Good thing is that if you are planning to buy an old car, this tax will be lower.

In Europe the way the monarchy was always bound by some form of rule of law in the way it could treat the nobility: this is the result of the Catholic Church and the existence of a proud, hereditary land-owning nobility which drew its power from the land it owned. For instance, it would bodes quite ill for an English king who executes one of his dukes for no reason both because it would probably provoke a revolt and because it falls outside of institutional norms.

In China the nobility was far more tied to the imperial bureaucracy and as such was far more vulnerable to the power of the emperor. The most powerful nobles in Imperial China would be the person of the chancellor: who is something like the chief bureaucrat and equivalent of a premier, in England the most powerful noble during the 15th century would be someone like Richard of York who is the largest land owner (with his own army) in the country beside the king. If a strong emperor really wanted to execute an entire house of even the most powerful nobles he could usually get his way because they ultimately draw power from the bureaucracy as oppose to personal, physical fiefdoms. While there is always going to be struggle of -some- sort between whoever is emperor at the time and the nobles: is usually takes a completely different form than the European models and is really far less important than struggle -between- different groups of imperial elites (the bureaucracy vs the Enunches, or the family of the empress dowager for example)

To be honest, I'm an American sociologist close to political science and I remember the most recent government shutdown mainly for its relation to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, where their first illicit encounter was during the first government shutdown in November 1995.  As the Starr Report notes, ""Only essential federal employees were permitted to work during the furlough, and the White House staff of 430 shrank to about 90 people for the week. White House interns could continue working because of their unpaid status, and they took on a wide range of additional duties.""  So basically my knowledge of government shutdowns is primarily sex-based.

&gt;However I think the closest we've ever had to something like this would be the constitutional crises of the early twentieth century which was a similar dispute over budgets and reform which saw the government grind to a halt and fresh elections called.

Did any of these lead to civil servants not getting paid (at least temporarily)?  I often know of situations where government employees are not paid in other parts of the world, but I was wondering if there's a modern, non-U.S. precedent for it happening in Europe or North America.",AskHistorians,1380613379,yodatsracist,5,5,cciqwuq,t5_2ssp3,t3_1nhsno,0,,t1_cciqrn4,Comparative Religion

Pretty much, yeah.

&gt;Does that 14 trillion dollars even exist tangibly? What would be the repercussions of defaulting?

US debt is in something called Treasury securities, often known as T-bills (short for treasury bills). The US will basically say ""Hey, world, we need five billion dollars. We're willing to pay back the loan in 6 months."" And then bankers will start bidding, based on interest. They start high (""we'll buy $1b of T-bills at 1% interest"") and then go lower and lower (""we'll buy that same $1b at *0.5*% interest!""). The amounts and time to pay back vary on the needs of the government, it can be anywhere from 1 month to 30 years (actually, longer ones are called a bond, but no biggie). T-bills are used by a lot of people because of their stability. The price is set ahead of time so you know for sure how much you get when it comes time to turn them in, and the US would _never, ever_ default on its debt... until possibly now, of course.

I can't tell you exactly what would happen, I'm not an economist. But that promise to pay back that money goes away. People who were expecting cash won't be able to get it, whether they were bankers trying to make a safe buck or pensioners wanting a zero-risk way of investing their retirement funds. It'll affect everyone; trillions of dollars of debt is held by Americans, but China and Japan each have over a trillion in US debt and a number of other nations have over a hundred billion. The US economy will be fucked, multiple other nations will quickly have major blows to their own economies, and then the global economic meltdown will continue from there.

The US will also have a much harder time borrowing afterwards (just like anyone defaulting on their credit). That'll mean even recovery will be a hell of a lot harder. Greece was the most recent nation to default, but they had their blow cushioned with IMF and EU money. The US debt is way too big for a similar bailout.",worldnews,1380613771,Solomaxwell6,2,2,cciqyvz,t5_2qh13,t3_1nhlv9,0,,t1_cciqs3a,

1380665967,t1_ccir78x,,0,True,False,1429284655,0,"This sounds like the sort of question that would require several lectures to answer properly.  I’ll do my best to simplify somewhat (but apologize in advance for any long-windedness).  Your question can be broken into three parts:

**I. What was the Ancien Régime?**
The Ancien Régime (or Old Regime) is a term used to describe the social and political systems in France from roughly the 15th century to the 18th century.  In politics, this means monarchy and aristocracy; in society, it means the estate system.
*Politics*: The first thing you need to know about the 15th-18th centuries is that it is an era of increased centralization.  Beginning under Henry IV and continuing through Louis XIV, a series of ministers worked to consolidate the administrative units of France under the rule of the king.  There were several reasons for this: (1) perceived threats from other countries; (2) increased trade and transportation systems; and (3) increased court costs coupled with a need to standardize taxation.  Of course, this was happening all over Europe, and in fact the map of Europe begins to resemble that of today as countries form larger administrative groups – but I digress.  The centralization was thus fuelled by political and economic reasons.  The king, or his chief ministers, would place first *gouverneurs* and later *intendants* in each region to maintain order and ensure that judicial power in the provinces ran from the king, rather than the local nobleman.  This, naturally, did not please aristocrats, who did not particularly wish to cede all of their powers to the centralized state.  Parlements remained in place that maintained some judicial and legislative control (subject to the king and the Parlement of Paris), but much of the real power of aristocrats was taken.  There were many justifications for this, but the most important one is known as the *divine right of kings*.  Basically, the king was chosen by God to rule over his people.  To question that, or to challenge the king’s authority, was to challenge God.  Since nobody really wanted to challenge the power of Heaven, the king and his ministers were allowed an enormous amount of power within the state.
*Society*: In order to understand the French Revolution, it is important to understand the estate system.  In France during the pre-revolutionary period, there are three “estates” that divide the population.  The First Estate is comprised of the clergy.  The clergy were exempt from any taxes (they instead gave a ‘donation’ to France every year that was much lower than the taxes they would have had to pay).  The Second Estate is comprised of the nobility.  The nobility were exempt from most taxes and were given privileges at court.  [If you’re interested, they’re technically divided into the “nobility of the robe”, who dealt with civil governance, and “nobility of the sword”, which is fairly self-explanatory.]  The Third Estate was everyone else: non-noble bourgeoisie, urban and rural craftsmen, farmers, peasants, etc.  The majority of taxes was levied on this estate, despite the fact that their income was considerably less than the first and second estates.  Good so far?  Excellent.

**II. What were the causes of the French Revolution?**
The causes of the Revolution are many, and I apologize for oversimplifying somewhat.
First, the philosophes.  Philosophes were public intellectuals whose life philosophy might be summed up by Kant’s famous maxim “Sapere aude” – dare to know.  They fought for the democratization of knowledge, the replacement of superstition with skepticism; they championed the sciences and applied logical rigor to all subjects.  The philosophes are primarily remembered for their “republic of letters” (they were a literary bunch, and would spread their views through publishing) and for their consistent fight against dogma.  This took the form of religion, naturally – with a few exceptions, most philosophes disavowed particular sects of Christianity in favor of Deism – but also of government.  Divine right monarchy was soundly criticized as a poor reason for governance, and so the philosophes proposed an alternative system based on talent rather than birth.  They were responsible for most of the criticism of the Ancien Régime in the years leading toward the French Revolution, and their popular works did much to sway public opinion.  In addition, intellectuals such as Voltaire and Diderot did much to champion the ideas of “equality” and “freedom” that would become central to the Revolution.
Next, the wars in America.  The colonies rebelled against England in 1776.  Despite having just fought the colonies for control of North America during the Seven Years’ War, France sought to challenge British global dominance and supported the rebellion.  This support (which included troops during the latter half of the American Revolution) was instrumental to the revolution’s success, but it came at a hefty cost.  To make a long story short, France ran out of money somewhere in the midst of their battle for world domination.  It instituted a number of taxes on the already heavily-taxed Third Estate, who struggled to pay and still make ends meet.  Indeed, famine is now considered one of the causes of the French Revolution as the peasantry rebels in an effort to survive.  Ultimately, the Third Estate was unable to provide enough money to balance the books, and so the first two estates were asked to relinquish some of their traditional privileges and tax exemptions.
Naturally, this was not particularly popular.  To remove exemptions would be tantamount to challenging the hierarchical system itself, and with the king perched precariously at the top, it would be political suicide.  Instead of simply raising the taxes, then, the king was forced to call the Estates General into session in order to comprehensively reform the country.  With promises of reform coming and political pamphleteers like the Abbé Sieyès writing impassionedly in favor of the Third Estate, it was only a matter of time before public opinion began to turn against the ideas of hierarchy and divine right monarchy in favor of a system that placed talent above birth as a criterion for fitness to rule.

**III. How does the French Revolution relate to the Ancien Régime?**
The French Revolution is the reason why the term Ancien Régime makes sense.  The phrase first appears in the eighteenth century as a way to differentiate between hierarchy/divine right and equality/liberty/republicanism.  The “old” regime describes the state of affairs in Europe leading up to the French Revolution; the “new” regime was intended as an alternative based on reason.  Tradition versus talent, birth versus brains: this is the way that the pre- and post-Revolutionary worlds are separated.  I suppose that the answer to this final question is that it is the perceived abuses of the Ancien Régime that cause the French Revolution; and the Revolution that marks the downfall of the Ancien Régime.  Each is crucial for understanding the other.

Again, this is just meant as a short overview.  For futher reading, William Doyle, T.C.W. Blanning, Peter McPhee, Keith M. Baker, Albert Soboul, Lynn Hunt, Hillaire Belloc… everyone has their own interpretation.  For historical fun, check out de Tocqueville’s *L’Ancien Régime et la Révolution*.

If someone becomes too desensitised to violence, drug abuse, or sexualisation, then though they may not act out and do that, they may also not PREVENT it either. 

If someone who has become desensitised to violence was to observe a bar fight, they might see that as a normal way of life, when in reality it can be a dangerous environment for someone to be in, especially if it starts to spill into the street. They may see someone produce a knife or another form of weapon and not react correctly, such as warning someone about the weapon, because they would think 'well duh'. This means someone gets hurt or worse.

However, someone trained to think, 'OH SHIT A KNIFE' would likely shout it, and people would back off from the wielder, or refocus attention to calming a situation.

Same with sexual abuse/harrasment etc. If they think that becomes a norm, then they may not see the signs of someone that needs help, be it a young child or an adult.

Social immersion should be taken step by step, not all at once. It's why we have basic education at a younger age to develop rational thinking, then more in-depth education to expand upon it.

However, I will say this, I do think age restrictions are archaic, in the sense that seeing a breast/vagina/penis will bump a rating higher than verbal language, or violence. That teaches the wrong messages in many ways. We should look into a form of global agreement on what is and isn't acceptable for age groups. Sadly, we have a lot of countries that think their way is the right way, and are not willing to open up talks. PEGI is a step in the right direction for Europe, but if Japan, Australia, Germany and US all conflict that system, then it creates disparity amongst those nations, and also their youth as well.

For example, I think that GTA should be 16+. The level of *moral* education at schools now is so high (even in the US, drop the circlejerk for a moment if you will) that I think 16 year olds can handle what happens in these games.

However, things like Street Fighter should also come UP to meet this rating. I find it difficult sometimes to understand how Street Fighter and Tekken can have lower ratings than GTA, Red Dead, Dead Space etc.

If I, a well educated gamer, who works in the games industry (I am a Junior Producer) have a hard time understanding that, then most parents who have no interest in the media will have NO chance.


**tl;dr:** The system of age rating is broken. Don't blame parents, blame the fact people haven't come together to agree on a universal system through government stubbornness.",truegaming,1380615739,spoofex,20,20,ccir80o,t5_2sgq6,t3_1nhsqv,0,,t3_1nhsqv,

Ebert agreed with Prince Max that a social revolution was to be prevented and that state order must be upheld at all costs. In the restructuring of the state, Ebert wanted to win over the middle-class parties, which had already cooperated with the SPD in the Reichstag in 1917, as well as the old elites of the Empire. He wanted to avoid the spectre of radicalization of the revolution

It's bad enough that our broken news media continue to get this wrong without this artificial political correctness seeping into Reddit. This is not a case of both parties failing (we have plenty of examples of that.) This is a rabidly extreme section of the already extreme Republican party that is solely to blame.

The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It was passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President. We're talking about a law that takes baby steps towards the ultimate goal of providing Americans with universal health care - something that the populations of every other western nation (Europe, Canada) have long since taken for granted and are quite happy with.

The Tea Party nut jobs (within the Republican party) are using political trickery and jeopardizing the country's already fragile economy to impose their small minority's will on the rest of the nation. This would be bad enough on its own, but the fact that they have no chance of success topples the entire subject into crazy, lunatic territory. These people are dangerous and they are undermining our democracy, or what's left of it.

For crying out loud let's stop the pretense that this is a simple matter of two sides unable to come to a compromise. The fault lies entirely on the Republican Party and on the Tea Party segment in particular.

1380622238,t1_ccirurn,religion,0,True,False,1429284350,0,"Ah, yes, but it's the *timing* I was arguing with, not that the the Balfour Declaration had some sort of realpolitik purpose.  While it was clearly a device meant to appeal to Zionists and Jews, it was only published in November 1917, when America had already entered the War in April 1917.  Chaim Weitzman, it's worth pointing out, was a *Russian/British* Zionist, not an American one.  But yes, appealing to Zionists was meant to get 1) Jewish support in America generally, many of who were of German origin (particularly the wealthy ones), 2) get the attention of a few close Jewish/Zionist advisers of Wilson's, 3) get Jewish support in Russia generally (and, depending on when it was actually negotiated, some of the Soviet Leaders) 4) getting support of Jews in Western Europe and Britain and in the German and Austrian Empires, though it's unclear how many Jews in Western Europe were Zionists.  

Again, here, timing is key for any argument of *why*.  How far before the Americans joining the war effort was the Balfour Declaration planned?  Your Malcom piece states clearly, for example, ""[in May 1916], the Jews were not mentioned at all [in the Sykes-Picot agreement] and had clearly not been intended to have anything to do with the future Palestine.""  It's unclear when he's opening negotiations.  The next mention of a date is ""An informal Anglo-Zionist gathering took place at the house of Dr. Gaster on the 7th February, 1917, to meet Sir Mark Sykes, and Herbert Samuel (now Lord Samuel), James de Rothschild, Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Sokolow, Dr. Tchlenow and Mr. Sacher and one or two others were present,"" after the deal was apparently already made, but before it was widely publicized.  In the Lloyd George Memoir, for instance, it clearly says, ""such were the chief considerations which, *in 1917*, impelled the British Government...""

So, was it meant to bring Americans into the War?  And was it in ""October 1916"", as Freedman claims?  Here's where I don't think it was, either.  I think it was later than that, and I think it was meant, essentially, as a PR campaign among an important, probably pro-German constituency in the U.S., one that seemed to have the ear of Wilson (through Brandeis and Frankfurter).  I don't think it's possible to argue that this wasn't the Balfour Declaration's goal.  I'm sorry if I didn't make that clearer.  Going back to Friedman's speech

&gt;However, they made that promise, in October of 1916.   October, nineteen hundred and sixteen. 

I don't think there's any evidence that a promise was made that early.

&gt;And shortly after that — I don't know how many here remember it — the United States, which was almost totally pro-German — totally pro-German — because the newspapers here were controlled by Jews, the bankers were Jews, all the media of mass communications in this country were controlled by Jews, and they were pro-German because their people, in the majority of cases came from Germany, and they wanted to see Germany lick the Czar. 

I don't think this is at all true either.  While the majority of the Jews may have been pro-German, it's hard to say the whole country was pro-German as Freedman argues, nevermind the whole country was pro-Germany *because of the alleged Jewish control of all the newspapers, etc.*.  

&gt;To say that the Balfour Declaration is what brought America into war is several bridges too far though I think.

To be clear, I think the Balfour Declaration was meant *primarily* for American Zionists, with secondary audiences in Russia, Germany, and Western Europe, but I think it was meant to *shore up* support in the American Jewish community rather than single handedly bring American into the War at the behest of Jewish bankers and newspapermen, as Friedman appears to argue.  

So, to be clear, the British were not acting altruistically with the Balfour Declaration--it was specifically calculated to help their foreign policy goals, yes.  But that doesn't mean Freedman's at all accurately presents the reality of the situation.  Like I said, ""Most conspiracy theories are built around a nugget of truth--the one real bit of history is that the Balfour Declaration [...] declared formal British support for a Jewish 'national home' in Palestine"".  Yes, the Balfour declaration was meant to affect world-wide, and particularly American, Jewish opinion, but again, not exactly in the way that Freedman claims it did.

Man City and Chelsea sack managers because they do not live up to the high expectations of the board.

It's early days, but 2 wins in 6 is cause for concern, and it's not as if Man Utd have been unlucky in the games -they've struggled all season to create anything. 

Worst of all, is this attitude of Moyes to blame the board and Ferguson for the quality of the side -immediately after shitting himself in another big game (Moyes record speaks emphatically for itself here), and by lowering expectations of the fans for this seasons' CL, he can now justifiably play his negative, fear football against the best of Europe too.",soccer,1380623652,FullerBatistuta,10,10,ccis4a4,t5_2qi58,t3_1ngzay,0,,t1_ccikryk,Stoke City

Yes, because it's not as if people in the UK are free to write, speak, organise, lobby, form political parties or stand for election.

I don't necessarily disagree with the rest of your analysis, my point is simply that human rights advocates should engage with the world as it is rather than the world as they would like it to be, and face the fact that human rights law in the UK is in trouble and it's not enough to dismiss the problem as entirely down to small-minded right-wing Tory bigots. It seems to me that the Tories are entirely correct to point out that if no other way is found to fix the broken relationship between the UK and the European Court, then the UK's last resort is to scrap the HRA, withdraw from the ECHR and implement a replacement framework that protects human rights without exposing the UK to the whims of an activist court that has failed to respect the margin of appreciation accorded to all signatories. Now, I grant you the extent to which that last part is true is up for debate, but I don't see the problem in the Tories setting out their stall for the benefit of the voters and (hopefully) to encourage the European Court to consider some form of rapprochement.

False,t1_ccisiw2,,0,True,False,1429284037,0,"Germany has a export oriented economy since 2 decades. Since that the wages stagnate. And Germany has no way to compensate their exports on the domestic market. So Germany depends on their exports. Their wage stagnation policy created an low inflation policy which means in a currency union with a common inflation target that you devalue your ""shadow currency"" and make your products less expensive in other Euro countries. The export in no Euro countries is also better with the Euro because such a large currency is less likely to increase in value then a ""smaller"" German currency.

Also it's not that relevant how ""high-value"" (do you have an economic definition for that) the exports are if nobody has the money to buy them. If you see in the newspapers Chinese import of German capital shrinks because the crisis has lowered the demand for consumable goods. Europe buys so 50% of German exports if they break the whole German growth strategy depends on the US and some not very stable 2. World countries. And if they get struck by a crisis (Brazil?) Then Germany has some different problems then rising public debt.

Also when you have to pay like 1% interest rate (sometimes negative interest rates!) a shrinking public debt is not hard to archive. There was no relevant austery in Germany the last years. Of course not they don't want to ruin their economy.

&gt;The public debt we currently have is much a result of the reunification with East Germany.

Financial crash, lower income and cooperation tax and so on. The public debt has some more reasons then the reunification which by the way was not a Keynesian deficit spending project.

&gt; So it seem, that German goods find demand, even in those times

That is not a economic argument. Also when were there difficult times for the export industry? Do you mean 2008/2009? That was also for Germany a shitty time which our industry only survived because of Keynesian policies. Please try to be a little more specific.

First off, the vast majority of people I've spoken with about the state of healthcare today do not know that the problems we have today were in fact created by the government: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHXzAU8_0fg

As you'll see in this video healthcare was previously provided ""universally"" quite well and cheaply, not through the state but through mutual aid from societies including fraternal organizations. It was not even done for profit. But people who wanted to profit from it used the state to their advantage to shut it down. You see this same effect when corporations lobby today.

The ACA is not ""universal"" healthcare, it's basically a state manipulation of the current health insurance market via increased subsidy and a bunch of other laws. The main issue, to me, is the increased subsidies.

When subsidies enter a market, it manipulates competition unfairly, because in an unfettered market, prices go lower as choices and competition increase. Subsidization creates soft monopolies by cornering markets. You see this effect everywhere, from rising education costs and even the markets for loans themselves. Yet people keep begging the state to end these problems that they created in the first place and continue to create!

Further, you have to qualify for the subsidies and if you're not qualified you have to pay a yearly tax. If you don't pay the tax you WILL receive free healthcare...in prison.

In systems like European or Canadian universal healthcare, all healthcare is subsidized. These systems are often touted but the reality is they're grossly inefficient. I mean, imagine the DMV handling healthcare. It's absolutely ridiculous. 

The Native Americans have had subsidized healthcare for a long time in America. It's an absolutely terrible system. ""Don't get sick after June"".

Lahm is easily the best positional , tackling, passing, and crossing RB, while a large part of Schweini'a skills rely on his mental and passing skills, though he needs strength too. We do have Javi Martinez who can play a single pivot too, who is 26.

&gt;
&gt; The new ruling has prompted retired law professor Madeleine Leijonhufvud to speak out and call for the introduction of a specific law which says that consent must be given before sex.

I'd say Ms Leijonhufvud has an excellent suggestion there - the problem is that Swedish law seems to miss the fairly fundamental point that sex without consent is rape. Also in for example the UK sex with a girl under 16 would be illegal

http://www.sarcplymouth.co.uk/default/index.cfm/historic/consent/

&gt; It is a criminal offence for someone of either sex to take part in sexual activity with someone under the age of 16, unless it is reasonable to believe that that person is 16 or older. Sexual activity includes sexual intercourse and intentional sexual touching. The penalties for an offence of this type are more severe if it is committed by someone who is 18 or over rather than someone who is under 18.
&gt;
&gt; It is legal for two people of the opposite sex or the same sex to have a sexual relationship if you are both 16 or over and you both consent to the sexual activity.
&gt;
&gt; Where both people are under 16, each will be committing an offence if they have a sexual relationship. However, it is unlikely that there will be any prosecution if both people agreed to have sex and one person was not taking advantage of the other. If someone under the age of 16 is sexually involved with someone else aged 16 or over, the younger person will not be committing an offence. However, the person over 16 could be charged.

In Sweden the Age of Consent is 15

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe#Sweden

&gt; The age of consent in Sweden is 15, as specified by the Swedish Penal Code, Chapter 6 (On Sexual Crimes). The age of fifteen is referred to several times, for example in Section 4, which reads: ""A person who has sexual intercourse with a child under fifteen years of age or who with such a child carries out another sexual act that, having regard to the nature of the violation and the circumstances in general, is comparable to sexual intercourse, shall be sentenced for rape of a child to imprisonment for at least two and at most six years.""

IMO a lot of the problems with Swedish law is that it all seems a bit woolly. If you read about the Assange case there's no mention of consent, rather vague notions of 'bodily integrity' and the age of consent has been set too low in an attempt to be seen as liberal, sexually liberated etc. 

The net effect of all that is that if a naive 15 year old strays into the ghetto which is what Tensta sounds like

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensta

&gt; Tensta has a large concentration of immigrants, high rates of unemployed and people on social welfare.[3] The open unemployment rate is 43.5% (2009) and the rate of people on social welfare is 40.2% (1999). In 1999 the employment rate was 44%.[3] Immigrants make up 66% of the population and 95%-100% of the children in local schools are of foreign origin.

... this sort of thing happens and the Swedish legal system will exhonerate the perpetrators. 

I'd say if six teenagers have sex with a 15 year old the onus should be on them to prove it was consensual. The boys were older too

http://www.thelocal.se/50488/20130927/

&gt; Six teenage boys aged 15 to 17 were cleared by an appeals court on Friday of raping a 15-year-old girl in the Stockholm suburb of Tensta in March.
&gt; 
&gt; The Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt) ruled that according to the law as it was framed prior to July 1st 2013, the girl could not have been deemed to be in a ""incapacitated state"", while recognizing that she was in a vulnerable situation.

See here's the problem. She said she said no and the court seems to have no opinion on this. Since she wasn't unconscious and there were no explicit threats of violence she was deemed to have consented.

&gt; The court found that there was insufficient evidence to indicate that she was afraid of being subjected to other physical violence if she had said no to the boys. The court cited testimony from a friend of the girl who said that her no to sex had been respected.

Friend of the girl, or friend of the defendants?

&gt; The court furthermore ruled that the boys' testimony was credible, despite the fact that four of the boys initially denied being at the party where the alleged rape took place, before changing their stories.
&gt;
&gt; The appeals court argued that as the boys knew that a friend had already been arrested, a fear of becoming accused themselves was sufficient motivation to lie.

Both games are part of the grand stategy genre, meaning they're highly complex and detailed games focusing on governing a nation through a time period.

These two games take different approaches to this.

*Crusader Kings 2* takes place during the medieval era and focuses on feudal politics in Europe and surrounding areas, such as Northern Africa, Eastern Asia, and the middle east.

In CK2 you do not actually play as a nation, but as a feudal ruler, with his (or occasionally, her's) own personality and skills. You can play as either a King, Count, Duke, Emperor, or the regional equivalent (Earl, Sultan).

In CK2, you will not only have to focus on ruling your realm effectively, but you will also have to secure the survival, and eventually, power of your dynasty.
CK2's world is filled with people, Lords and Ladies, Lowborns and bishops. Many of these people will have an agenda, and will try to achieve it.

This is a game in which you'll have to do everything from arranging feasts, weddings, and tax reforms, to killing your daddy, murdering babies in their sleep, and trying to maneuvre your way through succession laws.

It's a great game, and it's the first one I've seen to combine Strategy and Role-Playing games.

PCGamer published a series about one journalist's attempt to unify Ireland, [it's a pretty great read](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/09/05/crusader-kings-chronicle-the-prologue/

----

In *Europa Universalis* you will be tasked with guiding a nation through the renaissance, the age of discovery, and possibly, revolution.

The game takes place between 1444 'till 1820 and allows you to play any nation that existed during the time period, as long as they weren't *too* small.

We have the NHS or similar systems throughout Europe and pay taxes for these systems. They are for us to use  and people that happen to be here at that very moment. Thats a perfectly fine and moral and just human system in the end.

Someone coming over here for the sole purpose of leeching on that system and then flying back home to pay taxes abroad even though it's a wealthy country where he is coming from annoys me massively.

Admittedly it's not Vancouver-specific, but it's clear that the vast majority of tourists in Canada come from the US - not particularly surprising given how close the two countries are.

I'd imagine this is the case for Paris as well, travellers from the EU likely outnumber Chinese tourists (I gave up looking for data after five minutes of googling. I'm sure it's out there, I'd appreciate if someone could point me towards it)

Further the argument for cognitive error only really stands where there is a bias against tourists from mainland china to begin with. It doesn't stand to reason that every city complaining about mainland tourists had a pre-existing bias against them.

Naturally then one has to wonder where this hostility towards Chinese tourists stemmed from in the first place. A possible explanation is that Chinese tourists *are* typically more rude than tourists from other countries. Certainly it's not the only explanation, but referring to cognitive error and the percentage of ""bad apples"" in a very large barrel oversimplifies the issue.

From personal experience I'd say people in high energy generally do okay, depending on what you study and the skills you develop. Some high energy theorists will apply to more than 100 positions before they find one when they're finishing their PhDs; I think for experimentalists it's generally way easier than that. Overall employment for physics PhD holders is really great statistically - usually the unemployment rate is like 1% or something absurdly low like that, but that doesn't mean everyone employed does physics or even physics that they like. There's lots of info on AIP's page that you can dig through if you're curious (assuming you're American, I think the situation in Europe might be pretty similar or you can dig around for region specific statistics). 


As an aside I'd like to mention that there's tons more physics out there than the stuff high school students or the general public are exposed to. High energy physics has a really, really good PR arm and anything that sounds really crazy can get mention in the public sphere as well (is the universe inside a black hole, will the LHC blow up Earth, etc.). But that's only a pretty small part of what all real physicists do, maybe 10 or 15%. There's lots of really interesting physics outside of high energy (just look at how varied the Nobel prize winners work has been, and even then that's not necessarily representative), so if you find the physics something you want to pursue I would highly recommend keeping an open mind about what kind of physics is interesting. Usually University courses leave a little wiggle room, so if you do a year or two of physics and decide you don't like it, you can usually graduate in 4 years with an engineering degree if you switch out of physics before the end of the 2nd year. So pursuing a PhD is definitely not a lost cause, but I think reddit's general slant towards high energy and the userbase can put things in a real negative light when they are not evidently that way.

I lived in Montpelier for a short time and sure enough I met a few adults that had done a school report on Canadian Natives.  Also, in France, occasionally you'll meet someone reasonably knowledgeable of Quebec and with desire to travel there for the nature, the Laurentiens.  They were certainly aware of the extreme geographic size, which also was an attraction.  The concept of driving for 2 - 3 hours and still be in Quebec instead of crossing 2 - 3 countries was expressed as pure wonder.  Of course, I'm sitting there thinking they'd probably ""enjoy"" a Winnipeg - Calgary drive, and yes indeed when describing a 2 - 4 day drive of golden wheat fields there was incredulous wonder about doing just such a thing.  Something I learned in this instance, is that a 2 - 4 day W - C drive can be easily upsold: Winnipeg has a lot of French history, and Calgary is 45 minutes from the Rockies - again, to some southern French people, this was beyond exotic.

I was in southern Africa for awhile, on a project to export university students to universities in various countries for a ""real"" degree.

It resulted in about 70 - 80% choosing Canada or N.European university, they just couldn't get over their suspicion of American racism.  It was a real learning experience for all involved, and a bit difficult because, as this was a momentous decision for them, the students asked some very direct questions ""How much racism is there really in America / Will I get beaten / Will they steal my money?""  How do you answer that?

that's just not completely true, this is the story of the company Ferrero (for which I worked for and still do sometimes btw) [on wikipedia](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrero_%28azienda%29).

the company was started by his grand-dad Pietro Ferrero and was inherited by Michele ferrero as a medium sized company, it's true it was Michele who made it grow into a multinational but he inherited a company with 60 worker and left a company firmly rooted in the european economy with plants all over europe.

Also a few interesting fact about Ferrero:

- the family still holds the majority of the company

- as early as 1983 they made a fundation for their employee

- even though the family is amongst the richest people on earth they live a relatively limited life, you never see them on tv or newspaper, they don't own a thousand villas but the family mansion is something very great, they give parties there for the company and the closest employee

- the recepy of Nutella (hazel nuts cream) is a traditional recepy from piedmont which Pietro Ferrero built upon and industrialized, the actul ""home recepy"" provide a different product which lasts few days and then start dividing again into the components, it has to be consumed fresh.

- You still don't appreciate this in USA but it will reach you as Nutella did...[Estathe](http://www.controappuntoblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/395_LIMONE.jpg), across europe the consumer consider it an ""addictive"" beverage, it's actually a secret guarded recepy based on ingredients that have space project level tolerances.",todayilearned,1380633767,dadadu,2,2,ccitu3z,t5_2qqjc,t3_1nhgil,0,,t1_ccinxid,

False,t1_ccitwdt,,0,True,False,1429283396,0,"There are several reasons you can't just compare these statistcs, severall of witch are outlined in the report.

1) **Differences in reporting the statistics in different countries**. In 1.1.1.6, they write: 
&gt;Petty offences are not always recorded in police statistics. Also, coun-
tries differ in the way they consider certain offences as petty (e.g. theft of
low value items).

This could be a source of major crimerate inflation, if for example Sweden is including offences such as speeding whilst other countries are not. If you wan't an accurate picture, you need to look into specifik offences (eg. number of homocides). 

2) **Willingness to report offenses vary from country to country.** This is oulined in 1.1.1.3, 1.1.1.4 and 1.1.1.5: 
&gt;Victims may choose not to report the crime to the police or may not be
aware that they have been a victim of crime. In addition, reporting may be
self-incriminating (e.g. when a victim is also an offender) or humiliating;
or the victim may think that nothing will be gained by reporting (e.g. the
victim thinks that the police will not be able to solve the crime). If a victim
does not report a crime, and the police do not learn about the offence
from another source, the offence will not be recorded and therefore not
counted in police statistics. Research suggests that victims of assault or
rape tend to be less likely to report the offence than victims of property
offences.

&gt;Even when a crime is reported to the police, it may not be recorded
in the official statistics. This occurs mainly after investigations that lead
the police to believe that the event reported did not actually constitute
a crime. Research has shown that recording is less likely to occur for
offences against persons than for property offences.

In other words - if the swedish society is one where crimes that carry a lot of stigma (rape, for example) are reported, and the police also register these offenses, a stastical inflation would result. [Studies have come to this precise conclusion before.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008713631586#page-1) 

3) **The effectiveness of the police in different countries varies.** If police in one country is very effective, and has high conviction rate, then they would obviously have higher higher numbers than a country with a low conviction rate, regardless of the real number of legal offenes in each. That is why statistics sorrounding the number of homocides are much more interesting than the number of caught murders when you are comparing countries. 

4) **Legal definitions vary between countries, as does the legality of different actions**. Sweden has for example one of the toughest drug laws in europe, and also activley enfores them. The buying of sex is also illegal. In countries such as Netherlands, all these actions would be considered legal and dandy, thus making non-specific statistical comparissons very missleading. 

**TLDR: These statistics are very broad, and differences in the police effectiveness, the public willingsness to report, legal definitions and how the statistics are gathered in each country can skew the data significantly. That's why looking at specific types of crimes when doing comparisons between countries paints a much better picture.** ",todayilearned,1380634020,lobax,4,4,ccitwdt,t5_2qqjc,t3_1nhgil,0,,t1_ccirmsa,

Sure, people are free to follow whatever paradigm they see fit, but its looking increasingly likely that the 'nationalist' framework we have had as human social groups has worked for several centuries, right now its starting to look less and less relevant. Consider this: we grew up as a species and increased the size of our social groups - first as family kinship groups, then tribes, then monarchies, then nations in the industrial age. Each stage was relevant then, and perhaps we are beginning to see the next transition.

The internet certainly helps, not only can we talk to people of different races religions and nationalities online and find out we have a lot more in common than we do as differences, but the speed of communications helps us to relay what we understand about the unfolding situation much faster. We did this first with the printing press, and lo and behold there was a revolution in terms of thinking in Europe with Lutheranism and the Enlightenment. Think what will happen with the internet in terms of a global society.

To get back to the money supply - if we can agree that the system is knackered and needs an overhaul of some kind, this is the idea that needs proliferating. My belief is that we should make our systems idiot proof. If there is a problem with the way our money *works*, its more or less a technical issue. The evidence points to the mechanics of fiat money being flawed - both in its centralisation and its lack of backing by a commodity.

Politics is also something many will agree is a waste of time to get involved in, first and foremost as the main players are a group of entrenched privileged individuals in the same camp as the financial elites. In fact you can argue they are the same people in many countries. Why not crowdfund political candidates through something like Kickstarter?

Now, I think we should be careful and not go the whole hog over to the camp of hyper libertarian dogma and metaphysical woo-woo ideas here, as is the tendency to happen when innovative and bold new ideas come about, but neither should we rest on our laurels in a relativistic sense and just throw hubris around about our respective countries and their cultures whilst waiting for the next artificial boom to sort the mess out.

So yes, this idea of 'growth' needs to end. Fast. We should cultivate openness - much like the Soviet Union did in the 80s ([Glasnost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost)) - and the idea that many heads can solve this mess.

Secondly, Europe accomplished whatever it is they think they accomplished only after asking for, and then demanding, US support. So they couldn't even do that alone. Wherever and whenever Europe takes action, you'll see the US's fingerprints all over it because, again, the US is essentially Europe's protector. You're welcome.

There are 4 main options on healthcare.  
1.  Single-payer.  This is what most of Europe has.  It's nice because it doesn't cost much, but it doesn't encourage innovations in medicine with profit.  
2.  Obamacare.  The government is forcing everyone to buy health insurance, but it's all from private companies.  Lots of benefits, but still not very good.  
3.  Our old system.  It was just awful.  If you wanted a system that would screw over people with birth defects, genetic disorders, etc., this is the one I would give you.  
4.   Minimalist insurance coverage.  Youtube user HowTheWorldWorks made a great case for it.  [here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuqtZxVole8) It's the option I prefer.  

Despite Obamacare being not so great, it was passed passed by Congress, signed by the President, upheld by the Supreme Court, and Obama was reelected after passing it.  Everything on the GOP's list of demands has already been passed as law, and some of the demands are absurd, like taking away the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gasses (the main purpose of the EPA).

The rest are PVP sets.

Here is a quick rundown on how  to get them

* Jax : Credits via daily quests in Cutthroat Harbor

* Agnitor : Nexus event credits.

* Abyss : Argon Corpus dungeon.

* Regent : Manaya's Core dungeon.

* Mayhem : Kelsaik Raid dungeon

* Visionmaker : Crafted (expensive)

* Steadfast : Channelworks, Shattered Fleet, Kezzel’s Gorge, Wonderholme

* Wonderholme : Crafted from Steadfast, dropped in Wonderholme Hard and MCHM

* Nightforge : Crafted from Visionmaker (again expensive)




I suggest you grab Jax and Agnitor gear to start out with by doing Nexus
everytime and doing some dailies and then jump straight to the new Gear.
Steadfast/Wonderholme dungeons aren't very hard and the gear is better
than the old Visionmaker which had been the highest tiered set for a while.

For example, I saw women with kids begging at the train stations or outside shopping centers and this was when I supposed school session was going on as it was not summer yet. 

In the USA for example, if you're a kid, 6, 7, 8 years old, whatever, you can't be out on the streets begging, and if you're, the police will come out and get you.

So one thing that could be done, if you're out begging, then the police would come get you and put you to do some type of community labor, like cleaning out the streets, etc. Soon enough the word will get out that if you come to sweden to beg, you'll be put to work on the streets, whatever. I'm sure that then these people will not be coming to Sweden as they would go to another country where they are allowed to steal and beg, like in the UK for example. :P

Education is poorer because these schools are usually in smaller towns and villages, the budgets of both countries for education suck and at least in Bulgaria the educational system is a clusterf*. Furthermore these children prefer not to study, because roma culture does not value education, often they prefer to use the children for some profit and the roma communities are violent against the authorities, teachers, doctors etc. They also do not care much about public property stripping it of anything valuable. This also applies to schools - which combined with the abovementioned poor budgets makes maintenance nigh impossible. Older children are often violent against teachers and are often involved in petty crime. Finally roma barons and leaders, and many roma themselves do their best to keep the state of things as it is. Integration is extremely difficult, and often just a waste of resources, and the romani are very, very good at sounding opressed, abused and expert at abusing the system. Speaking of integration the major romani ngos that deal with this are usually just a syphon for European money.

And the antiziganism sentiments are mostly a reaction - this does not make it any better, hating any group of people is bad, and sadly, in this case there is some basis that goes beyound racism, stereotypes and xenophobia. Another issue is that thanks to a lot of the illegal romani immigrants and their activities it is more difficult to find a job in EU as a bulgarian or romanian, which further increases anti-roma feelz. tl;dr its a complicated issues, and roma populations are a legit problem in Europe and integration almost never works.",worldnews,1380638095,cybelechild,37,37,cciv1gb,t5_2qh13,t3_1niach,0,,t1_ccitl8g,

My confusion here, when looking at the US from the European vantage point, is why there is a debate about this fact in the first place? All you need to do is compare our two systems and see which one's better and more enabling for society in general. You have all the case studies you need in the decades of social democracies here on the old contintent. You have Canada next door. They all have some form of universal health care that relies on working people chipping in while they're healthy in order to treat others (and themselves if need be) who are sick and injured.

It feels really strange to me to look at the US reinvent the wheel like this, losing so much precious time debating about this being ""theft"", ""socialism"", ""overly interfering government"", etc. while financially challenged families die from treatable conditions on a daily basis.

I'm not trying to sound judgmental, I'm genuinely confused, because on the other side of the coin Americans seem like one of the easiest nations on the planet to rally together in times of need. Natural disasters, 9/11, take your pick - the sense of togetherness and lack of selfishness is (on occasions) overwhelming and drives even worldwide popular culture (movies and TV shows from the US are dominant in portraying this and have global reach). 

Truly confusing. It's blatantly obvious most people in the US *aren't* so selfish and *don't* think helping others out is akin to enabling freeloaders.

This is both directly important in the sense that there are (were) plenty of ""hermit kingdoms"" like NK that were never part of another nation. Cuba, Burma, etc. But it's also simply a matter of the conception of nation state and stuff like that, tl;dr ""countries"" is a term still being defined and for many, many places communism was arguably the first form of formal, nation forming government in the area's history.

All that said, you note yourself the Kim family's importance in Korea. Can't be stressed enough. Soviet support and a cult of personality took you a long fucking way in the 50's. 

An eduation on the Eastern bloc could be fitting as well. For one we have to abandon the post-Cold War reading that identifies this all as brute soviet bullying. The soviet union came within inches of being annihilated in world war II and then upon victory found itself confronted with a fresh faced American army supported by a truly unstoppable american prosperity/manufacturing base with which the soviet union could not hope to compete in the near term. This whole business of ""satellite nations"" and ""buffer zones"" is not just political pretext for annexation. The soviet union saw the dual benefit of stealing necessary resources and establishing tons of non-Russian territory between the West and themselves.

So the Soviets were administering East Germany, sure, out of greed, evil, etc., but also out of perfectly rational political/economic fears. 

Let's not forget this nation had just nearly destroyed the Soviets. It is important to realize the Eastern bloc is not a single ethnicity or political body: Countries like Yugoslavia, the Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, were ethnically Slavic, like Russia. In some places this meant little, in others a lot. It was in these countries, in general, that the imprint of Russification is strongest, because the Russians were treading well worn cultural ground.

By contrast Hungary, Romania, and East Germany (along with some baby baltic states and albania) were not ethnically Slavic. Hungary had once been as big and powerful as France in Europe, and the history of the world wars is in no small part the story of Slavic (russian) power rebalancing against the Germanic-Hungarian-sattelite slav (czechs, poland) nations that held Eastern European hegemony.

All of that to say, the Eastern bloc experience is very much not a story, on a detailed level, of simple bullying. Complex historical forces were at work of which the Russians and their captors were all too well aware. The Hungarians rebelled in 1956, and the American air lifts to East Berlin signified that the West was not leaving behind half of Germany to turn into a slavic satellite state. The historically Germanicly influenced Czechs and Polish later led their own resistances. These events embarassed the Soviets on the world stage and led to more free rein in those countries. In effect, East Germany was one of the freest countries in eastern europe, and one of the most prosperous.


tl;dr The notion that the Eastern bloc was this Russian hellhole is just a western misconception. The ""western"" eastern bloc nations were never subjugated as much as say, the Ukraine or Kazakhstan. Additionally, NK lacked a precedent for Western government that kept rule of law alive in the Eastern bloc. All of Korea was also reeling from Japan's invasion the decade before.

tl;dr part dux, there's almost nothing in common between the two situations, but you shouldn't at all feel ignorant. the average person who just sailed through a western historical education in school would probably not even be able to find Korea on a map.

So in summary: ship to Canada! Just make sure you out the extra shipping cost on the buyer and make sure you choose a shipping method that has tracking. This helps protect you if someone tries to file a claim that they never received your item, then you can whip out your tracking number info and BAM it says delivered, mother fucker! Having delivery confirmation is basically the only way Paypal will side with you if a dispute would arise. If the buyer doesn't want to pay the extra for tracked shipping, suggest them to pay by ""gift"", this protects you so that they cannot file a claim since it's considered a gift and you can ship the cheapest way without tracking.

Yes it will. If you count aspectual constructions with lightverbs, Spanish has gained a freaking lot of these. If you don't, why not? It's also gaining object marking in the verb, which latin and medieval Spanish lacked.

That's also a tricky question and it still depends on which country and what you need for your professional qualifications. 

In general, the standard of education is increasing. Thus, having a MA or a MSc could only work in your favour. Though, if your profession doesn't need it, then you would need to think about the cost of that education.

1380641116,t1_ccivvde,,0,True,False,1429282476,0,"&gt; Maybe I'm missing something but I thought most TVs could output 1080p24 these days. I know mine certainly does and it ain't that fancy.

[Noooope](http://i.qkme.me/3ug5y3.jpg). First, I'm guessing you mean input, not output. And no, most TVs *don't* do that. They're designed to support the ATSC 1.0/DVB/ISDB standard (whichever is appropriate for your region) and some subset of HDMI's specs (probably HDMI 1.0 to 1.2, HDMI 1.4 is beyond what most TVs are capable of, and 2.0 is *way* out there). So *most* TVs out there (which includes TVs that people already own) support 480i29.97, 480p29.97, 720p59.94, 1080i29.97, (or 576i25, 576p25, 720p50 and 1080i25 in Europe) and *maybe* native resolution at 60Hz (most likely *only* via VGA, however). And I know that exactly *zero* of the TVs in our office handle 24p natively, we have to tell our video hardware to apply pull-down.

&gt; My understanding was that most tv's these days could do refresh rates of 120hz or 240hz, so 1080p24 stuff played smoothly. This is because 120/240 is a multiple of 24.

120Hz and 240Hz are also multiples of 60 and 30. And that irritating motion interpolation ""feature"" is typically only on higher end televisions. But that doesn't mean those TVs accept 1080p23.98 as an input signal, nor does it mean most consumer hardware devices will output that signal. *Maybe* those TVs are detelecining the input signal (when detected) but I'd bet they aren't.

&gt; My htpc with xbmc automatically adjusts the framerate on the tv and I'm pretty sure that the wd live I used to have, could do the same thing.

But an HTPC is a completely different beast than a Roku. It's not manufactured to a price point, or optimized in design for simplicity. Remember: your HTPC probably cost several hundred dollars to build (assuming all parts new). The Roku costs $49 on the low end and $99 on the high end. It's all embedded components chosen and configured for the simplest possible set-up.

And it's my understanding that the WD Live supported 1080p23.98 *only* for locally played back content (*not* for Netflix or Hulu or VUDU or whatever else) and only on the now-discontinued model. But [that doesn't mean all TVs can display it anyhow](http://vid.ly/2s1k5i).

Tripod. Oh man, it's tough to choose one. I thought about buying one for a long time, but could never decide which one is better.

Some time ago I came across this: [Dolica AX620B100 62-Inch Proline Tripod and Ball Head](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D60LG8/)... but cost of importing it to Poland is as much as tripod itself! (It would be around $85). So I looked into some local shops, but each got some weird tripods that cost more than $100 and didn't offer so much flexibility as Dolica. And they weighed a ton.

Today I'm looking at [Hahnel Triad 40 Lite](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0046EDM1U/) and I was thinking... should I import Dolica, which costs less (incl shipping) and is lighter, or go for Hahnel?

Or (and this is why I'm posting over here, to you, fellow Redditors)... Are there any good tripods under $100, available in Europe (preferable amazon.co.uk) and that could do this: [IMAGE](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71vE5IEbaRL._SL1500_.jpg)?

The ruling parties of most other countries do not, ultimately, effect America. Even your close allies (us, for example), will not have a huge effect on you.

There is also the entertainment value....we watch American politics out of a dread fascination for how much of a train wreck *your* right wing parties are (I say 'your' right wing, because it's a bit of a laughable statement. America doesn't really have any large left wing parties. In Europe, Obama would be considered centre-right at best. Most Americans don't seem to have any real idea what left wing actually is).

This is actually really common. But in most European societies it takes revolution to really usher in new changes to the old political order (or in the case of right wing revolutionaries, old changes to restore the old order). Basically the vocal minority usually gets upset if their vocal demands are not met. They will then lead some kind of revolt (though, as today shows us, violence is *not* necessary) against the old geopolitical status quo. 

Another good example would be socialists in the Second German Empire. They basically declared they would only stay in government so long as they got the programs and concessions they demanded. But once those stopped, they would lead the revolution to overthrow the Kaiser. And Otto Von Bismark, the savvy politician he was, dealt with them the easiest way possible: he granted all of their reforms.

Most Quebecers would refer to themelves as non practicing catholics and couldn't care less about whether someone is atheist or not.

Quebec city is a fantastic city to live in, and is medium sized.  However it does have a, sadly somewhat justified, reputation as a city that is not especially welcoming to non Quebecers.  I do know some non-Quebecers who live there and they love it, but it takes some time to be brought into the family so to speak.

That said the city has one of the lowest unemployment rates an highest average incomes in Canada.  it has a very European feel to it.  Crime rate is very low, amazing food, good access to cultural events...  the only problem is that living in the city proper is very expensive, the housing bubble did not burst in Canada.  And cost of living in Canada in general is higher than in the states.  Also you'd need to learn French.  It should be noted that the influx of islamists into the country is causing rural quebec to react in a frankly very ugly way, but a very Canadian way.  IE no violence per se just some name calling and some debate over a very stupid document called 'la charte des valeurs quebecoises' I think.  A very scary document, but it would seem very mild in the US.  We still teach evolution in schools, allow abortion with no bombed clinics, passed gay marriage laws years ago, etc etc.  

Alberta is quite religious, but that's compared to the rest of Canada.  Religion has not penetrated our government quite the way it has the US's so there is less stigmatization to being an atheist. 

I would recommend Ontario as a more neutral ground though.  You'd probably be fine in Calgary, but try something like Ottawa where they are very religiously neutral.  It is very similar to quebec city in feel, more londony then parisy, slightly bigger but not too big.  And they speak English.

There are a LOT of ongoing projects, researchers, students and scientists in this country who get funding from and work with these agencies. I'm one of them. We have three students in the research group who have pending funds from NSF right now that can't get it. We have papers that need to be reviewed. We have people we need to talk to. Can't do any of it.

And that's just a tiny slice of it. There are a lot of businesses out there who do contract work for DoD, Dept of Energy, Dept of Education, DARPA. Nobody will answer those calls until the shutdown ends. A lot of companies have to interface with the EPA in their operations. They can't do that anymore either. 

Just because the shutdown isn't affecting your own little slice of the world doesn't mean that it doesn't have wide reaching affect on the economy, countless businesses, students, researchers and scientists. The shutdown is a ""big deal"" for a lot of people who woke up to the unpleasant news this morning. Not everyone's lives is limited to the local governments.

&gt;When you take systems that work well for a country with 22 million people, you end up with well, state government. Those systems don’t scale well to something with 15 times the population.

And please, don't give me this crap. This was true maybe half a century ago. *Maybe*.

It just doesn't apply anymore. Scaling these systems is a trivial issue when communication is this easy in the internet age.

And no, our federal government does not have more in common with the EU. That used to be true in late 1700s, but hasn't been the case since the civil war. In this modern, highly populous and increasingly globalized world though, each individual state has about a snowflake's chance in hell of becoming self-sustaining. They're bound to each-other and the federal government *inseparably*. They're bound by laws, bound by resources.

A more apt description would be that the state governments are local branches of the federal government that is responsible with interfacing with the local *American* (notice, not Virginian or Floridian or Californian) citizens independently from the federal government when rendering services (many of which are federally funded). As such, they maintain a semi-independent revenue stream (localized taxes) so that they can continue operation even when the federal government cannot.

Your entire post reads like a propoganda poster for why we should return back to the 1700s structure where States were independent ""countries"" that formed the union (federal government) in order to police and mediate inter-state trades. That's just insanity. That kind of structure has no place in the modern world. The United States of America *is*, not are, a single unified country and the state lines just don't have much of a meaning anymore. Neither should they.

You are absolutely right, you should be loved with scars and all. Denying or hiding what you have gone through will not work in the long run and will not foster a healthy relationship. It's like what they say when someone passes away: you will never forget that person, and their death will never be less real, it just won't hurt as much when you think about them.

Had these motherfucking cock sucking Europeans stopped handing over their money to people who beg, there wouldnt be beggars. 

Ive seen beggars in Oslo and in London and none of them were gypsies.  

The Europeans are the same like they were in 1500, 1700, and in 1942, genocidal hateful maniacs who go for the weakest in society.

They cant hate and shit on the jews anymore, they got stronger, they got nukes ready for anyone who fucks with them again. 

The gypsies are the poorest most excluded, most oppressed group in society.

They try to get by with music and culture, keep to themselves as they are not welcome anywhere just for being a gypsy. 

The swedish government ffs has a list of children in a police register. 

Tell me how a 2 year old mugged, robbed and begged and deserved to be registered and be put a on a watchlist.

EDIT: Downvote me all you want mother fucking cock sucking genocidal Europeans. I am not  a gypsy, you hateful fuckers are gypsies.

That's obviously far lower than the States, but Canada has 1/10 of the US population. To put it another way, the US is producing roughly 4 papers per million people; Canada is producing over 5 papers per million. I'd be really interested in seeing the comparative paper weight of the wealthiest European nations with a total population of 300 million.

Research publications are not a measure of research output.  A single study could be 10x the cost of 50 others combined and take years longer.  A single development grant for a robotic prosthetic that actions off of nerve impulses at the point of connection is on a completely different level than doing a statistical analysis on the NHANES survey datae.

Your comparison is terrible.  The UK has 1/5^th the population of the US... yet we fund upwards 100+x the amount of research.  The quality of institutional research in the US is still unmatched anywhere in the world.  There's a reason that research focused fellows (both MD's and PhD's) have the most abundance of opportunity for ground breaking forward developments in the US more than any other place.

&gt; American research is still very good, but other countries are catching up or taking over. It's a little too self-serving to think that the US is paying so much for its health care purely because it's generously subsidizing the research of lesser nations.

It's not self serving at all.  The capital that big pharma has to invest in research grants comes directly from the revenue of their pharma products.

This one is a bit nicer than many others,  it has a slight advantage in that it has a very intact and pretty village centre and that none of the area seems blighted by any mid-century redevelopment.  So that's a plus, but there's still tons of places like this.  Why go here when you could go to Tabor?  Why go here instead of the countless villages just like it that have a bit more to offer like a castle or a larger village centre or more history?  Why see these farms and not some other village trying to do farm tourism?

The place needs something to offer.  If it wants to go for some tourism it's going to really work on the whole customer service angle, which is going to be a very hard pill for the people to swallow if they're like typical rural Czechs.  It's often hard for tourists to get good service even in Prague (well by insane western standards) but outside of Prague... it's shocking to most tourists.  The village could build a splendid inn,  organize winery tours,  guided hikes through farms and countryside with free food along the way, they could make a website, setup package deals.  They could do it all, but all it takes are a few reviews online complaining about the nasty locals or the shop-keeper who tried to scam them and suddenly the tourists dry up.

It's very hard, because you're asking how to not just stimulate the economy, but radically change it, plus radically change the culture of the people living there.  Villages like this are grumpy for a reason. Anyone with a future, anyone with ambition or education leaves for Prague or europe.  There's a LOT of resentment towards Prague and the outside world in general, which is fairly understandable since the governments development strategy seems to be ""focus on Prague, fuck the rest of the country"".

I don't think anyone will be able to revolutionize the village, it will have to be fairly slow change.  You could build a successful luxury hotel there, but most of the staff won't end up being local due to a lack of local skills and attitude, so the building and its guests will just be resented.  You could build a successful tourist attraction, but it will just be resented by the farmers and locals as making the village too busy and raising prices.  Unless they are DIRECTLY benefiting from will be against it.  Also even if they are benifiting from it directly, but someone else is benefiting MORE than them they'll be against it.  ""Ah the new winery hotel employs a lot of locals now,  but the owner and management are all from Prague and Frankfurt so fuck these outsiders getting rich off our land!""

""Laminated safety glasses usually consist of two plates bonded together. The two plates are either **glass-glass** or glass-plastic combination.""

""Whereas plates made from mineral glass show high methcanical strength and resistance to scratches and chemicals""...

Glass lenses are also used as sightglasses for stuff like combustion chambers specifically because of their high melting point and resistance to scratching. We use quartz glass at work for our single cylinder engine when doing combustion analysis.

The advantage of the Azure platform is that it is scale-able (as it is the same ""code"" for lack of a better word) on all servers, meaning that if demand increases, they don't need to setup extra servers, they can just use the existing ones that may be idle.

For example: Modern shooter 17 is releasing tomorrow. EA has to arrange for dedicated hosting from their provider. The provider sets up the servers and prepares them for launch. Modern shooter 17 puts such a load on the servers that more are required, so EA gets the provider to set more resources up. This is time and cost intensive.

Using Azure, if the game requires extra resources, the usage should scale to the other servers that are not being used by other games that also use the azure service. This means that downtime SHOULD be limited as those Azure servers are already in the wild and are compatible with the required resources because they are all the same. Another advantage is that because there is already a network set up and localised in many different regions, EA would not have to worry about setting up an EU server farm or a OCE farm because that infrastructure is already in place from those existing Azure servers.

Microsoft have thrown so much money at Azure and are already making a tonne off it because of the way it is designed to work.

If you do see, as you say, dramatic declines in infrastructure products, that would reduce oil consumption (and cushion against price shocks) and would also cut into growth (by directly reducing the consumption of bridge steel, hiring of dredging crews, etc) and increase operating costs for those sectors of the economy that depend on the infrastructure. This would reduce activity, and you'd see a further drop in consumption, which would again, further cushion against price shocks. The end result could as easily be stable end-user prices for petroleum products, with a dramatic reduction in employment and investment income. I think this is what the report is getting at when they decline to endorse a single economic outcome. Geology is much easier than economics!

Nu e vorba DOAR de munca.

Au trait stiind ca salariu bun, pensie mare. Apoi '89. Incercari de initiativa privata, tata si-a facut S.A. (proiectare si constructii), asociatii au plecat din tara, el a ramas sa plateasca creditele si muncitorii. Apoi si-a facut firma (mica) si l-a mincat concurenta (primarul si gasca lui). Practic, a pierdut trenul.

Mama, mai fricoasa, a incercat niste chestii cu certificatele de proprietare, societatea ei s-a privatizat prin MEBO, a luat teapa, noul director si nou sef de sindicat impreuna cu nou contabil sef si-au impartit firma, au inceput amenintarile asa ca a iesit la pensie de nevoie.

Ce vreau sa zic este ca lor li s-a intimplat chestia asta din doua motive:

* altii au tras cit au putut
* ei n-au anticipat asta

Nu traiesc in frica, au o viata destul de linistita, citesc mult, nu sufera de lipsuri dar nu e ce trebuia sa fie. Intr-o tara normala erau upper middle class. In viziunea lor, ei sint niste intelectuali condusi de niste mecanici auto. [Au crezut ca lumea e corecta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis).

Eu sint sceptic. Desi platesc (de nevoie) impozite statului, n-astept ca statul sa faca ceva pentru mine, desi imi datoreaza. Nu e treaba de mindrie si nici de resemnare. Pur si simplu riscul de a ma baza pe stat e prea mare. Pornind de la asta n-am cum sa sufar vreo dezamagire daca pensia mea e mica sau Basescu e la putere sau Rosia Montana sau altceva. Asa ca-mi vad de viata, nu votez, inteleg politica dar nu ma bag si stiu ca societatea perfecta e o utopie.

&gt; Genul asta de investitie e pe termen scurt/mediu si necesita munca... 

Da, e genul de munca de citeva ore pe saptamina cu un cost psihic minim pentru ca nu ma fute nimeni la cap. Inca tatonez. Nu-mi asigura toata pensia dar e mai rentabila decit investitiile bursiere si poate evolua. Poate-mi fac terasa (bomba) de cartier, poate fac software pentru scoli (a intrat fiica-mea la scoala si am vazut o oportunitate). Habar n-am, dar mai am vreo 10-15 ani de munca in care sa pot gasi ceva ce-mi va permite sa ies la pensie inainte de termen, traind decent dupa, fara sa depind de stat.

&gt; Nu poti sa te bazezi pe asa ceva la pensie. Trebuie sa treci prin sectorul financiar...

So I'll give you a quick rundown about how your statement is one that is profoundly ignorant.  Many people own homes, in turn they have to pay mortgages.  Odds are, unless your home is almost paid for, on your personal balance sheet you are up to your eyeballs in debt (your net worth is simply taking assets and subtracting any debt owed on those assets from it).  Do people care?  No, because they, presumably, can afford the monthly payment on their mortgage.  In addition to this, typically a home is viewed as a long term investment.  You take on heavy debt up front but in the long run that home will appreciate in value, on average.

The debt the US government has now is, more or less, doing the same thing.  The stimulus programs and quantitative easing as the goal of creating a long term investment (whether or not that actually happens remains to be seen).  The exception here is that it is spending more money than it takes in in order to pay it's bills and to try to spark the economy by various investments (and sadly yes, fund wars).

To see countries who are engaging not in stimulus programs and QE, one only need to look at places like Greece and other parts of the EU.  Their austerity programs actually ended up COSTING these countries money.  Why?  Cutting government spending created higher unemployment which does two things, one it reduces the amount of tax revenue these governments can collect and second, it INCREASES government spending due to the unemployment benefits these countries suddenly have to pay out (Greece likes to tote that it has what's called a ""primary surplus"" which is your budget before you take into account interest payments...take these into account and Greece is very deep in the hole).

Unlike you or I, we get a steady flow of income not directly reliant on the population at large, likewise, our expenditures are not directly tied to the population at large.  The saying, ""you have to spend money to make money"" apply greatly to two enterprises, private business (through capital expenditures) and governments.

To use an example using the former, an IT company (FireEye) recently filed for its IPO to be listed on the NYSE.  As a result it had to make it's financial statements public.  It has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years, raising over $60M in revenues, however it's expenses totaled almost $70M and the company has been in the red for quite sometime, yet it's stock price skyrocketed.  According to you, their failure to ""balance their checkbook"" means that this company is doomed for failure and should not be run this way.  Obviously people familiar with finance realize how ignorant this sounds.  Looking beyond the numbers, the company has heavily invested in it's salesforce to hire sales folks around the globe like crazy to sell their product and spark tremendous growth, hoping in the future these upfront expenditures pay off heavily.  So like I said spending money to make money.  They, like the US government, have the cash on hand to make this sort of up front spending.

So you see, this is how personal budgets are not like federal (or even corporate) budgets and how people like me view what you just said has extremely ignorant and tremendously short-sighted.  Unfortunately I see many people who view the world in an oversimplified manner because they simply don't understand how everything works.  Instead of asking or trying to find out how complex these situations are, they just prefer to spout ignorance and oversimplified, irrelevant comparisons.

The power of narratives. In the Middle Ages, this power was held by the Catholic Church who interpreted the Bible in sermons all over Europe. The Bible was written in Latin, and you could even be sent into exile for unauthorized reading of that Bible in Latin. The Church had no reason to fear any laws being made against their interest, for they controlled the entire worldview of the legislators. They defined the problems and they defined the applicable solutions.

In this day and age, some crazy guy named Gutenberg came along with a cartload of Bibles in the streets of Paris. In French! Readable without interpretation! This tore down the church’s power of narrative like a house of cards under a steamroller. In this, the Church saw themselves as the good guys and wanted to set the record straight, to prevent the spread of disinformation. They had learned that they were the carriers of truth and could not unlearn having this position.

Thus, the penalties for using the printing press gradually increased all over Europe, until it hit the death penalty: France, January 13, 1535. Yes, there has been a death penalty for unauthorized copying. Guess what? Even the death penalty didn’t work. But as illustrated here, cracking down on the copying technology wasn’t really a matter of preventing copying. It was a matter of maintaining the power of narratives – the complete and total control over the world’s knowledge and culture. Between the printing press and now, that power has been held by the operators of printing presses. They have observed, they have interpreted, they have retold the story of reality.

Recently, the printing presses have received company from radio and TV broadcasts, but the model has remained the same: a small, small elite has determined what the world should know and how they should relate to the events going on.

The net changes everything. All of a sudden, anybody can publish their ideas to the world in 10 minutes.

Since you do not have fury to hammer you just hit with your mitts until you have enough fury to get your battle rage skill up.  This is a must have at all times.  You can also get that initial fury by taking damage.  Once you have battle rage your crits have a chance to give you fury, this is why having your crit chance high is so important.  Okay so battle rage up? check.  At this point you hit a couple of times on a monster to either do one of 2 things. WW into a pack of monsters while while letting go a sprint to drop down some nados or drop nados first with the pack in pursuit.  Option A will trump eventually but if you have trouble then go with option B.  So now it is time to draw some circles with your mouse while using WW and dropping nados on packs of enemies.  This is where your nados will tick so much that you have near infinite fury as long as you are attacking enemies.  At this point you want to pop wrath.  Keep in mind this is a very drawn out explanation, all of this happens within a matter of seconds.  

So at this point you sprint from pack to pack, taking one down and moving on to the next.  To keep your wrath from expiring you have to over expend your fury to keep ""gaining"" it.  Sometimes just dropping nados will be enough and other times you will have to repeatedly refreshing battle rage.  When you run into an elite pack spin/nado then hammer away for a few seconds, rinse repeat.  If you are going against an elite rare pack and just want to take down the boss you can just hammer away and should be able to take the dmg which in turn keeps your fury full/near full.  If your lifesteal can't keep up with the incoming dmg (poison pools etc) make sure to stop hammering and spin around to give your health time to recover.

A couple of things to take note of:

-If you are doing runs solo make sure to skip on the empowerment shrines, you have to expend out even more fury to keep the wrath timer up. 

-During all of this make sure to keep using overpower as much as possible

-After some practice you will get your fury management down

-If you are up against a health-link elite pack don't hammer them just spin to win, your nados can stack on top of eachother.

Hopefully you have better luck armed with some knowledge this time.

From Wikipedia: *Ozone is an unstable molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms. It is a very strong, broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in Europe. It is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts. It also works well against almost all other pathogens. Ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a ""cold"" electrical discharge. To use ozone as a disinfectant, it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact. Some of the advantages of ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems (in comparison to chlorination) . Although fewer by-products are formed by ozonation, it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen bromate. Bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 ppb of bromate — the maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA. Another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water. Ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in Nice, France. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted ozone as being safe; and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment, storage, and processing of foods.*",science,1380647641,clickity-click,5,5,cciya4p,t5_mouw,t3_1nip28,0,,t1_ccixrui,

Milton Friedman had been working in Government since the New Deal and Great Depression. Originally he was very much a Keynesian, but shifted for more towards libertarianism and limited government over his lifetime.

He was also a [consultant for the Marshall Plan in Paris](http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2008/5/cj28n2-9.pdf) that helped rebuild Europe; [he credits the West German's CDU's rejection of the price and wage restrictions imposed by the Allies as war penalties as being the primary factor for the West German Economic Miracle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOG_bg7thZY).

Additionally, he was the chief economist behind the creation of numerous IRS tax codes and documents (including the W1 mentioned here), numerous economic policies, from the Earned Income Tax Credit--arguably the most effective welfare reform to date--, to the Payroll witholding Tax, the move to go off the Gold Standard in 1972, as well as Quantitative Easing. Ben Bernanke credits the Federal Reserves policies in 2008, which have been credited with saving the Global Economy from Recession and Depression, as being the result of Milton Friedman's work. Milton Friedman, who, as previously mentioned, worked as an economist during the Great Depression, saw the rise of the New Deal, and despite endorsing parts of it at the time, argued that it was the [""wrong cure for the wrong disease"" and instead suggested that the majority of the harm caused, and therefore most of the good that could be done, was from the Federal Reserve's monetary policy](http://books.google.com/books?id=a1Qlh0GpqD0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22wrong+cure+for+the+wrong+disease%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hhS_3WEToF&amp;sig=Twb691WPxE3RtHCD5urOwqmZxOo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aSxLUsKCCumfyQHqqYG4Dw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wrong%20cure%20for%20the%20wrong%20disease%22&amp;f=false).

Additionally, for those who aren't Americans, the System that he's describing--the US system--is one that is certainly a private market, but not a free market. [It's major costs are controlled and distorted by private interests](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6t-R3pWrRw), such as the American Medical Association, insurance companies, and organized Medicine, as well as by unions, who wish to preserve their bargaining position, by employers who wish to maintain their tax exemptions for healthcare as opposed to paying higher wages for their employees to literally buy the same healthcare on the Free Market, unhindered and undistorted by private interests.

Milton Friedman's opposition to large scale public options aren't based on ideology per se; [he categorically rejected deontological libertarianism and Ayn Rand's Objectivism](http://reason.com/archives/1995/06/01/best-of-both-worlds). On the contrary, he believed, quite strongly, that serious--BUT EFFECTIVE-- welfare reform was needed. He basically created arguably one of the most efficient Guaranteed Minimum Income strategies in the world (the Negative Income Tax), [which was the basis for most of Bill Clinton's much lauded Welfare Reforms in the 1990s, with Larry Summers ultimately saying that ""any honest Democrat will admit that we are now all Friedmanites""](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/opinion/19summers.html).

His opposition to public ownership and public companies is that since there is such a heavy connection between these groups and the legislative bodies that fund them, what occurs is a large exercise in moral hazard. In government and private monopolies, there is very little incentive to eliminate long-standing inefficiencies or problems that can have a largely hidden distortionary effect on the particular industry. His criticisms of socialized healthcare is that they use wage and price controls that create shortages and rationing that inherently reduce the quality of care. Rather, by creating a free market--also free of private monopolies--where individuals are essentially free to choose and select what products they want, much like any other good, such as food, or clothing, most of the inefficiencies would disappear and the healthcare market would largely be optimized.

To those who would argue against Milton Friedman's description of a Free Market, I would invite you to investigate the Swiss Healthcare system, which most resembles Friedman's free market hypothesis. It still uses a number of cost and price controls, as well as a public option, but it provides a much more innovative, comprehensive, and cost-effective solution to many single-payer systems, which hide most of their costs in national debts and deficits during recessions. Additionally, the Swiss system is arguably one of the most diverse and innovative, as its healthcare market has low barriers to entry (i.e. few monopolies/cartels, unlike the US system); as a result it has the ability to respond to new innovations and new challenges.

There really is a special relationship, but it is more between the  governments and and the military.  That is not to say the people don't care about the UK, it just isn't on their mind much, and the US mainstream press is famously insular.

That being said, I do think Americans have a high opinion of UK peoples, and we know we can always count on you.  And jeebus knows you just did us a huge favor by rejecting military action in Syria.

We also know great shows like Top Gear, The Office, etc. and think you guys are funny as hell.  But of course you are going to be more exposed to American culture then we are to UK culture with our media dominance.

As for coverage of US in the UK, your coverage is very international, and your country has history so many places.  Like this mall in Kenya; you guys are more familiar with it because it was a former colony.  Additionally, I think any media worldwide has to cover the US a lot because we meddle in so many things and are a prime mover of world events.

You also have to remember that only fairly well off (middle class and above) Americans can visit Europe.  I know it is a reddit cliche, but as a NY'er, it takes me only 1 hour more to fly to London than LA.  Thing how far and expensive it is for Midwestern and West Coast Americans.

All the kids I met at Uni in London had widely traveled, apparently the ferry to France is cheap as hell.  I took the chunnel to Paris myself.  That is almost unthinkable to Americans, being somewhere so different in an hour or two (unless you count Mexico, speaking of which, you can go from Civilized San Diago to Tiajuana in 5 min, I do not recommend!!!)

So again, it isn't that we don't care about you, you just aren't covered in detail regularly (you were for the Syria vote), not as many of us have been there as you visit here.  Europe is a big place and a lot of Americans want to go places that are totally different then the US (France, Spain, Italy, etc.).  It would also make perfect sense that you have more in common with you close northern euro neighbors.

I do think Canada is more in touch with you, your Queen is their head of state!!!

So while not all of us know too much about the UK, everyone here would support any action needed to help you, and we know you are always there for us, even when it is to stop us from doing something stupid.

This also means that Valve has got to do something with the filed trademark within 3 to 5 years (they filed the trademark in Spain) or it'll be deemed abandoned.

&gt;*In many other countries, grounds for abandonment depend solely on whether the mark at issue has been in use, without regard to the subjective intent of the trademark owner. The period of non-use required to show abandonment typically ranges from three years (e.g., in Australia, Japan, South Korea, Canada, China, Russia and many Latin American countries) to five years (e.g., in various countries in Europe, such as Ireland and Norway).*

**Edit 2:**

There are also specific rules on how many times you can extend a trademarks extension time *(I believe it's possible to extend it five times for six months each)*:

&gt; *Extensions of time are granted in six-month increments. The first extension will begin to run from the expiration of the six-month period following issuance of the notice of allowance. An applicant will receive the full benefit of each extension before a subsequent extension will begin to run. The six-month period following issuance of the notice of allowance (or any subsequent six-month extension period) will not be cut short by the grant of an extension.  No extension will be granted for more than six months.*

I know in my area, the attorney general's office is going after debt collectors right now.  But if they didn't, why not have private attorneys handle it?  There's often more that can be done, so why not have so-called private attorneys general, as well?

Regardless, I just don't quite follow the point you're trying to draw by comparing it to normal tort litigation.  I mean, million-dollar results aren't that uncommon.  If you have a lawyer walk into your office with a tort claim and a plaintiff who is going to require lifetime medical care, you might as well start considering settlement whether or not you're negligent.  You can tell a lot about the value of a plaintiff's case immediately, based solely on the damages.  The negligent conduct and the legal work required might be similar to other cases of much less value.  What is different about that?  And why point out that mass torts don't go to trial?  I mean, the same holds true for other cases as well.  

Obviously, when there are a lot of claimants, the amounts can get large.  Gotcha.  But you still have the same proportionality issues elsewhere, and the fact that class actions are (1) subject to additional procedural requirements and (2) typically involve individual claims of low value should help mitigate the problem posed by the number of claimants.  I don't really follow why private attorneys general might be a bad idea based on proportionality or why normal tort cases are particularly relevant since proportionality is going to be an issue in any contingent case.

Well, the argument is the lack of efficiency. If AT&amp;T cheated their consumers out of $500 million, with our mass tort system, the consumers only get $350 million back, and a law firm gets $150 million which is completely out of proportion with the amount of work invested.

**Lavalval chain** - More expensive than it needs to be and a widely used rank 4. re-releasing this wold drive sales of the new tin.

**Daigusto Emeral** - see above

**Evilswarm Ouroboros** - a good 3 rank 4, still moderately expensive and a reasonable choice to bring down the price of evilswarms.

**Constellar Ptolemy M7** - See Evilswarm Ouroboros

**M-X saber invoker** - Generic rank 3, useful and so far not overpowered.

**Harpie’s Pet Dragon** - (if it is not re-released in Joey’s world)

There are reasons why even at the best of times, the NAU conspiracy theorists never did find a single elected official in Canada in the US who wanted it.  An EU-style union couldn't work in North America. The EU has several major powers, and many smaller ones who can band together. North America on the other hand would be dominated by the US's economy and population. To avoid ""the tyranny of the majority"", Canada would REQUIRE an equal say in monetary, economic and other policy. This in turn would be unfair to Americans. It won't happen.

Nor do we have the incentive that made Europeans support the EU: An endless cycle of war after war. Not just WWI and WWII, but many ""little"" ones like the Thirty Years War, a third of the population of Germany wiped out.

And that's at the best of times, which this is NOT.

Even the EU has rules that any country joining must have its economic house in order - and those who did are getting a harsh lesson in what happens when they relax the rules for those who didn't.

The economic mess in the US - industry-wide mortgage fraud turned industry-wide investment fraud - has not been cleaned up.  The con artists responsible are still running the show.  Meanwhile Congress refuses to address the growing debt, instead resorting to do-nothing theatrics like the current shutdown.  Canada does no want to tie itself further to that.

On the trade front, the US becoming far more protectionist. From wheat to lumber to trucking to livestock to manufactured goods, the US refuses to honor even NAFTA.

All of which is has led Canada to distance itself from the US economy as fast as it can. It's signed free trade agreements with at least six other countries since the crisis started, is negotiating free trade with a bunch more countries and the EU.

A general article about the labour movement in Sweden.

http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbetarr%C3%B6relsen_i_Sverige

An article about 'Communism in Sweden' which doesn't really start off until 1917 when the communists broke away from the the Social Democratic Workers Party and created their own party.

http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommunism_i_Sverige

To read more about the socialists/communists pre-1917 I'd suggest the main article for the history of the Social Democratic Workers Party. It starts in 1881.

http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_socialdemokratiska_arbetarepartis_historia

With that said it shows that the communist wave around Europe in the middle 1800s did not really reach Sweden. But since you're only interested in the 20th century development the second provided link should give you a good overview. Naturally the article is tagged as ""not neutral"" and ""pro-communist"" by right wing neckbeards.

* I think Dark Kingdom is a great idea (as already proposed by roj2323) although I would make sure it was done in classic Disney fashion i.e., not merely roller coasters -- we don't want this to just become a Disney version of islands of adventure -- but intense theming, interactive exhibits and architecture, ride alongs, dark rides, etc.--the whole nine yards. 


* I think a true, standalone Disney Star Wars park could do really well.  
([People have already done some nice mock-ups of this concept](http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SWLand.jpg).)  The possibilities are endless -- pod racing, the Death Star, Mos Eisley cantina, etc.  Star Wars is one of the few properties that I think so permeates modern culture that you could make the capital investment and expect the park to last for many decades to come.


* I would love to see a Disney History park.  Imagine the ""World Showcase"" concept of Epcot except with the showcase being through time.  So a land for Ancient Egypt, a land for Ancient Greece, a land for Ancient Rome, a land for Medieval Europe, a land for the Renaissance, a land for the Age of Enlightenment, a land 18th-century Colonial Times, a land for the Gold Rush era, a land for 1930s New York, etc.


Any of these parks I'd put down in Florida.  One day, Florida is going to need a fifth gate, particularly if Universal continues with their aggressive expansion plans -- one of these parks would be a great response by Disney, along the lines of ""you think we lost our ability to create new American parks?  *Watch* what we can do.""",disney,1380650684,APeopleShouldKnow,10,10,ccizeqk,t5_2qh8g,t3_1nivup,0,,t3_1nivup,

&gt;I thank the European parliament and the LIBE committee for taking up the challenge of mass surveillance. The surveillance of whole populations rather than individuals threatens to be the greatest human rights challenge of our time.

&gt;*The success of economies in developed nations relies increasingly on their creative output, and if that success is to continue we must remember that creativity is the product of curiosity, which in turn is the product of privacy.*

&gt;*A culture of secrecy has denied our societies the opportunity to determine the appropriate balance between the human right of privacy and the governmental interest in investigation.* These are not decisions that should be made for a people but only by the peopler after full, informed and fearless debate.

&gt;*Yet public debate is not possible without public knowledge - and in my country the cost of one in my position of returning public knowledge to public hands has been persecution and exile.* If we are to enjoy such debates in the future we cannot rely upon individual sacrifice. We must create better channels for people of conscience to inform not only trusted agents of government but independent representatives of the public outside government.

&gt;When I began my work it was with the sole intention of making possible the debate we see occurring here in this body and in many other bodies around the world.

&gt;Today we see legislative bodies forming new committees calling for investigations and proposing new solutions for modern problems. We see emboldened courts that are no longer afraid to consider critical questions of national security. We see brave executives remembering that if a public is prevented from knowing how they are being governed the necessary result is that they are no longer self governing. *And we see the public reclaiming an equal seat at the table of government.*

If the later happens, Europe will probably be gone anyway.  Also, while Europe is more united than ever, it's not unreasonable to think that it could still experience regional conflicts.  Things were getting pretty dicey between Germany, and Greece/Spain/Italy, for a while during the financial crisis. Europe also seems to be more susceptible to terrorism.  Asia is a powder keg that just waiting to explode.  These are the types of things I was referring to, and the U.S. will likely be sheltered from them.

Domestic violence is highly contingent on location.  Pick a good neighborhood in even the current Murder Capital of the U.S. (New Orleans, looking at 2011 data), and you're going to be fine.  Looking at the odds, you have a *far* better chance of dieing of [heart disease, cancer, stroke, accidental injury, a motor-vehicle accident, and suicide](http://www.livescience.com/3780-odds-dying.html), in the U.S., than you do of [murder](http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/06/us/around-the-nation-odds-of-being-murdered-are-1-in-133-study-says.html).  I apologize for the age of those articles, but it's actually pretty hard to find the odds-breakdown on this stuff.  I'll refrain from doing my own math, to avoid errors.  It's almost certain that the murder-rate in the U.S. has gone down since the Times article was written, as the 1990's saw a great decline in crime, nationwide.  It's doubtful that the stats in the other article have changed too drastically in the past decade.  With all that said,  It's a bit silly to compare war deaths to those lost in domestic murders. Wars kill a lot of people, in a short time, murder kills only a few people (relatively), over comparable time periods.   

On a purely anecdotal note, I get the feeling that Europe is not as safe as you're making it out to be.  I have a friend that travels to Europe regularly, and he's always talking about how people are constantly trying to rip him off with various scams directed at tourists.  He's needed to confront people who were following him both in Barcelona, and Paris, so that he wouldn't get jumped. I've never had such problems traveling in the U.S.  Granted, you probably won't die in such encounters, but it's just another thing to think about.

&gt;To clear up what this means: Valve does not have a trademark on the title ""Half Life 3"" (ignoring common law trademark). Valve filed an intent-to-use trademark application. This means Valve has three months to show actual use in commerce of the mark to get the registration or they lose the mark. They can file up to 5 extensions, each I believe can last 6 months. 

&gt;Thus, this is evidence that Half Life 3 is planned for a release within that time period but not definitive proof. Valve could use the mark in a different way than selling the game itself or they could abandon it.

&gt;Edit: you can read [about ITUs here](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/teas/intent_to_use.jsp) and [general trademark information here](http://www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp) at the USPTO site.

For example, I'm a more logical, plan-things-out type of person. But I like to be spontaneous and go with the flow, under the right circumstances. My SO is the other way around. So when circumstances call for planning and being logical, generally speaking I'm in charge and make the calls. When circumstances call for going with the flow, he's in charge and makes the calls.

* 15% for FICA/SS amounts to ~12095 
* Federal taxable income would be roughly 62000
* Graduated Federal income tax computes out to 10660
* State income tax computes out to 3100

Total is 25855.

25855 / 80625 = 32%

You are left with 54770. From that you are paying consumption taxes, as well as other things like commodity taxes. Your effective tax rate will go up. Let's just factor in sales tax.

Suppose you spend 20% of your remaining income on taxable items. .20 * 0.075 * 54770 ~= 820

Suppose you have property. In my state the tax is 1500 a year for a 225,000 dollar home (the average home price).

Now, lets factor in health care. This is provided in many other countries, so it's only fair to factor it into ""effective tax rate"". The average is about 318 per month in premiums.

&gt;http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/25/us-usa-healthcare-exchanges-idUSBRE98O03P20130925

However that cost will be reduced for most people. Let's just say by 50%.

318/2 * 12 = 1908

(25855 + 1908 + 820 + 1500) / 80625 ~= 37%

Like I said, Tax revenue / GDP is too flat to make a comparison. My entire argument is that we get less than what we pay for, particularly middle / upper-middle class. That is why I feel like it's too expensive. I even wrote I'd be happy with a 50% tax rate if it meant free education and health care. We get neither.

From your source : 

&gt; In many European countries taxes exceeded 40 percent of GDP, but those countries generally provide much more extensive government services to their citizens than the United States does.

The UK (at least England, maybe Wales and Scotland do too but I didn't check) provides publicly funded health care, as do many other countries we are comparing ourselves to. Furthermore, many of them also provide free post-secondary education.

TL;DR; I am not interested in having some heated debate about it. I am just sitting here chilling out, meanwhile making arguments about my side of it. If you ever wondered why people who make more money bitch about taxes, it's because we pay a lot of our income in taxes and get very little in return, meanwhile see no one else getting much in return either.

I've been playing this game for 3 and a half years now (even before start S1) and for the longest time of me playing there were problems on EU. It was up until the point that many people ignored the ping on NA and changed to that shard. 

Mistakes are bound to happen but not in such a size and frequency. 

It's a free game, yes. But think about it, how many people have spend how much money into the game? Every thread of reddit about LoL being free is filled with comments like ""oh so free..."" and ""I spent 1k$ on League."" etc. 

Riot gets a shitton of money considering that the game is free. It is free but about everyone who has played for longer than 2 months has bought RP (some even immediately after starting to play). 

So don't give us such bullshit. And how can you be ashamed to be from EUW? Because people complain? People always complain. It's human nature. Why aren't you ashamed of being a human? Stupid question heh?

You could also get the lower spec A319 rim to save some money without sacrificing anything much. An A319/105 build should cost you ~£130 with good spokes and a decent mechanic.

I've been touring Europe for the past wenty years and the bane of my existence is people in our group who come touring with 32-spoke wheels. This summer, when we hit the alps spokes started breaking. My hands were permanently black from fixing people's wheels.

Very often, it's not just the spoke that breaks from heavy loading. The rim very easiy fails at the eyelet (especially in cheaper rims like what you're using) which means an entirely new wheel-build. You won't have the luxury of a well-stocked bike shop where you're going, and you could easily spend days hunting for a compatible rim of decent quality. That'll eat into your budget far more than a decent wheel ever will!


Edit: just saw that you're using a no-name disc brake hub, in which case you can't use a 105 replacement. If your spacing is 135 then you can use any of Shimano's excellent value MTB hubs (I'm using XT).

False,t1_ccj0kpf,,0,True,False,1429280238,0,"I have to disagree with your premise regarding the prevalence of these attitudes in SRS.  While yes, it's true not all SRSers are the way I described, a very large number are.  Again, generalizations are bad, but nearly every single interaction I've had with an SRSer has been negative.  This isn't true of feminists in general, mind you, but SRSers tend to be a different breed.  I admit, however, this probably has something to do with the fact that I reject their theories.  I appreciate your trying to convince me, by the way, particularly that you were reasonable about it, but as I mentioned earlier, I simply can't accept gender politics.  Again, as I said, it devalues individuals in favor of groups.  And groups are just not as important to me as individuals are.

&gt;Most of them just believe in equality, which is a pretty reasonable position IMO.

I want to reiterate how much of a fallacy this is.  Social Justice is very specifically *not* about equality, and never was.  As an example, [here is a comic](http://square-go.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/equality-vs-justice.jpg) an SRSer once linked that I found particularly relevant.  As I said, it's in the very name... it's social *justice*, not equality.  You may still agree with it, but conflating the two has been very misleading to a lot of people.

So, while I agree equality is very reasonable, it's absolutely *not* what SRS is going for.  They don't want to build people up, they want to knock people down.  The entire social justice movement is predicated on that notion.  

Combine that concept with the fact that individuals don't matter, only groups do, and suddenly you have a recipe for the death of Dr. King's dream.  SJ does not judge people by the content of their character.  SJ doesn't care about you or your struggles or what you've been through.  SJ encourages the Oppression Olympics.  SJ encourages denigrating entire groups of people in favor of others.  

You want to fight for equality?  Fucking fantastic.  I'm with you.  SJ doesn't do that.  SJ does the exact opposite of that.  This is not noble.  This is petty vengeance.  And worse, it's not even against the people who perpetrated it, since, as you mentioned, those fuckers are long buried.

&gt;""women have it so easy because they're women"" (I'll happily provide examples of people saying things to that effect if you need)

You don't need to.  But, as it turns out, in *some* (and only some) ways, that's very true.  I won't claim that overall women have it easier, but in a few respects, it's true.  SJ says it's the patriarchy.  MRA's claim ...  I don't know, matriarchy?  Everybody has their own theory I'm sure.  But the fact remains that *some*times, women do have an easier time of things.  

&gt;it's frustrating because if you go by the demographics the people on reddit saying this stuff are middle-class white young men in relatively well-off nations, 

In my experience, SJW's are just as (or more) Amero- or western-centric.  (Again, I point to the people I mentioned who considered fake war paint to be cultural appropriation.  Or another TiA post a few days ago where a Hispanic man, cosplaying as a Hispanic character, was accused of wearing ""blackface"" by an SJW.)  I've seen them claim that a white guy in China is still the privileged majority.  There's no context with this ideology.  There's no understanding.  There's only ""white people *baaaad*"", and American/European social makeup is the only one that exists.

&gt;It's pretty sad how often the viewpoint that men should be happy when they get raped by women comes up, but like you saw in the link - it's very often men who spout this opinion.

It's pretty mixed gendered, actually.  Maybe not what that particular article showed, but I've seen plenty of women who have said the same shit.  Worse, I've seen women (and SRSers and other SJW's) literally claim that men *can't* be raped (similar to the ideas that only white people can be racist and only men can be sexist, or worse, that they are intrinsically so and cannot do anything about it).  I've seen this not infrequently, although I will admit that the internet certainly gives these people a louder voice than they actually represent in the general population.  Even if this is the radical fringe, these are the face of SJ.  And it's not just random internet travelers.  It's bloggers, journalists, and authors too.  These are the leaders, the voice, the face.  

Look, I get not wanting people to be assholes.  But the way SJ goes about it isn't doing anybody any good.  It's controlling, and bigoted, and completely antithetical to how I live my life.  It has led to thought-crime - but only for white people mind you!  (When's the last time a black person got convicted of a hate crime?)  It has led to a conformist culture where disagreement is discouraged and shamed.  Exploration is disallowed.  And opinions are only valid if you win the Oppression Olympics in the group you're currently speaking with... which of course means the only time I have valid opinions is when I speak with other SAWCSM's.  But if I want a space to do precisely that, I'm being a horrible oppressive shitlord.  There's no winning, there's no upside.  And again, this isn't just the extreme elements.  This is what the entire movement is based on.  These are basic tenets of the ideology.  It is, at it's very core, racist and sexist (dictionary definition, not SJ textbook definition).  I can't support, in any way, an ideology that promotes such ideals.",videos,1380653754,Ravanas,1,1,ccj0kpf,t5_2qh1e,t3_1nfe58,0,,t1_cciw4nq,

1380655033,t1_ccj0svw,,0,True,False,1429280132,0,"Socialism in Scandinavia **didn't** work. Particularly during the 50's to the 70's there and in many other countries in Europe a lot of services were nationalized, new regulations introduced and taxes were blown sky high. It simply did not work and most countries introduced reforms during the 80's and the 90's.  Shortly after the war Sweden was one of the richest countries in Europe thanks to their staying out of both wars. However because of their pioneering in socialist experimentation they lost that position and ended up with a serious economic crisis in the 80's I believe.  Right now Sweden is behind Denmark and Finland and sometimes even Iceland in quite many areas. Norway is obviously ahead everywhere because of their financial capability thanks to oil and gas but Sweden has more resources than any other Scandinavian country.   And in pure economic terms Scandinavia isn't really ""progressing"" as much as it doesn't regress so heavily as other countries. There is a **lot** of economic issues there only Scandinavian societies tend to be less vocal around the world about them and they tend to have less warlike political structure - mostly due to the fact that their society is relatively economically flat and homogenous (except for that fresh and problematic immigration from non-european countries) and there is little room for political battle like in America or even Britain. 

So in short - the actual ""socialism"" did not work in Scandinavia whenever and wherever it was introduced as it never worked anywhere.
What ""works"" there is a curious mixture of government intervention and free markets but it really doesn't ""work"" as much as doesn't spectacularly fail in epic style as government activity in most other places. The region has a lot of its own problems though.Two important traits of our northern friends:

1) Low corruption - that is an important factor too whenever collective systems are in place and Scandinavia tends to score top marks in transparency.  

2) Mindset of society - Scandinavians are traditionally less focused on consumption and individualism than say Americans and that means that any issues that relate to their standing in society and giving up some freedom for the sake of organization is not seen as a terrible issue in itself. That comes from the fact that Scandinavia is an awful place to live if you happen to be a primitive pre-industrial society.All those countries were very poor until the end of XIX century and the beginning of XX century wasnt easy on Europe either so culturally they are  more restrained with regards to material wealth.  And this gives the impression that things work there better than somewhere else while in fact there are many areas of economy that other countries do better than Scandinavia. So in fact you might live in a country - say New Zealand or Canada but also (especially) the US and have the impression that things in Sweden are better when in reality some particular issue can be actually greater over there. Comparing standards of living (which is the ultimate measure of whether economic system works or not) is a tricky subject because often it requires to measure very different sets of expectations. I have done it once in the past and have seen so many errors in my methodology since....

On the other hand, the parliament has the power to kick the president out, which is what happened in 2004, when it turned out that the newly elected president had a Russian mafia guy among his closest friends. This russian dude donated a big pile of money for the presidential campaign and in exchange was supposed to get a Lithuanian citizenship. That was supposed to be an awesome deal, as Lithuania is in EU and Schengen, while Russia is not.

Just looking at the divided Germany tells you everything you need to know. US policies flooded a ton of money into West Germany and went to great lengths to stabilize and rebuild essential sectors in the country. This is a country whose major cities were firebombed and largely levelled, and today is the dominant economy in Europe.

You can still see the divide between East and West - there's a lot more restoration happening in the East, since rebuilding from WW2 didn't really start until the 1990's - the Soviets/DDR left whole cities to crumble and only erected a small number of ugly (by modern standards, anyway), cramped apartment blocks.

Talking to people, the younger generation and people who grew up in the West are positive and have (surprisingly) a high opinion of Americans. Maybe not the US Government, but Americans in general are highly liked. In the East it didn't take long to hear people from the older generation cursing the Soviets or Russians in general. There's still a lot of anger under the surface, and it's directed towards the USSR for the post-war occupation and Soviet planned economy.

I've have thought there would be some residual anger towards the US, who had a major part in the firebombing of Dresden and Hamburg (with 10s of thousands of civilians dead), and conventional bombing that devastated Munich and Berlin. To my surprise, the general attitude seemed to be ""yeah, that wasn't very good, but [shrug] we had nazis, you know"".

It might as well come from the fact that the US are a Common Law jurisdiction, based on case law so you would understand where this practice-focused orientation would originate. I don't really know about America, but in France it is really frequent for law students to spend their summer working in law firms as interns. So I think that in the end, there is a good balance between our classes that are indeed very theoretical and practice. 
Once more, I only speak about what I know, but after university you still have to take the French equivalent of the LSAT to get in what we call ""the Bar School"" and after you did your 18 months there, you have to take another test before you actually graduate from this school and take oath. So this is kind of a specialised, advanced degree. 

I agree with the fact that law is not very portable cross-borders but to us European, the gap between the different legal systems tend to diminish with European harmonisation. This is so true that there is a European directive allowing a lawyer from any EU State to practice in another EU country. These lawyers would have their qualifications acknowledge by the host State. For the first 3 years, you would practice as a ""European Guest Lawyer"" (I'm not too sure about the exact title but you get the meaning) and then you can get the actual lawyer title from your host State. So there's a whole potential employment market that you could access with your national degree. Obviously it does not include the US. 

About this, I was wondering, there's been a trend lately in France for lawyers to take a year off and study in the US (or UK/Australia ...) for a year to get an LLM. This is supposed to enable them to ""qualify"" to practice in the US. Could anyone tell me whether this is accurate? To me, it occurred that an LLM is far from being enough!

&gt; Democracy is absolutely necessary as concentrated power is a threat to freedom

These two statements need to be separated, as they do not logically follow. While you may argue that that [liberal] democracy ensures freedom, or that concentrated power can endanger it (I wouldn't), the notion that democracy ensures decentralised power is incorrect. I don't think that modern democratic states have seen a significant reduction in power. I would argue the opposite. Austerity measures have been met with serious disdane across Europe at the very least. State interventionism and Third way economics I think are becoming more the norm, trying to mix state interventionism with a free market. This latter aspect would reject your first point, but fascism isn't inherently opposed to market economies (although generally does oppose them).

But, back to my original point, a democratic regime does not mean one with limited powers. There are of course options to ensure the democracies are decentralised. The most prominent one is the use of a constitution to separate and balance power. However, you argue;

&gt; The state derives it's right to power from the people

Who then provides the legitimate authority, a constitution, or the people? When the two clash, why should the constitution, as it does in America, gain the upper hand, by forcing super majorities to ammend it? The issue of no democracy being founded democratically is one of great discussion. Jurgen Habermas has written about the issue, and he would support your point (for him, Constitutions enable democracies). Still, it is an issue that needs addressing.

We must also define what democracy is. Do numbers rule? Is quantity really better than quality? And, should we find those numbers directly, or through representatives? In the UK, it is rare that any political party gets 50% of the vote, and yet the winning party often gets 50% of the seats in the commons. Essentially, they gain a mandate to do whatever they want (within reason), often against stiff opposition from the parties who collectively are more representative (as we currently have a coalition, the govt. does have 50% of the votes, or at least did). Admittedly, it is difficult to gain an ideal form of democracy, but I don't think here the old 'democracy is the best form of government, except all others tried' really cuts it here, as most fascists would disagree. The points needs expanding upon.

&gt; without their [the people's] consent the state is illegitimate

Well, fascist parties have a tendency to exploit democracy. If the people consent to fascism (well, if 51% consent to it), is fascism now legitimate. This brings up the question of what is important in a democracy; is it how the decisions are made, or what decisions are made. If it is the latter, we come face to face again with the problem of which authority; the constitution that protects certain freedoms/liberties, or the people who oppose them? If the former, then fascist regimes can gain legitimacy without much difficulty, and indeed have (although extra-parliamentary activities have been used).

Sorry for not really touching on fascist alternatives, but I think this critique is a good starting point. I think in general my view would be that democracy, or what you actually mean, majority rule, does not compete very well with meritocracy that has popular approval. Take Italy over the past few years. Who has proved the more capable governor. Silvio Berlusconi, elected by the people (although, corruption scandals are an issue, but he does have very popular support from certain aspects of Italian society), or Mario Monti, and his techoncratic government, supported by Constitutional procedure via the Italian President? Capable admins are more important than popular ones. Fascism attempts to address this issue.",DebateFascism,1380656245,AlbrechtVonRoon,3,3,ccj1jnn,t5_2v642,t3_1nis4e,0,,t3_1nis4e,Fascist

We're almost all employed/stationed at universities, so there's no real shutdown for us.  I don't know if the theorists employed at federal labs (Fermilab, Brookhaven mostly) are affected, but even if they are, there are relatively few of them.  For most of us there's pretty much no special equipment we need, so even if we weren't allowed to come in, we'd still keep working on our laptops and on paper at home, communicating by email and Skype as always.

That being said, while the shutdown doesn't seem to affect us directly, there are probably indirect long-term effects, especially related to funding, as /u/99trumpets has pointed out.  But since I'm just a grad student and not a professor, I don't know the specifics of dealing with the federal agencies for grants.  Also, there's the unrelated larger long-term decline of support in the US for particle physics.  So even without the shutdown, many of us are leaving the field (and thus science altogether) because there aren't any jobs, and those who are trying to stay in the field are thinking more about overseas particle physics projects in Europe, Japan, and China since we're pessimistic about the US funding the next collider.

The roots of the EU lie in the ""European Coal and Steel Community"" formed in 1951 by West Germany, France, Italy and the BeNeLux-States. (for further reference, this stands for BElgium, NEtherlands and LUXembourg).

This was in essence a trade agreement with some added benefits: a ""High Authority"", a ""Common Assembly"" of national parliamentarians, a ""Council"" of national ministers and a common court for cases of supranational relevance.

Upon this groundwork, in 1957 two more treaties were added: The European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community.

In 1965 with the Treaty of Brussels, those three communities were merged into one, which retained the label EEC.

Fast forward some decades in which many more countries joined, Maggy Thatcher threw several fits about how the poor Brits were abused by the horrible Germans and the stinky French and that she wants her money back (a large fight about agricultural subsidiaries - the UK paid a lot of money to the ECC but it's economy was largely based upon industry and commerce so the UK got a far lesser share of the paid money back as subsidiaries than France and Germany with extensive agriculture) and we arrive at the Treaty of Maastricht in 1993.

With this treaty, the EU was formed - the EEC meanwhile was converted into the European Community (EC) which still existed alongside the EU but was mostly meaningless. It still claimed some relevance due to the fact that their field of work was broader than that of the EU.

The EU took over the four institutions founded by the ECSC in 1951: The High Authority became the European Council, the Common Assembly the European Parliament, the council of ministers the European Commission and the court was retained as the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The next big step was the Treaty of Lisbon (edit: that took effect in 2009), which dissolved the EC and merged it with the EU while also vastly expanding the rights of the EU by having its member states give up a significant portion of their national authority to the EU.

That's right. That's exactly what I said. I'm still waiting for you to list a few good things that unionization has given us in the last twenty years.

&gt;Why don't you tell me why so many people have been ""working hard"" since 1970 and yet, despite record growth in our economy, few are any better off?

Record growth? Since 1970? I think you may be mistaken. I don't know about you, but I was around to remember the stagflation of the 1970's and the creation of the ""misery index"". 

If you'll google it, I'm sure that you'll learn that there are thousands of more millionaires in the US now, than there were in the 1970's. Is everyone a millionaire? No, but that's not the fault of capitalism. Virtually everyone who put any money into the stock market from 1982 - 1999 made money by investing in just about anything. The fact that there were people who chose not to save and invest their capital is not the fault of capitalism. 

Don't talk to me about all the people who can't invest in the stock market. I grew up poor in the 1970s so don't try to tell me about how hard it is to ""live beneath your means."" I did it. Millions like me did it.

Not everyone can be a small business owner, but then I never made that claim. I've tried to start 2 small businesses myself and failed both times. But that never stopped me from thriving even though I've had to work a variety of jobs. You make it sound as if it's an ""all or nothing"" proposition, as if a person who works for someone else doesn't stand a chance to thrive without a union's help. That's just not true.

Right now, today, there are currently 3,000 CDL A driver positions open. It costs about $5,500 to get a license and a person should make about $40,000 a year to start. In 2 or 3 years you can be making twice that, especially with the Natural Gas industry booming like it is. Hell, some people make over $100,00 a year driving truck. What's wrong with that? I'm seriously considering making the switch to driving due to a lack of upward mobility in my job right now. If it's good enough for me, why isn't it good enough for you? Or, is that something beneath your dignity?

How to escape poverty:

1) Get as much education as you can. If your school sucks, supplement your school by going to the public library. If a person wants to learn there are plenty of opportunities.

3) Don't be a drunk or drug addict.

As for some of your other complaints, let's look at The Gifted...

Hooks: not incredible but I'd say LoveHate Thing, Bad, Clappers, Rotation, Heaven's Afternoon, Vanity,Gullible, and 88 all had somewhat memorable hooks.

 Topics/concepts: Speaking from the perspective of Jesus about Jesus pieces, bricks being literal bricks to build yourself up, Jordan 3's symbolizing aspirations for Michael Jordan's greatness. Those aren't interesting perspectives? LoveHate Thing, Gullible, Vanity are all interesting too if not entirely unique.

Production: The ""New Black Soul"" type shit on LoveHate Thing, Sunshine, Gullible etc. The beat switch in Heaven's Afternoon, The church organs and choir on Golden Salvation, the EU sample on Clappers, the eerie boom-bap on Simple Man, the classic Just Blaze sound on 88, and the sequencing and transitions between all of them? None of that is above average?

Rotation, Tired of Dreaming, Bad Remix (especially), and maybe Clappers to some degree are all kinda A&amp;R garbage. I'm not sure what exactly about his persona is unbelievable though.

What would this accomplish in the long-term? Just an honest question. If Hitler could have an empire, why not use the lesser races as slaves? Germany had enforced many laws, usually against the Jewish, but if they so wanted to, they could had them enslaved instead of encamped and gassed. The point I'm trying to bring up is from my original theory of Hitler's end-goal... could there be racism if there was just one or a very select few 'greater' races? Was my theory as far off as you originally thought?

&gt;  ...establish a glorious Third Reich that would usher in a new era of dominance just like the Roman Empire did. 

Is this necessarily a bad thing? Many countries were founded on dominance, including the United States, which was also founded on a near-genocide of the Native Americans. There have been occurrences of much worse things happening in the past.  

&gt; Basically, take the German people from the depths the world had forced them to via the unfair Treaty of Versailles up to their rightful place on the throne of Europe, and fuck anyone who didn't like it.

This scenario sounds like Hitler is a patriotic leader that helped raise Germany out of the mud and rise to the throne where they so belonged. However, I suppose this is more or less the perspective of what Hitler would have seen it, right? If so, bravo, that looks like something he'd think (at least from what I know).

A good composition of arguments, thank you for taking your time.

First of all, yes, in terms of war, the US is one of the more secure countries in the world. But I would also like to argue that in the current state of politics - even with the economic crisis - the eastern and northern European countries are just as safe.

Now, please see that the matter at hand, which I tried to sought you out on, was if it is actually better to live in the US than another country - due to it being less hostile than.... well, the rest of the world. I thought at first that your original statement was one of a bit of ignorance. I am happy to see that not being the case, but instead finding you having a fair reasoning behind it.

With that said, let's continue. Yes, I find your sources believable about the amounts of ""normal"" deaths in the US are far outnumbering the numbers of homicides commited. And it is true that the [murder trend have according to the UN been sloping downwards lately \(with a peak in 2006\)](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/homicide.html) but while that is true, the same data still suggests a higher chance of ""being murdered"" in the US than my the ones suggested in my original comment: UK, France and Germany. If you check the [amount of people brought into formal contact with police](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/data.html) (an indicator for the number of crimes commited), you'll find US outnumbering most of the developed countries in the world.

Now, to address your anecdotal note: Several issues matters here. Cultural differences is one of them - if you or your friend were to come to Sweden or Finland you/he would hardly find anyone bothering you/him, as the culture in these countries are rather reserved. Another one is that tourists are often the main targets in major tourism cities such as Paris and Barcelona; can they afford to fly themselves over there, they have likely have a lot of money. And it is quite easy to figure out who is a outlander tourist and not. (it is sometimes almost comedically easy to find the american, no offense) I am pretty certain the same is true for the criminals in the US.

But, coming back at the matter at hand, I think it is reasonable to say that neither the US nor any of the highly developed countries in Europe are facing any wars anytime soon, and that while I still think the US is generally less ""secure"" for the indivual, my main concern was actually not at all to make you think that the US is less secure, or necessarily inferior in any other particular way, than the rest of the world: rather I were to make sure that your point of view was not that of an ignorant patriot unable to take critisism.

Yeah. Race is nearly pretty much defined by physical phenotype, with some leeway for descent. 
German/Danish/Italian/English/Icelandic etc. people whose ancestors are indigenous to the countries their identity is named after have a European phenotype, so they are all called white regardless of their cultural affiliation.  A norwegian or relatively recent African descent will be called black in America, with a Norwegian ethnicity. 

The reason it is like this is because of the origins of the race concept in America was in early ""science"", not sociology. When the Irish were considered non-white in America, scientists went to great lengths to find ""scientific"" reasons (such as theories based in phrenology) to justify beliefs that the Irish were drunk, unintelligent, lazy etc.
