Flights don't get delayed as often, homes are safe from storms wrecking havoc on their roofs and walls, you can walk out with your things without worrying about  you or your stuff getting wet, public events can stay open longer, days aren't too gloomy, and places that receive flooding annually can take a breather. But as time goes on, weathermen, meteorologists and the general public alike begin to notice a problem. 
 
In America, in the Midwest in particular begins to experience lots of drought. On the west coast forest fires begin to ravage everything. Closed bodies of water such as lakes start to dry up. Goodbye great lakes. Rivers shrink as the drought spreads nationwide. Though we have massive aquifers (like the Ogallala Aquifer) to satisfy us for a bit longer, with no rain they begin to dry up even faster as we take more and more water from them, and just like that they're gone completely. Crops that depend on these aquifers slowly begin to die out. Farmers take the hardest fall, and now penniless because their main source of income is gone, they are forced to move and find prospect elsewhere. The breadbasket of the world crumbles and Americans alike awake to find that store shelves are dwindling. Growing concern turns an orderly fashioned line of citizens waiting their turn into a zoo where it’s every man for himself. Martial law is implemented after weeks turn into months with no rain and water dwindling. Water overtakes gold and silver as the number one trading item. Around this time, we've probably turned to desalinization of the oceans to curb this growing crisis. The process is quite expensive and as a result, our economy begins to shows signs of fracture. With not enough water to meet the demand, most of North America is left in ruins. Society collapses and the US economy takes a nose-dive, taking Europe and most of East Asia with it.

The lack of rain begins to affect people globally and places like rainforests die out, and the millions of species that thrive there all go extinct. Goodbye “Lungs of the World.” Mass extinctions start to occur as the food chain begins to break down.  Livestock die with no water left to give them. Meat that was plentiful at one point goes scare and humanity is pushed back to the Paleolithic age. The Sahara and Kalahari deserts grow and quickly consume all of Africa, causing millions to die and war to erupt everywhere. The Middle East, especially in places like Dubai return back to the desert whence they came and that cushion of wealth evaporates. Governments have agreed to use the freshwater from the ice caps to supply the survivors with freshwater, but this ultimately exacerbates climate change dooming us even further. 

Perhaps we've begun to seed the clouds by now and force rain that way, but by the time we've done so the damage has already been done.

This all comes down to whether or not you can justify buying something. Essentially: How much do I want this figurine? Is it worth the amount that they ask for it? Will my wallet hate me?

&gt; I've always gone with SAL when I order off AmiAmi, guess I'll stick to SAL then :)

SAL is a good, economical option for the patient ones. Sometimes EMS would be a better choice, as it might only be a couple hundred yen over SAL. Not to mention that EMS is also fully insured up to 20,000 yen, which is always nice.

&gt; That kind of damange doesn't bother me, no more worries about the damaged boxes then thanks

Stores like AmiAmi and Mandarake treat ""box damaged"" as ""minor dent"" or ""unnoticable scratch on the plastic"" most of the time; ranging from that description to the picture /u/pitman posted.

&gt; And same I've only ever had to pay customs once when ordering figures but that was because it was a big Gunpla xD

Here in Sweden they catch your order if it comes outside of the EU and is above a certain threshold in terms of value. I can't lay down the law when it comes to the UK but I can paint you a picture with an example:

Let's say that I order a figurine which would cost me £85, shipping included. Would this be shipped with SAL, the Swedish customs would catch it and have me pay 25% tax or more when I am to pick it up at my local office. Should I instead have it sent through EMS without giving Mandarake a note of how much I want it to be insured for, it *might* sneak through customs without getting the additional tax. This has so far been the case in 1/5 purchases - granted I don't usually select EMS either, because of financial reasons.

For some final words I want to encourage you to think before buying something, if possible. Don't put yourself in the red just because you found something which you think look nice. Try and search within and see if you have some form of connection with the figurine before you place an order. I hope this helped you in some way and I wish toy all the best in your search for figurines!",True,t1_cdqedl9,t3_1rsa7w,5,,t1_cdqjxfq,cdqjxfq,False,1385857048,,5,AnimeFigures,1428447495,Tiriniz

First off - I want you to imagine the idea of circling Earth in a wood ship in the 1300s, maybe laying a transatlantic cable, flying, landing on the moon, building a global internet, etc etc etc before saying IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN!!! That is a constant thing I think we all need reminding of while we denounce The Future.

The system will not be built by humans. The material will be mined from asteroids (by robots that are all descendants of the original six 3D Printers and 100 tons of metal dust we shipped up starting in 2017). The mineBots (tm) will immediately break down the asteroids into component powders and shoot them to the moon orbiting production facilities (probably inside of Hefty Bags - tied off with duct tape). The facilities will output the various pieces of hardware (racking, modules, cable, etc) as single rolls of product that will slowly spin out of the mile wide 3D Printers Facilities. They will slowly float to the surface pulled toward previously automatically place AlivePiers (tm). The AlivePiers - using a bit of magnetism - are a two piece system used to fine tune the positioning of the Solar Beltway. This keeps it above dust patterns, gains extra sun tilt to increase efficiency, etc etc.

Due to the highly automated nature of the system, we actually never stop producing new solar modules on the moon. Over the next 200 years the earth enters a golden age with near infinite amounts of energy (that ends of course once the population begins home string theory experimentation - but that is another post!).

Due to the nature of asteroid mining and the broad availability of ALL elements - we do in fact build near 100% efficient solar modules with MANY layers of materials to absorb many wavelengths. This takes into account the higher levels of sunlight available on the moon versus the earth (atmosphere). Additionally - it will be necessary to build a battery system underneath the solar modules to balance the two to five or six lunar eclipses per year (hah - planet powering batteries!!).

So yes - all of the math you state is very true! And very AWESOME! However - it does not take into account the reality of human growth and the dynamics of economic desires. We do a lot of funny things on this planet - scaling up to global volumes some amazing things (hand held global communication systems - you know, cell phones).

Yes - the resources needed to (build pyramids, conquer the known world from horseback from Mongolia, circle the planet in boats, build Rome, cover roads across Europe, cross the Atlantic, populate the planet, go to the moon, etc etc etc) are LARGE and involve INVENTING NEW INDUSTRIES, however, we have experience in this shit.

1. BoE is contentious but the governor of the BoE offered yesterday to begin basic talks with the Scottish government about this
2. any EU citizen can use any other EU members Embassy if their particular country is not represented by an Embassy in that country, if when it comes to diplomatic channels the UK (for some reason) decided to be uncooperative then there are plenty of other countries to do deals with on embassies (not necessarily all with the one, ideally not actually)

4. there is uncertainty around the process for joining the EU (again, thanks Westminster for making sure we are ""as informed as possible"") but the simple fact is the EU will have no reason to not have Scotland, the conditions surrounding membership may be tricky and the negotiations may not work quite how has been expected but ultimately it is the aim of the EU to unite *all* Europe under the EU, casting Scotland out makes absolutely 0 logical sense when you consider the EU as an institution.",True,t1_cdqjhyw,t3_1rru6k,0,,t1_cdqk2iz,cdqk2iz,False,1385857426,cnty-scotland,0,unitedkingdom,1428447430,74159637895123

This is just flat out wrong.  The USA announced intentions to become a hegemonic power on March 23, 1983 with Reagan's SDI speech.  It took only a few years for the USSR to organize a response plan which has been in motion to this day.

The USSR 

- immediately challenged dollar hegemony via Iraqi proxy
- baited weak leaders into eastern expansion in Europe (Clinton, Bush) and ran them out with threats of nuclear war
- strongly encouraged a large scale ground conflict in Afghanistan by feigning opposition via requests to the US to tone down opposition to their activities in Chechen conflict
- baited the USA into Iraq by approving the attack in the UNSC (see how they blocked Syria more recently), thereby acquiring elevated petro prices for a decade
- has quietly organized the settlement of international trade in domestic currency rather than dollars
- has acquired near reserve status with ruble thanks to its better finances, account surplus, and appearance of more rational leadership relative to the USA

Overall, if you wanted to balance the starting locations, I think the US's starting income should be dropped to say, 160, South america needs a huge buff (say, brazil is 120 and argentina is 90), China needs more money (120ish?), and frankly, autopsies need to do something.

Other political parties were suppressed, such as the Freiland Lige and the Bund, in order to make sure that the only political ideology that was dominant in the camps would be the Zionist cause. 

They ensured that very little emigration to countries other than Palestine/Israel took place, preferring instead that people would be stuck in the camps rather than go somewhere other than Palestine/Israel. This took various forms, but the most shocking was the blocking of the transfer of Jewish orphans to England and Switzerland for fear that it would set a precedent which would undermine the Zionist cause. 

The Zionists running the camps also instituted a voluntary draft for the then nascent Israeli Defence Forces. This was an abject failure, with only a few hundred signing up for it, so they instead instituted a mandatory draft. So you had a situation where Jewish displaced persons, who were citizens of various European countries, were being forced into the army of a country that was not only not their own country, but not even yet founded, and all for a cause that many did not necessarily believe in. In order to ensure maximum conformity amongst the Jewish refugees, the Zionists resorted to violence, withholding of rations, infliction of fines, evicting people from their homes, and threatening them with the loss of their jobs if they had one in the camps. 

But the one thing that really stood out amongst the entire account is that the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust were referred to by the Zionists as ""chomer ‘enosh tov"", which translates as “good human material”.

It's interesting because the positive aspects generally ascribed to fantasy dwarves - hardy, brave, good at crafting - all come from Germanic or Norse myth.  What's missed out is the negative aspects that mythology gave them, particularly letchery.

It's also interesting that Tolkien intended for the Dwarves as a people to be similar in many respects to the Jews in Europe around the start of the 20th century.  Both groups have no homeland, for example, and are looked down on by others - the tension between Dwarf and Elf is apparently a reflection of how Gentiles tended to treat Jews.

The only fantasy writer recently who seems to have picked up on that is Terry Pratchett, who gives Discworld Dwarfs the kind of treatment people seem to be looking for.  You won't find the kind of warrior dwarf badassery that you get from Thorin and Gimli...no, seriously, Peter Jackson occasionally does give Gimli the comedy role but that's because Legolas and Aragorn simply aren't funny or particularly relatable; but when time to kick ass arrives, isn't it Gimli who basically gets pitched into a platoon of Orcs in order to hold the door at Helm's Deep?  And doesn't he have to be reminded to fall back?

I don't know where to begin.

For instance, your ridiculous support of the mestizo myth is just . . . well . . . breathtaking. What's your claim? That all Mexicans are equally mixed, they're all equally brown, and they all look more or less the same?

Let's test it against MY statements: That Mexico is a colonial country made up of several races, more or less like the United States [but with different percentages].

Let's see: I said Mexico had clear Western European people. Let's look at some: http://www.kevinalfredstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/mexican_girls.jpg

And now let's look at Mexico's predominant group: Amerindians. http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/1x6628552/mexican_girls_LLP-VLK-02891.jpg

And now let's look at Mexico's Africans. (Most Americans are unaware that Mexico imported in Africans before the United States did. In fact, at its height, Mexico had a 20% African populace.) http://newsantaana.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Sal-Rojas-the-Third-Root.jpg

My ""controversial"" position is that these three groups are three different races. Each is unambiguously tied to totally different population groups: Group 1 = Western Europeans. Group 2 = Amerindians. Group 3 = Africans.

If you are seriously, with a straight face, trying to convince the people on this thread that all these Mexicans are the same race . . . or that all Mexicans are ""equally mixed"" and identical . . . you're just being insane.

The truth is, a Mexican who looks like this: https://www.vdare.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/fullsize/images/james_fulford/nuevo-consul-de-mexico-en-las-carolinas1.jpg

...will have a completely different life inside Mexico than one who looks like this: http://occupationoforegon.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/080622_diego_perez.jpg?w=640

To sum up this (hilarious) bad history:

* Hitler's maid's high opinion of her employer does not erase millions of deaths

* Children's smiles do not erase millions of deaths

* JFK's quotes are all about his significance: Hitler was a significant asshole

* The vast majority of those other quotes are missing context/from the years before most people had any idea of the Nazi platform (for example, Lloyd George's is from 1936). The quote attributed to Hartley Shawcross is, after a quick Googling, probably fiction that originated at Stormfront.

* Hyperinflation was not solved by the Nazis, it was solved with the creation of the Rentenmark in 1923. 

* The Autobahn idea was developed in the Weimar Republic, and was implemented in a few places. The Nazis actually opposed it publicly, before claiming it as Hitler's idea once they were in power.

&gt;forced the world to rethink international relations to such an extent that much of Europe has enjoyed peace for over 65 years

If you want to be technical about it, you could argue that the current state of Europe is the way it is as a result of WWII, but that's not exactly to Hitler's credit. Europe today is a result of the international desire to avoid a WWIII, coupled with post-war Allied (largely American) construction of a strong (West) German state/economy. Arguing that we should thank Hitler for the peace Europe has enjoyed (assuming Europe doesn't include any country from the Eastern Bloc or in the Balkans) for the last 65 years is like arguing that we should thank ~~Frederick Douglass~~**JEFFERSON DAVIS** for the civil rights movement. Or something, that was a bad analogy.

&gt;The holocost was good.

Risky move, let's see how it plays out for him. Is he going to claim it never happened or try to excuse it?

&gt;The holocost had to happen for punishment of the Jews. 6 million jews weren't killed, there's no evidence to support that. Some jews were killed, these were the power elite jews.[2] The jews that were killed all were involved in gangs and were mostly bands of thieves.

And he goes for the double play, combining Holocaust denial **and** antisemitism! 

In all seriousness:

* This guy is a disgusting racist

* There's plenty of evidence to support the fucking Holocaust having happened

* The Nazis did not differentiate by socioeconomic class when deciding which Jews to kill (they actually allowed some Jewish family to buy their ways out of Germany, albeit at disgusting prices). Hitler may have claimed to be attacking what this moron so eloquently calls the ""power elite jews"" but in reality he went after every Jew he could find (as well as Gypsies, homosexuals, communists, etc).

* If I really need to rebut ""The jews that were killed all were involved in gangs and were mostly bands of thieves"", I'm in the wrong sub.

Anyway, again I'm not seeing anything about the ""great medical knowledge"" we gained in the Holocaust. As has been pointed out on this sub before, most of the so-called ""experiments"" conducted by the mad bastard Mengele and his cohort of sick fucks were basically prolonged, somewhat systemic bouts of torture and acts of sadism. I do believe we learned a bit about the human body and freezing temperatures from the Nazis' experiments, but one has to question whether we needed a massive war and the systematic extermination of human beings to get said knowledge.

From there the professional route is the CFL, or for very talented individuals, possibly NFL (though many only get to the tryout contract stage).  Also similar to what many European football leagues like the Bundesliga have is a minimum of non-import players that must be on the roster, whether they are born and raised in Canada or just having been living or born elsewhere but raised in Canada for a certain number of years.  We have an import ratio for offensive and defensive sides of the ball, and when a non import (Canadian) player can take a roster spot that often is filled by an American player (like running back or, extremely rarely, quarterback), that player is referred to as a ratio buster, and a non-import spot somewhere else on the roster can be used for an American player.  The Prairie Thunder is a junior football team which often feeds both the Saskatchewan Roughriders (pro CFL team) and the University of Regina Rams (CIS Canadian college football team) rosters.  The junior team I referred to is the closest equivalent that you'll see to ""youth academy"", as unlike soccer, hockey, or sometimes basketball, players rarely* transition to the pro level from a high school age.  

*I should actually say never as only the best college football players get drafted to the NFL before their sophomore or senior years.  The main reason for this is physical development, but also because American/Canadian football are such an experience dependent game, and there are often draft busts (players who destroyed in the college game but just couldn't cut it at the pro level, whether because they couldn't handle the pressure or because it was the team around them that really made the difference).  I mention this because when looking at the NHL, there are busts, but rarely do you see busts on the level of the NFL.  Guys like Stamkos, Crosby, Patrick Kane, etc were surefire draft picks and transitioned into NHL superstars just as well.  Hockey players get noticed fairly young sometimes but usually in their teens (maybe 12 at the soonest).

""In late 1984, when a Hong Kong distributor asked Cutter about the newer product, records show that Cutter asked the distributor to ""use up stocks"" of the old medicine before switching to its ""safer, better"" product.[3] Several months later, once haemophiliacs in Hong Kong began testing positive for HIV, some local doctors began to question whether Cutter was dumping ""AIDS tainted"" medicine into less-developed countries.[3] Cutter denied the allegation, claiming that the unheated product posed ""no severe hazard"" and was in fact the ""same fine product we have supplied for years.""[3] By May 1985, when the Hong Kong distributor told of an impending medical emergency, asking for the newer product, Cutter replied that most of the new medicine was going to the US and Europe and there wasn't enough for Hong Kong, except for a small amount for the ""most vocal patients.""[3]

The United States Food and Drug Administration helped to keep the news out of the public. In May 1985, the FDA's regulator of blood products, Dr. Harry M. Meyer Jr., believing the companies had broken a voluntary agreement to withdraw the old medicine from the market, called together officials of the companies and ordered them to comply.[3] Cutter's notes from the meeting indicate that Dr. Meyer asked that the issue be ""quietly solved without alerting the Congress, the medical community and the public"" while another company noted that the FDA wanted the matter solved ""quickly and quietly.""[3] ""

After a few nights with this, your body will get accustomed to sleeping right away as soon as you hear the sounds.

That's how it started. I was just compensating for the skills I lacked. It seemed like the obvious route.


A king doesn't need skills. A king needs subjects.


I started with the children, what few of them there were. Small and scared and cut off from everything they know, it's easy to make them love you. A warm place to sleep and a scrap of food and suddenly you're the father they thought was gone forever.


In those first months I was just that, a father. I was cold because it would make them fight for my approval. I was cruel because it would teach them distrust. I turned them into what I needed them to be so that I could maintain my own life.


When my scavengers and thieves were discovered I turned that to and advantage. A doe eyed child can bring so many instincts to the fore. Soon I was more than some Dickensian master of thieving children.


I had men and women now who looked to me for guidance. It was just as well, even the best trained child is so often useless.


I was still their father though, regardless of age.


My authority needed to be absolute and unchallenged. I had the strong willed killed outright, though I told my subjects that they had been cast out for sins. It didn't matter which, they had no reason to question my wisdom or judgement. I was their father.


I gathered subjects as quickly as I could. Numbers provided me strength and gave my rule legitimacy. Our territory grew. The dark and damp hiding grounds that had been my original refuge were too small for the people that hung on my every word like the thoughtless drones they were.


I set them to work, rebuilding the world as I needed it to be. Society as it was couldn't work. Not with the lack of resources and the lawlessness of the wastes. Things needed to be stronger. No room for the petty bickering that most people engaged in. I needed other to be strong for me to survive and for them to be strong, a strong hand needed to rule over them in absolute.


Though it hardly resembled its European brothers, my castle was strong. Smaller than most and a patchwork of materials it was perhaps not aesthetically pleasing but it was strong. 


The walls came next, like the castle itself it was not what you might call 'great'. It was once again, ugly, and patchwork, and strong enough to hold.


I divided the land. My most loyal and useful had the lion's share. The rest, well, I made them understand how grateful they should be for what I had given them. A king needs to reward his subjects but his subjects need to understand their place.


Some didn't like this but their coup was short. I knew how to make people love me and the few that forsake me were nothing against the ocean of loyalty. When it ended and examples had been made I had a crown forged. Like my castle and my wall and my wasteland it was ugly and patchwork but it made me the symbol that I needed to be.


When the world ended I had no practical skills to live in the wasteland but I had my cunning and through it I had what I needed.

0,0,1385878199,t5_2sokd,0,,"&gt;Why do foreign countries seem to hate Americans so much

For the same reason no one likes a bull in a china shop.  

The US has a surprisingly large collection of racists and ignorant fools, some of whom end up in government and then go and do things like invade some countries for no reason, and refuse to help when people who need it are begging.  And then it has a bunch of people who think the key to victory in this ridiculous plan of invading a random country is to to christianize the whole thing, and make it into the next Crusade, an idea that went out of fashion in 1274.  It's not like the rest of us don't have the same crazy people, we just try and keep them bottled up a bit better.  

The US actually used to be really good at looking at what other people did, and then copying the good ideas.  Since  the end of the Korean war, maybe even a bit later it has become largely myopic, thinking the US must be great because it's great and American ideas are great.  And what's happened?  Convinced of the rightness of itself it ends up with a lot of people who know nothing about the world and think they must know everything because they're americans and americans are smrt.

I think it really boils down to celebrated ignorance, and the problems that arise from a media that is free to lie constantly without repercussions.  It's not that the rest of us necessarily hate americans, - it's that most of the ones we meet are clueless, throw their money around like it should buy them privilege - we all smile and nod and say thank you sir, but we'd have charged less and been happier for it if the americans weren't assholes in the first place.  

Take for example the 'Europeans are socialists' thing.  Yes, there are major political parties in Europe, in many cases the ruling party *are* socialists.  Deliberately.  The idea that this is somehow a bad thing is downright offensive when, on evidence it has worked very well.  It's not that europeans hate being called socialists, it's that the underlying ignorance required to suppose that is a bad thing is infuriating. 

In the same way people in the US (who believe in reality) hear about schools trying to stop teaching evolution and who try and use 'scientist' as a dirty word.  It's frustrating to realize someone has managed to get to the stage in life where they believe their own bullshit, or are so ignorant of the world as to think reality is a bad thing.  

Ya, sure, it would have been nice if the US had joined the good side in WW1 or WW2 earlier, yes, it would be nice if the French weren't arrogant assholes about how wonderful their country/women/food are.  The US for a while was able to brag about how wonderful they were because things were going great, which was annoying in large part because the rest of us were struggling after fighting the Nazi's for 6 years.  But then the US clung to the idea of being superior, despite the rest of us having lower murder rates, better healthcare, better education, now we're even seeing european countries  where the bottom 99% are actually better off than in America in terms of disposable income, or at least they were until the Euro and David Cameroon had at them.

It is very hard to get an exact date of manufacture of most pre-war JP Sauers because most of the records were lost when the soviets occupied that part of Germany after WWII. The really early ones had the Krupp Stahll-Essen stamped radially around the barrels near the breech. Yours has been very well taken care of. 



It almost looks to me like the section that was damaged was originally supposed to be inlaid with a metal cap but was filled with epoxy or a similar compound. It is not uncommon for metal stock inlays to fall out over time from wood shrinkage, and I'm guessing it was lost and the relief was filled and shaped to match the shape of the missing cap. Before you try gluing it I would remove any sort of cloth debris and oils that may have made their way in. 

**EDIT:** Looking closer the cap of that foream may be inlaid with animal horn.

It's not my argument, it's the state of the world today.

&gt; All the design and development of the mods you mention were done by a small cadre of people with personal investment.

I don't disagree.  I just don't see the point of them getting into the manufacturing business.

&gt; It is then comparatively easy for a larger organisation to then clone their work and dominate the market they created thereafter, especially when they do not even have to credit the creator, let alone reimburse them.

Indeed.  Such is the world, and we can try to push water uphill all we want, but it'll just result in a lot of frustration.

Listen, I'm the best 8-track salesman you've ever seen, but selling 8-tracks in 2013 is a really risky proposition, as is manufacturing pretty much anything in the US or Western Europe.

&gt;it is the time, effort, ingenuity and risk. Supporting a culture that does not reward those things, just leads to the largest players exploiting the smaller players and in the long run leads to a less diverse market place as anyone else is crowded out.

Indeed.  None of those things, however, have anything to do with manufacturing.  You want to get rewarded for your time, effort, ingenuity, and risk?  Put in said time, effort, ingenuity, and risk, and then put in a tiny bit more to figure out how to not get cloned - here's a free tip: get your shit manufactured at a cost low enough that your final price is only 2x (rather than 10x) of what China could accomplish - then you're not worth cloning.  Or just don't compete on price - do something China can't.

You can charge whatever you like - and I'll never argue otherwise, but, if you exceed what the market will bear, the market will find a way around you.

&gt; As has been mentioned, it isn't the materials that represent the cost, hence why your silver idea would not apply, but rather it is the time, effort, ingenuity and risk. 

You're fixated on materials.  I don't know why you mentioned them the first time, and I don't know why you're mentioning them now.  I was simply throwing out an idea that will come, whether I say it or not, China will graduate from $20 clones to $40 clones (it already has), then to $75 clones, and to $100 clones, and possibly to $200 clones.  The only way to get a clone from China to actually cost $200 is to use something like silver.  The actual material in question is irrelevant, the point was that the quality is functionally equivalent at around the $25-$30 price point, and it'll only go up from there.",True,t1_cdqo99w,t3_1rsml6,0,,t1_cdqozv2,cdqozv2,False,1385870512,,0,electronic_cigarette,1428445131,vjarnot

0,0,False,t5_2ssp3,0,Historical Linguistics,"Words have etymologies, languages do not. Instead, we say that they are ""related"" to one another. Linguists generally think of languages as being related to one another in two ways: a genetic relationship and borrowing. 

Basically, when languages have a genetic relationship, it means we can demonstrate that they descended from a common ancestor in the past. We generally prove this by showing that they share such a number of vocabulary which, by a number of regular (meaning with few or no exceptions) and recurrent (meaning found everywhere in the language) sound correspondences can be reconstructed to a common ancestor that you cannot explain it by just random chance or by borrowing.

And that leads us to the second bit: borrowing. Languages borrow (perhaps ""copying"" is a better word here), and they can borrow essentially anything: not just words but sounds, grammatical constructions like basic word order, etc. But, glossing over the important case of pidgin and creole languages, this is not how languages are considered to be related, because languages are usually passed on from parent (and community) to child, not from adult to adult.

So where did Greek, Latin, and Ancient Egyptian come from? Or, better, what are their common ancestors? Greek and Latin are both members of the Indo-European language family, having descended from the Proto-Indo-European language. Other descendants include English, Russian, Albanian, Armenian, Hindi, and Farsi, among many others. Ancient Egyptian belongs to the Afroasiatic language family, and, along with Arabic, Hebrew, Somali, and some other languages, descend from the Proto-Afroasiatic language.

Note, though, that we can only go back so far with our current, reliable methods in historical linguistics.

We take our civil war history seriously around here, because we hate hearing about how we're the bad guys all the time.  Slavery and racism are terrible things, and as such are the most-often mentioned/cited as the biggest cause, but it was not the only reason.  It's been a few years so I can't quite recall all the stuff that was going on, but... The south (agricultural base) felt persecuted/used/like the north (manufacturing base) was trying to weaken us for a while.  The north had very dense populations, while the south was more spread out.  All those tiny states in New England get senators and all of current Virginia AND WV got two.  And the South's population looks even smaller when slaves aren't fully counted.  whether they should or shouldn't be *mainly* divided down who had  what to gain.  Really, decades before the war, do you sincerely believe the industrial titans and politicians of the northeast were pushing to discount slaves when determining population and representation in the House because they care about these people who they don't know and have no affect on their lives, and the abolition movement was still weak?  *really?*  the south was importing goods from and shipping material to Europe.  The north east pretty much only ""imported"" from the south, and manufactured their own.  So taxes on imports and exports never went over real well, the south was always fighting them since the north had disproportionate representation and didn't really feel the economic effects of these taxes... There was other stuff, but I'm tired.

And as far as what grounds a state should require to secede, I believe someone said something like, ""any union entered into voluntarily can also be dissolved voluntarily.""  In a free society/country, that is.  But anybody that's studied American history seriously knows how often we claim freedom and justice for all only to turn around and use slaves, persecute Indians, inter Japanese citizens, etc.  I want to add ""lay siege to and shoot a bunch of people because they have some funny/strict religious views and 'a lot' of legally purchased guns,""  but I don't know enough about Waco or ruby ridge to comfortably add that...

Edit oh and as far as fort sumter's status, it was built after the war of 1812 as part of an effort to beef up or defense.  The commander at fort moultrie (located on the more easily approached  sullivans island that mainly had cannons facing the Atlantic ocean) abandoned the fort in favor of the more defensible fort Sumter at the mouth of the harbor and turned the cannons around on the city (without orders, but they didn't exactly punish him for it).

Differences between LCS and LPL are clear. The former provides stability for a good number of teams, the latter doesn't. For years they could barely play in international tournaments because they wouldn't get visas, only now seems to improve. The teams weren't really created by/involving big E-Sports organizations like the EU (and Curse in NA) ones have been.

&gt;Besides, Korea is by far the best region when it comes to the depth of their league and players, meaning plenty of teams and players are top tier players, where as the other regions aren't near this point. The second best region when it comes to that is EU.

Cool story, but not what it was about, all I did was say that ""skillgap decreasing between regions"" was a bold statement seeing how from the launch of the game until this day it's been the other way around. Of course Korea is the best region when it comes to depth of their league and players, that's why they're #1 atm. However, it's not like the region can't get even stronger, it's not capped.

It's worth pushing home that what the fibre to the premises NBN delivers is this sort of high speed, reliable, high definition connectivity for EVERYONE, and multiple people in the same household simultaneously.

These sorts of interactions require high speed internet travelling in both directions. Copper based technologies simply do not provide that flexibility. They can be squeezed to get higher download speeds, but uploads will always be paltry in comparison, meaning true two-way communication is always a pipe dream, particularly with multiple people using the connection at once (and that includes multiple people on the same street.)

We all know that copper is already over saturated and that at peak hour, with just a few people in the street using the services heavily, everything can grind to a halt. Changing to VDSL isn't going to improve the congestion problems. Only fibre offers the most bandwidth, in both directions, easily upgradeable into the future.

The thing is, everything in that video is something we can do now. We can have video chats - although most ADSL connections will struggle with multi-conferencing, and many struggle even with sending an HD upstream. We can have multi-party music studio sessions - but with higher pings and lag on copper, they're pretty useless compared to the almost instant feeling low-latency of a fibre connection. We will all watch TV over the internet rather than over aerials, and it will come sooner rather than later, and TV will be broadcast in 720p or above, even 4K is not that far off, using up loads of bandwidth. 

The technology for shopping programs, trying on clothes like that woman in the video, already exists - just see the iPhone app glasses.com. The technology is there, it's just limited by the speed and amount of information that can be sent and processed in both directions. The technology is there to film the woman, scan her body, match a scanned clothing frame to her skeletal frame, and display a real time reflection of her wearing those clothes. It's entirely possible, but requires a huge amount of data to be quickly sent in both directions between server and home. This is not feasible on ADSL, and it won't be feasible on VDSL when little Johnny is watching an HD movie in the other room whilst daughter Britney Skypes her friends, along with everyone else on the street. And companies who would be DYING to invest in such technology for their online shopping services simply won't do so until they know their customers have a reliable enough connection to experience it. 

The node boxes and the copper will reach saturation so so quickly - this technology and the expected usage of HD etc is already becoming default across much of the world as places like Asia and Europe invest in fibre. Hell, even YouTube these days starts chewing up your bandwidth instantly by defaulting to a 720p advert everytime you try watch a video. 720p+ video for everything is already pretty much a standard, and even our tiny pocket phones take 1080p video by default these days; but boy does it take a long time to upload one of those videos over a crappy copper connection. There are plenty of online back-up services/cloud services out there who would love to take my money, but I don't want to pay for them as I know that uploading my gigabytes of data will currently take days and days of time if not weeks.

Spending all this money on copper all over again is such an unbelievable waste of money. Biggest case of government waste I think this country has ever seen.

This doesn't need to include month 1, though getting a 2nd uplink up by the end of month 1 is a great way to get a good lead.

&gt;If a soldier kills a soldier legally through war, it's war. 

Is that saying ""all war violence is bad and killing is wrong""? No. It isn't. How are you so obtuse you don't even remember what I said literally 2 comments ago?

What I said was that I do not believe in the CURRENT WARS. Or in SENSELESS COLD BLOODED MURDER. I really hope you are following here, because it might get tricky. Look at World War II. That was a perfectly valid war, at least from this countries perspective. Not only were we stopping a fascist megalomaniac who wanted to colonise not only parts of mainland Europe, but also us, but was also systematically wiping out entire groups of people.

Now compare that to the war in Iraq that came under the pretense of ""weapons of mass destruction"" and ""stopping Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden"" who weren't really much to do with Iraq in the first place... I believe that war is wrong.

So that's two wars compared. Now lets say... Take the killing of Lee Rigby and compare to the shooting of James Huberty. The killing of Lee Rigby was a cold blooded murder that was apparently for political reasoning, which seems contradicted by the fact that they are now denying guilt. When compared to Breivik or Al-Qaeda, this is strange as they wanted to be guilty.

On the other hand, James Huberty shot and killed 21 people, injuring 19 more. This, believe it or not. Is bad. The police sniper that shot him? That is good. Whether or not it needed to be a fatal shot, that is a question I cannot be bothered answering as I do not know all the facts. However, he was stopped. He could have killed more people, but he was stopped. In this instance, violence was good, and the killing may well have been justified.

Because I don't believe in the killing of innocents, the perpertation of war crimes, or what I believe to be unjust wars, does not mean I am some ""violence-hating hippy"" like you seem to think I am. Stop trying to assume you know what the hell I think, and reducing it to one sentence.

I'm more realistic in this world.

However you and me both know as long as the world is in it's state of greedy men that is not realistic.

The people of Ni'ihau only exist out of our charity now. They exist because we (society) tolerate the wishes of a Kings (IV) request, but that could change in the future. Just ask native Americans who lose their tribal land each time something is desired on their lands such a uranium or gold, or oil etc...

What happens to them if the fishing grounds here start drying up? China and Japan and South Korea are feuding over fishing grounds. This why Ni'ihau can not keep living in the past. They have to develop a system of trade because obvious they can not provide their own resources to technologically build, nor do they even want to. As long as men seek power and greed those that are weak will be swallowed up. I've seen this many times as a Marine and historically. It's the reality of the world and yes it's sad to say.

King IV was foolish in his decisions. He almost bankrupted the kingdom as well. I tend to think he predecessors like King Kam the I wanted Hawaii to progress out of the stone age ways. Keep some of the traditions, but be educated and progressed. He used European technology in his conquest. He knew the value of such tech and education. That was what made him greater than all other Ali'is. He had a future vision.

There you have it moonpurr. Ni'ihau needs to get with it. Their future is short and they can't see it, and are in denial of such. They are going to get swallowed either by their own population growth (study Rapa Nui rise and fall from overpopulation) or by  greed of conquest. Already people are invading their fishing for profit. They will have to defend it, or come fully into the Hawaiian isle family of the USA, or if it ever became a sovereign kingdom.

It depends on where you are. You need to keep in mind that the US has 300+ million people in it. New York City has about three million more people in it than the entire country of Norway (8 mil NYC, 5 mil Norway). We have incredible diversity as a country in beliefs, customs, and treatments of those with or without religion. Yeah, we have a greater number of assholes in our country, but I would argue the percentage of assholes to populace is probably about the same. We have Texas, you (meaning Europeans) have... I dunno. I'm just going to assume Greece and Spain because they seem like they'd be super religious. We have Massachussetts and really most of New England (I say most because well occasionally New Hampshire jumps on board the crazy train), and Europe has the UK, Germany, and from what I can tell the Scandanavian countries.

My point is that yes, things can be construed as bad here, but my experiences differ wildly from many on here as well. I grew up in New Jersey, went to school in Maryland, and work now in DC. I became an atheist towards the end of my college career, and honestly am pretty open about it. Nothing bad has happened to me. 

Have I had experiences with people coming up and preaching to me? Sure, but I also had a homeless man tell me he was Kal-El and explain to me the adventures he had with Wonder Woman, Spider Man, and Wolverine (I didn't have it in me to argue about him crossing the streams of DC and Marvel). Both types of experiences happen just as often (not often at all).

My boss's dad was a preacher. I don't know if he is Christian or not, and we don't talk about it at all. He doesn't mention faith, nor does anyone in the office because who cares? I visit Georgetown (a Catholic college) and talk to the atheists, catholics, protestants, and hindu students, and honestly you couldn't tell a difference. 

Yes, a majority of people in the US are still Christian, but so what? A lot of that depends on region. While you sling mud at us, I would like to remind you that [Europe isn't a bastion of tolerance either.](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-survey-shows-widespread-homophobia-in-europe-a-900505.html)

&gt; I have asked the EU Commission to investigate why I, as an EU citizen for 40 years, have been told by Westminster politicians and some innuendo driven rhetoric from European politicians that my citizenship is somehow on loan and second class because I was born and reside in Scotland and asked why my English born brother who resides in Scotland has therefore, seemingly a ‘proper’ claim forever to his EU citizenship. I asked whether it was a breach of my rights as an EU citizen to have that citizenship questioned merely because there was a legally approved referendum forthcoming in Scotland that follows approved democratic lines supported by the EU?

&gt; I am either an EU citizen, or I am a pretendy EU citizen who is only classed as such if a Tory Government in Westminster or say, Alistair Darling allows it it appeared from what I am hearing and reading, and I don’t believe there is any mechanism to undo my citizenship so I wished to be informed not because of the Referendum in 2014 alone, but because the EU rules are clear that I cannot have my personal EU citizenship downgraded for political reasons and this gets them off the hook with ‘not wishing to intervene in the politics of the referendum’.

&gt; The fact that the Spanish Minister and Barruso have intervened and muddied the waters means the EU must clarify our position as Scottish citizens within the EU.

You think they seem cheaper because the government is taking money in taxes and subsidizing government exchanges. And as for how much we spend on healthcare, it's not only an apples and oranges comparison, it'a also difficult to know what European countries actually spend on healthcare costs because they don't calculate the entire costs of the government bureaucracies taking in taxes, funding the healthcare programs, etc. While the costs are more transparent in the US. Further, the US excels at treating bad diseases. The prime minister of Canada didn't come to the US for treatment for nothing. The US, much as they do with their military, has a big free rider problem. US companies spend a TON on R&amp;D and the Euros get the savings. If we do switch to single payer or universal healthcare in the US, just about *every* healthcare economist will tell you those research efforts and ""heroic"" efforts for older patients will have to be reduced.

War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied: and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals, engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.""

Similar claims are uttered by snake-oil salesmen throughout history. It's not special privilege for *my facts*. It's an objective truth that has only historically been disputed by people with transparent political motives.

&gt;And no one is disputing that Jews were put in camps and forced to work and that many died. That they had their property taken from them and were encouraged/forced to emigrate and that racist laws were enacted preventing them from holding certain jobs and treating them as second class citizen. No one disputes Jews were blamed for Germany's ills by politicians.

And nobody disputes that Jews were regularly shot in the concentration camps for insubordination or the guards' good pleasure. Nobody disputes the horrific scientific experiments on Jewish people in the camps or the cruel methods of execution. Nobody disputes the fact that Jewish prisoners deemed too feeble or young to work in the camps were quickly killed. 

This is not the stuff of fantasy.

&gt; What people dispute is the numbers that were killed and whether there was a state wide policy of extermination and the manner they were killed.

There is no reasonable doubt that this is the case. My grandparents survived the Nazi death camps as Jews. Everything they witnessed is consistent with the accepted historical account. 90% of the Jewish population in Poland was destroyed. There was a state-wide policy of extermination of the Jews across Europe and it is beyond a reasonable doubt. The only person who would deny such easily accessible and definitive evidence is someone who is hopelessly biased. 

&gt;If you insist on seeing bad faith when people want to find historical truth there is no fixing your deliberate ignorance.

He's remembered today for playing with major figures like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie; for being one of the first to develop a formal system of jazz education, with students including Lee Konitz and Wayne Marsh; and for being one of the very first to experiment in the studio with overdubbing. 

From the Youtube description:  
&gt; This 1965 concert broadcast on Danish television not only represents a rare opportunity to enjoy Lennie Tristano playing solo piano, but it is one of his last recorded public appearances. Tristano was notoriously difficult to persuade to perform in later years, but he made a trip to Europe where he took part in a televised Berlin Piano Summit (as one of six featured all-star pianists) and came to Denmark the following day for this program. Tristano's dense altered chords in a deliberate ""Darn That Dream"" don't seem all that radical decades later, while his inventive reworking of the swing favorite ""Lullaby of the Leaves"" is a treat. The blind pianist is not one for a lot of theatrics, he simply turns and offers a slight smile to his enthusiastic audience after each selection.

For a plethora of reasons. Again, one such reason was given in a source which describes Churchill's hesitancy.

&gt;Yes, Stalin was insistent, but what does that reveal about America and Britain's motivations?

It reveals Britain and the US' *lack* of motivation. They viewed D-Day as a consolation to Soviet war efforts. Churchill wanted to stick with their southern attack strategy through Italy.

It appears that international sanctions work and that a boycott is a tool like no other. Even Israel’s prime minister has admitted this; he has called on the world not to ease the sanctions and to even intensify them, and following his lead is the shrill U.S. Jewish lobby.

This being the case, the moral is clear: This is the way to act with recalcitrant states. This applies not only to Iran, where the theory is being proved before our eyes, but with another country that does not obey the decisions of the international community.

Israel has signed the Horizon 2020 agreement for scientific research with the EU barring funding from companies or institutions with ties to the settlements. This is irrefutable proof that a boycott threat works well with Israel, too.

The truth is hard to miss. By signing the agreement, Israel gave a hand to the first official international boycott of the settlements. There is no other way to portray this agreement, even including the special appendix that Israel added in protest. Israel, which passes indecent laws against calls for boycotts against it, surrendered and signed on to boycott terms when it began to be hit in the pocket.

Now we have a limited boycott and a harbinger of things to come. The negotiations over the agreement were conducted by Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, whose office is located in the heart of occupied East Jerusalem. For some reason, the EU didn’t boycott her for this. Negotiations over funds trickling to the settlements are being conducted with a minister who, according to the entire world, has her office in a settlement on Jerusalem’s Saladin Street.

This absurdity reveals the hypocrisy of boycotting just the settlements. Every Israeli organization, institution or authority is somehow involved with what’s going on beyond the Green Line. Every bank, university, supermarket chain or medical institution has branches, employees or clients who are settlers. The settlements are an all-Israeli project and the boycott can’t be limited to them, just as the boycott of apartheid-era South Africa couldn’t be limited to the institutions of apartheid.

There everything was apartheid, and here everything is tainted by occupation. Israel funds, protects and nurtures the settlements, so all of Israel is responsible for their existence. It’s unfair to boycott just the settlers. We’re all guilty. On the other hand, boycotting all of Israel is likely to morph into the rejection of its very existence, something most of the world justly does not want. Therefore, we should rejoice over the limited boycott even if it is tainted by double standards. We should draw lessons from it.

The success achieved with Iran must become the world’s road map in how to end the Israeli occupation and the denial of the Palestinians’ rights. The outline is clear. We have had a failed diplomatic effort and decades of the “peace process,” the longest in history. We have had endless peace plans buried in drawers, while Israel has continued to build without restraint in the settlements in contravention of the world’s position.

So the time has come for sanctions. When these are felt in Israel, only then should an international committee be formed, whether in Geneva, Jerusalem, Oslo or Ramallah, where the world will translate economic sanctions into political achievements.

This worked with Iran, and it will work with Israel and prevent bloodshed. There’s no reason to continue the masquerade of peace talks that, with the exception of one American, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, no one takes seriously. Even he will eventually come around because as long as Israelis don’t pay a price for the occupation or are blind to it, they won’t end it. That’s the truth.

The truth is a bitter reality with which no Israeli can be happy. Disconnected from the international reality, most Israelis are convinced that the status quo where the people of one nation lack all rights while the people of another nation enjoy full rights can’t continue indefinitely. Maybe this will be the real historic achievement of the negotiations with Iran. It will be the last wake-up call for that sleeping beauty, Israel.",True,t3_1rtvv8,t3_1rtvv8,-1,,t1_cdqu0st,cdqu0st,False,1385887883,,-1,Israel,1428442712,Johnlongsilver

0,0,False,t5_2ssp3,0,,"Isaiah Trunk's ""Judenrat"" is probably the most exhaustive account of German-appointed Jewish councils that oversaw European ghettos during the Holocaust. Chaim Rumkowski was the head of the Judenrat in the Lodz ghetto, where my maternal grandmother's family was from, making [Rumkowski's 1942 speech](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/give_me_your_children.htm) all the more gut-wrenching for me:

&gt; A grievous blow has struck the ghetto. They are asking us to give up the best we possess -the children and the elderly. I was unworthy of having a child of my own, so I gave the best years of my life to children. I've lived and breathed with children, I never imagined I would be forced to deliver this sacrifice to the altar with my own hands. In my old age, I must stretch out my hands and beg: Brothers and sisters! Hand them over to me! Fathers and mothers: Give me your children!

...

&gt; Yesterday afternoon, they gave me the order to send more than 20,000 Jews out of the ghetto, and if not - ""We will do it!” So the question became, 'Should we take it upon ourselves, do it ourselves, or leave it to others to do?"". Well, we - that is, I and my closest associates - thought first not about ""How many will perish?"" but ""How many is it possible to save?"" And we reached the conclusion that, however hard it would be for us, we should take the implementation of this order into our own hands.

&gt; I must perform this difficult and bloody operation - I must cut off limbs in order to save the body itself. I must take children because, if not, others may be taken as well - God forbid.

...

&gt; I must tell you a secret: they requested 24,000 victims, 3000 a day for eight days. I succeeded in reducing the number to 20,000, but only on the condition that these be children under the age of 10. Children 10 and older are safe! Since the children and the aged together equal only some 13,000 souls, the gap will have to be filled with the sick.

...

&gt; I reach out to you with my broken, trembling hands and beg: Give into my hands the victims! So that we can avoid having further victims, and a population of 100,000 Jews can be preserved! So, they promised me: If we deliver our victims by ourselves, there will be peace!

...

&gt; One needs the heart of a bandit to ask from you what I am asking. But put yourself in my place, think logically, and you'll reach the conclusion that I cannot proceed any other way.

Bullshit.  Even historians on your side dispute the numbers.  Surely you don't think they all agree exactly 6 million died, do you?

You're the intellectual fraud.

And how is Leuchter a fraud?  Have his findings of no HCN on the walls of the alleged homicidal gas chamber been disproved?  A simple visual examination for the Prussian blue color reveals he's not a fraud.

&gt;Reports estimate 8,668,400 in irrecoverable losses to the Red Army's 34,401,807 conscripts. This comes out to a 25.197% death rate. Applied to the 9.5 million Jews in Europe before the war, there would be 2.4 million deaths. This is less than the Jewish death toll from Poland alone.

You denier!  How dare you pick and choose the lower numbers.  You must be racist towards Russians.

Other reports have claimed up to 25 million dead Red soldiers.  Read a little bit further down in the Wikipedia article you're plucking your information from.

Again, I used the same 2.4 million deaths you calculated as the low number.  It goes all the way up to 6.5 million if you use the larger estimates.  And we're not accounting for the huge numbers of wounded and sick which brings the numbers up to like 90% killed, wounded, or sick.  And Russian civilian men died at an even worse rate!

And 2.4 million Poland deaths is not written in stone.  I assume this is part of the 6 million figure?  And you included camps like Auschwitz?

These numbers are in dispute.  The Red Cross and German records show about 150,000 deaths at Auschwitz.  The official Allied sources (although historians have always disputed this) started at 4 million at Auschwitz and now are down to just over 1 million. 

The evidence supports the lower Red Cross number.  

The numbers from Treblinka, Sobibor, and Belzec are also likely exaggerated.  

There may be 2.4 million total deaths . . . I'm not sure.  It's possible Jewish deaths exceeded this.  But just looking at those 4 camps alone (which is almost half of claimed deaths) the numbers seem grossly exaggerated.

&gt; Qutb's message was spread through his writing, his followers and especially through his brother, Muhammad Qutb, who moved to Saudi Arabia following his release from prison in Egypt and became a professor of Islamic Studies and edited, published and promoted his brother Sayyid's work.[7][8]
&gt;
&gt; Ayman Al-Zawahiri, who went on to become a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, was one of Muhammad Qutb's students [9] and later a mentor of Osama bin Laden and a leading member of al-Qaeda.[10] and had been first introduced to Sayyad Qutb by his uncle, Mafouz Azzam, who had been very close to Sayyad Qutb throughout his life and impressed on al-Zawahiri ""the purity of Qutb's character and the torment he had endured in prison.""[11] Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet's Banner.[12]
&gt;
&gt; Osama bin Laden is reported to have regularly attended weekly public lectures by Muhammad Qutb, at King Abdulaziz University, and to have read and been deeply influenced by Sayyid Qutb.[13]
&gt;
&gt; Late Yemeni Al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki has also spoken of Qutb's great influence and of being ""so immersed with the author I would feel Sayyid was with me... speaking to me directly.”

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism#Sayyid_Qutb

&gt; Maududi's political ideas influenced Sayyid Qutb, one of the key philosophers of Islamism, and a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood movement. Qutb believed things had reached such a state that the Muslim community had literally ceased to exist. It ""has been extinct for a few centuries,""[118] having reverted to Godless ignorance (Jahiliyya).
&gt;
&gt; To eliminate jahiliyya, Qutb argued Sharia, or Islamic law, must be established. Sharia law was not only accessible to humans and essential to the existence of Islam, but also all-encompassing, precluding ""evil and corrupt"" non-Islamic ideologies like communism, nationalism, or secular democracy.
&gt;
&gt; Qutb preached that Muslims must engage in a two-pronged attack of converting individuals through preaching Islam peacefully and also waging militant jihad to forcibly eliminate the ""power structures"" of Jahiliyya – not only from the Islamic homeland but from the face of the earth.
&gt;
&gt; Qutb was both a member of the brotherhood and enormously influential in the Muslim world at large. Qutb is considered by some to be ""the founding father and leading theoretician"" of modern jihadis, such as Osama bin Laden.[119][120] However, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and in Europe has not embraced his vision of undemocratic Islamic state and armed jihad, something for which they have been denounced by radical Islamists.

I think the notion that the Islamic world had fallen into a state of Jahiliyya was Qutb's invention. That means that jihadists are fighting unbelievers even in a nominally Muslim country. That's a tremendously important - and tremendously bad - ideological innovation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbism#Takfir

&gt; The most controversial aspect of Qutbism is Takfir, Qutb's idea that Islam is ""extinct."" According to Takfir, with the exception of Qutb’s Islamic vanguard, those who call themselves Muslims are not actually Muslim. Takfir was intended to shock Muslims into religious re-armament. When taken literally, Takfir also had the effect of causing non-Qutbists who claimed to be Muslim in violation of Sharia law, a law that Qutb very much supported. Violating this law could potentially be considered apostasy from Islam: a crime punishable by death according to Qutbis

0,0,False,t5_2s7tt,0,,"&gt; Euthanasia is fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer, would be difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks.

There are several European countries that have already proven this concept wrong. It is not impossible to control, and it being ""difficult"" to do so is not a good reason to allow people to suffer. The ""healer"" is causing a person to suffer for a longer amount of time because of semantics. 

&gt; Euthanasia could also readily be extended to incompetent patients and other vulnerable populations.

I had already covered in my comment the concept of patients like this being taken advantage of. It's a hurdle overcome, and would take a great deal of effort to do so, but there is a vast difference between a cancer patient who is wasting away and wants to die and a patient who is incapable of making that decision for themselves. 

&gt; Instead of engaging in euthanasia, physicians must aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the end of life. Patients should not be abandoned once it is determined that cure is impossible. 

Then create a new title for it, if people are so damn insistent on physicians being solely ""healers"" rather than people who are there to actually give their patients the option of a dignified and comfortable death when said death is shortly imminent regardless. It shouldn't be considered ""abandonment"" when a cure is impossible and the only possible path is one of many months of suffering and degradation until death.  

&gt; Patients near the end of life must continue to receive emotional support, comfort care, adequate pain control, respect for patient autonomy, and good communication.""

I find it laughable they put ""respect for patient autonomy"" in their argument against giving their patients the ability to choose what they want to do with their lives. You can have all of the above except for that one point while still allowing a terminal patient to choose to end their life - but you're ultimately breaking that point when you choose to not let them because you are a ""healer"" rather than someone who isn't so cruel to force a terminally ill patient to to go through the wasting process when they don't want to.

0,0,1385898213,t5_2v419,0,,"Okay, this will be very generalized (or perhaps it'll be very limited to what I see around me), but I'm going to give this a shot.

I guess one of the main points in European fashion (EF from now on) is that there is less of a stigma to wearing more feminine clothes as a male (dare I say ""gay it up""). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I always get the impression that American culture favours the macho man, and this shows in the average man's clothing. Israeli culture, I happen to know, goes even further with this, men there are laughed at for wearing too tight of a t-shirt (just an example).

Another major difference, that you already adressed, is the weather. It is often colder here, than in many parts of the US, and when it's colder in the US, it's so cold that you can only wear specialized clothing.

A lot of clothing worn in europe is produced by spanish brands (I'm talking the inditex group: Zara, Berschka, Pull&amp;Bear), which means smaller sizes/""gayer"" looks. I really advice you to look on [Zara's website](http://www.zara.com/), they have a very defining role in EF.

So to generalize very much, Europeans wear more layers, skinnier pants, and slightly more androgynous clothing.

In england, I've noticed, among teenagers, the look is often dark red chinos, with a blue sweater over the top. Kind of like [this](http://images-ff.asos-media.com/shmotterstorage/71093/large_f13f5998-c7cd-4c98-a635-eeabe71e5aa0.jpeg), except exchange the jacket for a sweatshirt. As a matter of fact, you see this so often, it becomes comical.

Lately in Holland, especially what I see on black people, all black outfits have become very in. This means, often, a black (fake) leather jacket, with black skinny jeans and black sneaker (vans, allstars). Army colours and camo prints have also made a big hit, in [coats](http://www.remixline.com/5205-thickbox_default/scotch-and-soda-quilted-nylon-jacket-in-camo.jpg) and accesories (bags, watchstraps). Studs were also in for a while, though slightly more for women than for men, but there were definitely [men's clothes with studs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.svpply.com/large/1919457.jpg?1383226628).

Hope this gives a bit of an idea, I'll come back later and add some more foto's if I can think of them.

No, it's not. ""To go viking"" meant to set out on raids, being comparable to the modern phrase ""to go pirating."" The word ""viking"" stuck as a word to describe those who did that. It was predominantly a male activity and far, far from universal; commonly it was local lords known as Jarls organising raids for food and money whenever crops were failing or whenever he felt he wanted more support (he lends a couple of boats he has and money to buy initial supplies for the raid, everyone loves him), or kings raising armies to go raiding as a kind of terror tactic. It was a huge event in their society, not a fact of everyday life, well attested in the Sagas.

We are hoping the constitutional court will prevent at least that, as it proved a useless and completely political institution in re to lgbt rights in matters of sexual eduaction and now in allowing this referendum.

The reason I suggested LL.M.s for you to also take into consideration was simply because you said you wanted to work in international organisations. Now, even if an LL.M. would not allow you to work as a 'proper lawyer' in a court environment or whatever else specific jobs only fully qualified lawyers can do, it still means that you know the law a particular organisation is operating in. If you are an administrator in the European Union and involved in negotiations about trade regulations, or environmental policies, it is quite helpful to know the law that exists in these fields -- or rather, be able to look it up quickly and understand what you're reading. 

I do not directly have any statistics on whether or not an LL.M. in International Law would be better employability-wise than for example an M.A. in International Relations, but I can definitely imagine that knowledge of the relevant law -- or at least the paradigms governing it -- helps you more in navigating within the day-to-day context of an international organisation than being an expert on social constructivist thought, or the intricacies of Marxist international political economic thought (what a mouthful).

I can also understand where you feel the current system can be criticised. I just don't like the idea that people can be thought of ""lazy"" as a whole, or that blame can truly be laid on the individual. It's true some people are dicks, but most are just people.

The idea of European culture being superior is and was very prevalent, especially during the days imperialist Britain. I'm not an expert on this, but I think as far as attempting to force your culture on others, that represents the peak of efforts ever placed by one country in completely replacing other cultures with their own. It wasn't entirely unsuccessful, but that was achieved more by immigration than by changing people. What it did do was create massive divides and friction, and in the areas you would regard as successful, they brought wealth, which I'll talk about soon. The short of it is, imperialism didn't really work, and cultural superiority was a pretty terrible assumption to make about human nature. People have the capacity to be good no matter the culture. You spoke of grants as if it was degrading, but what is more degrading, giving people money for their race, or telling them their way of life is inferior and forcing them to change with the idea that this will somehow bring them out of poverty? 

We can agree some cultures in the past WERE bad, but that doesn't mean European culture is the only way to form a peaceful society. There are harmful aspects, sure, but most are simply about language, food and social expectations. The trouble is it's impossible to look at a culture and determine that it's the cause of economic issues. Given that, who are we to say to other people that no their culture is not appropriate? It really does seem to be the case that nothing makes European culture truly superior. It's just a different way of living your life.

Also, imperialism offers no explanation for how European culture arose in the first place. Are they inherently smarter? I'd severely doubt it. It seems like the growth of wealth and development of society encouraged peaceful (I use this word reaaaaaalllly loosely here, considering imperialism was not all that peaceful) culture, not the other way around. People like to use the same cultural idea to explain why democracy occurs less in the Middle East, but a real connection has yet to be found. Egypt, despite its history, rates democracy higher on average than any other country in the world.



All this is to say, lots of people like to latch onto the culture explanation because it's both intuitive and easy, but interestingly, neither statistics nor history really attest to this. That's why it's become far less acceptable to criticise a whole group and/or their culture, not out of stupidity, but rather out of past mistakes and misunderstandings.

&gt;I'm not an expert, nor do I pretend to be, but it doesn't look to me like anything much is getting solved.

I'm glad you brought this up, because politics and life in general are very much focused on the near future. The thing is shifts of wealth take time, likely longer than the lifespan of human beings. That's why you see so little change, because you aren't going to level out a racial division in a few decades.

&gt;I'm just saying that the time is ripe to stop blaming the white man for all the woes that black people suffer. I'm not gonna pretend that racism is not a thing, it has and always will be among humans (and for the record, minorities tend to be racist too), I just think that actually taking responsibility for the actions of your fellows is a good first step in becoming masters of your own destiny.

Anyone could be racist. Perception and education play a big part in it, but there are dicks everywhere. That's kinda what I was getting at about not blaming someone's race for things. You're right about needing the people with the problems taking responsibility and doing something about it. That is something else I was trying to illustrate: it's hard to take the initiative when you don't perceive an initiative to be taken or don't have the resources to do anything with it. That's why I think we need education, and as much of it as possible to anyone that needs it.

&gt;No, race (and this shit really needs a better name, it feels weird saying race) is an integral part of a person, I just want people to acknowledge the fact that everyone's shit smells, that white people didn't invent slavery, that not all the world's ills are the white man's fault and for people to actually take a responsible stance and call out the cretins in their midst when they step out of line.

You mean white-guilt, right? I see what you're getting out, but for me it's not about that at all. I'm primarily descended from the English, and I feel absolutely no guilt or fault, but I am happy to aid those who were wronged by the circumstances of colonialism. This is New Zealand, where people weren't made slaves because of their race. I think the ""white man"" idea is just as bad, because it's encouraging the exact same division we want to remove. It's not about that, it's about society now regardless of race, returning everyone to at least some kind of an even footing. Along those lines, it's not the white man doing everything to fix it, it's people working together to fix it: in my country both Maori and Pakeha pay tax that goes in huge part to welfare. People of their own race who are better off are doing as much to fix the issue as they are able, it's the people without the wealth or education that can't do as much. Racism is a pretty bad tear in society, and if economic issues are brought to an even level, crime will fall, perceptions will change, and we can finally get past people being pre-judged because of their race. I won't live to see it though, and nor will you.

&gt;They approach minorities (and women) like they are inept children unable to think for themselves and take responsibility. It's never their fault, it's always some external force (the man or the patriarchy etc.). This sort of behavior is not beneficial to anyone. All it does is teach said group that they need not take (even partial) responsibility for any of their actions.

I don't know how you conclude that that's how everyone does it, I don't know what situations you've seen or experienced, but it does touch on something I wanted to mention: perception. I hear it in debate all the time: X is bad because I see Y all the time. What you see on the ground level is never a good indication of what is happening on the whole. The reality is that it is getting better, it's just hard to see. Statistics often paint a different picture. That's the reason I often refrain from having opinions on political issues, because it's so hard to base your opinion on anything other than your own flawed perception, which is all too often wrong. Along those lines, I don't expect to convince anyone in one big post, I just hope to offer doubt in what they perceive, it's like the gaslight of kindness.

&gt;I come across as hostile and rude, I'm aware of that. I don't make excuses for my behavior, nor do I demand that of anyone. One of the cardinal rules of the internet is to develop a thick skin since anonymity and a general lack of serious consequences will result in people lowering their inhibitions.

I agree with you in part, but the only issue is that it can invoke anger, which pretty much makes it impossible to actually convince anyone of anything, rendering the conversation useless. I'd rather take 30 minutes and write a good response, if it means one person will listen and hopefully change their mind. I'm not always a saint either, and if one party says something you interpret as hostile, it's easy to slip in the mode where you're trying to shame them, not convince them.

That is why the EU, and your own country, considers Tymoshenko a political prisoner and why the EU made the release of Tymoshenko into one of the major points in the association agreement with Ukraine. For Yanukovitch keeping Tymoshenko in jail is important since that means she cannot run in the 2015 elections, where she would probably have a good chance of ousting him.

The basis for why the EU considers Tymoshenko a political prisoner is the report filed by the Danish Helsinki Committee. You can read it here: http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1321398054

Here's a brief summation:

&gt; Considering that the present administration has been under considerable pressure to decriminalize the articles on economic crime which are the basis for most of the pending cases against politicians from the former government, including the sentence of 11.10.2011 against Mrs.Tymoshenko, opening a new investigation and reopening old ones for violation of other articles against an inconvenient opposition politician is remarkable.

I think that there are two roads for the reps: either stay religiously focused and embrace the minorities (minorities are usually more religious than whites and the trend is continuing) or abandon the religious rhetoric and indeed, focus on whites, especially on female electorate. 

This is however a choice that I fear the current direction will never have the courage to make, preferring to focus on the dwindling white, male and religious electorate.

Sagen er, at det kun er de centralorganiserede fagforeninger, der kan sørge ordentligt for dette. Jeg har skrevet lidt om problemet med de gule fagforeninger før [her](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/1rip01/regeringen_indg%C3%A5r_finanslov_med_vk/cdohkuj):

&gt; Først og fremmest er de ikke fagforeninger i egentlig forstand, men mere forsikringskasser. De har frasagt sig strejkeretten og har således intet at forhandle med overfor arbejdsgiveren. Arbejdere, der arbejder på en gul overenskomst, er derfor helt underlagt arbejdsgiverens nåde og generøsitet. 

&gt; Af samme årsag har det også vist sig, at gule overenskomster er værre end dem, der bliver indgået af reelle fagforeninger [Kilde](http://www.business.dk/arbejdsmarked/gul-overenskomst-giver-ringere-vilkaar-til-kokke-og-stuepiger). Disse overenskomster indgået mellem gule fagforeninger og arbejdsgivere er dog få. Mange medlemmer af gule fagforeninger arbejder nemlig på et område, hvor en overenskomst er blevet forhandlet på plads mellem de traditionelle fagforeninger og arbejdsgiveren. Disse overenskomster gælder for alle på det område, uanset fagforeningstilknytning. Medlemmerne af de gule snylter dermed på de resultater, som de traditionelle fagforeninger har forhandlet sig frem til. Medlemmerne af de traditionelle fagforeninger betaler oftest også mere i kontingent, hvorfor disse er fuldt berettiget til at se på gule medlemmer som freeloadere. På den måde er gule fagforeninger dybt undergravende for den danske arbejdsmarkedsmodel. Det er derfor tonen fra de traditionelle fagforeninger er så hård, når talen falder på de gule ""fagforeninger"", da de lokker lønmodtagere væk fra reelt organiserede fagforbund, der kan indgå ordentlige overenskomster med strejkeretten som våben og rent faktisk kæmper for lønmodtagernes interesser.

&gt; Ligeledes kæmper de gule heller ikke for deres medlemmers sag i arbejdsretten og bruge meget færre ressourcer på at føre sager om arbejdsskadeerstatning osv. [Kilde](http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Penge/2013/10/07/1007070240.htm) Dette er formentlig fordi det er dyre sager at føre, og de gule fagforeninger er jo egentlig forretninger med kunder og ikke fagforeninger med medlemmer.

&gt; De gule fagforeninger ønsker heller ikke, at man skal kunne konflikte mod en virksomhed, der allerede har tegnet overenskomst, som det f.eks. skete med Vejlegården. Dette støttes af V og DF, men vil i princippet føre til, at danske arbejdere skal acceptere f.eks. at arbejde under polsk overenskomst, da denne sidestilles med en dansk jf. EU-ret, uden at kunne konflikte. [Kilde](http://jyllands-posten.dk/politik/ECE4831695/v-forslag-tillader-30-kr-i-timen/) 

&gt; En sjov fact er, at KriFa i sin tid blev oprettet af personer med baggrund i Indre Mission og Tidehverv, og blev sat i verden for at bekæmpe den organiserede arbejdskraft, som de mener er skadelig for landet. [Kilde](http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/article1600375.ece) [Kilde](http://www.krifa.dk/omos/fakta/historie/stiftelse.aspx)

&gt; Med hensyn til lønnen, så lønner de ""moderne"" fagforeninger deres bosser væsentligt bedre end de traditionelle fagforeninger. 

&gt;&gt; Eksempelvis tjener direktøren i Kristelig Fagbevægelse (Krifa), Jesper Wengel, 1,67 millioner kroner om året.

&gt;&gt; Det er næsten det dobbelte af, hvad formanden for Danmarks største fagforbund, 3F, formand Poul Erik Skov Christensen, får.

So on a level 3 Ninja or Rogue for example, with Weapon Finesse &amp; two weapon fighting, a Dex of 18 you could attack with both weapons at at +4/+4/+4/+4, each attack would deal 1d4+2d6, assuming the target was denied dex/being flanked/non undead/plant/construct, and assuming a Str of 10.  
  
Now, for the acrobatic stuff, jump and tumble are class skills, and there are skill tricks in complete scoundrel that allow you to spend skill points (which you have tons of) in order to do stuff like make a 90 degree turn in a charge, tumble through opponent's squares to render them flat footed (and sneak attackable) and climbing up walls etc...  
  
So with that sort of build you'd be doing lots of attacks which actually do something thanks to sneak attack and have lots of acrobatic mobility. Which to me is very Voldo.  
The Crescent Knife even [looks like a Voldo weapon](http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s216/phyreblade_blog/Weapons/Black%20Ronin%20Ninja%20Ring/BlackRoninNinjaRing_540.jpg).  
  
It might even be worth a dip in Barbarian for [Whirling Frenzy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/classFeatureVariants.htm) for extra attacks and damage.  
  
I'd personally also look at becoming a [Dervish](http://dndtools.eu/classes/dervish/) but it has a ton of stupid feat requirements. (Thousand Cuts with BaB 16 and Whirling Frenzy = 10 attacks, which is 20 with Crescent Blade, 20 attacks is hilarious... especially considering they all have great cleave.

It's debatable whether the fiscal aid had much of an impact in the subsequent massive economic expansion in Western Europe, but it certainly left a political impact--bringing some stability to the countries, limiting the support of their local Communist parties, and eventually fostering a togetherness that eventually led to the European Union. 

On the Eastern side of the equation, the Soviets forced the countries under their influence to reject American aid, and most of their own plans were to drain resources out of the puppet countries rather than pump it back in.

so lets say you want to have an icbm that can go from somewhere in usa to somewhere in europe.

first thing you'd do is, launch atleast 3 rockets (preferably 6) or more with gps satellites within them and have them deployed at a certain altitude above the earth. 

After deployment you will have to ""configure"" the satellites which is an incredible feat on it's own once, mainly because sending and receiving data is not the same as we'd experience on the surface.. there is Einstein's theory of relativity involved and you're algorithms running the gps will have to account for that **correctly**, then you'd have to ""configure"" the communication between receiver and gps satellites (you're receiver would need to talk to atleast 3 satellites at the same time ... (and when i say same time, i mean same time .. even a nanosecond of lag will have to accounted for). and once you have done all this, you're gps system is ready :)

But you're not done yet. You'd also need to think about protecting your satellites from solar flares, solar winds, earth's magnetic field's change, meteorites, space dust in general, other satellites ... as well as what you'd do in case your enemy shot your gps satellites down ... and if you're enemy tried to use your own gps against you.

There is an incredible amount of planning, thought and planning and co-ordination that goes in building you're own gps system. 

icbm is much simpler to do. it still is very difficult of course but it's not even in the same league of difficulty as deploying your very own GPS system.

you could build a sub-orbital capable rocket in your backyard and launch it, ask john carmack if you don't believe me. and if you succeed you're more than half way there and you're only left with implementing the reentry maneuvering and navigation capability ... which unfortunately requires your gps to tell you where the thing is, so that you can control and hit the target precisely. 

if you don't want reentry navigation, because you're sure of your calculations at the start time, then you can simply slap a nuke on top of your rocket and you're icbm is ready.

Germany: Aside from Berlin (Northern Germany) there is virtually no one talking about it in the far wealthier South, even during Cyprus, the whole 'where would they be if they saved or paid their taxes' occurred; there is a small minority in agriculture that have taken an interest when I spoke about it, but it is seldom followed up on. Hardly anyone I ever spoke to have asked for greater details.

They seem interested in crowdfunding, so perhaps this can segue into that with the adoption if bitcoin by a few of the crowdfunding guys.

Italy: Too many other problems encumber any real growth: Berlusconi's circus keep the eyes fixed in the older and often more affluent levels, while the youth are fleeing the country to find employment elsewhere, so it seems that little to no disposable income can be sourced for investment.

Croatia: Prior to entering the EU many came out in support of maintaining their sovereignty as a young nation, still tattered by the war with Serbia, some are receptive to what bitcoin can offer. But just as in Italy very few have any real disposable income, a majority of the population live hand to mouth, and seldom have work outside the peak tourist months. Many are fleeing the country to Sweden or any where else.

Despite that I think I heard of an exchange setup in Zagreb and some guys are listed on localbitcoins with reviews, they are asking absurd premiums (even above gox!) with relatively high minimum purchases, this sadly has left many unable to enter, should they even have the slightest amount of curiosity. 

The few that have heard it are only repeating the tired soundbites given to them by TV and the radio: Dread and silkroad being the way to get people 'whacked' and getting drugs online. 

Oh, and a villa or 2 in Dalmatia take bitcoin, so like I said they are ready for adoption; they just need to be convinced it is in their interest. 

Switzerland: Perhaps the most affluent nation in Europe per capita, the truth is things are very slow there; but the youth are eager to learn and are capable of taking greater risks due to higher salaries they earn, but living expenses being what they are, it is still relatively difficult. The older crowds are not even remotely interested, they live in relative 'opulence' in comparison to the rest of the crumbling EU so they are just 'savoring the moment,' so to speak. I don't blame them, because so many have worked so hard to get there, and after all the years of laboring they deserve to enjoy what they have earned. 

That being said, Switzerland is the country who I find most capable of making the biggest impact in Europe, and not just because of the wages and relative economic stability; but rather because their youth are going to need it in such an inverted wealth paradigm. They are deluding themselves if they think the franc and Swiss economy will not be affected by the failure of the Dollar or Euro. These two currencies represent their largest trade partners.

Most importantly, the infrastructure to use oil is already there--the refineries, drills, and gas stations needed to supply oil already exist, while a competitor would have to rebuild a competing infrastructure from scratch.  

The conspiracy theory about Big Oil suppressing the backyard inventor who figures out an engine that runs on water is about equivalent to those online advertisements for the ONE WEIRD TRICK discovered by a LOCAL MOM who DOCTORS HATE!

Generally, these are the options you have if you want a car that doesn't burn petroleum:

Natural Gas--done in Europe, in large part because the infrastructure (fueling stations) already exists, and helps make up for the lower range of natural gas vehicles (you just can't fit as much natural gas into a tank as you can gasoline).  

Biofuels like Ethanol or Vegetable Oil--you need to use oil to farm them anyway, from the tractor that runs in the field to the fertilizer that makes them grow.  It ends up being more environmentally harmful and more expensive than gasoline.  The only reason it's done in the US is to subsidize the corn farmers in a state that's important to Presidential nominations.  

Hydrogen--liquid hydrogen is even less energy-dense than natural gas.  You'd pretty much have to replace the trunk of your car with a hydrogen tank to get anywhere.  And to make this mainstream, you'd have to build a huge network of hydrogen fuel stations so that the car can actually go anywhere.  

Battery-electric: The only one that is showing progress against oil, and for good reason.  While energy density is still an issue, these make up for it by taking advantage of an existing infrastructure--an electrical grid.  You can charge up at home for a very low cost.  Problem is that battery technology has only recently advanced to where this is feasible at all--driven, in large part, by the boom in mobile electronics in the last twenty years, and an increase in gas prices in the last decade.  Companies like Tesla are doing it properly--they are building charging stations across the country to make it possible for Tesla drivers to go across the country.  This company intends to unveil a general consumer-grade electric car in 2016--the Generation III Tesla, intended to cost $30,000.  

As for why fossil fuels are the standard fuel for power plants, it's because coal and natural gas are still extremely cheap and the infrastructure exists.  Vast networks of mines, railways, gas wells, and pipelines have already been built, and there is an entire army of engineers who have worked on such power plants that can be used to make a new plant run at peak efficiency.  

Meanwhile, solar power is still in its infancy, and relatively inefficient.  Wind power and solar power both have to deal with variable loads--that is, unlike fossil or nuclear or hydroelectric plants, they don't produce a constant amount of electricity.  So you need to build an infrastructure of energy storage for renewable power to be viable.  ",True,t3_1ru84x,t3_1ru84x,1,,t1_cdqycz2,cdqycz2,False,1385913411,,1,explainlikeimfive,1428440671,[deleted]

While I think most readers can understand HoD without any problem, I find that scaffolding the material with introduction to King Leopold II and Henry Morton Stanley really benefits my students. 

Historical context to most (historically-based) novels adds a layer of understanding for the reader in terms of plot, character motivation, and the aftermath. For example, there's a layer of understanding when reading Dante's Inferno that he was exiled from his own town. Leopold II proclaimed he wanted to end slavery in the Congo and ""civilize the savages"". Leopold II then set up an international committee to organize a Congo Free state; Conrad calls this committee the International Society for Suppressing Savage Customs. It is also important to know Leopold actually never visits the Congo, but instead has ""The Company"" run it for him. 

Our unit on HoD transitions into other literature and themes that are linked to this discussion.

And it's really not about this being a conspiracy. The entire propaganda model may be overselling the point but sports is an uncontroversial, simple issue. Thus, media stations pick it up, devote airtime to something that's for all intents and purposes filler material and it happens to sell. This pretty much starts a feedback loop, with more people becoming interested in sports, resulting in more sports coverage, yada yada. 

Ultimately everyone loves sports because it draws viewers, thereby increasing ad revenue. To which extent the amount of sports coverage is directly dictated from above for nefarious, political purposes however is probably the most debatable aspect. But if I'm not mistaken, the model doesn't depend on evilness, as simple ""rational self-interest"" will lead to this situation. In any case, the result is valuable news time being dedicated to something with no cultural, political, artistic, academic or economic value, news is drowned out by entertainment. 

As a foreigner, I can't speak with any authority about American sports culture, but I guess [Stephen Fry, as always, sums up the point perfectly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cn8io3kplA&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=3303) There's a truckload of pomp and circumstance involved in sports, colors and symbols are of utmost importance and the game is structured by elaborate rituals and traditions. It ultimately creates an us-vs-them distinction. And as Noam mentioned, it starts in high school, meaning the kind of cultural life you're directly affected by as a teen is to a noticeable extent influenced by sports.

Every country has its own national sport so this is present everywhere. In Europe, soccer hooliganism is a more direct expression of the idea. Instead of just wearing the same outfit, carrying the same flag, cheering for the same team as thousands around you, you actually go out and punch someone who's cheering for the other team. In international competition this actually is jingoistic: you root for athletes from your nation for no other reason than them being from your nation. I honestly don't care how high or far some person can jump but if it means we get the medal, woohooo! 

EDIT: I probably should've lead with this, but I can't quite brain today: I totally get what you mean. Whenever Noam says something like ""The rich and privileged are deceiving the masses"" it's easy to understand it as something conspiratorial, as if they're all sitting around a large table, discussing how to be evil. But taking a look at how he defines the terms on their own, it becomes apparent that he's really saying that in a system with economic inequality and a political arena that is heavily influenced by lobbying, those with cash to buy lobbyists have a significantly easier time making ideas that benefit them be heard than anyone else.

Why do you need to ask this question, when I said:

&gt;even the most basic and objective facts presented to you quite clearly! Why don't you move the argument on by joining all sides of the political spectrum and all economists ever and conceding that yes, maybe labour is a resource?

I literally could not have been more clear and yet you are still not conceding that of course labour is a resource!

This is not the same as name calling (e.g. calling someone stupid, leftie, bigot, bleeding heart, racist etc.) as that is an attempt to discredit the argument by discrediting the person.  This is completely the wrong way round and doesn't work!  However discrediting the argument is perfectly reasonable, and if the person finds themselves discredited when their arguments are discredited, then that is just collateral damage! You discredit the argument and point out when the person is wrong, you don't try to discredit the argument by discrediting the person!  Right?

&gt;The deficit IS the interest we're paying on the debt we owe, so when it is down to 0, we'll no longer become more indebted as a country. 

No. No it isn't. The deficit is the difference between income and outgoings.  The debt is the total money we owe and the interest is the cost of servicing the debt. 

The current government has reduced the deficit. But we're still spending well over 100bn more than we're taking in each year and each year the debt is still going up as are the interest payments (it's currently nearly 1.4 trillion, next year it will be nearly 1.5 trillion) We're just increasing the national debt at a slightly slower rate! To reduce the interest payments we would have to start paying off the debt, not increasing it, which means going into surplus (take in more than we pay out) and that's not due to happen until the end if the decade at best. It's quite possible to run a surplus but still pay interest on the debt. You just have enough revenue to cover all your expenses including debt interest. To reduce interest payments to zero, you'd have to clear the whole 1.4 trillion national debt and that is never going to happen.  

&gt;To pretend that immigrants all pay their own rent, don't claim housing benefit and that we haven't got ghettos full of them is just ignorant of you, and again why people aren't happy with EU and general immigration policies. 
 
I never said all immigrants paid their own rent, just that they are less likely to claim benefits than the rest of the population and every independent economic study has found net economic gains.  They pay taxes as well. Nor did I say there were no ghettoes, just that over time they moved on, which any glance at the history of the east end will tell you. I clearly said that there were short term and localised issues but they should be understood alongside the economic benefits. I was perfectly clear but that idea seems too nuanced and diverse for you!  Stop setting up more straw men. 

&gt; I could quite happily push this agenda myself and get upvotes like you do. But I don't feel the need to try and fit in here. I'd rather there be more diversity in opinion too. You should be able to understand this. 

I'm not saying anything to fit in! Stop wildly inferring bizarre motivations. It sounds like you have an axe to grind. You're being down voted for arguing badly.  Also, while blatantly incorrect statements about deficits and resources may well increase the ""diversity of opinion"", because we have the diversity of both right and wrong statements, you probably shouldn't act too surpised when you are called out on them!

Regardless, all that is irrelevant. To indulge a kid that wants a present from Santa you don't need any bribes. The kid certainly isn't asking their parents to be bribed. In fact if you want you can even tell him it's not real, like many parents do, Christians and non-Christians. Point is none of this has much to do with religion, it certainly has nothing to do with state being secular, and it's not much of a reason to feel for Jewish parents more than any other parent.

Why do you think that Europeans were taking more profit? What evidence do we have for that claim? Also, it's hard to understand how they are taking less risk that the African slave-trading kingdoms, since Europeans had to sink a great deal of capital into ships, in addition to the items they wanted to trade. The African slave traders only needed to provide the items they wanted to trade. Can you see any other elements in which one side or the other had to work harder to make the trade happen? Other examples of investments necessary?

&gt; get all the enslaved Africans to the plantations whereas the slavers ended up having to keep selling slaves to keep their economy going.

Does one side seem more dependent on the trade than the other? I mean, the whole Atlantic economy was underpinned by African labor: no slaves, no plantations. The trade in slaves was one of several equally indispensable elements to this system. A productive question to ask here is what alternatives the Europeans and Africans each might have had.

And let's not forget to consider how the actual interactions for trade occurred: you note that the African sellers ""could demand tax revenue from Europeans."" That sounds like a pretty substantial indicator that they were dictating the terms of the trade. What else do your sources say about the actual conduct of this trade? How widespread and important were these tax revenues to the African kingdoms? Did the Europeans merchants have ways around them? How did the trade between Europeans and Africans develop over time? Did Europeans favor particular trading partners over others? ",True,t1_cdqyeln,t3_1ru32t,3,,t1_cdqzhae,cdqzhae,False,1385916851,europe,3,AskHistorians,1428440135,agentdcf

The average salary is probably a more representative quantity, the mean in Moldova being ca. $300, comparable to Ukraine and roughly half of Romania's average of $600.

In any case, I view Moldova's economic under-performance as symptomatic of more profound underlying problems. Sure Moldova may not have had the luckiest start as an independent country and its unsettled separatist conflict is certainly not great for business. Nevertheless, even with these hindrances, it is hard to deny that Moldova's poverty is due more to egregious mismanagement and absurdly widespread corruption. These are problems that cannot simply be wiped away with capital investments, but will require much more profound changes, including a change in the mentality of the people. 

I agree with you that Moldova's best chance lies is in European integration, but perhaps more in the process itself than in the outcome. Only by hanging the sword of cutting Moldova lose can the EU have sufficient leverage to force Moldovan politicians to pass critical reforms and seriously crack down on corruption.

russia (read Putin and the Russian establishment) is scared to death of Ukraine becoming more European and really living up to European values of democracy and transparency. Because if that happens, then Ukrainians will begin to see their standard of living rise and when ordinary Russians wake up one day to see Ukrainians living better than them, the Russian elite will be swept out the door.

Russians always write off higher standards of living in Poland, the Czech Republic etc as ""well, we aren't like them, we could never live that well"". Not to mention that they don't even really dream of living like people in the UK, France or Germany. 

But they really look down their noses at Ukrainians as being less than them. And it would shock Russians to see Ukrainians able to root out a lot of the overwhelming corruption currently endemic in the country. And signing the Association agreement with the EU means Ukraine's adopting a lot of laws to meet Europeans standards of free speech, property rights, the legal system (especially getting the courts to be indepedent of the executive in more than word olny), etc., etc.

I really, truly hope that people serving in governments in the West are starting to understand that. If they really want a Russia that is law-abiding, the best way to get that huge country on that path is to show them a working example in Ukraine. 

Meanwhile, the Kremlin will do everything in its power to keep that from happening. Including their very sophisticated propaganda attacks which have moved into social media in a huge way.

Sent an elite team of sgts, captains and a major to handle a council mission; the escort/rescue one with the astronomer who was studying alien flight paths. I stack up a team of three on one north-facing door and three on the other north-facing door in the first room.

Opened the door overlooking the outdoors area. Triggered Thin Men. Luckily they clumped together and, moreover, my heavy has danger zone, and he was stacked up on the other side of the door. All he has to do is shoot out the door.

Then, everything went horrible forever. It was a simple shot, just fire the thing out the door. Nope. Rocket veers *just* enough to hit the wall, where the trooper who opened the door was standing. It's not enough to kill anybody- *except the VIP*. Also, the assault sergeant, who was at ground zero of the rocket impact, who has never, ever panicked before, panics. And shoots the heavy with his scatter laser, killing the heavy. 

I can't really blame him.

Of course, with their cover blown away, the assault sgt and his other teammate were exposed to the Thin Men, who proceeded to pick them apart, almost casually, with their light plasma I barely got the other 3 man team out, 2 wounded, one gravely. 

Anyway, so failing a counsel mission raises panic. Which caused me to lose France. Also, with 4 days until the Council Report, a Terror mission pops. I have no veterans to handle it; the squaddies I sent out got murdered by Chrysallids and panic further escalates. I lost all of Europe.

0,0,1385918769,t5_2qh5b,0,,"&gt;Well, to be fair, the same might be said about people. People don't always know what we want. Some people who make suicide threats don't actually wish to die. Some have the temperament to be miserable their entire life, no matter what environment they're in. Some end up trapped by circumstances and depression from the learned-helplessness, and they give up.

This is correct.  Most people don't even know themselves and what they themselves really want.  And, even more so, they know infinitely less about any other human/creature or what that human/creature really is or wants.  Consequently, none of us can be dogmatic about any of these questions.  We simply do not know and cannot possibly know.  It's just a matter of pure speculation.  So, based on your comment, I think that we agree here.  

&gt;I'd argue that it depends on the purpose of the confinement. If you're putting a fence around a huge field to protect your horses from wandering out onto the busy highway and being killed by cars, the confinement is being done FOR their best interests.  If you're taking a baby cow away from his mother at birth, locking it in a crate so small he can't turn around, denying him exercise or grass, that confinement is done FOR human reasons of greed or convenience.
In the general context of meat animal production, their confinement always done being done FOR profits, convenience, lower labor costs -- anything but what the animal naturally needs.

From the cow's purely subjective viewpoint, the subjective viewpoint of others can't possibly matter.  If you murder me, I myself don't care if you've done so because you don't like the way I look, don't like my politics, or whatever.  You've just murdered me.  I'm just dead.  Your subjective reasons are totally irrelevant to me, and, as a practical non-political matter, shouldn't matter to anyone else.  So, I think from an animal's perspective, the reasons you treat it well or poorly are quite irrelevant. It just feel positive or negative treatment.  It's not going to debate you about the underlying rationale.  

And, in any event and most importantly, the subjective reasons for the human's behavior says absolutely nothing to anyone about whether the animal would prefer to live/exist -- in the given conditions -- or not.  So, I think that your point here is both mistaken and irrelevant.  

&gt;Add to this that states are now trying to pass ""ag gag"" laws making it a crime to document a livestock producer breaking the law. I don't know any other industry where the whistleblower who reports a violation is charged with a crime. Whatever happened to our freedom of speech?

See the Obama Administration for charging whistleblowers -- and even the reporting journalists -- with crimes and denying freedom of speech in a thousand different ways.  

As for your other points here, the California laws related to factory farming just recently passed, so I suspect you didn't see the full impact because the full impact hasn't yet been fully seen.  Also, I think that the standards do vary on a global scale.  Chinese livestock are treated far worse than US and Western European livestock, for example.  There are federal and state standards, but each owner has its own systems.  For example, at higher-end premium grocery stores, you can get much more expensive beef, but beef that has (allegedly?) been raised more humanely.  Same for pork, poultry, fish, and eggs.  Even if it's not ideal, it's still a wide variation in treatment.  

And, finally, we still come down the the unknown question of whether the animals prefer their life/existence conditions -- whatever they are -- over non-existence.  This is a question that no person can answer dogmatically, so I'm not claiming to do so.  But, at a minimum, the necessary uncertainty here warrants a complete suspension of judgment or, for the more aggressive debaters, at least a very modest and admittedly uncertain opinion, as opposed to anything resembling dogmatic, vehement, and hostile certainty.  

&gt;Would a human be as happy to have lived if he was born a slave, forced to do hard labor every day of his life in dark mines, forcibly made to have sex when he/she didn't want to so that the owner could get more ""stock"", kept in very tight confinement, deprived of mobility and privacy. If you woke up in terribly pain from being overworked daily, you had zero chance of escape, and you were repeatedly raped (and then the child taken away), some people might wish they were never born.

So, we have thousands of years of experience here observing the worst and most barbaric aspects of humanity.  Tragically, humans have been enslaving each other all over the world since the beginning of time, including in the very same conditions you've described.  What seems clear is that slaves rarely actually killed themselves, and today's slave descendants must certainly be happy that their ancestors persevered through the most unspeakable horrors.  So, even for humans, it's very difficult to say that all, most, or even a significant minority would have preferred non-existence to existence in these horrific conditions.  It probably varies, but it's impossible to say, specify, or estimate with certainty.  And, it must be nearly certain that descendants from slaves all over this world prefer their own existence -- which necessarily implies horrific living conditions for their ancestors -- to non-existence for their ancestors and for themselves.  So, I think, we can only conclude with certainty that we can't conclude anything with certainty.  For some, all, or most animals, existence in terrible conditions is preferable to non-existence.  Or not.  We just don't know.  Therefore, it seems most wise and rational to suspend all judgment here and to maybe try to improve farming/ranching conditions in whatever ways are possible.  Or, even better, buy the more expensive meat that at least claims to treat the animals better. 

&gt;You raise some very good points. I had not thought about confinement in the context of loved animals (pets). It's good food for thought.

We confine our children even more rigorously than we confine our pets, but we just dress their confinement up with fancy words.  

Anyway, thanks for the compliment. You also raise some very good points.  I appreciate the discussion very much.  And thanks for the documentary link.  I'll watch it, and I'm quite certain that I'll find the animal conditions appalling to me -- particularly because I don't believe that animals are any less valuable than humans.  The real tragedy here is that humans evolved to eat meat and that many animals evolved to eat other animals and even plants.  Too bad that we all can't just get sufficient energy from air.  But the entire universe is just one single gigantic recycling machine.  Energy is never created or destroyed, but just eternally takes different forms, so, in that sense at least, nothing ever really dies, but just changes form.

England accounts for 82% of MPs (with Scotland 9%, Wales 6% and NI 3%). As of the 2011 census, that makes England slightly under-represented, the others over-represented - Wales by the most; it ""should"" have 31 seats.

This suggests that England doesn't have the same sort of ""minority representation"" problem that the other regions might. An English Parliament should be making similar decisions to a UK Parliament. Whereas a Scottish Parliament or Welsh, NI, London Assembly could return very different results due to smaller variations in voting intention having much more significant outcomes.

A better solution, as suggested elsewhere in this thread, would be having regional assemblies within England (similar to the 4 devolved ones); perhaps based on the EU constituencies. But there isn't the same kind of regional identity (or political/public will) to pull that off. Arguably that level of administration, combined with the EU, could eventually remove the need for a full-time UK Parliament; but that's not going to happen any time soon.

------------

As an English person (not in London), the West Lothian question doesn't bother me that much - at least partly because I seem to be closer politically to the average Scot or Welsh voter than English one. Representatives are always going to end up voting on things that affect their constituencies less than others; for example Police and Crime Commissioners (which don't cover all of England) or HS2 (which doesn't really affect those in other parts of the country). It's part of having a representative democracy.

They're not doing it because they want less rights but MORE! As in we won't allow you to be deported unless we see the evidence first and you get to address it in this country. Innocent UK people have spent months upon months in foreign rotting jail cells without being charged!

I'm not sure what you're saying here. Are you saying that you're against the ECHR is bad because it takes away the rights of British people?

Because if so, you **literally** have it backwards. The ECHR gives British people explicit rights that we didn't have before. 

If I may quote [Yarg](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1k239g/cameron_we_need_to_look_at_scrapping_the_human/cbkmj03) for a moment:

&gt;The European Convention of Human Rights is so named because it sets down a series of minimal requirements that European states have agreed to be necessary for a fair and democratic society. Each of the specific rights it sets down is extremely reasonable and difficult to dispute.

&gt;Here are some of the rights infringements that the ECHR has prevented in the UK:-

&gt; * Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
&gt; * Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
&gt; * You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
&gt; * It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK) (Although it would appear not nearly enough...)
&gt; * You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
&gt; * The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
&gt; * Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
&gt; * The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
&gt; * Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
&gt; * Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
&gt; * Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)
&gt; * Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).
&gt; * Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)
&gt; * If you're arrested and acquitted, the government cannot arbitrarily hold onto your DNA, which could never have been obtained were you not wrongly accused (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

&gt;The crucial thing to bear in mind here is that in every single instance the government claimed their behaviour was justified and defended its illegality. If we merely had a domestic Bill of Rights, there would be no external check to prevent it being modified whenever it inconveniences the government.  

&gt;As for the two main 'case studies' against the ECHR:-

&gt;1. The prisoner voting right has been hugely overblown by politicians. The ECHR simply requires proportionality, and no blanket policies - that is, there must be a possibility of certain prisoners voting (e.g. if you're in prison for 2 weeks on a petty offence, you shouldn't be denied the right to vote).

&gt;2. The Abu Qatada issue is incredibly sketchy. It only became an issue because the government was unable to scrape together enough evidence to convict him under our very broad limitations to freedom of speech, even though he would seem to fall within them.

0,0,1385922262,t5_2qhqb,0,,"I disagree on the point that being in the EU would make up for the competitiveness (and the size/geographical/infrastructural etc.) advantages that the rUK would have. If anything, being in the EU could constrain the competitiveness of Scotland - as EU red tape will make it far harder for an independent Scotland to aggressively undercut the rUK in important markets. This is even more true at the moment as the EU is pushing for greater economic cohesion particularly amongst smaller higher-risk member states (Greece, Ireland and Portugal being prime examples). 

I do agree with you that both nations would get by - but my point being that I think the Scots might actually find they emerge from independence feeling somewhat bruised and asset stripped by hard-line negotiations over the settlement, and the comparatively weak nature of their own bargaining position. Then on-top of that, far from being economically 'set free' they suddenly find key industries under economic assault from south of the border as companies rush to snap up contracts and business that normally would have gone north. In the long term the Scots may be able to re-orientate their economy to exploit that difference, but at the outset the Scots will not have the capability in many key industries to exploit the full economic advantages that independence could allow. I think the time frame for that would be more like &gt;30-50+ years down the road as a minimum.

Here's one very small example - the call centers for a lot of English country councils are actually outsourced to Scotland... but its likely that post-independence people wouldn't accept government functions being outsourced to companies operating under the legislation of a foreign power. So there will be a move to get services like that back into the rUK. The UK has massive capacity to take semi-skilled office jobs like that back overnight. In contrast, for Scotland to build up a world leading shipbuilding industry, or become a global financial center is going to take decades of focused investment and competitive planning.

So the main point is that although there may be long term economic benefits for the Scots, the assumption in voters minds (as I see it) should be that independence could, and in all likelihood will, bring with it a period of economic hardship in the short term. Precisely how severe that could be is debatable - my gut instinct is it wouldn't be drastic, but that average Scots would feel the pinch - from increased redundancies and unemployment to reduced state services.",True,t1_cdqzx15,t3_1ru5vp,6,,t1_cdr1gzg,cdr1gzg,False,1385921996,,6,unitedkingdom,1428439206,Kesuke

Its basically a full time job on top of my full time job, not to mention the several thousand dollars I've spent on vetrinary care as well. I just want to live my life and pursue my goals but I have these animals, whom I do love dearly, that require my constant care.

I can't find homes for them cause they are all grown. I don't want to give them to a shelter cause not only will it split up their social group, they would likely be killed or possibly placed in bad homes.

I'm not saying I don't love these animals, cuz I do, and I take amazing care of them and end up spending more money on them than I get to myself, I just feel overwhelmed by it, getting off work everyday and having to spend two hours cleaning my house before I get to even consider my interests.

I'd like to go back to school or go to europe for a few years, but I can't when I have seven cats that rely upon me to make sure they are taken care of every day. I have put my dreams on the back burner to tend these animals, and they deserve a good life so I'm not resentful for that, but I just don't know what else to do, other than what I've already been doing.

The Japanese people were fiercely loyal to the emperor, and that loyalty was passed down to generations in the US. Not all of them held this loyalty, but certainly enough to pose a threat. There is a book called 'The No No Boys' which covers this indirectly. It is about men if draft age in Japanese internment camps who were given the choice of jail time or fighting in the European theater. But in the book it discusses many of the Japanese in the internment camps insisting that the US must have lost the war and that the emperor prevailed.

See an article on it here: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/25/cooler_past_for_british_men/

Quote from article: ""A previous study had found the set spreading from east to west, which, coupled with other indicators, led to the conclusion that British men had likely descended from farmers migrating from around modern-day Turkey. The Oxford/Edinburgh study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society, did not find this pattern in its larger dataset. ""Our work overturns the recent claims of European Y chromosomes being brought into the continent by farmers,"" Dr Cristian Capelli, the Oxford geneticist who led the research, said.""

So, yeah, I'm well aware of the movement to re-frame R1b as ""neolithic"". But that conclusion was based on flawed methodolgy and small sample sizes. Larger studies overturned it and went back to the claim that r1b is the paleolithic haplogroup of hunter-gatherer Europe.

...As for Otzi, the Iceman, he brings up an interesting point. According to geneticists (though he was found in Austria) his closest living descendants are Sardinians. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:I_Distribution.jpg

Sardinians are interesting because they're an ancient Iberian population. As I said in another comment, geneticists usually say that Sardinians are Iberians (minus the Northern infusions that Spain got in the neolithic period). So Sardinians are like paleo-Europids trapped in amber.

And Otzi was one of them. Meaning [circumstantially] that the people we associate with Iberians and hunter-gatherers were originally distributed farther east into what is now Southern Germany and Austria.

Otzi himself was on the cusp of Austria and Northern Italy. (According to T.H. Huxley, the Basque language is attested as far southwest as Sicily.)

It's a country that's larger than some continents and has a collective population of nearly 1/3 of a billion.  When you are comparing them to Switzerland, which has a population of only 8 million and only slightly larger than Maryland, scale very much comes into play.

To put things in closer context, one needs to compare states or regions, instead of the entire country.  For example, I live in Oregon, where we have VERY lax gun laws.  It's land area is actually bigger than Great Britain, and we have a population of only just over 4 million.  1 out of every 16 Oregonians has a concealed carry permit, and 39.8% of the population owns a gun (a higher ownership rate than Texas).  Yet we have the 16th lowest gun death rate and the 12th lowest gun crime rate in the US.  Our gun murder rate is 0.9 out of every 100,000, and our overall murder rate is 2.0 out of every 100,000.  That's a much lower rate than the rest of the US, and is on par with European countries like Finland, Belgium, and the Czech Republic.

On the other hand, you have places like Maryland, which has a much lower gun ownership rate (21.3%) and more restrictive gun laws, yet has a much higher gun murder rate (5.1 out of every 100,000) and overall murder rate (7.3 out of every 100,000).  That's the same murder rate as Pakistan.

It rarely gets past the 80s or 90s. We are known to have the coldest beach of the west coast (but half moon bay is a nice place to watch surfers when the season comes around). 

2.) This is probably as multicultural as you can get without witnessing the ""melting pot effect"" that a lot of ethnicities have to experience in the east coast cities. Giant asian community here, and the Korean community is very accepting. 

3.) This is a left-wing borderline socialist atheist pinko loving town. You'll fit in great, especially with your art (I suggest mission street, panhandle, richmond, noe valley, etc.). 

4.) Downtown is dirty and some parts of the mission. But the city as a whole I cannot say is dirty. You can find some peaceful gems out here where this question kind of fades away. 

5.) Mission, Panhandle, Noe Valley, Richmond, SoMa (techies live there), North Beach, Pacific Heights for starters. 

6.) Padhunter.com; if you want to be around people and be social while not breaking the bank, i suggest finding a roommate. 

7.) Jobs vary. Obviously if you are an engineer of some sort it is booming, but the overall unemployment rate is 5.3% (the lowest in California) so I don't this it will be too difficult for you to find something. 

8.) San Francisco I one of the only places I seen a african american speak Russian to a Chinese woman. Yes, races interact a lot here. You can become part of a racial conclave though, so be careful. San Francisco is one of the few places where interracial mingling is not only okay, but accepted as a norm. We have naked people protesting in city hall, and many other wacky norms; we have far past the racial thing that other cities are just getting over. 

9.) NO SWIMMING UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SICK (TOO COLD). The beaches you have to dress up like you are going skiing sometimes. There are bonfires here and there, but only on hot days, or nice days (before sunset) can you really enjoy the beaches. 

10.) Whites make up 54% of the population, with asians making 34% (largest minority in SF). Then the Hispanics and African Americans. 

11.) You will absolutely love the access we have to camping and mountains here in SF. Great hiking trails are only an hour a way, and Yosemite is known to be our camping playground. Lake Tahoe is a 2.5 hours away and we alway have wine country. 

12.) I have not been in Toronto, but I have heard it on the News (sorry about your mayor :-/). SF has been compared to be like a European city, but liberal in its own way and culture. We instill a lot of big picture dreams and ideals, and we are extremely accepting. This is probably the number 1 value of SF. I am an SF native that moved to the east coast for 5 years, then came back. I hope this helps! PM me if you need more info!

**EDIT: Thanks for Gold! First time!**

**What’s going on?**

Between 100,000 and 500,000 people gathered in Kiev on Sunday, with most congregating in Independence Square. Opposition leaders have called for massive protests and a general strike to challenge Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision not to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union. Until late November, President Viktor Yanukovych had said he intended to sign a pact with Europe, but backed out after pressure from Moscow. He also refused to allow opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to leave prison for medical care in Germany - a key European demand. 

The police, specifically the Berkut troops, have been blamed for a heavy handed response to the protests. [Many videos show them beating lone, non-violent people, and destroying their phones and recording devices.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWNdeRtBmWA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m30s) (The scene at around the 4:20s mark is particularly horrifying.)  The Berkut have also been observed [attacking journalists and destroying their equipment.](http://youtu.be/zBWqawm81Fo) For reference, [here is list of Ukrainian &amp; foreign journalists attacked by police while covering the protest.](https://www.facebook.com/notes/olya-shumylo-tapiola/attacked-media-in-ukraine-euromaidan/10153566814680374)

Though the temperature was reported around 4 celsius on Sunday evening, there are still thousands of protesters in Independence Square and many are camping out and choosing to occupy it. [People have built barricades and many are draped with Ukrainian flags.](http://rt.com/files/news/21/56/40/00/kiev-3.jpg) The mood remains festive. Large protests, rallies, and general strikes are occurring in Western Ukraine where the opposition parties poll very favorably. Rallies have also been occurring at much smaller scale in and around the city of Donetsk in the East.

*Live stream of events* [here](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/aronets) (Svoboda Party public relations) *and* [here.](http://hromadske.tv/)



**A Few Things to Understand...**


**There are several major political parties in Ukraine.** (**Party name** - *percentage of votes in legislature*)

* **The Party of Regions** - *46.6%* - The party in power right now and the party of President Viktor Yanukovych. The party itself is led by Mykola Azarov, who is also the Prime Minister. The party is for regionalism, and is pro-Russia.
* **Fatherland (Batkivshchyna)** - *20.9%* - Opposition party. Led by Yulia Tymoshenko, whose prison status is a sticking point for EU negotiators. Pro-European, populist, a little on the right.

* **UDAR** - *9.5%* - Opposition party. Led by Vitali Klitschko. Pro-European, anti-corruption, a little on the right.

* **Freedom (Svoboda)** - *8.1%* - Oppositon party. Led by Oleh Tyahnybok. Nationalist, populist, far-right.

* **Communist** - *7.1%* - Opposition party. Led by Petro Symonenko. Far-left.

**Public Opinion**

* Though the protests are large, most polls show [the Ukrainian people are split rather evenly between what they would prefer.](http://russialist.org/topics/ukraine/) Half support the Association Agreement with the EU and the other half support Eurasian Customs Union with Russia. The situation can be best described as [very complicated.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%94%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80_2010_%D0%BF%D0%BE_%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%85-en.png)

**Police**
  
* The Police Force being used on the streets belong to the **Berkut**. It’s an on the ground auxiliary police/paramilitary. They are similar to OMON in Russia and follow orders from central authorities, not local ones. Here are two interesting pieces by NYU's Mark Galeotti about the Berkut: [This explains who who they are and what their duties and tactics include](http://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/berkut-yanukovichs-stormtroopers/) and [this one is about their known numbers in and around Kiev.](http://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/security-forces-in-and-close-to-kiev-a-preliminary-tally/)

**Major Events of Monday December 2nd**

* [Prime Minister Mykola Azarov fears the opposition may attempt to use the events to stage a parliamentary coup.](http://www.rferl.org/content/demonstrations-kyiv/25186622.html)

* President Viktor Yanukovych is still on schedule to be in Russia this week to discuss the Eurasian Customs Union with the Russian leadership. [Russia has preemptively offered natural gas to Ukraine and a significantly reduced rate.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-01/russia-lures-ukraine-with-cheaper-gas-to-join-moscow-led-pact.html)

* Prime Minister Azarov has agreed to a Ukrainian delegation's visit to European Commission to further discuss an Association Agreement, [says Interfax-Ukraine / Kyiv Post.](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yanukovych-barroso-agree-on-ukrainian-delegations-visit-to-european-commission-to-discuss-association-agreement-332844.html) Head of European Commission, Jose Barroso, has explained that the door is still open to Ukraine, but they will not alter the initial association deal previously agreed upon 

* The Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovich, and his government are ready for talks with the protesters in Kiev, the country’s prime minister, Nikolay Azarov, said at a meeting with foreign ambassadors.  He also urged the ambassadors from the EU states do everything in their power to persuade the opposition leaders to sit down at the negotiating table.

* [Several government administrative buildings remain occupied.](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/131202/kyiv-protesters-eu-deal-yanukovych-independence-square) These include the city's central admin building and the Kiev Trade Union Hall. [Picture taken inside the city's main admin building around 12:00PM EST.](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=606371182759075&amp;set=a.103647476364784.5197.100001585953356&amp;type=1)

* [Roadblocks set up overnight successfully disrupted traffic and movement of government cabinet members.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcN0bY4t1uc) 

* Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said that Kyiv's police chief, Valeriy Koryak, has been fired for the violent dispersal of protesters on November 30. ""After the events of Friday and Saturday, the police chief was dismissed,"" he said. [RFE/RL](http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25187527.html) In addition, law enforcement officers “went too far” when they dispersed the pro-EU rally in Kiev at the weekend, but such harsh actions could’ve well been provoked by the protesters, the press-service of the Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovich, said.

* Russian President Vladimir Putin, [has told RIA Novosti](http://lenta.ru/news/2013/12/02/putin/) that events in Ukraine ""don't resemble a revolution, but a pogrom."" ""In my opinion, it has very little to do with Ukraine's connection to the European Union."" 

**Major Events of Sunday December 1st**

* [A front end loader attempted to ram a police line at the Presidential Palace.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US4MaCl7XUg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=) Vitali Klitschko, head of the opposition Udar party, and others, have claimed that those attempting to storm the presidential building were provocateurs. They have called on protesters to remain peaceful and have warned about other groups infiltrating their movement to provoke violence. 

* [There have been reports of tanks loaded on trains heading towards Kiev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1pW2lMVqDk). This is not confirmed, seems unlikely and sensationalist. Jon Chicky (A Eurasian security specialist) has since Tweeted: ""These are 2S1 122mm self propelled howitzers and some BTRs &amp; MTLBu personnel carriers.

Possibly a few radical politicians join the veterans but it's definitely not ""the government"". What many people don't understand is that for Eastern Europeans, the USSR is just as evil as the Nazi Germany. In some cases the soviets killed and deported more people than the nazis. But they also had their own citizens (most of the time forcibly) drafted and fighting for both sides, depending on who was occupying the country at the time. So they let the veterans from both armies hold their little walks.

I also live(d) in a country that has quite recently joined the EU - Lithuania. And the progress has been immense. Yes, there's still corruption but it's definitely been reduced through various EU measures and regulations; plus that's always and internal issue and EU can't do too much about it. There's insane corruption in the U.S., except it's legalized and called lobbyism. And there's not even a shred of decency in the Russian government. So I would say Eastern Europe is doing quite well in comparison.

He links to an article called ""Sardinian R-M269 casts doubt on its Neolithic arrival into Europe"" and writes:

*I had previously posted on a paper which proposed a Neolithic origin of European R1b1b2 (R-M269) chromosomes. In my criticism for that paper I noted that:*

*Equally flawed is the inference that R1b1b2 is clinal (Figure 2A). Microsatellite variance is not significantly higher in Turkey than in Europe -- even if one makes the questionable questionable assumption that modern Anatolian Turks are patrilineal descendants of Neolithic Anatolians. The significance of the regression line disappears if 1 or 2 data points are excluded, and the plot has a quite visible ""gap"" between Turkey and Italy corresponding to the entirety of eastern Europe and the Balkans, i.e. the routes that any putative Neolithic lineages would have entered Europe.*

*The current paper does not sample the gap I noted in my earlier post, but it looks at Sardinian Y chromosomes, casting doubt on the alleged reduction of diversity from West Asia to Western Europe.*

In any case, wider studies done in 2011 and 2012 seem to back Dienekes' conclusions.

At any rate, yeah: I think you're right. I agree. Haplogroups I and G are incredibly old. And Sardinia is a great ""fly trapped in amber"" to see what ancient Europe looked like.

The thing is: Most people forget about subclades. I remember some poorly-written article claiming last year that Hitler had ""African DNA"" because he had haplogroup E3b. The journalist clearly wanted to be sensationalistic. But his science was off-kilter. He had no idea, evidently, that E3b had two totally different subclades. One, found among Berbers in North Africa [who are Caucasoid anyway], and another subclade in the Balkans common among Czechs. Hitler's adversaries were always teasing him about being distantly Czech. The Hitler family was from the border between Austria and what is now the Czech Republic. So Hitler's DNA established that, yes, he was descended (on his father's side) from ancient Czech stock. Not so shocking or ""sensationalistic"" when you consider the proximities of the countries involved. It's like accusing an American in Minnesota of having Canadian ancestry.

In any case, the journalist didn't find that sufficiently ""snazzy"" so he implied that Hitler had black ancestry. Or -- even more silly -- Jewish ancestry, (In fact, Sephardic Jews DO occasionally have E3b, but they have the Berber subclade of it. Not the Czech subclade that Hitler had.) Shlomo Sand talks about this, in his book on the origins of modern Jewish groups. According to him, Berbers converted to Judaism in the 6th Century AD. It were these ethnological Berbers who entered Spain with the Moorish invasions. (The DNA would imply that Sand is right, given that the Berber subclade of E3b is non-existent in Palestine, and a massive percentage of Sephardic Jews have it.) So even though ""religiously Jewish,"" these new Jews were still ethnologically Berber.

My point in all this?

It's always good to remember that different subclades of haplogroups exist. I and G are forcefully in point. Sardinian Haplogroup I, for instance, is different from standard Balkan haplogroup I.

And when I think of haplogroup G, I typically think of Iranians, Ossetians or Ashkenazic Jews. But Otzi the Iceman's haplogroup G was NOT that subclade. So he wasn't an ancient Near Easterner in Europe. He was, for lack of a better word, an ancient paleo-Sardinian.

I made a common mistake for immigrants in America and that is having a dream but not having the details. I did everything I thought is required for having something in this land of opportunity. I went to College, I studied hard while maintaining an active social life and working nearly 40 hours a week in an administrative role for my school. 
All the while i took out heaps of student loans because my parents are still together, make literally a couple dollars over the poverty line and are on the wrong side of the color wheel to get any grants or Scholarships (Im an immigrant from Eastern Europe). Now i've graduated with a useless Liberal Arts degree because I didnt and still do not know what the hell im doing with life. On top of that, the jobs I was able to get do not pay me nearly enough to afford to pay rent, car insurance, gas, student loans, and put food on the table every day. 
Now i am miserable, I only eat maybe every other day. The student Loan collection agencies are calling me every week and threatening me or my family who also don't have money. I would move back in with my parents but they live in a part of the state that has little to no jobs or decent transportation and they are going through a foreclosure themselves. Whereas i live in the same college town that i graduated from which has great transportation and tons of jobs in the area and I pay really cheap rent.
I've been applying to new jobs with career promise every single day but have not heard back about an interview at all. I feel trapped in a cage of debt and dont feel that I have a future anymore. 
I feel that i am just one of the millions of others who dared to try to live the American dream but got shackled into indentured servitude instead. I have not given up in the slightest, and feel that if I do get out of this hump I will be stronger for it.

Actual climate scientists downplaying politicians fuelling hysteria.

And since even the EU commissioner for Industry is saying that they're facing an economic 'massacre' because of the push for renewables driving  up energy costs then there seems to be more pressing matters.

It's strange that when you actually listen to industry and scientists, and not politicians interpreting science and lobbyists, then the climate hysteria around climate change (which is a real thing) takes on a different hue and comes across as just that - hysteria.

&gt;But what you shouldn't do, which you currently are, is be a total dick about it and shame somebody for doing something that is going to change their entire life. 

That wouldn't be a lie if:

0.- I was being a dick.

1.- I was shaming anybody. Don't call any form of criticism shaming.

2.- They are ""doing something that is going to change their lifes"". Being gay isn't doing anything, It's being something. Maybe you're talking about admitting you're gay (coming out of the closet), but I never said anything about that. Yes, maybe people can be proud of coming out of the closet, because it's something they did and not something they were born with and did nothing to achieve. 

&gt;People are often proud because of their heritage or how far the group they identify with has come.

Just because something is commonly practiced it isn't more legitimate.

&gt;If a person is gay, comes out, and considers it an accomplishment, I don't see why it is up to you to decide to shame that person and think you are better due to your so-called unpopular opinion.

Stop putting words in my mouth, I never said anything negative about coming out. It makes it look like you disagreed with be but didn't have anything to say so you made up stuff.

&gt;Some people can't even come out until they are totally independent. What do you think will happen if a gay 16 year old came out to his baptist anti-gay parents? What if he got kicked out of his home? That's the risk I'm talking about. Getting beat up at school or parties. I had the nastiest shit shout out to me for holding my boyfriend's hand in public. This is why gay teenagers have a higher suicide rate, compared to their straight counterparts. 

So...? Who said the opposite? Why are you mentioning this?


&gt;The history of gay people is a rough one. They literally and physically had to fight for some rights, and can you imagine being portrayed as a child molester due to public service announcements? Can you imagine losing your job because of it? 

No. But it doesn't have anything to do with anything I talked about in the post that you replied to.

&gt;You just can't go around making your ridiculous statements without knowing a goddamn thing or putting yourself in that situation. 

This would be true if

0.- I was making ridiculous statements.

1.- I didn't know a goddamn thing. I am homosexual and while I don't suffered discrimination of that level (physical abuse, bein disowned etc), I am more or less familiar with lighter discrimination.

That's true, and obviously mathematically correct. However, if it was a general rule, we wouldn't have evolved as a society, but rather as a group of individuals (More like bears).

As a society, we're much stronger than single individuals. 

Being nice plays a part in this.

Mainstream economic thinking says that this will help to grow Ukraine's economy by giving Ukrainians access to European goods and services, allowing them to more easily seek work in Europe, and allowing other Europeans to more easily invest in Ukraine. I'm inclined to agree with the economists on this one, and it seems to work for other countries in the EU (once again, mostly).

Politically, once Ukraine becomes more integrated with the European community, the people there can move away from their communist past and try to fix the problems that have been lingering in Ukraine since the days of communism. This includes widespread political corruption. The EU can impose minimum acceptable standards on Ukrainian politicians and officials to convince them to act better.

This comment is unhelpful and misleading for a couple of reasons. First, ""they"" is a poor use of words in this case. Islam is not a monolithic belief system, and Muslims are not a monolithic people. Being specific is immensely helpful.

Second, the battles listed were fought by different Islamic states--the Ottoman Empire (Turks) for Vienna, and the Umayyad Caliphate (Arabs) at Tours--for different reasons. The battle of Tours was a vastly different battle than the Ottoman attempts to take Vienna for just that reason--they were attempts. The 1529 and 1683 battles of Vienna were both battles in which the Ottomans were making concerted efforts to take the city, while the Arab army at Tours was a raiding party pillaging Aquitaine.

Off the top of my head, any rational economist/statistician would probably ask the following:

 - **Is unemployment being calculated the same way in all of these countries?** The short answer to this is no. Nations don't use a uniform definition of unemployment, and there are a lot of ways to hide people whose existence a government would rather not acknowledge. (Japan was amazing at this for a long time. Haven't read up on it recently, so they still might be.)
 - **Did everyone on the euro benefit from the introduction of the currency?** Again, [the short answer to this is no](http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1of1si/change_in_unemployment_rate_20082011_europe_1371/ccrj3p6). Germany's manufacturing sector went on a killing spree when it got the chance to export with a euro that was cheaper than the old deutsche mark. Not everyone was so lucky.
 - **Is every country on this map subject to the same set of economic/geographic/political circumstances?** No, no, and no, although that really goes without saying. Norway, to borrow a nation you obviously look on approvingly, is 5 million people sitting on top of a North Sea oil spigot. It also has some of the world's most poorly-designed import/export laws that prop up some amazingly inefficient domestic producers, a frighteningly non-diverse economy, and relatively unproductive workers in comparison to its European peers. These would, under ordinary circumstances, kill its chances at wealth, but that doesn't matter while Norway's government coffers are awash in the world's most valuable commodity. This is not a knock on Norway, mind you, because I think they're handling the oil wealth as responsibly as they possibly can, but let's not swoon over their numbers. Norway has a lot of problems that its oil money is hiding, but that doesn't mean those problems don't exist.
 - **Is regulation in itself the most important factor in determining a nation's resulting unemployment rate?** Probably not, although it has its own part to play (to good and bad effect). There are just too many things that play a role in what percentage of your population is in full-time employment. Too little regulation (e.g., China) and your country will probably wind up with a well-earned reputation for safety issues and spotty quality. Too much regulation (e.g., France) and existing industries and elderly people will basically be fattening themselves at the cost of entrepreneurs, innovators, and the young.

International metrics are often useful for rough comparison, but they're very sensitive to being gamed by governments with educated bureaucrats, which is why they're not always useful measurements long-term. It's also important to remember that many of them are really only good at telling you something about a country's economy without necessarily being a useful tool for comparison. For example, GDP per capita tells us that financial services or oil + small number of people = lawl (e.g., Norway, Switzerland, Jersey, Brunei, Qatar).

And there are some regulations that *are* demonstrably bad for business. The real question is whether the hit that business takes is worth whatever the regulations are intended to accomplish.

Korean audiences actually cheer for the winners in tournaments even if the winners are not Korean. Hospitality and image is a huge thing in Korea (and Japan). If we're hosting a tournament and get destroyed, we're not going to be sore losers about it. There was a Dota 2 tournament recently in Korea in which all the Korean teams got destroyed. However, the casters/audience loved it cause we got to see two of the best teams in the world play (DK and Alliance; DK is Chinese btw). Same thing when X'Ds~Grrr... came to Korea and won the first Starcraft starleague; same thing when CLG came to Korea. The Koreans loved Doublelift and loved him when he scored a penta vs some Korean team.

Maybe it's a cultural difference, but for the most part, I see nothing but poor sportsmanship everytime China hosts a tournament and loses.

Edit: You're a perfectly good example of a sore Chinese loser. I just went through your post history and wow, you're one butt-hurt Chinese fan. You seem so upset that there's a huge Korean bandwagon on /r/leagueoflegends. Guess what? That bandwagon didn't come from nowhere. People like winners. When TPA won they had their own bandwagon in which people were calling Toyz the best midlaner in the world. If you were in this subreddit 2 years ago when the Korean LoL server was starting, you would know that the majority of Reddit was laughing at the idea of Koreans playing competitively:


""They're too far behind; NA/EU have been playing for too long""

""LoL isn't the same as Starcraft; less about mechanics and more about strategy"" 



Koreans start winning MLG, All-Stars, S3 WC, and now WCG so people jump onto the Korean bandwagon and start praising them. You, on the other hand, keep praising the Chinese even when they don't win. I've lost track of how many posts of yours stated, ""[Insert Chinese team here] will win the tournament, mark my words and bookmark this post."" How about you start talking shit until your team(s) win something instead of before. If people are talking shit about how great the Koreans are, just stfu and wait til OMG wins to mock them. Or you won't even need to because people will have jumped onto the OMG bandwagon by then. Just stop running you mouth and trying to justify it by saying that everyone is a blind fanboy of Korea.

You understand when I say I'm a part of the black population, and it isn't wrong. There isn't anything wrong with grouping people, provided there are no connotations with it. 

The people I called from the past? We have something in common; we are black. They contributed to the culture that was passed down in many black families and neighborhoods, that's their relation to many black people.

When I say black culture, I'm referring also to the black AMERICAN culture. Not all black people living in the US are American. I'm a great example, I am Nigerian-American, the child of Nigerian immigrants. It's easier to refer to myself as related to other black people by our blackness. However, I was not raised in the black american culture, I was raised surrounded by the Nigerian culture. See, black people are diverse as well. There's this concept I like using: All African-Americans are black, but not all black people are African American. I define African American as having heritage from an African country whilst living in America. Not all black people are African-American; black people can come from anywhere: Caribbean, India, etc. That's an example of how black people are indeed not a monolith.

I'll say it again, there is nothing wrong with group people of similar traits together. Blonde haired people. Tall people. Gay people. Asian people. But there's a problem when you start treating this group like a monolith, when they really aren't. How can you go around refusing to group people when necessary? Rap music was created by individuals who happened to be black. This music was shared with other individuals who happened to be black. This type of music is now popular with communities where individuals happen to be black. Yes, black people are diverse, but we have things in common that allow us to be grouped together (not in a stereotypical way). Music made by black people was and is generally accepted by black people, and is commonly rejected by white people. Other people of other races did not invent rap/hip hop/r&amp;b, so it is fair to say that those types of music are almost exclusive to the black community.

&gt;In your views can ""white culture"" own anything the same way? According to Wikipedia, the earliest musical synthesizers were invented by white people. Does that mean a black person who uses a synthesizer in their music is stealing from white culture? That seems silly to me, but not too far off from what you're saying about Macklemore.

They can. Much like black culture, white culture is diverse. You have different European cultures (English versus Greek, Christian versus Pagan, etc.). If a black person is inspired by a white person's music, it is not stealing in the same sense (provided that they're credited). Why? Because music genres dominated by white people are widely accepted, while others are not.",True,t1_cdr4vo2,t3_1ruc7r,2,,t1_cdr5s9k,cdr5s9k,False,1385931726,points ,2,changemyview,1428437127,everydayimtrollinn
