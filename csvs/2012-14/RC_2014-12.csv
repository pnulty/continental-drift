Eu concordo contigo que a proposta não está formulada correctamente para um proposta de lei. O artigo 1 está quase ao nível de generalidade de um artigo constitucional, e a proposta não especifica quase nada de como será implementada.

No entanto, discordo com a tua afirmação que ser um direito implica que possa ser usado sem limite. Qualquer direito requer uma perda de liberdade (e.g. direito a viver =&gt; é proibido matar, direito à propriedade privada =&gt; é proibido roubar, direito à água =&gt; é proibido acabar com ela). ""Adequado"" é definido pela lei, como tudo.

A questão ideológica é se esta liberdade deve ser restringida pelo estado (i.e. regulando o preço da água/racionando) ou pelo mercado (i.e. menos água para a mesma procura =&gt; aumento do preço =&gt; perda de liberdade no seu uso.)

Vou assumir que concordamos que estamos a falar de o estado garantir esse direito. (i.e. vamos largar a ideia de Laissez-faire).

A questão política que a proposta aborda é se o estado deve garantir o direito controlando os meios de produção, ou se deve apenas regular o mercado para garantir esse direito, como tem feito.

Eu vejo o uso da água como uma taxa não progressiva. Isto é, o que pagamos por ela não depende dos nossos rendimentos, e todos usamos mais ou menos a mesma quantidade. Se o estado controlar os meios de produção, existe a opção de ela passar a ser uma taxa progressiva (por impostos).

A minha posição, e ai demarco-me do PSD/CDS, é que social democracia requer uma equidade de rendimentos superior à que temos hoje em Portugal. Nesse sentido, acho que é perigoso liberalizar o mercado da água pois estamos a falar de uma taxa não progressiva.

No entanto, a menos que o preço da água dispare, estamos a falar de um valor ainda relativamente baixo no rendimento familiar, quando comparado e.g. com a alimentação. Assim, não acho escandaloso o mercado ser regulado. Há coisas mais importantes para nos preocuparmos.

Oil dropping from $110 barrel down to $60/barrel puts hundreds of billions of dollars back into the pockets of consumers, and it may single handedly bring the EU out of recession and push the US GDP growth to over 4% for the first time in a decade.

Because this will kill our world. We had cars as efficient as those today in the 1970s after the oil shocks [1]. What's more there is the real and persistent danger of fear, uncertainty and doubt. Without major political sustained will to push renewables no one will invest in them if the Saudi can make them unprofitable every time tens of billions of dollars have been sunk into them and they become competitive with oil at a given price. 

Again, we had a renewables boom in the 1970s, which turned into an oil orgy in the 1980s because of politics. Had we sustained the political will them we would have been energy independent by the start of the 1990s with a near zero emissions economy.

The Saudi are a lot smarter than people give them credit for. This isn't any better for the advanced economies than a dealer giving free hits to his best client when it looks the client is about to quit heroin for good.

By that point, it became clear to British policy-makers that not only would Britain no longer be an exporter of food, as it had been in much of the early modern period, they would have to import in years of poor harvests. In years of abundance Britain could mostly feed itself. 

The situation was largely disrupted by the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, however, as imports were harder to come by and prices rose substantially. This actually led to some important pieces of legislation with long-term consequences, including the implementation of the Speenhamland System in 1798 and the passage of the Corn Laws in 1815. The Corn Laws were a series of duties on imported grain implemented at the conclusion of the wars in order to keep grain prices high, and to continue the period of prosperity for landowners. Britain's population growth, however, meant that the problem of short food worsened over time. This led to the period (retrospectively) called the ""Hungry 40s,"" and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846: with their repeal, we get proper ""Free Trade"" in food for Britain. 

At that point, in 1846, British farmers typically produced about 75% of the wheat that Britons consumed. By World War I, less than 70 years later, that figure had dropped to less than 20%. And, in addition to wheat, Britain imported massive quantities of preserved and refrigerated meat from the US, Argentina, and Australia; butter and other dairy products from New Zealand, and continental Europe; and an assortment of other products like tropical fruits. These added to Britain's prior dependence on the tropical world for its chemical stimulants like coffee, tea, chocolate, sugar, and tobacco (not a food, but useful to consider in the same category), as well as spices. This utter dependence on overseas farmers was obvious their enemies in both World Wars, as evidenced by the resources Germany put into submarines. Their principal goal was to disrupt the trade in food between Britain the rest of the world--especially North America--enough to force the UK to a negotiated peace. Convoys, the US and Royal Navy, rationing, and government support for intensive agriculture prevented this from happening both times. In 1947, the wartime support for agriculture (itself a fascinating story of top-down environmental management) was made permanent with subsidies for intensive agriculture. Britain abandoned the free market for its food supply, and has been much more capable of feeding itself since then.

Also, I should point out that Ireland was in no way part of a separate economic system in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has long served as a combination of captive market for British goods and a supplemental granary for British stomachs.

Y encima los de la plataforma se quejan de que la estructura de la sociedad ahora solo es de 30 personas...Claro estan acostumbrados a que sea cuatro veces mas,..como el dinero no es de nadie,venga a meter enchufados,que son la gran lacra junto a los liberados en las empresas publicas


Los de IU siempre critican a otros pero en Rivas donde llevan gobernando hace siglos,La empresa municipal de vivienda era de gestion privada..si,si,la misma de los desparecidos 20 millones.En 1998, del patrimonio de todos los vecinos salió gratis el suelo para el primer Plan de Vivienda joven, gestionado también mediante una privatización,  . Pues bien, habiendo sido gratis el suelo, la gestora se lo cobró íntegro a los adjudicatarios de las viviendas. Más de 9.000 euros por vivienda. Alguien, con el beneplácito de IU, se embolsó más de 120 millones de pesetas de la época. En 2003 el Alcalde de Izquierda Unida pagó sin necesidad alguna a la empresa de un amigo 300.000 euros por la “ideo arquitectónica” del proyecto del centro Comercial Rivas Plaza que nuca llegó a ejecutarse...pero a parte son tambien de gestión privada El Colegio Municipal Hipatia, las escuelas deportivas, la atención a  mayores y dependientes,  , el mantenimiento del Pilar Bardem y otros centros culturales, los servicios de atención a la infancia, la atención de las mujeres víctimas de violencia de género, la educación ambiental, la planta de tratamiento de residuos...Así son los de IU ¿¿que dice Tania?? ella estaba en IU Rivas,nunca la he oido quejarse

Ransom and hostage-taking are treated as distinct topics within medieval historiography (ie. the study of history) and the words themselves are not synonyms in lay usage either. Hostages are, in the medieval period, typically taken to assure future good behaviour (more practically to punish bad behaviour) and a fairly frequent feature of high inter-state medieval politics (ie. at the end of a war). Ransom equally pragmatic but less: it's an alternative to being killed which relies on your personal reputation, both fiscal and moral, to be able to make good on the merciful deed. As I have not read Pinker, and thus I am not aware of his wider thesis on hostage-taking in Mesoamerica, I am rather unwilling to offer a comparative example especially where I do not think that the comparison is a good or balanced one. So I will give you what figures we can reliably put together for the number of dead at Agincourt, and explain the underlying mechanics of ransom and warfare in the early fifteenth-century.

That caveat aside let's get to the meat of the matter. Figures of the dead from Agincourt are obscured by the nature of the sources to hand. Thomas Walsingham gives a figure of 3069 knights or esquires who died on the French side, which he explicitly states does not include the 'common' people who would not have been counted by the heralds. Antonio Morosini, a Venetian writing to the city of Paris five days after the battle, quoted a figure of ten and twelve thousand (although he does not state whether this is including the 'common' folk and erroneously states that twenty-six named barons had been slain and another thirteenth had been taken prisoner). While the precise number of French dead is perhaps irrevocably lost the comparison with the English is stark. A reconstruction of the figures which does not include those who would later die from their wounds is, at a top end estimate, not likely much more than 112. Of these almost exactly two-thirds were archers. On the French side the dead were so numerous that even the heralds, who recorded only those entitled to bear coats-of-arms, simply couldn't keep up.

Agincourt is a good exemplar of medieval prisoner-taking and ransom and less so of hostage-taking. The chivalric ideal and its more seedy undercurrents were represented by the large numbers of noble prisoners taken which, in turn, endangered the smaller English force (c.10,000 including all ranks) once it looked like the tide of battle might turn against them. Henry V, supposedly upon hearing of a reinforcing French army, ordered the massacre of the French prisoners who had surrendered to his soldiers. Their throats were cut and the reinforcing army never arrived. Later historians and commentators have attempted to use the killings as a stick with which to bash Henry. None of his contemporaries did. It was a sad but understandable mistake and one which had conformed to the expectations of warfare in the period.

The French had fought under the [Oriflamme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriflamme) it was a symbol that the traditions of chivalric culture would not be honoured by the French - ie. no prisoners would be taken - and was one of the many reasons why contemporary commentators did not condemn Henry V for the eventual massacre of the French prisoners. It should be noted that these prisoners would not be of 'low' birth anyway. At Agincourt the duke of Brabant, Antoine de Bourgogne, was killed while masquerading as a result of hiding his identity (probably with the intention of securing a lower price for ransom). Those who would not profit the captors would be killed or left for dead.

The chivalric class, which had extended beyond those dubbed as knights to include the loosely defined 'men-at-arms' by the fourteenth- and fifteenth-centuries, could expect a reciprocal extension of certain ideals and customs in warfare such as ransom - whereby an individual could surrender himself into the protection of his captor and either on license (ie. they were released for an agreed future fee) or held until a fee was agreed with their kin or lord (where the boundaries are more blurry with regard to hostage-taking). The origins of this system can be traced back to what is called the Frankish diaspora (essentially the spread of proto-French warrior aristocrats across Europe taking not only their military technology and customs but creating a massive web of interpersonal bonds which would remain in place even while fighting one another under various lords and rulers. In a period where blood feuds (or at least the spectre of such feuds) loomed large in the mind, the ability to not have to kill your opponent was valued highly. It made sense not to kill those whose kith (friends) and kin could feasibly retaliate. The rise and popularity of the tournament in the twelfth-century created not only a point where large numbers of similarly-minded individuals could test their prowess and win honour, but could test these principles and loyalty to their vows. Finally, and made most obvious by the tournament, was the economic incentive. Ransoms were far more valuable than dead nobles and knights (in most cases).

There was little or no such incentive to preserve the life of those who could not pay a ransom. The modern concept of the merciful knight has intruded from the historiographical conflation of the Peace of God movement and the Romanticisation of chivalry in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-centuries. Mercy was extended usually to your peers and the rest may as well go hang. We should never forget the economic incentive well captured by one contemporary French chronicler:

&gt; After this bloody battle, the king of England and the nobles of his army bought from their men, and also from working men and the lower folk, the most important lords of France so that they could put them to ransom and gain great sums of money. The English put to ransom all the others, even those who were lying on the ground amongst the dead and who were still breathing and givig sign of life.

&gt; *Chronique de Religieu de Saint-Denys*, ed. L.-F. Bellageut, 6 vols, Paris, 1839-52 (reprint Paris, 1994), v, p.568. Trans. Anne Curry, *The Battle of Agincourt. Sources and Interpretations*, (Woodbridge, 2000), p.108.

Agincourt is notorious because it supposedly contravened these ideals which the warrior aristocracy had placed upon themselves. This ire, like that directed towards Richard I after the massacre at Ayyadieh (1191), was not a contemporary one. In the context of the points mentioned above Henry's actions were completely understandable and justifiable (although Henry was not made to during his lifetime). Likewise many of the other battles of the Hundred Years War played out in similar circumstances, although this would be the last battle the French fought in the shadow of the Oriflamme. It is held up as a brutal battle because it was the nobility who suffered, as they had at Poitiers and Crecy in the fourteenth-century.

There are other aspects which I should probably expand upon but I'll have to leave it at this point for now. A final comment is that this entire system relied on trust. Trust that you could allow someone to return to their kith and kin and pay the agreed ransom and not seek immediate revenge. Trust that if someone gave you their word it could be respected. This cut both ways - if you were a notoriously faithless individual then good luck getting any person to take you prisoner when there were more profitable individuals to seize.

Even tiny little towns shat across Europe and North America.  I like to think I'm a seasoned vet when it comes to the game (buying and selling) and have to admit I both enjoy and take pride in my ability to score dope anywhere anytime.  Here are some of my major rules to cop by that have yet to be mentioned:
  
Grease the wheels.  Always take care of those who help you out.  Not only will things generally go smoother, but now literally ""what's good for you is good for him"".  You've basically hired yourself an agent who take a percentage.  And you've tipped him for not ripping you off, which 90% of the time he could have.  Finally, if you ever have to go back, you'll have a somewhat trustworthy connection who'll be happy to help you.

Always try to get a direct number or contact.  Nothing worse than having to call a guy who has to call a guy etc.  Under normal circumstances I won't deal with anyone other than a dealer.  No middies.  It usually takes way longer, is way sketchier and the count will always be smaller in the end.  So when you make initial contact with your above mentioned ""agent"", always factor in an extra $20 or so to get him to make an introduction to ""the guy"".

If you've got the extra cash, a tried tested and 99% successful method is calling an escort/prostitute.  Phone books, Craigslist, Backpage.  Call them up, be straight but discreet on phone/email and let them know you'd like to pay them for some of their time.  When they get there, fill them in and most will be happy to help you and often make the introduction for a small fee.  In my experience the product is usually top notch.   Chicks don't sell their asses for shitty dope.  This is the way to go if at all possible.

This next tip doesn't occur to many people.  If the typical ghetto/strip isn't happening for whatever reason, head to the area of town frequented by the gay community.  In my experience many gay people like to party or know someone who does, and they always have good product.  They typically aren't ""in the game"" and will usually help you out for little or nothing with none of the shady bullshit.  I've had some good experiences going this route and met some solid connections this way.  Drugs don't discriminate!

Finally:  ALWAYS TRUST YOUR GUT.  Don't be afraid to walk away.  If it doesn't feel right, it isn't.  Better to be without drugs than to be ripped off and still without drugs.  Be smart.  Be safe.

Food Insecurity (a state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food) is occurring in the U.S. In 2013, 49.1 million (14 percent of the population) Americans lived in food insecure households. SNAP, a government program and one that has recently suffered cuts, is a large reason why the problem isn't even worse. But you're saying that the current level of malnourishment isn't a problem, that access to food is an issue that should be further addressed only when people are literally starving to death or to near death.

Regarding your calling out obesity, this means that people are eating junk food, which is a lot cheaper and is not an indicator that they have access to food that has real nutritional value. Are you getting your talking points from Forbes?

Homelessness is a problem in the U.S., which you just stated that it is in the EU, U.K., and U.S. The main causes being lack of affordable housing, mental illness, substance abuse, and low-paying jobs. There has been a decline in the number of homeless, in large part due Open Doors, a government program. But you're suggesting that this might not be an issue of economics, so no problem that wages can address.

Regarding Walmart, I'm not singling them out; the article that created the discussion was about Walmart, so. No one is saying that Target, Kmart, McDonalds, Burger King, etc. are any different when it comes to paying many of their employees enough to live on without assistance.

About better jobs through investing in companies, what does this mean? What are these ""better jobs"", how will these exist on a scale such that a large portion of those currently holding down minimum wage jobs will be able to realistically transition into? Invest in by whom and in what way? On the surface, it sounds great...until specifics are requested. At that point, without any details about what is involved and how to implement it, this becomes just a nebulous and vague statement. FYI - I'm not asking for a business plan, a link to a rough outline with a few bullet points would be great.

Comparing buying power of the impoverished in the U.S. to those in other countries? Why? If someone in the U.S. can barely afford adequate food, shelter, clothing, transportation, and health care, what difference does it make if someone in another nation in the same relative segment can afford more or less? I 'm not saying that it doesn't, just please explain further the link and what it suggests in regard to helping someone here.

This whole discussion has somehow morphed into whether or not there are even any problems, which I seem to be getting the impression that you're saying that there aren't, so minimum wage doesn't even need discussing. This could go on for days, if there are problems, to what extent, why...and that's just at the surface level that you and I are on. So, I'll bring it back to the original question under the assumption that there are actual problems regarding poverty (the ability of having a full time job and making enough money for adequate food, shelter, utilities, clothing, transportation, health care, etc.). On what do you base your assertion that increasing minimum wage, at all, *will* result in more people falling into poverty? Aside from U.S. Samoa, what concrete, real world examples can you point to that demonstrate and support this argument?

Edit - if you want to maintain that there are no problems that are not already being adequately addressed, that's fine.

Edit - I'll also add that, assuming poverty in this country is a problem that needs to be further addressed, no one, at least I'm not, is looking at an increase in minimum wage as a silver bullet. If raised, it would be one of many different mechanisms used to try to tackle the problem.

That said, we all know their communication is not the most amazing, and they've also tried pretty hard so far to avoid getting involved in actively managing the scene.

Some issues I have what your last reply: 

**Travel suppport**:
All the big LANs give some travel support. For teams from SEA/South America to attend EU LANs this isn't enough to pay for all of it - at least for the cross-continent teams (I don't have the numbers off-hand, but I'd guess maybe 75-85% of the flights/accommodation, from what I've seen/heard in interviews and discussions). That 15-25% extra could just be too much for some good, yet unsponsored teams - teams that maybe could afford one or two LANs and show they're deserving of an invite to TI.

**The LAN requirements**:
By the criteria given, Newbee would never have been invited to TI. They formed in early 2014, they only played in 3 'big' LAN events before TI: V Games Tournament (Chinese only, they lost to DK 2-1 in the finals - 2nd place), MarsTV Tournament (Chinese only, they beat LGD 2-0 in the finals -1 1st place) and WPC 2014 (Alliance and C9 from 'the West', Titan from SEA, rest Chinese. They ended 3rd).

Format at the event is also significant. The actual statistical value you get from a single elimination tournament (like ESL) is a lot less significant than what you get from a double elimination or groups -&gt; double elimination. I don't see why an 8-team ESL bo3 SE tournament would ensure points, but The Summit (1) wouldn't.

What about invite-only vs qualfiers? Some tournaments like ESL are likely only financially viable based off of the top 'fan favourites' attending. I would think it's a concern for them if the teams that are coming is unknown until a few weeks before the LAN finals occur, and this might make potential viewers a bit more hesitant. We saw the outcry based on the TI4 format in that some teams didn't get 'stage time'. Would the tournament rider that Valve sets out specify how many teams must qualify? Some of the tournaments are also hosted or organised by teams, so there could be a very heavy conflict of interests in that the prize money is now not the biggest prize (it's also the TI invite).

The other issue is about the 75k. This is pretty much excludes 99% of the tournaments. There's only been like ~25 non-TI tournaments with &gt; $75k in the last 3 years, and if you exclude the country-locked ones (Nexon, KDL) and the regular ones (like Starseries, which will only happen once or twice in a qualifying period), you're probably only looking at 

**Timing**:
Teams that win enough tournaments 6-9 months before TI would be in a great position. Their spot would be automatically guaranteed, they could even change 2 players and still retain the spot. This means that a team who does well enough in a 'season' could drop their star players and be totally useless in the pre-TI patch, but still get an invite. Based on my observations (so this could be totally wrong), Valve seem to invite teams based entirely on performance; and primarily on performance in the ~2 months before the invites are sent out. Here's a spreadsheet with ratings as of 1st May: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hv82FSQWud0f24fAaCaHbHNKPm2KQCXL1cKnLPMX1Ik/edit?usp=sharing

**Control**:
Valve don't really want to manage much. In fact, they want to manage the absolute minimum that they need to, but still ensure that things are done in line with what they want. Subcontracting this out might seem like it makes sense, but I don't think Valve trusts enough people to do this. Even consider that some teams might not be able to travel for safety reasons [there was discussion around the Ukraine issue for Starladder] - should they be punished in TI qualification points by not attending? 

**The bit about leaving sponsors**:
This would possibly put a load of teams in a precarious sitaution. Consider the SpeedGaming @ MLG fiasco with Marco. Imagine there were even *potentially* some way he could try prevent that squad (after they joined C9) from a TI spot. That issue was very one-sided, but it's very possible that 

**Mystery/hype**:
Teams don't know if they're getting invites. Maybe the top 5-6 feel pretty confident they'll get one, but for those 'almost at the top teams', the pre-TI period (normally 4-6 weeks before the invites go out) have provided some of the best and most exciting Dota. It's a time where the smaller teams feel like they have something to prove to grab Valve's attention. At the same time, the top teams still practise - they still show face. There's normally a substantial slow-down in tier 1 LAN tournaments in the months leading up to TI (it was already deemed squashed with WPC ACE, The Summit and ESL - here's the full list http://pastebin.com/7qGBAtvv), and I think if the known invited teams were announced (or could be worked out a lot earlier), we'd see even fewer of these (as the teams would not necessarily confirm attendance at a LAN when they're absolutely assured qualification to TI).

Hitler's generals thoroughly disagreed with him upon many things; these were all men who had led others or fought during WWI and had decades of experience, and recognized Hitler for the child he was during most of the war. They absolutely were confident in victory, though, right up until Barbarossa failed (literally everybody in his staff urged him to pull back from Russia and establish a defensive line instead of continuing the assault into the winter months, but Hitler had to one-up his icon: Napoleon [yes, he studied Napoleon thoroughly, idolized him, and still had his men fight in Russia during winter]).

Just to clarify, Humans are apes. Apes are group of primates that don't have tails. The living ape species are: humans, orang-utans, gorillas, chimpanzees, gibbons, siamangs, and bonobos. 

Anatomically modern humans have been around for about 200,000 years. These people living 200,000 years ago would be indistinguishable from a person living today. They would have looked just like us. 2 million years ago, our closest living ancestor was [Homo erectus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) who looked and acted a lot more like us than any other living ape species today. Homo erectus evolved in Africa but then quickly migrated into Asia and Europe. Going further back in time we arrive at the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. This ape species lived in Africa about 7-8 million years ago. It was not a human and it was not a chimpanzee, it was its own distinct ape species that is now extinct. This ape species would split into two linages, one that would eventually lead to the evolution of humans. The other linage would eventually lead to chimpanzees and bonobos...our closest living relatives.

**More on dinosaurs**

Dinosaurs have a really interesting evolutionary history. They first evolved during the Triassic, 231 million years ago and most dinosaur species went extinct 65 million years ago, when an asteroid impacted near modern day Mexico. The surviving dinosaur species are now known collectively as the [birds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird). Birds are dinosaurs, albeit ones that have undergone considerable evolutionary changes since they first evolved about 150 million years ago. Birds are part of the theropod group of dinosaurs, akin to how humans are part of the apes. Here is the wikipedia article on the [origin of birds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_birds). 

But back to early dinosaur evolution. Like I said they evolved 231 million years ago and the early dinosaurs quickly diverged into two groups distinguished by their pelvis shape - the Saurischia and Ornithischia. We have a few early representatives of both groups, and their skeletons would have looked something like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_dinosaurs#mediaviewer/File:Dino_evol_1_modificated_ES.svg).  [This picture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_dinosaurs#mediaviewer/File:Evolution_of_dinosaurs_EN.svg) explains exactly what I am talking about regarding early dinosaurs and their divergence. ""When dinosaurs appeared, they were not the dominant terrestrial animals. The terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosauromorphs and therapsids, like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs."" After of series of extinction events, which largely wiped out their competitors, the dinosaurs radiated and evolved into many different kinds of species. This radiation process spanned millions of years. Different dinosaur species lived at different times, and each group of dinosaurs has its own unique set of fossils. For example, the [ceratopsidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopsidae) are represented by a number of distinguished species...the most famous being the triceratops. These species did not all live at the same time, and some very likely evolved from earlier species. 

Dinosaurs are of course reptiles. The closest living relative to dinosaurs are crocodiles. You can see that in this [picture](http://highered.mheducation.com/olcweb/cgi/pluginpop.cgi?it=jpg::640::480::/sites/dl/free/0073212040/63804/0637l.jpg::Reptile%20phylogenetic%20tree) of the reptile family tree. FYI the [therapsids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapsida) (on the left side of the reptile tree) are the very distant ancestors of all mammals. Also notice how the [pterosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur) (flying ""dinosaurs"") are not actually part of the dinosaur group...neither are the marine reptiles like [plesiosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosauria). 
Pterosaurs and plesiosaurs are not dinosaurs. ""Many prehistoric animals, including mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and Dimetrodon, are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, but are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.""

The boom in population (England was now at around 5 million) put a strain on the natural resources used for energy (wood). Nations were put under great stress due to high rates of inflation, but none more so in Britain where the rise in cost of wood was made extreme by there being relatively little of it compared to mainland Europe.

This caused Britain to search for an alternate source of fuel, and luckily for them it was a land abundant in coal (particularly in Wales and the north east). This fuel was already known about but was considered a 'dirty' way of producing heat so was never exploited whilst there was an abundance of wood. However coal had one massive advantage because it could get much higher temperatures than wood was able to. It also drove technical innovation as coal fumes would often ruin existing processes, so new technologies had to be developed.

Together the higher temperatures and need to innovate led to a boom in material science. Larger, stronger, and more complex machines and infrastructure could be built - the start of the industrial revolution.

&gt; Look, here's the thing. Ukraine is notorious for exaggeration, *however* it is undeniable that Russian provocateurs and regular forces are active within the Ukraine. 
&gt; 
Before we even go into hard evidence, specifics, it should be self evident; for one, the man at the heart of the separatist movement -- Igor Girkin, alias ""Strelkov"" -- was, of his own admission, in the employment of the Russian FSB until 2013. From [this article](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-igor-strelkov-i-am-responsible-for-war-in-eastern-ukraine/511584.html), we have the magnificent quote: *""If our unit hadn't crossed the border, in the end everything would have fizzled out, like in Kharkiv, like in Odessa.""* And that was on /r/worldnews' front page only days ago!
&gt; 
Secondly, there's the fact that [Russia denied it was involved in Ukraine](http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140304/188087074/Putin-Denies-Sending-Russian-Troops-to-Crimea.html), only for Putin to later [confess *""Of course our troops stood behind Crimea's self-defence forces*
""](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/17/russia-putin-crimea-idUKL6N0N921H20140417). Russia's word is fundamentally untrustworthy. 
&gt; 
[Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko has also attested that 1,200 of his fighters spent 4 months training in Russia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28817347). So even if Russia is not directly involved, we have it from the rebel's own lips that they are training and arming them. 
&gt; 
Does anybody remember the ten Russian paratroops (VDV) which apparently entered the Ukraine by mistake, and were apprehended? [Here's the link](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213). The thing is, those paratroops belonged to the 98th Guards Airborne Division. Of the 98th Airborne, you have the 331st and 1065th regiments. Both are based out of Kostroma. Coincidentally, in [this article](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/29/us-ukraine-crisis-prisoners-idUSKCN0HO1MP20140929) you have two Ukrainian soldiers, belonging to separate units, both attesting they had fought Russian VDV out of Kostroma. 
&gt; 
On the subject of the VDV, [we then have the captured APC's with the documents of Russian paratroopers, paratroopers of the Pskov division's No. 74268 Brigade](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukraine-gets-new-evidence-of-russian-soldiers-fighting-on-its-turf-photos-361543.html).
&gt; 
A basic understanding of the timeline of the content also demonstrates Russian involvement. Before the *massive* [Russian humanitarian convoy in August](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/08/russia-aid-convoy-moving-into-ukraine-201482282413556411.html), the Ukrainian army were on a veritable blitz, [ capturing a number of towns including Pervomaisk, Kalynove and Komyshuvakha](http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/218108.html), [tightening the noose around Donetsk](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28724487) and [reclaiming much of Luhansk](http://news.yahoo.com/fighting-outside-key-ukrainian-city-kills-9-troops-091723576.html). Then, out of nowhere, a counteroffensive turns the tide. The rebels [capture Novoazovsk](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28951319), and suddenly they're on the [doorstep of Mariupol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/04/russia-rebels-ceasefire-approaches-ukraine).  That is not coincidental. 
&gt; 
Now let's dig into hard evidence. 
&gt; 
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkRtOSk1tps) we have a handy camcorder video, from our friends the Separatists. They claim, as in the title, that's a T-72M; a common piece of Soviet surplus which the Ukrainian Army has never operated. They also claim to have captured it from the UA. Weird, huh? Despite that, there's another problem; that's not a T-72M. It's a T-72B3 -- a modernized variant of the T-72 which is operated exclusively by the Russian Federation, and is immediately distinguishable by its French *Thales* night-vision and reactive armour. The video gives a nice close up of those distinguishing features. 
&gt; 
On the subject of T-72B3's, we have [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKpsybu-x64) footage of another T-72, with a convoy of MT-LB's. It's clearly a modernized variant, as you can see from its reactive armour, though a definite identification is difficult. 
&gt; 
[More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWDkn-6mak) T-72's. Again, it's hard to tell what variants they are, but one wonders where they're getting so many T-72's when the modern UA pretty much exclusively operates T-64's. 
&gt; 
[Here we have a T-72BM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL-yofb3HzU), happily driving alongside an MT-LB Strela 10M and a BTR-ZD ""Skrezhet"" -- which is flying the flag of the Sevastopol Naval Infantry. That video was filmed outside Luhansk, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies [does not think it is a hoax](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28961080). 
&gt; 
[Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=2e1_1415920466), you have an interesting case of deja vu. The same MSTA-S, identified from Youtube videos, has been seen in Russia and Ukraine. It's worthy to note that those numbers are actually shorthand for ""oversized cargo"". 
&gt; 
Whilst people may suspect the [NATO satellite images](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/nato-satellite-photo-evidence-russia-lying-about-ukraine-2014-8), they corroborate what we've been seeing so far. 
&gt; 
So, in conclusion; just because Ukraine sometimes gets carried away doesn't mean Russia is not actively fighting a proxy war in the Donbass.

I'd also like to bring up the fact that we have *video evidence*, actual footage, of these Russian convoys. Columns of Kamaz trucks which stretch out literally for miles.

[Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=056_1409727656) we have a convoy of BMP's, Kamaz trucks and T-72's. Roughly 150 vehicles in all.

[Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=056_1409727656) we have a UAZ, a T-72 and a 2S1 Gvozdika in Donetsk Oblast. 

[Wonder where these rebels are getting hundreds of identical trucks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq1iBchjVFk)

[More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ladnBDs_Gg).

[More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPlew6Ee118&amp;feature=youtu.be)

[Yet more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgmxo7ImMQk#t=11)

Those videos are a pretty big step up from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodMqzF37ME), which is the sort of convoy you'd expect separatists to have. That was on the 28th of April. You've got a BTR, which they could have plausibly captured, as well as a civilian lorry and an anti-aircraft cannon towed by a bus.

I do not doubt that people can become very ill from Lyme disease, including the development of chronic conditions or sequelae; However, it should be noted that Chronic Lyme Disease, as a chronic infection, is not an accepted condition in the medical community or in the scientific literature, even though a minority of clinicians and advocates believe it is. This topic is so controversial, that the Connecticut Attorney General launched an investigation of normative treatment guidelines, forcing the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), the largest and preeminent professional organization of infectious disease clinicians in America, to assemble a panel of independent experts to review its guidelines. The panel was a year-long, transparent process, bringing together scientific and medical experts:

&gt; To ensure a fair and unbiased review of the 2006 guidelines, IDSA and the Attorney General jointly selected an ombudsman, Howard Brody, MD, PhD, an author and respected medical ethicist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Dr. Brody screened all potential Review Panel members for conflicts of interest using criteria jointly approved by the Attorney General and IDSA. The Review Panel was comprised of nine scientists and physicians from relevant disciplines who had not served on any previous Lyme disease guidelines panel.

&gt;The Review Panel’s work took more than a year to complete, with the group convening 16 times, including at an all-day public hearing in Washington, D.C. More than 150 individuals or organizations submitted evidence and other information including letters, newspaper articles, patient medical records and other materials on Lyme disease and its treatment.

&gt;“This was truly an extraordinary review process,” said Carol J. Baker, MD, who chaired the Review Panel and is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston. **“The final report includes more than 1000 citations, and after thoughtfully and carefully reviewing myriad materials, the panelists feel confident that advice to physicians treating Lyme disease should remain the same as set forth in the 2006 Lyme disease guidelines.”**

The 2006 guidelines for the treatment of Lyme disease state: 

&gt;As noted in the Review Panel report, **“In the case of Lyme disease, there has yet to be a single high quality clinical study that demonstrates comparable benefit to prolonging antibiotic therapy beyond one month.” The report also noted that “the inherent risks of long-term antibiotic therapy were not justified by clinical benefit.”**

Lyme disease is the source of *substantial* morbidity in the US and Europe, as well as some mortality. However, the science so far does not support the use of prolonged antibiotics for the treatment of Lyme disease. In fact, the use of antibiotics for this indication, is itself a source of unnecessary morbidity and cost to the system. Unfortunately, the belief in Chronic Lyme Disease is much like anti-vaccine beliefs: it is unfounded in the scientific literature but has been perpetuated by a minority of clinicians looking to make a name for themselves or promote other alternative medicines, such as homeopathy and naturopathy. The general public has very little ability to know any different, and so these myths continue, with very high consequences for uninformed patients.

The desperation was total with hyper-inflation and loss of hope for the future.

You know, for being a European you are woefully misinformed about your own history. First off, nearly none of the fighting from WWI occurred in traditional German territory. The Western Front was almost all in France and Belgium, and the armistice was signed prior to a full invasion of Germany. As a result, the economic and manufacturing regions of Germany were left untouched and they were ready to continue producing. For this reason, many Germans this led to a feeling of anger and resentment when they were forced to pay huge reparations by the French because they weren't truly ""defeated"". 

Second, the Weimar Republic didn't start off in debt, and while there was a period of super high inflation in the early 1920s, the currency was revalued and the inflation was under control by late 1923, a decade before Hitler was in power. While Germans certainly remember the episode well, it's not a clear cause and effect. 

Third, mainly France alone wanted to punish Germany with the huge reparations - Britain and specifically Keynes argued instead that the bill should not be nearly as high so that the German economy could function and therefore pay back the reparations and rebuild.

When that Allies broke through into Germany in WWII, General Eisenhower knew that they needed total defeat first, to crush the entire German nation and specifically the Nazi party, and then afterwards show humanity and rebuild the nation via the billions of dollars of aid (Marshall Plan). This proved to be a much more successful formula.

The first prequel came out when I was 12. I loved it just as much as the originals, though over time I've come to like it less just because of Jar Jar.

But Episodes II and III?

In my opinion those are the greatest in the entire series, completely blowing away everything in the original trilogy.

The galaxy is just teeming with life at the heights of civilization, there's more focus on universe-building and lore and less on just being an action series on par with Indiana Jones set in empty deserts, ice planets, swamps, and forests. But even the action is enhanced - the lightsaber duels are infinitely better, the force is actually a thing of power, and the battles are even more epic than what you see in the Lord of the Rings.

And to top it off, it is far more emotional, compelling and gripping than the original trilogy could ever hope to be.

Everyone saying the originals are better are judging it on technical reasons. If they looked at it from the heart - if they stretched out their feelings - they'd realize none of that matters. The prequels are just more beautiful, wondrous and magical in every way.

Even the midichlorians. Just like religion found a way to incorporate and work around science, so to did the Jedi and the Force. Giving the Force a technical label didn't kill it, it made it more tangible. Heck, you could even look at the degradation of society and technology between the prequels and the originals and come to the conclusion that the sciences greatly declined along with everything else, causing things such as the Force to be easier explained as a mystical ether instead of the technical term.

Also, before I end this, many people make fun of Obi Wan's big line ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes"" for being an absolute statement.

But this was the entire point. The Jedi and Sith are two sides of the same coin, but because they do not realize and embrace this fact as truth they are both blindly hypocritical. This is not the only reference to this - even the originals showed Obi Wan (a ""good"" guy) lying and manipulating several times. On the other side of the coin, we see Anakin doing terrible things despite his heart of gold - things he never wanted to do, but things he felt he had to do. ""So if neither side is truly evil or good, who is the right side?"" you ask.

Unfortunately, now that the Extended Universe is no longer canon, bringing up the Old Republic era seems pointless. But still, just as in my heart the prequels are better, in my heart the EU remains canon. So, the answer to that question would be the Revanists. Essentially a Star Wars equivalent to Taoism, Revanism sees both sides of the Force for what they are, holds both in balance and as such finds the true path to the Force and the serenity even the Jedi cannot attain.

Sadly, I don't think we'll ever see a trilogy on Revan - the greatest story in the entire Star Wars saga, even dwarfing both trilogies by far. But I digress and will now stop rambling.

Lots of interesting history, here.

Where the *New York Times* fantasizes about Russia ""annexing"" everything from east Ukraine to west Moldova, in reality, Russia has been consistent in advocating regional autonomy.  In Ukraine, in the spring of 2014, it advocated federalization as an alternative to secession.  And in Moldova, in 2000-2003, it offered the Kozak Plan for the reunion of Moldova and Transdniestria.  

If Transdniestria is independent today, it's not because of Russia: It's because Russia's Kozak Plan for an end to the conflict was rejected by the OSCE and the anti-Russia Communist Party of Moldova.  In other words, the ""frozen conflict"" was created by the Europhiles, when they tried to force all of Moldova into the E.U.'s pocket and rejected regional autonomy. 

In 2009, the E.U. used Maidan-style riots to cement its grip on Moldova.  A violent mob of students ransacked the Parliament Building, while the NATO-bloc admired their use of Twitter and urged them on.  Of course, when similar riots occurred in London two years later, the Twittering students were not so highly praised; just the opposite, they were condemned and put in prison.

A troika of pro-E.U. parties -- the Liberal party, the Democratic party and the Liberal-Democratic party -- won the early election that followed the riot.  

&gt; “The elections of 2009 were won by the parties which later formed the Alliance for European Integration, and after that these people never ceded power, and they won’t cede it peacefully in future,” says Svetlana Gamova, the main Moscow-based analyst on Moldova, who for almost 20 years served as Nezavisimaya Gazeta’s Chisinau correspondent. “In fact, the scheme later used in Kiev: “riots-control of the parliament building – early elections – iron grip on power” – this plan of action was first tested in Moldova,” Gamova said.

&gt; It appears that the new election will be no exception to this rule. The local court has already taken a very promising opposition party, Patria, off the ballot. The Constitutional Court recently stated that “opposing Moldova’s European integration” was an illegal activity. Meanwhile, polls show that 43 percent of Moldovans prefer integration with Russia and its Customs Union to the murky “European perspectives” promised by an Association Agreement which Moldova recently signed with Brussels. But who in Brussels has ever cared about the opinion of the electorate in Moldova, Ukraine – or in its own member states, for that matter? The battle has already been won by fists and Molotov cocktails – in 2009 in Chisinau and in 2014 in Kiev.

[*Merkel’s Russia policies have began to undermine her once unshakable political position, particularly in East Germany and with business elites. Her policies have also caused a deepening rift within the EU itself, with other countries such as Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria becoming increasingly vociferous in denouncing sanctions aimed at Russia that have impacted mostly their economies. In the past two weeks there has been a rash of articles pointing out the rifts that are beginning to appear within Germany and within the EU – see Mish. Also see Merkel, Clueless From the Start, Is Now Getting Desperate. and German Social-Democrats Warn Against Putin-Bashing (includes a rather fitting illustration of Merkel’s present place of residence). Losing positions in Russia to Asian companies has also not gone down well with German business. Meanwhile satire about German media parroting German government propaganda on Russia has become commonplace. So it appears to me that the US is trying to both prop up Merkel and to pressure her to stay the course. It remains to be seen whether Germany, as well as the rest of the EU, will finally realize that their interests and those of the US are divergent in regards to Russia but, to me, Packer’s profile is an indication that the US is concerned over losing its most valuable Euro poodle in Merkel.*](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/11/links-113014.html#comment-2363000)",False,vigorous,t5_2qh9a,1417398446,t3_2nuhc0,cmhhse6

[*“On June 6th, in Normandy, Merkel and Putin met for the first time since the crisis began, along with Obama, Hollande, Cameron, and Petro Poroshenko, the newly elected President of Ukraine, to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of D Day. News photographs showed Merkel greeting Putin like a disapproving hostess—lips pursed, eyebrows arched—while Putin’s hard features came as close to ingratiation as is physically possible. In the optics of power, she was winning. “This political isolation hurts him,” her senior aide said. “He doesn’t like to be left out.” (Russia had just been suspended from the Group of Eight.) Later, before lunch, Merkel orchestrated a brief conversation between Putin and Poroshenko. On the anniversary of D Day, Germany’s leader was at the center of everything. As Kurbjuweit put it, “That was astonishing, to see all the winners of the Second World War, and to see the loser and the country which was responsible for all this—and she’s the leader, everyone wants to talk to her! That is very, very strange. And this is only possible, I think, because it’s Merkel—because she’s so nice and quiet.” No doubt Merkel’s propaganda people wanted to paint the image of a fully reformed Germany that has gone from being a criminal to being a leader, with Merkel having played an integral part of that transformation. But adding in the image of a self-styled German Iron Frau reducing the Third Reich’s vanquisher to the position of a submissive supplicant reveals something rather dark deep down in Merkel and her circle, something that no sane person should allow to blossom again. Beware of the German revanchist pointing accusing finger at the Russian “revanchist”.*](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/11/links-113014.html#comment-2363000)

While it is very beautiful and sweet smelling, its has the ability to escape its ornamental confines in vine form, and then establish itself in the wild, where its aggressive vines creep around the forest floor, choking and out-competing many native understory species. Furthermore, sizable trees have been killed by those creeping Wisteria vines. When these large trees are killed, it opens the forest floor to sunlight, which allows the Wisteria seedlings to grow and flourish even more. 

Also, anyone who wants to see a good list of invasive species that are often sold at garden centers you should *definitely* avoid planting in your yard (depending on your zone), see [THIS LIST](http://imgur.com/a/PCLez) I made.

Lastly, you seriously over-estimate the skills of your city people. Running an ISP is a profession, they used to be public networks, bought up by companies because the local municipals weren't able to operate them.

Also consider that while SF is a rather big city, smaller cities really will have a hard time operating a network. Just try to attract the right labour for it isn't an easy job. Operating isn't an easy job. Being profitable (while we like to believe differently) isn't that easy. Comcast profit is only 10% which for a company isn't that excessive. If you are small such profit can easily turn into a 10% loss, is then you, the local civilian going to pony it up in extra taxes?

The problem isn't so much into the networks that are out there. It's the lack of regulation to get the ISPs in line that's the problem.

I think this is a very interesting debate so I did [a bit of analysis](http://imgur.com/4VHFpk8) on the performance of the big names at majors, my reasoning being this is where smashers are likely to perform their best. I couldn't do it for all tournaments (and couldn't really factor in EU tournaments, sorry Leffen) but I tried to account for how meaningful each of these majors were by assigning each a coefficient. 

The 9 tournaments I chose to be ""majors"" were Apex 2014, ROM 7, Pat's House 2, SKTAR 3, MLG Anaheim, CEO 2014, Kings of Cali 4, EVO 2014 and The Big House 4. It is hard to define since some tournaments have enormous attendance but not the big names (e.g. Fight Pitt V) and vice versa. Plus, some of these tournaments are qualifiers for the major majors but to discount SKTAR 3 and others would be unfair on many who put in great performances.

Anyway the list came out as this:

I don't expect this to agree with the MIOM list since they'll be accounting for all tournaments including EU tournaments and looking in a more qualitative way, trying to get a feel for the smasher's year, but there you go.

Things I agree with here:

Axe 7th, Plup high.

Things I disagree with:

Fly not higher, maybe Leffen &gt; Hbox, I was surprised how it turned out to be nowhere near as close as Armada/M2K. s0ft's rating is kind of... artificially high due to the MLG format. I fully expect Armada to get 2 over PPMD for the MIOM list.

The 1-5% Neanderthal DNA that some human population possess is not enough to suggest that we interbred with them to the point that they went extinct. 

* The 1-5% DNA interchange can be explained by a couple on interbreeding events. It does not mean that this phenomenon was ubiquitous across the Neanderthal population, nor did it have to be a common event. 

* We do know that Neanderthal populations were already in decline in much of Europe BEFORE humans even arrived, because they were not adapting to the climate change experienced there. We do know that a good majority of Neanderthals NEVER encountered humans, and went extinct on their own accord. Populations living in Central and Northern Europe never even met humans...how could they have been ""fucked"" to extinction?

* We do not know anything about the nature of these inbreeding events, or anything about the hybrids. Were these events consensual? rape? were the hybrids always fertile? did they have good vigour or were they of poor genetic quality and health?

* Finally, we have no evidence that Neanderthals have human DNA - e.g. the flow of DNA appears to be one direction.

Think of the 1-5% DNA being more of a side consequence of our mutual encounter, not the main reason why neanderthals went extinct.  Neanderthals went extinct because they could not adapt to their changing climate, and a better competitor (us) showed up at their doorstep.

They've successfully managed to link up with China. They signed huge monster deals with China this year that will come to fruition 5 years from now. 

Right now the biggest drag on their economy is the fact that the EU their largest market is facing a lost generation and is flirting with a Japanese style deflation nightmare. Once the Russians fully swing towards China they will have more opportunities to trade. The Chinese appetite for Natural gas is going to be insatiable.

back in 2013 it was the EU telling Ukraine to choose one side and Yanukovich, corrupted or not, choose to side with Russia because their offer was much better than the half-assed european version (The Russian offer was about 15 Bn USD plus a 30% discount on gas, no conditions. the European offer was 600m plus a chance of getting a single 1bn loan from the IMF and had several conditions like getting Tymoshenko out of jail).

the coup was endorsed by both the US and the EU *after* Russia got to keep Ukraine via simple diplomacy.

I assume you know that LIBOR stands for the London Interbank Offer Rate, that's literally what banks in Europe borrow from one another for short periods of time (usually daily).


That's an *extremely* low rate of interest, considering banks are pretty well capitalized and thus are usually able to borrow from one another at very low rates because the risk from bank to bank is considered to be fairly low.  Obviously things crop up like the S&amp;L crisis from time to time, but I would say pretty much without exception that LIBOR is -always- lower than what pretty much every consumer would be able to borrow at.  

That being said, rates are very low right now - they will *only* get higher as time goes on, guaranteed.  The Fed might put pressure to keep rates low through this year and next (which would put similar pressure on the EU and the Bank of London to do the same), but they will inevitably rise.  

Even if they do... I have a hard time believing they'll raise above what most student loans are fixed at.   It seems like a good deal to me, if there are no other caveats to the loan... can someone in consumer finance chime in on this?  It's very interesting to me.

So the German engineer can't quite wrap his head around the US maintenance situation. They ask him to make it more reliable, more maintenance free, because Honda, because US market, but he just keeps assuming it will see the garage waaaay more often than it's going to. He also drastically overestimates the skill of the average mechanic, which is I think consistent in Germany, but whipsaws all over the place in the US. Here a certified genius, there a guy too stupid to trust with a wrench, but he's got one anyway.

So the cars aren't maintained as expected, and half the time there's an idiot under the hood, making the situation worse, because it's not a Chebby, and he don't like faggy VWs or the faggits that drive em.

They were being legitimate screwups with cooling system design for a while. That didn't help. They still tend to get wacky with it. Too much complication, plus bleeding problems, plus the engineer designed it in steel, then the accountant made everything plastic.

In Germany, there's no import penalty on parts, but there is here, so the customer screams much louder every time. 

VW seems to design so that the maintenance awareness system is oversensitive. For example, a few cups of coolant get lost, and the warning light is on. It's all clearly designed to push more frequent maintenance so the car remains as close to it's design baseline as possible. But in the US, frequent maintenance=unreliable. In Germany, I suspect, frequent maintenance=what you should expect to do to any car.

In the US, the metaphorical standard for reliability is the hammer, which should never break unless you're trying hard to break it, or you've gotten a decade of use from it. Or two.

Asian makes and US Domestics just assume right away that these fucking rednecks are just gonna drive it into the fucking ground and then blame them when it breaks no matter what.

The systems are built from the ground up to expect piss poor maintenance, and you're lucky if you can get the punter to change the oil, much less bring it in for regular checkups. They want to pay for the car once, like a refrigerator, and never another dime unless they're having an arm twisted up behind their backs by circumstance. Then they blame the car anyway. They're angry enough they have to buy gas, to say nothing of maintenance.

It's shocking the Asians get it, and of course the Yankees do, so everything's designed expecting that all the tolerances will get completely the fuck out of spec after a while, but the car will still need to function. They spend money where VW doesn't, down in the guts, adding failsafes and allowances, putting a few more cents into the seals, expecting that none of it will ever see daylight until it's past warranty. They cheap out where VW spends, on interiors and bodywork. So you get all those older Asian cars that refuse to die even though the interiors were ugly garbage from the jump and the car's turned halfway back to dirt, just rusting, but it still starts at the touch of a key.

I think GM just designs all the important little specs on the sloppy side in the first place, so that when it's all gone to shit later, hey, fuckit, the thing will still limp along. 

Lights don't come on at all unless it's about to go kaboom, because informing the punter when things are a bit out of spec (cheap to fix) means that your car is a piece of shit now, because the light keeps coming on. In fact let's just not have any lights come on until it's out of warranty, then fuckem, not our problem. Basic capitalism. The customer understands and respects this. He'd certainly give you the same shaft if the positions were reversed. He bitches, but it's more like you beat him at poker fair and square.

I wonder if the Asian customer is also this maintenance adverse. Those makes pretty much started with a reputation for cheap shit, just because, only to come out of it with a rep for unkillable cars.

Either way, VW doesn't get this. They just don't. They keep building them like people are going to take care of them and in the US, they just won't. So VW=unreliable.

In actuality they'll just keep buzzing along with all manner of faults happening, which is how all these broke hippies keep getting to work. On par with everyone else, if not exemplary reliability.

NA has the most head to head wins counting ALL matches. EU has more finals and tournament wins and a better worlds performance. Get hyped for season 5 and let some friendly rivalry begin!

There are various powerful people or groups, with significant influence and varying degrees of cross chatter between them either directly (Bod sends Jim an e-mail) and indirectly (Jim repeats points in Bob's e-mail to Jane at a party). 

1) This has been a long time coming. The bank people bailing out those countries demanded austerity measures, Australia has a guy pushing for austerity measures, IIRC. Conservatism is a fairly popular school of thought all things considered, but its no more a conspiracy than Christianity, the Star Trek Fandom, or the anti-slavery movement.

2) There has been a global downturn in the economy. Obvious Europe got hit. Putin almost certainly listens to no one at all. Nobody is controlling Putin he decided to invade all on his own. 

3) The U.S. media loves crises. Ebola has killed a single American and listening to the media its the end of the world. And once again global economic downturn. No one has gone out of their way to destroy the Japanese Economy. 

4) Umm... the U.S. lets dictators run rampant, while providing them with material support and even weapons, all the time. But we are on really bad terms with Cuba. I don't even think we have an embassy there. And they are still embargoed. We have an embassy in much nastier dictatorships like Saudi Arabia. Shit we have tried assassination attempts.

If anything our response has been extra harsh. We certainly aren't ""soft on Cuba"". This isn't a thing. 

5) The U.S. using its clout to negotiate favorable terms isn't surprising. 

6) First of course, the rich are largely American. I mean America gets to control the world's reserve currency. 

 Kochs go to some effort to get their conservative view points into law. ALEC is the most prominent. You could find out more starting at Wikipeida. [Walmart lobbies too](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000367). Wikipedia, open secrets and similar would be good places to see what they are up to. However they do not seem to be in league with one another in any significant fashion. Plus, Wal-mart probably wouldn't like a lot of Koch ideas and visa versa. Wal-mart is heavily subsidized via welfare. Koch Brothers hate welfare. [Actually walmart has officially left ALEC](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/31/walmart-alec-membership_n_1558833.html)

Side note: How did you miss [Murdoch's media empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch)? That guy has a lot of influence. 

So basically there is a global economy linked through public stock exchanges, trade, banks etc. It hasn't been doing great. Some countries have gotten bailed out by a bank which loves austerity. Putin is an asshole who doesn't listen to anyone. The United States tries to negotiate treaties which favor it. Then you have two rich families that don't coordinate, but do lobby. 

There doesn't seem to be any real coordination between these groups.

Next point and this is important. **Emergent behavior can seem coordinated without any coordination.** If a bunch of people all act in their own self-interest groups of people with similar interests will act in similar ways. Furthermore with how easy communication is today an idea can rapidly spread much like a fad. There was no conspiracy of little kids to demand Bennie babies or pokemon. 

No conspiracy here. Just a bunch of groups doing stuff with no coordination. For more information I suggest opensecrets, wikipedia, the Economist, and Soc 101.

- City has many young fans. MANY. What we do lack is huge numbers in the 20-30ish generation (which I am in) because of how bad we were when those were growing up (kids tend to follow success), meaning United picked up many kids in that age group. But now, you see kids and teenagers all around Manchester in City shirts and the entire North Stand (which we attack in the 2nd half of games) is called the Family Stand for parents with kids. Our fan base tends to be young and middle aged or old, not so many in between which is probably affecting the atmosphere now as young adults tend to be the loudest. In 10 years, City will have a huge number of young adult fans. Right now, there is a group called the 1894 Group with quite a lot in this age range (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAFeyqg213g&amp;sns=tw).

- The empty stadium thing is absolute nonsense and a myth. We do have empty seats but I can assure you most of these are sold and it happens at every other ground in the league. Season ticket holders don't turn up for a variety of reasons. Seats on level 1, those which are on TV, are almost exclusively season ticket holders so bought and paid for. And despite being visible on TV, the majority of the stadium is full for most games. City's situation is not unique, it's the same as anywhere (attendances are lower for cup games except FA Cup) and all bar two league games in the past few years have sold every ticket available.

But because our rivals are United and United have the most fans and therefore the most online presence, a great number of myths and mistruths about our attendances have emerged. The reality is, City have had average attendances of 40,000+ since moving this stadium about a decade ago. In the 2003/04 stadium, our first after moving from Maine Road, City averaged 46,834, the third highest in the league. Last season, the average was 46,974, the 4th highest in the league. This season they are in the 45,000s because of reduced capacity due to the expansion.

City's attendances are in the top 15 on the European continent. So as you can see, there is a loyal and consistent fan base that has been there since long before the Arab money (unfortunately, for simple-minded folk having a rich owner turns 'long suffering loyal fans' into 'glory fans').

Even before the takeover, City had amazing attendances, usually higher than Chelsea and Liverpool. Right now, City have the 4th highest in the league behind United, Arsenal and Newcastle. Next year we will overtake Newcastle with the stadium expansion.

There is nothing really wrong with our fan base, it's just that when the said bollocks is repeated ad nauseum on Twitter and other social network, it becomes a viral myth.

The team is good, the club is good and fan friendly (but prices becoming less fan friendly, in line with all top clubs and the English football culture of greed), and our fan base is good and probably the least hostile of any top club (except when we play United).

But really you shouldn't need convincing to keep supporting a club... that isn't really what it's all about. YOU either like the club or don't, irrespective of what people say.

&gt;* A clear majority of Swiss voters have in a referendum decided against drastically limiting immigration to the country.

&gt;* Those in favour of limiting immigration had argued that a curb would ease pressure on the country's economy and environment.

&gt;* 

According to Ecopop, immigration is adding 1.1-1.4 percent annually to the Swiss population, putting the country on track to house up to 12 million people by 2050.

Realize that,  in part,  your message and cause has been hijacked for political purposes by people with a separate agenda that, while you may agree with it  has little or nothing to do with helping stop climate change.  

A perfect example can be found in Van Jones,  the former Green Jobs Czar for Obama.  He made several major speeches where he laid out a plan to fix global warming and social injustice by giving subsidies to Native Americans to put wind farms on their land,  and how by using global carbon taxes we could punish white people for all their social crimes and redistribute it to people they felt deserved it more.  

""Climate Change"" as an issue instantly became a social justice issue where some people should be punished and others rewarded based on politics.  It became about ""Fuck people who make things,  and fuck people who make a living off of oil""  and punishing the entire industrial world for their ""evils"" rather than about solving a scientific problem through innovation and adaptation.  

Surprisingly,  the people who were, litterally, told they were Satan ended up kinda resenting this,  and had quite the negative reaction.  They got defensive and answered back ""Well fuck you right back""  and thought that the completely political and personal attacks that were levels on them were devoid of any merit and were political attacks.  

You may want a more progressive society,  and that is totally your prerogative,  but when you politicize the issue of climate change into a social justice issue or any other ""us v them"" debate, you instantly isolate 50% of the population from being able to get behind you.  

Al Gore was your worst possible choice for a spokesman.  Had Neil Tyson started as the spokesman, someone who has done his best to be about the science and not the politics,  you would have seen a massive difference in the reaction from both sides.  

I think this is a major reason why the US had such a different reaction from Europe,  the spokesman here was involved in the single most divisive moment in the last 70 years of our politics.  

You could get everyone behind you, or at least a large amount of support from both sides,  if the issue were depoliticized and you take the demonization of industry and energy out of the Rhetoric.  ",False,King_of_Camp,t5_2qh1e,1417405743,t3_2nv2hn,cmhlfwj

I actually agree with you a LOT on Oblivion's setting; it was my first TES, but MAN did they miss an opportunity when they abandoned the jungle idea.   I think Skyrim actually managed to carve out a really unique spot thematically in the ""European medieval RPG"" genre of settings, though.  It's not as in-your-face weird and original as Morrowind, but it really feels like they ran with the 'ancient viking' theme and made it their own.   The expansions also really felt like they expanded the world a LOT, even if I felt like they rushed Dragonborn and left some of the more impressive bits of it to the modders.

I just don't see how any of this adds up to it being emblematic of an RPG golden age.  I'd also disagree with the idea that OB and Skyrim didn't bring anything original to the table.  To focus on OB, at least for me, the way that combat was so visceral was very new in an RPG.  No more randomly missed attacks for no reason deciding the fight.  Plus the archery in that game was really cool.  (Comparatively, I can't shake the feeling that Morrowind's combat was lackluster even by Daggerfall's standards.)  And I think that, despite a lackluster main storyline, Shivering Isles remains one of my favorite expansions to a game ever.   I LOVED the story there.

It's not like the series just took a nosedive after Morrowind.  It innovated in ways that many in the old vanguard hated, but which were well received by a LOT of other people.

Such a measure in no way captures a country's ability to repay its debt.

Consider that at the end if WWII, our country had most of its oil reserves still, had great room to expand, had barely begun to exploit the Ogallala Aquifer and still had vast fisheries, tens of thousands of factories to produce to sell to a devastated Europe and Asia.

Today, we have had over 50,000 factories closed in the past 40 years. And we are past the peak of oil discoveries and oil extraction. We have not had a positive balance of trade in over 30 years. Our Federal Reserve needs to print trillions to buy our bonds, just to keep our bonds bought and to keep interest rates low enough that we can still service our growing debt somewhat. Our government needs to borrow to spend just to keep our economy from crashing by 8% of GDP.

So we have far less wherewithal to service and repay our debt, which is why unlike soon after WWII, our debt to GDP ratio keeps grieving, not shrinking.

This state of affairs will see our economy and debt be like Japan's, not like Norway's, where their generous welfare state is bolstered by oil revenues and a sovereign wealth fund.

**I disagree that the action should be based on socioeconomic status** - which is against OP's view in accordance with CMV guidelines. This should fulfill the rule of challenging the view to ""however minor"" degree.

**I also disagree that the affirmative action should be based on any other status including race** - It is against OP's assumption but I believe that it made the debate here completely unfair and unnecessarily biased and in fact would amount to sopaboxing (we need affirmative action!) which *is* against the rules of this sub so I disregarded it. There are also two important reasons for that:

* Any argument *for* affirmative actions should be scientific rather than political and that it should be based on the program's actual results and efficiency. Therefore since it is rather obvious that it doesn't work as a general principle changing the criteria of allocation of resources is illogical and pointless because it doesn't address the causes of the program's failure. It just changes the political constituency which benefits.

* In America in particular there is high enough correlation between poverty and race that changing the criteria from ""black"" to ""poor"" is really no significant change at all other than expanding it to other impoverished communities which will make the program even more unmanageable and problematic.

Below the edited original post:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me preface this by saying that I am a European so I am free from certain cultural bias that Americans share - that is to say I am not racist because I don't approve of welfare for blacks. I am also fairly well acquainted with American politics and history so I do know what happened.  I also studied economics - and even taught it for a time -  so I do have the knowledge which helps solving socio-economic issues in a scientific way without resorting to overt politics.

Affirmative action is a program which works along the rules of **zero-sum game** within a given demographics by assigning higher priority in access to resources to some individuals *at the expense of others*. It is not a program which works by increasing the *total* pool of available resources but just re-assigns who gets to use them within the same initial parameters. It also typically works from the bottom up which means that it is the *least* advantageous people who get thrown off the lists to make space for the privileged ones. It is therefore deeply unethical in terms of an egalitarian approach in a society.

Technically speaking affirmative action should not be implemented at all for any purposes *if you really care about long-lasting effects*. There is a whole lot of economic and psychological reasons why it doesn't work, is a waste of resources and works often to the detriment of society. As a matter of fact in terms of society-wide effects understood in net terms and without racial bias there is *no* evidence that it works other than the obvious fact of special treatment for black and other minority individuals - which is a political criterion not a scientific one.

It is important to understand that there is a difference between affirmative action understood as a political slogan (as Obamacare or example) and the actual program classified in actual economic terms. In political terms affirmative action includes *all* programs aimed to help the blacks. In economic terms it only includes *selective welfare and preferential treatment* and should be treated distinctly from other general-purpose welfare programs.

Affirmative action works by lowering standards for performance for selected individuals whenever taken into consideration for a job, place in a school, access to resources, welfare or government grants or any other similar situation. It works under the assumption that rather than do something to help improve the results it is better to adjusts the thresholds so as to low-performing individuals will not be rejected.  It does nothing to address the causes of the low performance of said ethnic groups - that is the purpose of selective welfare or welfare in general. As a matter of fact affirmative action results in the direct opposite - by removing incentives for self-improvement, increased discipline, adjusting your plans to realistic options in the future etc.

The best evidence for the lack of results is the comparison for two culturally  distinct ethnicities in America - Black and Asian. Blacks were the main (or even *only* ) recipient of affirmative action aid while Asians largely made do on their own. The result (cultural factors aside) Blacks as a group are entirely dependent on welfare and government help and suffer disproportionately from any adverse activity (like the ""not racist at all"" war on drugs) while Asians constitute the most educated and highest earning demographic.

Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell - two very prominent and outspoken black economists - usually liked to point out that before the affirmative action era blacks had lowest rates for divorce and pregnancy out of wedlock beating even the religious whites. Right now they are at the absolute bottom replaced by... you guess who.
 
The question is now whether there's indeed any difference between affirmative action targeting race and affirmative action targeting low socio-economic status, typically poverty.   Technically - no. Practically - it is no longer affirmative action and becomes a more typical general purpose welfare targeted at the poor and the low-earners. A better example of how such a program works can be seen in Europe where many poor immigrants of various ethnicities use the welfare system in this way.

In Europe which has a much more broad welfare nets organized around income rather than ethnicity it has precisely the same effect only with a slightly different intensity and characteristics. There was a study done a couple of years ago which pointed out that in terms of pure demographics Europe has greater social mobility than America - which is mostly due to the more general nature of welfare in Europe compared to very selective approach in America. But recently more and more the poor start  to resemble exactly the American black minority (only mostly Arabs here, black Africans are not-so-close second). That's in large part precisely because of the welfare nets which are given to the immigrants in a different, more arbitrary and more selective fashion.

Coming from very poor and unstable countries are very often too content with the drastically improved living situation they often refuse to integrate properly they have children who grow up as second-generation immigrants but they do in an environment that is essentially Pakistan transplanted into Sweden. That puts them at a cultural and economic disadvantage because while they come from typically low income families unlike their parents they are not able to compare it to the old conditions in their parent's home country. The lack of proper context  makes them angry, unwilling to blend in and often completely reject the new society. Often this happens even when they make some sort of economic advancement but at a high cost because they have to transgress not only working-class upbringing and culture but also religion, national and ethnic heritage etc and they do - still unfortunately - suffer from cultural prejudice. An immigrant from Poland or Hungary only has to learn the language because the countries are not very different from Britain or Germany. Only the pay is different. An immigrant  from Iran has to learn the language, learn new customs which affect the lifestyle, bridge an economic gap which is much larger than for former soviet countries and often deal with family which is much farther away. 

So how does affirmative action (or selective welfare in European case) come into the picture. It makes things **too easy** in an unsustainable, artificial way. It makes the same mistake as NINJA mortgage loans. Puts people in a position where they can't cope as well as they would otherwise.  It doesn't really change any of the underlying issues it smooths the initial hurdles... until it doesn't anymore. Then since you did nothing to change your conditions you still need welfare.  That's why blacks have failed to improve their socioeconomic condition in America and that's why increasingly immigrants to Europe (but also welfare-dependents native population!) create a similar semi-pathological underclass.

So to sum things up while welfare has many negative economic results nothing is more counter-productive or destructive to  natural, spontaneous improvement of someone's economic status than arbitrary, targeted welfare and affirmative action. It eliminates incentives for self-improvement and reinforces current faults. It doesn't allow for development of self-reliance and economic independence and creates a sense of entitlement 

The difference between allocating limited resources according to skin colour or the size of income is completely irrelevant. The results are the same. It is much better - if one really wants to have welfare and government involved for philosophical or political reasons - to provide society-wide nets of public education, healthcare etc which treat everyone equally. It will still create differences because human society inherently abhors equality but those differences will be natural and will not stand in the way of long-term improvement of socioeconomic status.

Leaders of Warsaw Pact governments were puppets. Leaders of South Vietnam were puppets. Various leaders of various countries at various times in Latin America were U.S. puppets. Iran made a huge amount of money as an oil exporter but that oil was sold to Europe where Europeans paid for it. The U.S. Navy kept the sea lanes safe and the CIA kept the Soviets away.

However, that doesn't mean that only the anti-climate-change people are kept out.  You can also see scientists submit papers that are later proven to be inaccurate, for many possible reasons:  they could have skewed the results to be more noteworthy for a higher publication chance, they could have altered the testing methods to make the results fall more in line with what their sponsors are hoping for, they even could have accidentally had a ""control"" group or a ""test"" group that was vastly different from the rest of the subjects, creating results that can't be replicated without that unknown variable being accounted for in the same fashion.

Moving back specifically to climate change, I can't even begin to say with certainty what the issues with your linked reports even could have been, but a likely bet would be that it relied heavily on one of [Roy Spencer's ""Ten Good Skeptical Arguments""](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/06/top-ten-global-warming-skeptic-arguments-debunked), which I will copy here (in italics), complete with a scientific answer (in regular type in-between the arguments) to what was posed as a ""difficult"" ""question"" (you can check in the link for sources to each response fact), or something similar to one of those arguments.

&gt;1, *No Recent Warming. If global warming science is so ""settled"", why did global warming stop 15 years ago, contrary to all ""consensus"" predictions?*

&gt;Quite simply, it hasn't. Even global surface temperatures (which is how Spencer is likely measuring 'global warming', although they only account for about 2% of the Earth's warming), have warmed about 0.2°C over the past 15 years, according to the best available measurements. More importantly, the planet has continued to accumulate heat at a rate equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second over the past 15 years.

&gt;2, *Natural or Manmade? If we don't know how much of recent warming is natural, then how can we know how much is manmade?*

&gt;We do. The IPCC stated with 95% confidence that most of the global warming since 1950 is human-caused, with a best estimate that 100% is due to humans over the past 60 years. The IPCC was able to draw this conclusion with such high confidence because that's what the scientific evidence and research clearly and consistently concludes.

&gt;3, *IPCC Politics and Beliefs. Why does it take a political body (the IPCC) to tell us what scientists ""believe""? And when did scientists' ""beliefs"" translate into proof? And when was scientific truth determined by a vote…especially when those allowed to vote are from the Global Warming Believers Party?*

&gt;The IPCC merely organizes the world's top climate scientists every 5 to 7 years. It's those scientists who summarize the up-to-date status of the scientific research in their respective fields of expertise. The IPCC report and the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming are themselves not proof of anything. They summarize and reflect the scientific evidence – that vast body of evidence is the reason the consensus exists.

&gt;4, *Climate Models Can't Even Hindcast. How did climate modelers, who already knew the answer, still fail to explain the lack of a significant temperature rise over the last 30+ years? In other words, how to you botch a hindcast?*

&gt;Global surface temperatures have risen more than 0.5°C over the past 30 years. That rise is significant, both in the statistical and figurative sense. Climate models have accurately reproduced that rise.

&gt;5, *…But We Should Believe Model Forecasts? Why should we believe model predictions of the future, when they can't even explain the past?*

&gt;Climate models have accurately reproduced the past, but let's put them aside for a moment. We don't need climate models to project future global warming. We know from past climate change events the planet will warm between about 1.5 and 4.5°C from the increased greenhouse effect of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (the 'climate sensitivity').

&gt;In a business-as-usual scenario, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are expected to surpass 900 ppm by 2100 – that's close to two doublings from the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. Hence we know that business-as-usual will cause between 2.5 and 7.5°C (most likely 5°C) warming if we stop carbon dioxide levels from rising beyond about 900 ppm. This is based on simple math and what we know about the physics of the climate – no fancy models needed.

&gt;6, Modelers Lie About Their ""Physics"". Why do modelers insist their models are based upon established physics, but then hide the fact that the strong warming their models produce is actually based upon very uncertain ""fudge factor"" tuning?

&gt;Putting aside the accusation that hundreds of climate modelers are all liars – the answer is that their models are indeed based upon well established physics. NASA climate modeler Gavin Schmidt's TED talk on the subject is well worth watching.

&gt;Spencer's question likely refers to the uncertain size of the cooling influence of aerosols. However, that is a physical uncertainty. We don't have very good measurements of this effect; unfortunately the rocket carrying NASA's Glory satellite that had instruments to measure the climate effect of aerosols crashed two years ago. Nevertheless, climate models use the available data to account for their influence, and their projections include the associated uncertainties.

&gt;7, *Is Warming Even Bad? Who decided that a small amount of warming is necessarily a bad thing?*

&gt;We're headed for about 5°C global surface warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 if we continue on a business-as-usual path. 5°C is the difference between average temperatures now and those during the last ice age. That's not ""small"" by any stretch of the imagination. As for who decided that amount warming is a bad thing – climate scientists researching the impacts of climate change.

&gt;8, *Is CO2 Bad? How did carbon dioxide, necessary for life on Earth and only 4 parts in 10,000 of our atmosphere, get rebranded as some sort of dangerous gas?*

&gt;Carbon dioxide itself is not ""bad."" Water is also necessary for life. Too much water will kill you. Too much carbon dioxide causes dangerous climate change. Greenhouse gases were determined to be pollutants as defined in the US Clean Air Act . This was a ruling of the (politically conservative) US Supreme Court.

&gt;9, *Do We Look that Stupid? How do scientists expect to be taken seriously when their ""theory"" is supported by both floods AND droughts? Too much snow AND too little snow?*

&gt;This question is a bit like asking, ""Do I look fat?"". Do you want an honest answer?  
&gt;The warming of the atmosphere, happening especially at high latitudes, reduces the temperature difference between higher and lower latitudes. This tends to make storms move more slowly. This results in storms dumping more precipitation in localized areas, which causes more flooding in those areas and droughts outside of them. Higher temperatures also increase evaporation, exacerbating droughts and adding more moisture to the air for stronger storms. A climate scientist should understand these concepts.

&gt;10, *Selective Pseudo-Explanations. How can scientists claim that the Medieval Warm Period (which lasted hundreds of years), was just a regional fluke…yet claim the single-summer (2003) heat wave in Europe had global significance?*

&gt;There is no contradiction here – a regional event can have global significance, for example via economic impacts. In any case, the Medieval Warm Period was a regional phenomenon and the planet as a whole was cooler than today.

The next one is number 11, but it originated from the same blog post that the others did, and it was answered in the same Guardian article, so I am including it here.

&gt;11, *(Spinal Tap bonus) Just How Warm is it, Really? Why is it that every subsequent modification/adjustment to the global thermometer data leads to even more warming? What are the chances of that? Either a warmer-still present, or cooling down the past, both of which produce a greater warming trend over time. And none of the adjustments take out a gradual urban heat island (UHI) warming around thermometer sites, which likely exists at virtually all of them — because no one yet knows a good way to do that.*

&gt;Ironically, most of the adjustments to Spencer's own satellite temperature data set have been in the warming direction, so this question may be an example of psychological projection. Scientists also recently identified a problem in Arctic temperature data analysis that's leading to an incorrect adjustment in the cooling direction, and there have of course been other cooling adjustments in the surface temperature record. The urban heat island effect has also been demonstrated over and over to have no significant influence on the surface temperature record.

Overall, the scientific community is, by and large, ready and willing to change their beliefs on how the world works, but it requires solid evidence that can be recreated a near-infinite number of times by a near-infinite number of independent tests (obviously, since time is a constraint, we don't really require it for every single new understanding to be accepted, but it does have to hold up to stress-testing under varying conditions), and as our understanding of our world has improved (such as our ability to accurately predict the future's weather, increasing from ""dark cloud in sky, Zeus probably sad today"" to ""chance of rain on Sunday: 60%, with a high of 85 and a low of 57""), we have also largely become better at finding the potential issues with new ideas.",False,nadrewod,t5_2qh1e,1417410106,t3_2nv2hn,cmhnhau

What I see as the crux of the issue is that there are varying degrees of 'Being too late'. There are levels at how bad the effects of global warming will be, the longer we wait the worse it will be.

For example, when combating say a nasty plague, its easy to look at it and say ""The best option is if we contain the 10 people who are sick and limit the spread."", but there are deniers saying ""10 people isn't a plague, it probably is just the flu hitting them very hard..""... the plague spreads, people walk around cities, take public transit, etc. all while coughing, sneezing, etc. The longer we wait, the more people are infected, the more people infected, the more who will die from this plague in the long run.

I'm saying modern day Iranians are an amalgam of various **ancient** Iranian tribes with a single **modern** Iranian identity, but with regional cultural and linguistic variance (e.g. the cultural and linguistic difference between Gilakis and Baluchis and Bakhtiaris. All speak slightly different regional languages and have slightly different cultures, but all can be said to have an Iranian identity. They are **much** more similar to each other than they are to Georgians, Gulf Arabs and North Indians.)

**&gt; but are only collectively called Persian because the West called their country Persia?**

Yes.

**&gt; The language that modern day Persians speak is a direct descendent of Old Persian** 

Modern Persian is a descendant of Middle Persian, which was a descendant of Old Persian. These weren't step changes however, but subtle transitions over hundreds of years.  

**&gt; whereas none of the other Iranian languages are directly descended from an Old Iranian language,**

What? Of course they are. They didn't just suddenly spring up out of nowhere. Kurdish, for example, is descended from Parthian, with Medean and Old Persian influences. Persian is the largest and most spoken language because the first people to unify the country were Persian and used it as the administrative language so it became the most widespread. 

**&gt; so that would mean Persians are a surviving ancient ethnic group that assimilated many other ancient ethnic groups around them.**

I don't see how that conclusion can be reached by that argument at all. By definition if they assimilated many other ethnicities, they're not the same original ethnicity anymore.

**&gt; Yes, it is true that the Persians were named by the West. Back then, the Western Iranians fighting the Macedonians called themselves ""Aryii"" and their language ""Arya"",**

No, this isn't what I was saying. The Achaemenids (before Cyrus) were based in Persis (roughly the modern province of Fars) and spoke Parsi so the Greeks called the country Persia. The Persians assimilated some of their neighbors and considered themselves Aryans. The Sasanids considered themselves Persians but called their country Iran (or Eranshahr). The Romans called the country Persia because that's what the Greeks called it. Fast forward to the Safavids, for example. They called their country Iran but Europeans continued to call it Persia because that's what the Greeks and Romans called it. This carried on until 1935 when Reza Shah put an end to it. 

**&gt; Also, historically speaking, were the Parthians and Persians the same ethnic group or distinct ones?**

They were distinct groups with distinct (but very similar) languages. The Parthians were based in north-east Iran, roughly Khorasan. The Ashkanian dynasty were ethnic Parthians. 

**&gt; And how were the Medians and Persians fused into one people?**

Inter-marriage mostly.

**&gt; they didn't speak the same language**

Their languages were similar enough to be mutually intelligible. We don't even know if the Medeans themselves considered a separate language. In his Geographica, Strabo said that the Persians, Medeans, Sogdians, Bactrians, Arians, and Scythians all spoke essentially the same language. 

Once Old Persian took over as the main administrative language, it incorporated a lot of the Medean language. In linguistics this is called a substratum. Modern Persian has a lot of Medean loanwords. Medean was also (as a language) very close to Avestan, so it worked its way into Old Persian in religious matters. The Sasanids were hardcore Zoroastrian zealots, and Pahlavi (this word itself is derived from Medean ""Fahla"") again incorporated a lot of Medean. 

**&gt; Their descendants, the Kurds and Azeris(?) are proof of them being separate from the Persians.**

(quoting yourself)

the way you phrased this clearly shows how you feel betrayed by the writing, in the same way that some SW fans don't like it that a lot of EU stuff isn't canon anymore. This is certainly not looking at Beginnings ""on its merits as I see them, not out of bias against everything new."" Your post clearly implies that the reason you don't like those aspect of Beginnings is because they're not like they were in ATLA (""undermines everything we thought"" etc).

I wasn't being ""dismissive"" about anybody's opinion. I just called it out as I saw it with what you're all saying.

I still absolutely think that you're seeing this in the ""wrong way,"" because the new information they introduced doesn't contradict anything that they had shown before. The origin of bending was simply expanded. Saying that you don't like it because it undermines the importance of the original benders is literally what ""not liking it because it's new"" means. The way they used the lion turtles in the beginnings episodes was great. You may not like it personally, but saying that you don't like them because they somehow undermine the other lore doesn't sound like a good reason (other than literally meaning ""I don't like it because it's not the other thing."") Bending is much more than just being able to produce fire or air. I would actually say that they managed to explain bending without diminishing the role of the oriiginal masters at all.

I also don't think that anybody has any problems with the lion turtles per-say. The problem people have with it is its use as a deus ex machina in ATLA, but at least within the context of Beginnings, there's nothing like that going on with the lionturtles.

Castaway narratives are not new. The castaway has been an enduring theme throughout history, as a glance at various Wikipedia entries on the topic will show. 

Still, how do Enlightenment castaway narratives differ? 

It is important to note that such narratives were concomitant with other important historical events, such as the creation of colonies by European countries other than Spain or Portugal. It was concomitant also with an expansion in travel for those who were not part of the elite at the end of the 18th century and into the 19th. This was also a time when all of Latin America was suddenly open to foreign travelers, after Alexander von Humboldt ""rediscovered"" that continent and was hailed as the ""second Columbus."" This was also after the new republics got rid of Spain's policy of keeping foreigners out; this inaugurated a ""re-invention"" of Latin America, to use Marie Louise Pratt's term. 

Given this situation, it is hardly surprising that new colonial enterprises would enjoy fictional accounts of the lone European stranded amongst the savages, who yet asserts his or her superior will and educates and teaches the natives, so as to be able to claim, as Robinson Crusoe did, that they were kings in these new realms. 

 If we take the case of Germany, Susanne Zantop argued that because Germany was not a colonial power until the very end of the 19th century, they created ""fantasies"" of German colonies in literature. Castaway narratives showed how Germans would be better colonists, if not the best. This is especially important to note since the new colonial powers were not ""backwards"" and ""unenlightened"" Catholic nations, like Spain and Portugal. Spain and Portugal did it all wrong. The enlightened Protestant nations of Europe would show how to do it right, in the moral sense or in the economical sense.

He's talking about the Jewish people. I'm not sure what else you might be thinking.

&gt;Concerning orthodoxy and the holocaust I think it makes sense... as the religious were very encouraged to stay and not go to israel and america... 

A very popular oversimplification of the reality.

&gt;if you read the 3rd paragraph on orthodox judaism in [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism) there's an estimate that 50-70% of jews killed were orthodox, which is 3-4 million, now when you consider the fact that today orthodoxy is estimated at 10-20% of the jewish population, and this is after decades of high birthrates and secular assimilation, that there are today around 2 million orthodox.  so maybe half that in in 1945? it seems as if 3/4 of orthodoxy was wiped out and orthodoxy was very disproportianately affected.

You have here, in my opinion, a series of compounded errors and false assumptions. Most of these estimates are based on the assumption that the bulk of Eastern European Jews were Orthodox. However that assumption is itself problematic, for a number of reasons. The most obvious reasons are that, (1) while older Jews in Eastern Europe were still predominantly observant, their children often were not, and (2) the assessment of ""Orthodoxy"" can be subjective, and what is perceived as Orthodox by a secular statistician will often be seen as barely tradition by those who take halacha seriously. However, I suspect the main reason for this assumption is simply a false perception of Eastern European Jewry as Anatevka, populated by Tevye the milkman and all his picturesque friends. However, that had ceased to be the reality decades earlier. (And of Tevye's three daughters that got married, only *one* married a religiously observant Jew.)

The second problem is your assumption that the challenge of assimilation ended with the Holocaust. However, the reality is that Orthodoxy continued to experience large scale defections well into the Sixties, and most observers expected Orthodoxy to disappear entirely by the end of the century.

There is no question that a huge portion of the Orthodox population was killed out in the Holocaust, and I suspect that the Orthodox Jewish community was indeed disproportionately affected. However this is not because most of the victims of the Holocaust were Orthodox, but simply because the overwhelming majority of Orthodox Jews were in Eastern Europe. There was a very large Jewish population in America, which was entirely spared from the Holocaust, but there were very few fully observant Orthodox Jews in that population.

&gt;it bothers me when I hear the religious go on about the holocaust saying that this happened because *someone else* has done xyz, 

While understandable, this is a misinterpretation of what I am attempting to convey. First of all, the Jewish people are all interconnected. When large numbers of Jews turn away from the Torah, this means that the problem exists in *all* of us, including those who are apparently still fully observant. There are many sources that discuss this idea, and even go so far as to say that, ultimately, the failure lays with the rabbis and Torah scholars who failed to provide the proper guidance to the Jewish people. To interpret this basic Jewish teaching as an attempt to cast blame on others and thereby absolve ourselves of responsibility is  simply wrong.

(At this point, I'm pissed about the usage of ""lol"" regarding the Holocaust, but I press on)

Me: Come on! They were an Axis power in World War II!

Friend: Wait, there were two of them?


(I gave up at this point. I'm not mad at people like that. I just hate the teachers who failed them

- Re: Passive Aggressiveness

Please report, and if you are concerned we might not get the nuance, then PM us. Mods may miss comments here and there **especially** if they're not being reported. Keep in mind that people are posting from all over the world. ""Bless her heart"" might be a non-issue to someone from Europe or Asia, but for an American Southerner, it may be an obvious slight. There also may be contextual insults between two individuals, not cultural at all.

We're not omniscient and won't a lot of the context behind perceived slights. *Let us know* your thoughts instead of giving abstract complaints about how mods aren't doing exactly what you expect them to. 

Some members will refuse to report as they actually *want* insults to be out in the open to be seen (possibly because those insults discredit the person throwing them). One of the commenters here admitted to exactly that! If no one cares about a specific comment enough to report it, then you shouldn't expect the mods to care either, except for the most egregious cases.

- Re: Mod bias

We have frequently gotten complaints from both rpers and bpers about mod bias. Some of the same individuals who complain about mod bias are the ones being defended behind the scenes from multiple insults... insults that are regularly hurled at them for their own provocative natures.

I can't claim that there is no bias at all, because in my personal opinion, ""fairness"" is an illusion. There will always be some imbalance or loopholes/technicalities in an existing system for aware individuals to exploit. That says more about the ""fuckwads"" as CFRP calls them than it does about mod teams in general. 

I *can* say this though. There's no conspiracy or deliberate bias by mods as a team. Members who PM the mods about their concerns are PMed back with comprehensive responses explaining our decisions. They are allowed to make their points fairly. If you haven't PMed us at all with your concerns, then don't claim to know our thoughts and intentions.

- Re: Mod inactivity

Mods are generally active. Even during Thanksgiving Weekend, where a lot of us were busy, the longest stretch of inactivity was 11 hours. This isn't a full-time job for us. While that isn't an excuse, it's a call for some consideration. 

Consider the hypothetical fuckwad who has nothing better to do than screw with all of us whenever possible. He or she will post a thread like, *""How do red pill men feel about their mothers being slutty whores like all women are?""* It will slip by for an hour or two and someone will be bound to see it before the mods remove it.

It is true that they never promised they would, and the USSR hated this part of their collapse. There's a good article my John Mearsheimer explaining the [Russian perspective of NATO expansion](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141769/john-j-mearsheimer/why-the-ukraine-crisis-is-the-wests-fault). Regardless *how* NATO is expanding, it is. It's not like NATO is strategically deciding to surround Russia, rather eastern europe is trying to join it themselves. 
  
And yes as sovereign independent nations they have that right. 
  
But you have to understand that the entire history of Russia is an attempt at building some sort of barrier between it and potential enemies. It's mostly flat land, and they have no good natural defenses except a tough winter. The United States has two oceans, France only has one land side where they can focus all their defenses, Italy only has two small flanks, etc. But Russia has nothing. Their history has therefore been built upon building client buffer states to shield Moscow and the heart of Russia. 
  
If Ukraine as a whole were to eventually join NATO, that would be right on Russia's border. 
  
What you have to remember is that NATO was built entirely as a response to the Russian threat. It was designed to balance the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact dissolved with the USSR, but NATO didn't. As such, Russians see no purpose to NATO except to threaten Russia. I mean.. that *is* what it was designed for really.
  
 
So while sovereign states like Ukraine reserve the right to choose their own destiny free from hard power coercion, and NATO is *not* actually a malevolent force bent on neutralizing Russia, you have to understand the root of Russian fears. It is pretty legitimate. They have expanded it with this propaganda beyond what it should be, but fears of NATO enlargement are largely valid in my opinion.",False,slappymcnutface,t5_30hhs,1417414799,t3_2nv4lq,cmhp8qq

Zou leuk zijn als we dat konden afdwingen, want dan zijn we ook meteen van die buitenlandse haatimams af die hier steeds op bezoek komen, maar dan krijgen we waarschijnlijk de EU op ons dak over vrijheid van geloof.

&gt;The __Dervish state__ ([Somali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_language): *Dawlada Daraawiish*, [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): دولة الدراويش‎ *Dawlāt ad-Darāwīsh*) was an early 20th-century [Somali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_people) [Sunni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam) [Islamic state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_state) that was established by [Muhammad Abdullah Hassan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Abdullah_Hassan), a religious leader who gathered Somali soldiers from across the [Horn of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa) and united them into a loyal army known as the *Dervishes*. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands claimed by the Somali [Sultans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan), the [Ethiopians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia) and the [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) powers. The [Dervish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dervish) State acquired renown in the [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_world) and [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_world) worlds due to its resistance against the European empires of [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). The Dervish forces successfully repulsed the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) in four military expeditions, and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.  As a result of its fame in the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East) and [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), the Dervish State was recognized as an ally by the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) and the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire).   It also succeeded at outliving the [Scramble for Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa), and remained throughout [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) the only independent Muslim power on the continent.  After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920, when Britain used [aeroplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroplanes) to bomb the Dervish capital of [Taleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taleh).

Go to Europe and you will see a much broader audience; I've always been bowled over by how many young twenty-somethings will just go and enjoy a night at the opera, in the same way that the next night they'd go to the cinema and the following night to see a band at a pub. It's just another part of the cities entertainment and culture and people of all walks of life go.

The difference? Funding. Opera in Australia is simply not funded enough to be able to sell cheaper tickets. It relies on expensive tickets, so it's audience is old rich and white. Opera in Europe IS funded, so anyone can afford to enjoy it, and they do.

Now whether or not YOU like opera is immaterial. There are plenty of people out there that do like it but can't afford to go regularly, or that would like it if they were exposed to it and could afford to go. Many many MANY people appreciate incredible singing and music, even if you don't.

The challenge is that opera pretty much can't get any cheaper. It is labour intensive, skill intensive, experience intensive (you cant do it with young, cheap inexperienced graduates) etc etc. That's a fact that economic rationalists just can't digest. They want it to be cheaper and pay for itself.

It can't and it won't. So we should either look at funding it properly, or we should just let it die. Rename the Sydney Opera House the McDonalds Corporate Entertainment Hub. Which might make YOU happy as you didn't like it, but would make many others incredibly unhappy, and close off an entire industry of careers within Australia.

Because of the historical significance of the area and its relation to ""Jews"" (Hebrews), Palestine was an obvious option. While there were mostly Arabs living in the area, there were also Jews living in the area for thousands of years. There had never been a ""Palestinian State"" because the area had been occupied by foreign powers (Ottomans, then the British) for quite some time- thus while the majority of the people in Palestine identified as ""Arab,"" they didn't really identify as ""Palestinian."" Around the time that Jews started moving to Palestine and buying up swaths of land, this started to change and there was more of a push towards ""Palestinian"" rather than ""Arab"" nationalism. Unfortunately, by the time that this happened, persecution of Jews in Russia and Western Europe (Holocaust) led to greatly accelerated Jewish immigration to Palestine such that by the time the UN Mandate was proposed, the areas assigned to a Jewish state had a majority Jewish population. Thus, in short, the Jewish state was created in what was thought at the time to be ""land unclaimed by any nation"" when in reality the native Arab people of the land were just starting to become a ""nation"" with a distinct identity. As far as why Israelis are opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state today- there are a variety of reasons, but it really comes down to the fact that many Israelis have lived their entire lives in fear of losing their own state, and so this fear keeps them from acting in a way that they would normally consider fair and rational.

The problem is every bank offers 2fa authentication for large scale accounts. If you are dealing with millions of dollars on a daily basis, your account is not protected by a 2 byte passphrase (your PIN).  


That is part of my argument, but I'm not sure we watched the same video. We're talking about personal credit and debit cards, not accounts that deal with millions of dollars on a daily basis.

&gt; European banks have had smart cards for a long time which is the same idea (a heavily encrypted passphrase providing authentication), US banks are just now rolling this out to the masses.  


I agree this is a step in the right direction. I think it's more important however, to differentiate between push and pull transactions. People authorizing a transaction with a private key are *pushing* money to the merchant, not having it drawn from their account (that wouldn't be possible). The reason card theft works is because the thieves can *pull* money from your account, just due to the way things have been set up traditionally.

&gt; Yes your money was wide open for taking but that's why they offer insurance. You can expect bitcoin and similar technologies to take off because it doesn't require insurance and it's the same game banks have been playing before.  


The *they* offering insurance is the banks. This is an issue for them and the account holder. Yes, I expect banks to realize the potential of Bitcoin. I really can't tell whether you agree or disagree with me.

On the contrary, that's one of the main basis of my argument.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, instead of graciously accepting victory, Nato continued to expand and surround Russia.  You try to make out Nato as some sort of Alcoholic Anonymous where everybody is welcome.  It's not.  It is a political military body created for a specific purpose.  If smaller countries were feeling vulnerable, there were other ways Nato could have alleviated that, instead of the most aggresive option of accepting them into a military pact created to oppose the SU/Russia, and therefore surround and expand right onto Russian borders.  It's not about the right of smaller countries to join Nato; it's about the Nato being pragmatic and reasonable and not threaten the national security of their one time enemy, who was then at a very vulnerable position.  
  
Your opinion about the possibility of a 100% effective counter to ICBMs is really irrelevant when Russia sees its future national security in the balance.  Just like any other country would in the same situation.  Yet, you ignore all these real-world facts and have already decided that all this is about Putin's dick size.  
  

&gt; You specifically brought up my stances as influenced by propaganda   
  
Gee, whatever would have driven me to think something like that...  
  
&gt; If the US were truly as all-powerful  
  
Please, no need to exaggerate.  Swaying public opinion is not some insurmountable task as you're trying to portray it.  I didn't say the US has misled anyone to join Nato.  Just that Russia wouldn't want to bet its future national security on the belief that the US *wouldn't be able* to sway Ukraine public opinion in its favor.  See the difference?  Also, it's not about goading.  It's moves and counter moves.  Unless you believe that chess players sacrifice pieces because the other player 'goaded' them into it.  
  
&gt;  If the lease were cancelled then I would fully support Russia   
  
Once again, Russia was not willing to bet everything on your opinion.  If Russia had waited until everything had cooled down, it would have been immensely more difficult to initiate a military takeover of Crimea in response to a 'contract breach'.  Not to mention if Nato troops were present there (purely for training purposes, of course).  In any case, 'letting it play out' would have been the worse option of the two.  Your characterization of it as Russia saying ""Fuck it, let's invade"", tell me that you haven't even bothered to think it through as I have described, and have simply chalked it up to ""typical Russian aggression"".  
  
&gt; I was following the conflict religiously  
  
 Then you must have stopped while you were ahead, because those twitter accounts were revealed to have been fake (as in not the official rebel commander), and the phone calls were *proven* to have been faked by Ukrainian intelligence with pieced together phone calls from other conversations.  And the BUK were shown to have been captured from a Ukrainian army base in June.  To even fit Russia into the story you would have to reason something like ""Ok, so we know Putin is evil.  Now how can we fit him into this story?"".  

&gt; Nuland call  
  
The part I'm talking about the bit they're planning out specifically who's going to fill specific positions in the new government.  And how it played it out exactly like that. And the revelation about their 5 bil spending in Ukraine to 'Promote democracy'.  Then drawing parallels and extrapolating based on the US's previous involvements in pro-US insurgencies.  
  
Fact is that the Ukraine overthrow was a very momentous event, where if Ukraine had fully gone to EU/West, it would have been a huge victory for the US/West and an equally huge blow to Russia.  Therefore, it is unrealistic and naive to believe that the extent of the US's involvement/influence in it was limited to cupcakes and 'moral support', simply out of the goodness of its incorruptible heart.  In fact, it would have been pretty stupid of the US to *not* get involved, and let the chips fall as they may.  
  

&gt; No anti-Russian propaganda campaign  
  
I really have nothing further to say on this.  If you really can't see it, then you can't see it.  Maybe ask some uninvolved person for their opinion on it.  vOv  
  
  
&gt; Noone is forced into doing anything.  
  
You are naive if you believe that the cold-war just up and stopped when the Soviet Union fell.  Sure, it's not the real cold war, but the underlying game of moves and counter-moves never stopped.  Which is why Nato kept growing.  Why?  You yourself admitted that Russia isn't even 'the big scary thing it was'.  While Russia was not literally forced, it was put in a position where it had to choose from a bad option and a worse option.  While nobody threatened to 'destroy' Russia, it is in Russia best interest to make sure that it doesn't place itself in a vulnerable position, for the future when MAD might eventually disappear (100% success rate defense shield being in the realm of possibility).  Lest it becomes another Iraq and Libya.  The US has shown time and time again how it deals with countries that doesn't tow the party line, and can't really stand up to the mighty US military.   
  
&gt; You honestly think it was a good move to go   
  
Like I've explained already, swaying public opinion would not have been complicated after the fact.  They opted to make their move now, and place a hard counter to Nato membership with a border dispute.  A decision I agree with.",False,jaywalker32,t5_2qh13,1417418942,t3_2noymi,cmhqgqs

Burning at the stake was also a common punishment for heretics, so people executed by the Spanish Inquisition or the Papal States might be burned.

The Salem Witch Trials took place in 1692-1692. If you consider 1712 to be roughly at the same time, then yes, people were burned elsewhere in the American colonies (no U.S. at that time). The burnings took place as the culmination of the 1712 Slave Revolt in New York City--an incredible event that really should be getting all of the attention that the Salem Witch trials get instead. The event describes a New York that completely contrasts with the image most people have. What happened was that a group of slaves in New York City revolted and burned down a building. The slave owners freaked out and retaliated in a harsh and paranoid manner, suspected any and all black people in the city of collusion. Ultimately, 20 slaves were burned at the stake! Many others were killed in other, less official ways. History repeated itself in 1741, when again there was a series of fires in New York City allegedly set by slaves, and again there were harsh reprisals against any people of color. In that case, over 100 people were hanged or burned at the stake. Some of the dead bodies were gibbeted and displayed for all to see as they decayed. In both cases, burning at the stake was reserved for slaves only--it was illegal for white people to be burned at the stake. And then in the 20th century, there have been a number of cases of African-Americans who were burned alive by lynch mobs (we stereotypically associate lynch mobs with hanging people, but ""lynching"" meant any vigilante killings, not just hanging.)

What do British subjects being ""loyal"" and Britain integrating Indian cuisine have to do with their former better than anyone in the world mentality? Britain had shit food to begin with. Half the reason they conquered India was because Britain didn't have any cuisine to speak of. They wanted spices and ended up adopting the whole cuisine. British subjects were loyal because Britain had a wicked military to force loyalty up until relatively recently. And they've integrated the Indian and African/West Indian but they still have a chip on their shoulder with East Europe, Ireland, Scotland, and Middle Easterners. Pakistanis are so integrated in to British culture that they just make ""paki"" to mean anyone from the Middle East. There's also a healthy portion of blacks and latinos in America, much like your Indian Pakistani example. That doesn't mean there's not racial issues or strife. You might be right, though, [Britain](http://www.businessinsider.com/london-riots-mark-duggan-tottenham-2011-8) clearly [is not racist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Notting_Hill_race_riots) and [doesn't have any racial problems, at it's core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_Kingdom).

Then you want to be able to take the picture directly into the browser. Who wants to take the picture, then go to the page to upload it from their gallery? Okay, so we have the input accept camera. But now that we're skipping the album, we should be able to preview the picture, then accept it or reject it, right? So let's do it all in JS. We'll replace the upload input on phones with a camera icon, have it call the &lt;input&gt;, then detect when a file is attached, display it, and if accepted we'll upload the form. Not too hard, right?

Okay, but what about taking pictures when we're offline? Or what if we want to upload pictures only on Wi-Fi? (Never figured the Wi-Fi part out. Not sure there's a solution) So now we need to pass it through JS end to end. We need to maybe have store the photos on the phone until we get internet again, then upload them into a que. Or upload them directly if we're connected. While we're at it, we should also make it an offline app, obviously. It should sync up the library part when online to get new photos from other sources. And for the backend, may as well use Symfony and Doctrine. Why not.

In short: It started as a wedding album site, then adapted for taking pictures on honeymoon in Europe, not knowing how reliable our internet connection was. It worked pretty well actually.

Again, you are saying they invaded because they couldn't risk Ukraine joining NATO. But instead of rolling the dice on whether the US would/could sway public opinion towards joining NATO they took care of the job themselves- your point makes no sense. And absolutely yes, people are goaded into giving up pieces. Even pros occasionally talk about getting worked up or angry and losing a piece because of it.

&gt;Once again, Russia was not willing to bet everything on your opinion. If Russia had waited until everything had cooled down...

I have thought it through, hence my stance that they should have waited for this lease cancellation if they were so sure it was going to happen. Going in with a shady military takeover while denying it was infinitely worse for their image. And your Nato troops boogeyman is hilarious. If the US were behind the political coup, don't you think they would have done a better job of getting these Nato troops in, if its that easy? I stand by my opinion that they would have received less backlash if they had played their ""russian majority"" card along with ""they are wrongfully cancelling our lease on warm-water port"" card had it come up. 

&gt;Then you must have stopped while you were ahead, because those twitter accounts were revealed to have been fake...

Source for all those? I have kids and a job, so I won't claim to see every news story and reddit post- but I find it unlikely I missed that much. Give some sources and I'll happily admit I am wrong on that. The reasoning behind all mentions of Putin I saw appeared to be ""Recent mention of new missile launchers, Russia known to be supplying and supporting the rebels, ergo Russia is relevant to story""

&gt;The part I'm talking about the bit they're planning out specifically who's going to fill specific positions in the new government. And how it played it out exactly like that. 

I remember them saying certain people shouldn't be in the new government, but little else. Care to show a source for them playing kingmaker, and the same people getting in office?

&gt;And the revelation about their 5 bil spending in Ukraine to 'Promote democracy'. Then drawing parallels and extrapolating based on the US's previous involvements in pro-US insurgencies.

Haha, who is drinking the cool-aid now. You need to look up something on that 5 billion spending before touting that.

&gt;Fact is that the Ukraine overthrow was a very momentous event, where if Ukraine had fully gone to EU/West...

I think you are over-blowing the effects of which way Ukraine ended up. Again with nothing but conjecture to show direct US involvement in the coup. The Russian government made claims, including the US training troops on their embassy grounds, without a shred of evidence and as far as I've seen there hasn't been a bit of proof of US involvement. Using your logic we should assume Russia was even more involved since they have much more to lose/gain with Ukraine. 

&gt;I really have nothing further to say on this. If you really can't see it, then you can't see it. Maybe ask some uninvolved person for their opinion on it. vOv

Just so I can make sure, every uninvolved person I ask who says there is no bias is clearly biased, right? Can I just safely assume you are the ultimate barometer for what is/isn't anti-russian bias? You really seem to suffer from a version of Maslow's hammer, everything is anti-russian bias.

&gt;You are naive if you believe that the cold-war just up and stopped when the Soviet Union fell. Sure, it's not the real cold war, but the underlying game of moves and counter-moves never stopped. Which is why Nato kept growing. Why?...

The US and Russia both still spy on each other and trip each other up in international politics when possible. I hold no illusion that the US is some golden boy just out for altruistic goodness. I just have a problem with you and others not acknowledging the same of Russia. 

Russia had another option that it chose not to exercise: Join em. Considering they are outspent by NATO by more than 10:1, what is the use of pretending they are still a superpower and fighting it. Simply remove all reasons the US could use to trump up a war and be a better nation than the US openly. Lead in disarmament, join the EU, stop poisoning reporters with rare radioactive isotopes, and focus on modernizing/diversifying their economy.

Lets be honest, the only reason not to do these things is because the leaders, and many of the citizens, in Russia want their old glory back. Polls have consistently shown it, and Russia's actions have backed it up. As much as people call Putin a dictator, he is truly following the edict from his people: squaring up to the west and demanding respect.

&gt;Like I've explained already, swaying public opinion would not have been complicated after the fact. They opted to make their move now, and place a hard counter to Nato membership with a border dispute. A decision I agree with.

This is where we fundamentally disagree. On a strategy level I think it was flawed. It hurt Russia's economy heavily, told her other neighbors they better join nato before an invasion, and squandered Russia's growing goodwill on the international stage. Do you remember the swelling support on Reddit when Putin handled the chemical weapons in Syria and the positive response he received for his editorial? Putin/Russia was becoming a positive icon to most the demographic of Reddit and even some 40-60 year old guys I work with. Russia took a rightful beating over the anti-gay stuff, but was ultimately on an upward trajectory and considered by me and many others as a mostly good country.

All of that has changed now. They traded a stupid short-term gain for economic turmoil, damaged inter-state ties, and wrecked their image.

This is not to even mention the lost lives caused by this move. Even if you support the strategic side, there is a moral one also- and before you can say it, I will ""America kills people too"". Doesn't matter. Just because my neighbor kills his wife it doesn't lessen the evil of me doing the same.

Also, eventually, if Ukraine wants in enough they can drop their border disputes and join NATO- and this time I can see there being NATO troops on the ground for training beforehand. ",False,p90xeto,t5_2qh13,1417422502,t3_2noymi,cmhrbc0

An IELTS test will not get you into university, you need A level or equivalent grades.

I did electronics engineering at college and then at university quite a few years later.  Because I had done both I noticed a very big difference. At college electronics engineering is aimed at teaching you vocational skills for what you would encounter in most jobs, assembly and repair. At university electronics engineering is focussed on mostly designing - you are taught very little about assembly and repair to the point that you would probably be taught more in school about physically building a circuit. So for electronics if you wanted a job designing things then you would go to university but if you were more interested in building and repairing things others had already designed then you would be better going to college.

The advent of drilling and standardised armies came with firearms. The awkward nature of operating early firearms made it essential for armies to train regularly together, and unit cohesion is more important than ever. Look at the myriad fire drills available in Empire: Total War. Why do those add to unit upkeep? Because in real life, the only way to have people carry out actions is to have them train regularly, together, which means they must be part of a standing army that exists at all times, not a levy called up only in times of war.  
  
As a consequence, the professional European armies of the time were actually rather small, and strategic thought actually developed in the direction of not engaging in pitched battles, but manoeuvre in such a way that your position is so superior the enemy has to yield (something Clausewitz had problems with in his On War), because armies were small and expensive.  
  
That only really changed during the Napoleonic Wars, where the revolutionary French Republic brought a massive amount of manpower to bear via conscription, forcing other European powers to field larger armies, and abandon the various firing drills (which is why you don't see them in Napoleon: Total War).  
  
The training of individual soldiers didn't become less relevant with firearms. If anything, they became more relevant as European armies became more regimented, disciplined and professional. Then Napoleonic Wars created a system by which modern states can field massive armies and still maintain discipline to an acceptable degree, something rarely seen in ancient and medieval levies.",False,darthturtle3,t5_2rq9c,1417423249,t3_2nvcre,cmhrgwt

Incorrect. Russia has a VERY LONG history with the area that is currently Ukraine. It was a vital region of Imperial Russia and the USSR. Russia's history with Ukraine goes as far back as the start of their history with Kievan Rus.

NATO's involvement in the current illegal shift in the Ukrainian political is a direct threat to Russian security and geopolitical area of influence. 

NATO indiscriminately bombing the fuck out of middle east is in no way comparable to Russia's efforts in Ukraine; and you have no right to make that comparison. NATO's efforts in the middle east is absolutely and inherently wrong and unjust.

Don't forget that Kruschev also played an important role during the Kennedy era. And if you saw our nukes in Cuba as an aggressive act, I apologize; but it was a direct response to the US nukes in Turkey/Italy that were planted a decade earlier. 

&gt;I do believe that NATO actions threaten to cripple the Russian economy the same way the Treaty of Versailles crippled the German economy after WWI.

Oh don't worry about that :P We're already pivoting to China. Anything that can be found in Europe and the west, can be found in China and elsewhere. The west is not *special* in any way, shape or form. Decadent at best due to the current nature of their service-based/tertiary/parasitic economies.

A B-17 at cruising speed of ~190 miles an hour would take 24-28 hours to make that run (or a little less than 19 hours at top speed of ~290 miles an hour), but more importantly, they did not have that kind of flight range, usually half that or less for something like a B-17/B-24/Lancaster (so they could fly 1,000 or 1,200 miles out from the UK and then have to come back). 

Bombers of that age were extraordinarily inaccurate, with the vast majority of the bombs dropped by strategic bombers, especially early in the war, often not even landing within *several miles* of their intended target, especially as cities would black out any lightsource they could to make it difficult for bombers to find their targets. Weather was also often terrible. Even with low altitude carpet bombing formations of hundreds of bombers, targets were often missed or only lightly damaged. Often lots of civilians were killed instead, which didn't directly damage the war effort too bad but galvanized the population and hardened their resolve. 

Europe is also very big with lots of stuff, and while Germany is much smaller than the US, it's not exactly a small place. Also, bombloads were smaller than they are today and the munitions less destructive and with *extremely* high failure rates (that's why there's still so many bombs being found even today), and the German air defense network was actually quite effective up until the the war had already swung against them. Being assigned to a US bomber crew in 1942 did not have great survival statistics. The Luftwaffe, whatever other problems it may have had, knew its business quite well. 

On top of the fact that bombers of the day often didn't hit their target and carried smaller bombloads of less effective munitions, the Germans were very capable at bombproofing lots of targets or rebuilding them, and hadn't fully mobilized their economy for total war until relatively late, reaching peak production in 1944. While everyone was trying to bomb German industry, they were ramping their war production up far more effectively than anyone was destroying it. 

Individual military targets also were not always easy to find and usually hardened and/or well defended, and for anything mobile, like a tank division, strategic bombers were largely useless as you needed things like P-47's to get down much lower and engage individual positions and vehicles directly.

My understanding of immigration to Canada in the first 100 or so years post-confederation was that it was primarily white and European in complexion. The numbers were massive and the arrival rather swift. They might have relatively poor or uneducated compared to those arriving today but I don't think Canada was simply a landing pad for Europe's ""lower quality"". It's only in recent decades that people have started coming in comparatively larger numbers from more ""exotic"" locations so to speak.

Is his plan to keep these areas in big cities for the immigrants, preferably of the poorer, less educated kind so they too can get ""propelled"" (to use the authors words) in to the middle class by some future Doug Saunders? What about the immigrants who are already educated or even wealthy?

The whole article seems rather self-aggrandizing with stuff like ""I was struck by my own role in ending Canada’s postwar immigration miracle"", ""What had we done? ...we’d propelled several immigrant families into the middle class by allowing them to cash in on their property-value gains"", ""I’m a serial gentrifier"", ""has made me an agent of social change"".

That all sounds like rather fancy ways of saying ""i borrowed a chunk of change from the bank and then cashed it in at the other end so I buy another house"". 

In particular I'm interested in his supposed role in ""Canada's postwar immigration miracle"". The inner-cities of what are now the nations largest urban areas began to take shape long before the 1950's. Immigration in the post-war period is relatively low compared to other periods in Canadian history. These days, in a country of ~35 million the country takes in about 250,000 new permanent residents a year. More come on temporary permits, student exchanges and the like. But contrast that to the early part of the 20th century when the neighbourhoods in Toronto that Doug Saunders speaks of began to take shape. Canada was taking in 100,000+ immigrants a year at some points in the late 19th century when the total population in the entire nation was less than that of the GTA today. At points before the First World War Canada was bringing in between 300,000-400,000 immigrants. A very large number when the total population was still under 8 million. It would seem to me that Canada's ""immigration miracle"" occurred quite a few decades before Doug thinks. This leads me to believe he's basically sitting at his computer typing up his opinion piece but getting the wrong end of the stick. Canada has very clearly moved from being ""completely empty"" and needing anyone and everyone to a highly civilized, developed, wealthy society with a culture and history. While Canada still accepts large amounts of immigrants it certainly needs to be more ""discerning"". It doesn't need to perpetuate ""poor neighbourhoods"" just because such places existed deeper in Canadian history.

&gt;""If we don’t want the Canadian dream to be ruined by people like me, we’ll need to turn those inner-suburban districts into the sort of arrival cities we used to see downtown.""

I wonder if Doug Saunders would propose how that ought to be accomplished? His Surrey, BC example doesn't seem that robust. It seems rather glib to write a column about a supposed issue (if it even is an issue), say that such districts need a change and then just go ahead and buy the house anyway. Something must be done...but er...I'll not worry about it. I'll just write a piece in the newspaper and be on my way thanks! Very odd column.",False,84awkm,t5_2qh68,1417424569,t3_2nwpwg,cmhrqcl

If anything it was white Westerners who put an end to slavery. Britain in particular paid a huge amount of money to stop slave ships from transporting slaves. Whites put huge pressures on black and Middle Eastern countries to end slavery. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery#African_participation_in_the_slave_trade

&gt;African states played a role in the slave trade. Slavery was a common practice among Africans. There were three types: those who were slaves through conquest, those who were slaves due to unpaid debts or those whose parents gave them as slaves to tribal chiefs. Chieftains would barter their slaves to European buyers for rum, spices, cloth or other goods.[140] Selling captives or prisoners was common practice among Africans and Arabs during that era. However, as the Atlantic slave trade increased its demand, local systems which primarily serviced indentured servitude became corrupted and started to supply the European slave traders, changing social dynamics. It also ultimately undermined local economies and political stability as villages' vital labor forces were shipped overseas as slave raids and civil wars became commonplace. Crimes which were previously punishable by some other punishment became punishable by enslavement.[141]

&gt;The prisoners and captives that were sold were usually from neighboring or enemy ethnic groups.[142] These captive slaves were not considered as part of the ethnic group or 'tribe' and kings did not have a particular loyalty to them. At times, kings and chiefs would sell criminals into slavery so that they could no longer commit crimes in that area. Most other slaves were obtained from kidnappings, or through raids that occurred at gunpoint working together with Europeans.[140] Some African kings refused to sell any of their captives or criminals. King Jaja of Opobo, a former slave himself, completely refused to do business with slavers.[142] Ashanti King Agyeman Prempeh (Ashanti king, b. 1872) also sacrificed his own freedom so that his people would not face collective slavery.[142]

&gt;Before the arrival of the Portuguese, slavery had already existed in Kingdom of Kongo. Despite its establishment within his kingdom, Afonso I of Kongo believed that the slave trade should be subject to Kongo law. When he suspected the Portuguese of receiving illegally enslaved persons to sell, he wrote letters to the King João III of Portugal in 1526 imploring him to put a stop to the practice.[143]

&gt;The kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into transatlantic slavery, who otherwise would have been killed in a ceremony known as the Annual Customs. As one of West Africa's principal slave states, Dahomey became extremely unpopular with neighbouring peoples.[144][145][146] Like the Bambara Empire to the east, the Khasso kingdoms depended heavily on the slave trade for their economy. A family's status was indicated by the number of slaves it owned, leading to wars for the sole purpose of taking more captives. This trade led the Khasso into increasing contact with the European settlements of Africa's west coast, particularly the French.[147] Benin grew increasingly rich during the 16th and 17th centuries on the slave trade with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold, and carried to the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be known as the ""Slave Coast"".[148]

The video is filmed from the cockpit of a Norwegian F-16 aircraft, and is taken up in international airspace last year.

It shows how a Russian MIG-31 fighters suddenly folds into front of one of the Norwegian F-16 aircraft from 331 Squadron.

The spontaneous reaction from the Norwegian pilot says it all about the drama:

""In hell!"" He exclaims - before he pivots plane left in a tight evasive maneuver.

- We have seen some cases of behavior in the air from the Russians to show that they did not like that we are there, says Lieutenant Colonel Goran Hoel, commander of 331 Squadron in Bodø, TV 2, which first publicized the video.

- Closer than 20 meters
To VG estimates Hoel that the Russian MIG aircraft were ""less than 20 meters"" from the Norwegian F-16 machine.

- This is an example of how fast it goes when you're sitting in the cockpit of a fighter plane, and that we must be prepared for anything. This is something that can happen and that could potentially be dangerous, says Hoel VG.

- Why did the Russian pilot this?

- We do not know. We know that Norwegian Orion aircraft has had some challenges with that Russian planes have come very close. Whether this is a deliberate act, or he miscalculated total, and had control, says squadron leader.

Three important developments

Norwegian F-16 aircraft from 331- and 332 Squadron stands on days readiness for NATO in Bodo. So far this year, the Norwegian planes come out 42 times to show strength against Russian fighters. That's about as previous years.

But several sources pointing to VG in three important developments:

** The Russian planes are becoming newer and more sophisticated.

- There is a replacement and renewal of Russian assets and capabilities in all areas, both on land, at sea and in the air. This is a clear example, says Brynjar Stordalselva, pressevakt of Defense operational headquarters (FOH), VG.

** The number of Russian planes that fly together increases.

- We see that the flights are more complex than before. Now we often meet reconnaissance tanker, tactical bombers and eskortefly together increasingly. It did not happen as often before, says Hoel.

** And as the video top of this article is an example: The Russian pilots are more aggressive and aggressive than before, according to several sources.

- General meetings with the Russians disposition and quiet. But we've had some episodes, like the one in the video, says Hoel.

Many Doubled in Europe
Although the Russian air traffic off the Norwegian coast is stable, it is not so in the rest of Europe.

If one collects all NATO figures as a whole, the number of so-called ""scrambles"" - that NATO planes must scramble to intercept Russian fighters - many doubled during the year.

Earlier in the month let the London-based think tank European Leadership Network presented a report showing how the Russian Armed Forces acting far more aggressively this year compared with previous years.

The report lists 40 serious incidents, many of them in the Norwegian vicinity. Among the events are submarine hunt in the Swedish archipelago, and the dramatic minutes when a Russian patrol was only 90 meters from a SAS aircraft of Malmo, on the way from Copenhagen to Rome.

Also Russian planes along the Norwegian coast is mentioned in the report.

New aircraft along the Norwegian coast
&lt;p&gt; NEW RUSSIAN: This was the sight that met the Norwegian pilots off the coast of Finnmark in late October: Brand new SU-34 Fullback fighter, the very latest and most advanced weapon in the Russian Air Force. &lt;/ p&gt;

As VG wrote in November, the new SU-34 Fullback aircraft for the first time observed off the Norwegian coast in late October.

- The aircraft have been observed and identified by other NATO countries elsewhere earlier. But we have never seen them in the northern areas and off the coast of Norway before, says Stordalselva VG.

The highly advanced fighter bombers are the latest in the increasingly robust Russian air force, and is built to carry nuclear weapons.

As to the EU, there's a can of worms right there. The biggest thing I can say for it, is it certainly sounds good on paper. However, what it has exposed is a number of fundamental flaws in government policy, specifically monetary policy and has created some massive problems. Many of the member countries are running debt/GDP ratios that make the fiscal irresponsibility of the US government look paltry in comparison. The only notable exception is Estonia. In many ways, the EU is a broader reflection on what happens when a group of states, that all may have varied and different interest decide to unite under one banner. It certainly has it's benefits, but as we can see even in the US there are certainly some downsides.

&gt;

&gt;___Oxymoron___ is the third [studio album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_album) by [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping) [Schoolboy Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q). The album was released on February 25, 2014, by [Top Dawg Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Dawg_Entertainment) and [Interscope Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interscope_Records). *Oxymoron* was his first album released under a [major record label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_record_label) to [music retailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_shop), whereas his previous albums were released [independently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_record_label) to [digital retailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution) only.

&gt;The album's recording took place from June 2012 until late 2013. Schoolboy Q enlisted collaborators such as [Kendrick Lamar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar), [2 Chainz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Chainz), [ASAP Rocky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP_Rocky), [Jay Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rock), [Tyler, The Creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_The_Creator) and [Kurupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurupt), among others. The album's [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_production) was handled by high-profile record producers such as [Boi-1da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boi-1da), [The Alchemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(musician\)), [Mike Will Made It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Will_Made_It), [Clams Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clams_Casino_(musician\)), Nez and Rio, [DJ Dahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Dahi) and [Pharrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharrell_Williams), as well as others, including members of Top Dawg Entertainment's in-house production teams [Digi+Phonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digi%2BPhonics) and [THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THC_(production_team\)).

&gt;It was met with generally positive reviews from [music critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_criticism), with praise going towards its haunting, gangsta mood and Schoolboy Q's aggressive rhymes. *Oxymoron* was also a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US [*Billboard* 200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200) selling 139,000 copies in its first week of release. It additionally peaked highly on the main album charts in Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

&gt;The album was supported by five official singles: ""[Collard Greens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collard_Greens_(song\))"", ""[Man of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_the_Year_(song\))"", ""[Break the Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_the_Bank_(song\))"", ""[Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_(song\))"", ""[Hell of a Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_of_a_Night_(Schoolboy_Q_song\))"" and the promotional single ""[Yay Yay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yay_Yay)"". So far, ""Studio"" is his highest charting song as a lead artist peaking at number 38 on the US [*Billboard* Hot 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100) chart. He also toured the United States and Europe on the *Oxymoron* World Tour, with [Isaiah Rashad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Rashad) and [Vince Staples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Staples).

We, in the UK, have signed up to various EU treaties over the years and as such are subject to their rules. One of the cornerstones is free movement of people within the EU. That means 500 Million people from across the EU (inc. former communist countries in the east) have the right to live, work, and study in the UK. 

Now nobody really minded before about 5 years ago when the Euro currency started flailing badly, leaving tens of millions of Southern and Eastern europeans trapped with no future aside migration. The UK is bearing the brunt of a lot of this migration, we have no quality control or numbers control, so we don't know how many will come next year or in 5 years. The last 5 years we've seen unprecedented numbers coming, around the 250,000 a year mark, putting pressure on everything from school places to house prices and housing to hospital admissions to public transport overcrowding. 

Now the current government, in an attempt to placate the electorate, have put severe restrictions on the immigration they *can* control, which is non-EU. So anyone with a wife, girlfriend in Russia, Asia, South America, etc can pretty much forget about uniting with her in the UK. Or if you're a company that wants to hire an Indian engineer or an Australian biologist, forget it, getting a skilled visa is very very difficult.

The UKIP want to remove all these barriers and implement a points-based system for anyone from all over the world. UKIP are the least racist political party because they don't discriminate based on ethnicity/geography, like the current parties do.

Hubbert (Dianetics).  Jack Parson was the real founder of the JPL (Jet Propulsion Labratory) in Pasadena.  The original Rocket Scientist.  Jack Parson also was friends with Aleister Crowley and started a satanic branch in the USA (Crowley's was in Europe).  Jack used to recite satan stuff before Rocket experiments.  He hooked up with L. Ron Hubert.  Told Crowley via letters. Crowley didn't trust Hubert at all and warned Jack, but Jack woudn't listen. Hubert robbed Jack of his life savings, and took his girlfriend.  I think Jack took Huberts girlfriend after that.  After Jack Parson died, the police found video tapes of Parson screwing his mom.  She commited suicide a few weeks after.

This is from memory. I might have a few facts wrong, but doubt many.  And, oh there is soo much more in those stories. Google them up. With basic google skills you will be reading the most intense thriller you've read in your life, and it's not fiction.  Parson had sex orgies, and satan stuff in his home in pasadena.  Somewhere listed the address.  I looked up the address in google Street View. It's bizarre oogling his former house.  A crater on the moon was named after Jack Parson.  Parson was not really spoken of by JPL after he died because Parson was into so much unspeakable, and shameful stuff. I think that's why Goddard became known as the father of rocket science.  There are video clips of Old JPL members talking about Parson.  I know I'm all over the place but it will help you to google it.

Not goign to edit this. You have enough to get started on a crazy ass read. Hope you do.

Guys like Irving Kristol (and his son Bill) and David Horowitz are perfect examples.  They brought some communist principles over to the right when they switched sides.  The most prominent of those beliefs is the idea of spreading their ideology on a global scale; the difference being, instead of spreading international socialism -- they advocate spreading American democracy and American commerce.  They are empire builders who believe in using the power and scope of government for so-called ""conservative"" ends both domestically and internationally.  For example, ""No Child Left Behind"" is a great example of the neoconservative belief in using the power and scope of government so spread conservative ideology.  Let me make one thing clear:  I absolutely reject neoconservatives and evangelicals as legitimate conservatives.  Neither of which is interested in limiting the size and scope of government or maximizing individual/civil liberties.

Paleoconservativsm (of which I consider myself to be a part of) is a bit more complex.  It's also known as the ""old right.""  It has its roots in Jeffersonian-American/southern agrarian beliefs in de-centralized small (r) republican government.  Whereas neoconservatives are internationalists; we're very much non-interventionists (I hate to use the term 'isolationist.')  Paleoconservatives tend to stay out of the minute of policy debates and focus on the 'big picture' of limiting government and maximizing individual liberty.  We, including myself, tend to favor some protectionist policies over free trade; as such, we reject NAFTA.  We also tend to be fairly strong anti-immigration advocates, and we value protecting America's traditional western European heritage, traditions, and institutions.  All of these tend to be rejected as neoconservative as they stand in the way of spreading American democracy and American commerce.

There's much more to it than that, but those are a few principles in a nutshell.  I absolutely don't identify with the 'Tea Party' since there is no unified 'Tea Party' and the term can mean completely different things depending upon with whom you speak.  I've seen raging neocons call themselves 'Tea Party' and I've seen libertarians call themselves 'Tea Party.'

Speaking of which, I actually side in with the libertarian wing of the Republican Party (Republican Liberty Caucus) and even outright members of  the Libertarian Party since paleoconservatism is essentially dead.  The closest thing we have are the Doctors Paul -- Ron being more classically libertarian and Rand being more paleoconservative. ",False,Ingens_Testibus,t5_2qh1i,1417429451,t3_2nxdxc,cmhsltw

The Indo-European gender system stems from an animate-inanimate noun class divide present in PIE. It evolved into masculine-feminine-neuter later, but many languages like English only kept the distinction in pronouns, where the paradigm is he/she/it, and even relatively lately there were separate plurals for all of them, but nowadays it's just he-&gt;they, she-&gt;they, it-&gt;they, though in Icelandic there are three ""theys"", plural-he, plural-she, plural-it (or a mix of hes and shes).

To my knowldge, most languages of the world don't make this distinction. For example in Finnish we only find ""hän"" /'hæn/ which just means a person and it basically means he or she.

What I think touches a nerve with people about this bid is that, it is actually feasible. Not yet feasible when considering infrastructure, nor really feasible when considering that private money has not materialized as-of-yet, but feasible that Boston (or any American city) *would* be selected by the IOC if the USOC selects us as the American bid. In a bizarre turn of events, people who are against the Olympics might be hoping the IOC *will* be corrupt in its decision process. Here's my reasoning:


The IOC, as grotesque as it is, knows it's a fucked up organization. They know that the 2022 Winter games are a joke, that Oslo withdrew leaving only Beijing and Kazakhstan. They *do* want it to be a global affair and Europe/North America are due for a games by 2024: 2016 will be Rio, 2018 will be Pyeongchang, 2020 will be Tokyo, 2022 will likely be Beijing. Boston, in this environment, will be very appealing to the IOC, even moreso when considering the other cities in the running:

Casablanca, Nairobi, Jo-burg, and Durban have all explored the possibility of a bid, but all those cities will have to drastically improve infrastructure and in the case of South Africa, contend with a local population that lived through the World Cup and are not baying for another intrusive games. Doha is looking at a bid, but that probably won't happen because of the 2022 World Cup - also because the IOC would probably want to avoid associated with a state that essentially uses slave labor for infrastructure projects. Lima is also in there, but with a 2016 Games in Rio, South America will not likely receive another in an 8-yr span.

If anything the competition will be from European countries: Paris and Berlin having been toying with the idea, but nothing meaningful has been proposed. Rome wants it, but has its own issues, St. Petersburg wants is, but the spectre of *another* Putin games might deepsix that bid, Kiev probably won't happen for obvious reasons. 

The only three that I can see that the IOC would look hard at would be Istanbul, Baku, and Melbourne. Each has it's own qualities - Istanbul people (also the world's worst traffic), Baku has money, and Melbourne has the ""Western world"". 

I think Boston stacks up reasonably when against those three, which is why these Olympics proposals irk me and many on this sub - if we get selected, we would stand a very decent chance of actually seeing the games comes here. ",False,CantabKBH,t5_2qh3r,1417431204,t3_2nw48c,cmhswk0

- It also helps damage, since Kormac can not consistently debuff very large groups for Bane of the Trapped, but littering the place with Slow Time bubbles does. Since you are required to fight huge groups in higher Grifts, this is a pretty big deal.

Dar lăsând asta, eu văd alt înțeles în victoria electorală a lui Iohannis. În primul rând, este un personaj cât de cât credibil; în comparație cu alți oameni politici apare ca unul care nu a apucat să se compromită, puținul care se știe despre el este pozitiv (activitatea de primar). Aici se vede dorința populației de a condamna clasa politică actuală.

Dar mai mult decât atât, este reprezentantul unei minorități naționale, și asta întro țară în care majoritatea este sensibilă la astfel de argument. Iohannis nu a ajuns președinte pentru că e neamț, ci *în ciuda acestui dezavantaj*.

Serios: spuneți repede țările europene care au șef de stat dintro minoritate națională.

Ce văd eu aici este faptul că lăsăm în urmă încă o prejudecată populară, că începem, ca și comunitate, să ne maturizăm politic.

&gt;But you will vote for a party which wont get in who have literally NO fucking idea what they would do if they did and would do significently more damage to the country?

Except they won't get in, and my vote helps them on that path to maturity of a proper party.  It happened with Labour, Tory, Lib Dem and so on.  Once a party gets to a certain size and popularity the extremist views are watered down and sensible policies replace some of the more dubious ones.  That's the difference between Monster Raving Looney Party and Labour.  UKIP sits right in the middle of that, scale.    You might think I'm ridiculous for voting for a party based on their history.  I'm voting based on their potential for the future, and I'm fine taking that risk.


Would Ed be worse?  No, of course not.  He's no more a leader than Mickey mouse of Disneyland.  His advisors and special assistants would tell him what to do, and he would do what he's told by others.

That's my main point,  everything that Ed sprouts seems like it comes out of a advisors notebook, I know it happens to every leader, but they don't look so goddam pathetic saying it.  Ed isn't a leader, he looks like a nice chap, but he just isn't charismatic and authoritative.  Sorry if it sounds like I'm insulting your guy, but I cannot connect with him. 


Essentially I'm saying Ed pretends to be ""of the people"" when in reality he is a privately schooled, well educated person who went straight out of University to work in a MP's office without touching a proper job.  And he pretends to know what ""The Working Class Want"",  doesn't fly with me.  Give me Prescott or Brown or Johnstone, anyone else but Ed and I'd vote for them again,  but under Ed Miliband?

It is impossible to get info by randomly asking people who work at the KUL, as the internal diversity is enormous. 

Faculties, institutes, reseach groups and *centrale diensten* all have their internal dynamic. On top of that **organizational diversity**, the **contractual diversity** is huge. If you are ZAP (*zelfstanding academisch personeel*) you have of course a completely different work context from a secretary at your faculty (ATP), even if you are both employees.

So that makes it difficult to comment on this in general. So, three remarks on the context of labour relations in higher education, and why these issues are more pronounced at the KUL (and *possibly* (!) could lead to a higher chances of these kind of incidents): 

(1) In the years that I'm following higher education policy more closely, **KU Leuven is IMHO the worst offender in keeping contractual relations temporal and less protected**. 

The above mentioned mess of contractual diversity contains a lot misused/abused contractual relations, e.g. repeated full time temporal *privaatrechterlijke* contracts for *praktijkassistenten*, cheap *bursaalstatuten* for full time reseachers (which makes them ""students"", not [more secure/protected] employees, ect. 

Not that the other institutions are a lot better, but in negotiations to fix those issues, the KUL is nearly always on the side of ""keep the contracts more 'flexible'"" (read: more easy to dismiss).  

(2) **Unions and universities** are a tricky issue, as universities traditionally have a corporatists culture, e.g. employees can in theory be both ""the boss"" (*decaan*, *rector*) as the *ondergeschikte*. 

So while in other companies unions should be the ones defending the employees in cases like this, they are bypassed (or have too little power) in a corporatist setting (""we are all colleagues, let just solve this issue among ourselves""). Specifically for the KUL, they have a more pronounced anti-union position then other universities in Flanders, esp. compared to the UGent and the VUB. 

An example to illustrate this corporatist culture: the KUL has the [VALP](https://www.kuleuven.be/samenwerking/vapl), the ""*Vereniging van het Academisch Personeel KU Leuven*"". According to critics, if there are though negations on the rights of the employees at the KUL, the VALP is ""used"" to bypass the more critical voices of employee representatives: ""All unions are against this reform? Though luck, the VALP is in agreement, and we consider them more representative"". 

Crucial to note is that the VALP-members are only *academic* personnel, **not supporting staff** (ATP). All the people complaining about abuses in the article are ATP as far as I can tell...

(3) Universities are the focus of a gradual shift (and underlying struggle) the last decades from a governance model of ""a republic of scholars"" towards a private sector-oriented, top-down style of management (Kleiklie &amp; Kogan, 2007; Hüter &amp; Krücken, 2013). 

This means that there are more people with a ""traditional"", hierarchical relation (employee-boss), while the **""traditional"" ways and culture of dealing with the (possible) conflicts arising from this hierarchical relation have not really adapted** (e.g. union representation on *evaluatie-gesprekken* or in departmental conflicts).

For two reasons:

1) because beet production is just one factor of sugar production.
2) because when it's time to do things that are more efficient to do in Italy, like electricity production via solar panels, the German state prefers to flood the market with incentives for solar production in Germany (a very sunny state /s) instead of delegating this production to Italy.

The article mentions high-tech equipment installed by Thales being stolen.
If you look at an earlier [study](http://www.brookings.edu/events/2011/06/27-mistral) why exactly Russia is ordering naval ships (which they tend to build themselves) the reasons that came up in the study are:

&gt;Russia sought to acquire the Mistral primarily for its up-to-date command and control systems and for the modern, modular French shipbuilding technologies used to build the ship rather than to upgrade the Russian Navy’s amphibious assault capability.

Now if you look at exactly what the equipment from Thales is you [find](http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/mistral/) that they have build, among other things, the command and control system mentioned in the study:
&gt;The Mistral Class is fitted with the DCN Senit 8 derivative combat data system and will be fitted with the French Navy's SIC 21 command system for joint operations, which is being developed by Thales.
A high-performance communications suite includes the Thales Syracuse III satellite communications system.

For the modular shipbuilding technologies: South Korea’s STX (STX Europe is the shipyard that builds the Mistrals together with DCNS in Saint-Nazaire, and part of [STX Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STX_Corporation)) has a [contract](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-22/russia-south-korea-s-stx-to-start-work-on-1-8-billion-shipyard.html) with the Russian state owned United Shipbuilding Corporation to build a shipyard on Kotlin Island, St. Petersburg which also include the transfer of [knowledge](http://www.stxeurope.com/sites/France/products/Pages/Naval-products.aspx).
&gt;United Shipbuilding will provide most of the funding, and STX will deliver technological know-how, Trotsenko said.

United Shipbuilding already [delivered](http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/737917) the stern module for the Sevastopol (the second Mistral) that was build in St. Petersburg meaning they propably have the designs as well or at least the modular technology they were looking for.

&gt;
&gt;**Falsehoods you might believe after watching ****_The Imitation Game_**
&gt;
&gt;(mild spoilers ahead)
&gt;
&gt;Some of these falsehoods are not directly implied by the film, but may be inferred by reasonable viewers unfamiliar with the events in question. Many are defensible on grounds of dramatic license, but nonetheless I think it's useful to know which are true and which aren't. Alan Turing was described by Winston Churchill as the single greatest contributor to Allied victory in World War II. He also invented the programmable computer and helped found the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. He was driven to suicide within a decade of the war by persecution of his homosexuality. Most people don't know very much about him, so I thought some of these facts should be cleared up.
&gt;
&gt;I'm by no means an expert on Turing so some of what I say may be inaccurate, but I believe overall I can provide a more accurate portrayal than the film, so here is my best attempt, and I appreciate any corrections others can provide. Most of my knowledge comes from Andrew Hodges' biography (from which the film claims inspiration), so far as I know the only serious one to date.
&gt;
&gt;**The Enigma**
&gt;
&gt;From watching the film, you might believe that the Enigma cipher which Turing's team at Bletchley Park worked to break was used for all Nazi military communication and that no one had ever successfully cracked Enigma until then. In fact, there were many versions of Enigma, and a group of Polish mathematicians had cracked a weaker, older version prior to the war, then handed off their work to British intelligence, who built upon it.
&gt;
&gt;During the war, the Nazis utilized several variations of Enigma, all based on the same general principles but of differing cryptographic strength. Turing's team worked specifically on the Naval Enigma, which was particularly strong and up to that point unbroken. Their success enabled knowledge of U-Boat positions and safe passage for American supply convoys, resulting in victory in the Battle of the Atlantic.
&gt;
&gt;They **did**, as the film portrayed, make use of what is now called a ""known plaintext"" attack. Every day the Nazis would broadcast weather reports using both the Naval Enigma and a much weaker cipher that the Allies could easily decrypt. This provided Bletchley Park with a plaintext/ciphertext pair which greatly constrained the search space for that day's cryptographic keys. Modern crypto algorithms are designed to be resistant to known plaintext attacks.
&gt;
&gt;**Withholding of Intelligence**
&gt;
&gt;Contrary to the portrayal in the film, my understanding is that Britain chose not to moderate its use of the daily treasure trove of intelligence that Turing's team uncovered. The risks of making full use of this intelligence were clear and seriously contemplated, but it was also understood that the methods could soon become obsolete if the Nazis deployed stronger ciphers, and Britain's desperation for American supplies drove it to exploit this intelligence for its full value. For a critical few months, Britain actually had a better model of U-Boat positions than the Nazis themselves, due to their efficient processing of intercepted communications. The Nazis suspected compromise, but had such faith in the security of the Naval Enigma that they attributed this to spying rather than cryptanalysis.
&gt;
&gt;**The ""Universal Machine""**
&gt;
&gt;The ""universal machine"" was Alan Turing's thought experiment in which he described a programmable computer, in his paper _On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem_. He was actually the second person to solve the Entscheidungsproblem, a great open question in mathematics posed by David Hilbert. Alonzo Church solved it first, but Turing's approach proved more compelling and the idea of a programmable computer took on a life of its own, of which we're all very familiar today.
&gt;
&gt;Joan Clarke's remarks in the film strongly imply that the machine used to break Naval Enigma was such a universal, programmable machine (later known as a ""universal Turing machine""). It was not. It was a dedicated machine purpose-built for this function, with no general ability to be reprogrammed. This machine was called ""the Bombe"". As far as I'm aware, it was never referred to by Turing as ""Christopher"", the name of his childhood crush.
&gt;
&gt;It wasn't until the mid 1940's that serious work began in Britain and America on constructing programmable computers, of which Turing played a small role.
&gt;
&gt;**""The Imitation Game""**
&gt;
&gt;Turing never wrote a paper entitled _The Imitation Game_. He did write one called _Computing Machinery and Intelligence_, in which he introduced what he called ""the imitation game"" (later known as the Turing Test), a test for machine intelligence. This paper is considered by some as the founding paper for the field of artificial intelligence.
&gt;
&gt;**Internal Politics at Bletchley Park**
&gt;
&gt;So far as I know, Turing was never suspected of being a Soviet spy during his tenure at Bletchley Park, as the film portrays. There was concern by some, after the war, that his homosexual relationships with men in Europe could make the secrets he knew vulnerable to foreign spying.
&gt;
&gt;I also do not understand Turing to have been quite so socially inept as the film portrayed, no doubt for dramatic effect. When he wrote Churchill to protest the restrictions under which his team worked, he had the full support of most of his peers, he wasn't operating alone as in the film.
&gt;
&gt;**Personal Relationships**
&gt;
&gt;It was weakly implied in the film that Turing may have had a romantic relationship with Christopher Morcom. There's no evidence for that (or that Christopher himself was gay), though he certainly had a substantial crush on him and remained close with Christopher's mother throughout their lives, with whom he often visited and exchanged letters.
&gt;
&gt;When breaking off his wedding with Joan Clarke, to the best of my knowledge there was no angry argument, as the film portrayed. This was presumably inserted for dramatic effect.
&gt;
&gt;**Revelation of Cryptanalytic Work to Police**
&gt;
&gt;I am not aware of any suggestion that Turing provided the police, who investigated him after the war for sodomy, any classified information about his work during the war. He was, however, very forthcoming about his private life.﻿",False,GooglePlusBot,t5_2fwo,1417435164,t3_2nxmak,cmhtlyi

,0,0,t3_2nwnp3,,0,5,AskHistorians,5,1425741545,,False,t1_cmhtqiz,False,"The Xuanfeng or ""Whirlwind"" is a basic traction catapult, and a direct descendant of the first Mohist traction catapults of the 4th - 3rd century B.C. The throwing power in a Xuanfeng comes from a team of people pulling downwards on ropes tied to the short arm of the throwing arm. The power of this catapult is limited only by the number of pullers able to fit in the space available below the lever arm. The largest versions of the Xuanfeng were recorded to have as many as 80-120 pullers!

Like all traction catapults, the Xuanfeng Pao could throw projectiles with a great variation in range simply by changing the number of pullers. The traction catapult also enjoyed a high rate of fire since the lowering of the throwing arm for reloading was a simple matter of the pullers releasing their ropes. Typical for Chinese catapults, the throw arms were made up of bundled bamboo rods. As a light catapult, the Xuanfeng would probably have been mounted with anywhere from 1 to 4 or 5 bamboo rods, with the increasing scale corresponding to an increasing ability to throw heavier projectiles.

This catapult was generally used like the sniper version of a rifle. It wasn't the power of the punch that mattered but the accuracy of the shot. The Xuanfeng, due to its lack of power, was not usually deployed to knock down walls. Instead, its main functions were to take out specific soft targets with its ability to swivel around 360 degrees. With a team of pullers pulling downwards on ropes tied to the short arm of the throwing arm, a ""shooter"" would guide the catapult about by pulling and aiming the catapult on the projectile side to adjust the angles before releasing for the most optimum shot. This ability resulted in incredible accuracy. This ""light"" catapult was used to snipe at other catapults or enemy generals with an arsenal of projectiles consisting of porcelain/clay shrapnel balls and other inventive material.

From an account in the Zi Zhi Tong Jian or ""History as a Mirror"", during the middle of the Tang dynasty in A.D. 759, General Li Guangbi's Imperial army confronted the rebel leader Shi Siming's army across the Huangho. In an attempt to dislodge General Li's troops from a temporary floating bridge strung across the river, Shi Siming sent hundreds of battle ships pushing burning boats at the front in the hopes of destroying the bridge. Using long poles to hold the burning boats at bay, the attack was successfully repulsed by the use of catapults against what must have been highly maneuverable rebel ships. While it is unclear what kinds of catapults General Li's troops arrayed on the northern bank of the river used, this account clearly illustrated the effectiveness of, and incredible accuracy achieved by Tang catapults.

Unlike European catapults, the Chinese anchored their catapults by sinking the legs a few feet into the ground. Many illustrations of the Xuanfeng found in classical Chinese military manuals are therefore shown with very small bases. A typical Xuanfeng stood anywhere from twice a person's height to about 3 times a person's height. Because of its small size, it was easy to transport it around by dismantling it into its various components, and to set it up again wherever it was required.

There are basically 4 general variants of the Xuanfeng Pao.

The basic Xuanfeng had 2 legs sunk into the ground for stability. The central pole was fixed to the two legs and the pivot was at the top of the pole, allowing for the entire head assembly to turn 360 degrees. It was a very light catapults for throwing small rocks, ""shrapnel"" balls, gunpowder explosives, human heads etc.

This catapult was the mainstay of Chinese field artillery for centuries, and was the basic form for all the other variants of catapults including those introduced into the West via the Avars and Byzantium.

The slightly heavier variant of the Xuanfeng was mounted on a more stable 4-leg base frame with horizontal crossbracing.

This heavier Xuanfeng could still maintain a 360 degree field of fire while allowing for the firing of slightly heavier projectiles. However, the pivot for this heavier Xuanfeng was at the base instead of at the top. This meant that the central pole turned along with the head assembly. This allowed for heavier projectiles to be fired since the monolithical head-column arrangement effectively lowered the fixity point of the rotational joint, making the catapult more stable.

More stable than the basic Xuanfeng, this catapult was probably not countersunk into the ground or at best at a very shallow depth. This allowed for ease of deployment without sacrificing stability and hence firing accuracy.

Xuanfeng batteries were made up of a row of light Xuanfeng catapults all mounted in a row on a single simple base. Like the basic variant, the head assemblies were made to swivel, but in addition the whole mount was also made to swivel 360 degrees, allowing for a lot more flexibility in usage.

The Xuanfeng batteries were probably used in battle to fire projectiles enmass, at the same time and in the same direction, to create fire saturation over a given enemy position. This multiple catapult was also conceivably used to create a continuous stream of covering fire during a battle to keep the enemy from returning fire.

The Xuanfeng was also sometimes mounted on a mobile wheeled platform but was still based on the basic Xuanfeng variant. The basic variant with dual fixed legs and top pivot was fairly common while the heavier variant with a 4-leg base frame and base pivot was less common. 

The instance much often cited when catapults were first wheel mounted was during the Battle of Guandu when Liu Ye and Cao Cao of Wei deployed mobile catapults called the ""Pili che"" or (Thunderbolt cart).

These mobile catapults could be towed out to wherever they were needed, and the actual catapult throw-arm and central post were probably slotted in on-site when needed. The mounted Xuanfengs were light to medium sized catapults, overlapping in power and range at the upper end with that of the Hudun Pao. The development of mobile catapults which did away with the traditional sunken-leg base might have been a consequence of increasingly accurate enemy counter-battery fire.

The design of the Xuanfeng is such that when firing projectiles, the throwing arm impacted against the frame of the central post at the point of release. This results in a ""early"" release short of the vertical position, coupled with a slight whipping effect on the bundled bamboo which was the common material used to make the throw arm. Releasing projectiles short of the vertical position creates a high trajectory for the projectile, and maximises the range achievable, a requirement that is mirrored in the projectile-types typically used by this catapult. By the time of the Song dynasty in the 10th to 13th centuries A.D., the Xuanfengs were used to fire explosive grenades as well as molten cast-iron pots which could created large-area damage to troops and equipment alike, besides the usual assortment of stones, shrapnel balls, human heads and diseased meat employed by earlier dynasties.

The heyday of the Xuanfeng must arguably be said to have been during the Tang dynasty. Descriptions of the success of this catapult are recounted in various Tang dynasty siege accounts. During the Tang dynasty's founding years, in a siege of the Sui capital in A.D. 617, 300 catapults were said to have been deployed by the Engineer-General Tian Maoguang. Then again it is written that in a Tang dynasty siege of Pyongyang in A.D. 668 during the last year of the campaign against Koguryo, XuanFeng catapults were used to bring the city to its knees. Bombardment of such a massive scale would have been devastating to a beleaguered city.

The only know illustration of a trigger mechanism exists in a picture of a xuanfeng mounted on a siege boat from Wujingzongyao. 

It rotates 360 degrees, but not when firing. This should be kind of obvious but it fires like a normal trebuchet with the same trajectory. 

The xuanfeng is also man powered so the range would depend heavily on the number of people pulling the ropes. ",False,wumao,t5_2ssp3,1417435813,t3_2nwnp3,cmhtqiz

For many, they look at the war of 1914 and see it as much the same as the players of politics at the time did; as an inevitable march to the climax of European history. While revanche, alliances and historical hatred all combined in many regions to concoct four years of horror - ultimately the war was almost a self-fufilling prophecy. 

Okay, let's tackle these two one-by-one. 

**What did Germany want with Russia?** 

The reasoning for Imperial Germany declaring war on Russia in August 1914 was not an outright lust for territory. Berlin hardly entered the war with the hope of territory on its mind. While parts of the war, such as the 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovisk, betray perhaps the opportunities that the Germans grapsed once victory did come - it was barely an intention at the start of the war.

Rather, as you are probably aware from the YouTube series, the war was fought because of the tumbling series of wars which in the end obligated Germany to have to fight Russia. While it was not avoided - the race to mobilization in July and August was tense, as each nation used the threat of mobilizing, an irreversible intent of war, as a loaded gun at each others heads - it was not what Germany really desired for at the start.

**Firstly**, Russia was threatening to mobilize its huge, untrained army as a response to Austrian aggression against Serbia. The Austrian ultimatum ruffled many feathers in St. Petersburg, for Serbia was under the wing of Russian diplomacy. The Russian ambassador in Belgrade was consistently consulted over the two weeks of back and forth ultimatums in the lead-up to general war. Most of the time, he was the man calling the shots - would Russia come to the aid of Serbia, the Slavic cousin of the great Slav protector itself. Germany, naturally, came to the aid of its ally Austria. So, firstly, it was a tit-for-tat series of mobilizations/the Austrian alliance that obligated a German mobilization.

**Secondly**, Germany was intent on striking at France before the French could hit them. Ever since 1871 Berlin had been suspicious of the French revanche, an insistent need to prove lost honour. This meant that Berlin was constantly suspicious of encirclement both diplomatically and militarily. So Berlin urged on Vienna strongly in the July ultimatums as it could see Paris stirring in its peripheral vision, or so the Prussian statesmen imaging. So, war with Russia was a given since the 1892 Entente treaty obligated the Czar to help the French in their two-front war. So our second reason is a diplomatic feeling of isolation/encirclement prompted Germany to lash out.

**Thirdly**, was a deep German fear of Russian capability. The Germans were afraid of what the legendary Russian steamroller could do to eastern Europe - ala their worst nightmare of '44/'45. Germany was strong - but Russia had 114 divisions, twice as many big guns and eight million soldiers. Germany had just 96 divisions and 1 000 less heavy guns then the Russians. The only thing holding back the Slavic steamroller was a lack of capability in railroads. Germany had more railroad potential in Cologne then all of eastern Russia. But Russia - devastated by the defeat of 1905 to Japan - had under Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich attempted to reform the army. This 'Great Programme', though ultimately delayed by the corruption of the Minister for War after 1908, was promising to deliver a fully-capable railroad system in European Russia allowing them to mobilize the massive Imperial Army not in two years, as the German General Staff predicted in 1900, but in several months. 

As such, Berlin felt a need to beat Russia 'to the punch'. Leaders, like von Moltke, said that war must come before 1915 - the finish date of the 'Great Programme' - to allow Germany an even chance to fight a two-front war. It was, in the end, a race against time for military superiority. So, our third reason for war is that Germany felt pressured by Russian upgrades and felt it urgent to war Russia for supremacy before the upgrades of 1915. 

**Other** reasons were psychological. Perhaps more minor to fear of Russian military superiority or alliances, but race was an issue as well. The feeling of racial superiority over the 'Slavs' tinted the feeling of mistrust between Berlin and St. Petersburg. This was also a prompter of warm relations between the United Kingdom and Germany - for both considered each other racial brothers in the Anglo-Saxon mould, and many in both nations deemed each other natural allies. That the Germans let this slip away despite two offers of British alliances in 1904 is a tribute to their woeful foreign policy. 

As for psyche, militarism was born in Prussia. The old Junkers class was imbued with a Clausewitzian sense of war from birth. Berlin, and the region of Prussia, positively thrived off war. The entire nation, initially a patchwork of small German states, was born in the heat of war and in the quiet halls of an conquered enemy. As ever the conqueror, the Germans lived from 1871 onwards in constant suspicion of revanche - and despite Bismarck's masterful efforts of realism, they were victims of their own militaristic policies. Berlin simply assumed war would come - and so it did. 

So the reasons for war weren't nessecarily prompted by lust for territory or the like, but was rather a result of;

*  A **fear** of the capability of the Franco - Russian alliance.
* **Pressure** to strike before being outstripped by the Russian upgrades/'Great Programme of 1915.'
* An old, unbreakable **alliance** with Austria. 
* Both a fear of French **revanchinism** combined with rampant German **jingoism**. 
* A deep paranoia of diplomatic and militaristic **encirclement** and inferiority. 

The Treaty of Brest-Litovisk hoisted upon the new Bolshevik government in 1918 was an example of these. It demanded monetary repatriations as well as seizure of Russian Poland (i.e. a buffer against Russian aggression towards the Prussian homeland) and the freedom of the Ukraine. While this was all lost within months, it showed the limits of German jingoism. The war with Russia was, as well as being a result of alliances and national fears of race and isolation, a quick pre-emptive move to cut down Russia before it achieved its foreseen full potential.

From Alexandria, Christianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century of Saint Mark's arrival in Alexandria, as is clear from a fragment of the Gospel of John, written in Coptic, which was found in Upper Egypt and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century, and the New Testament writings found in Oxyrhynchus, in Middle Egypt, which date around the year 200 AD. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local language, today known as the Coptic language, but known as the Egyptian language at the time. By the beginning of the 3rd century AD, Christians constituted the majority of Egypt’s population, and the Church of Alexandria was recognized as one of Christendom's four Apostolic Sees, second in honor only to the Church of Rome. The Church of Alexandria is therefore the oldest Christian church in Africa.

&gt;The spider species ___Argiope aurantia___ is commonly known as the __yellow garden spider__,   __black and yellow garden spider__,  __golden garden spider__,  __writing spider__, or __corn spider__. It is common to the [contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States), [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii), southern [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico), and [Central America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America). They have distinctive yellow and black markings on their [abdomens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen) and a mostly white [cephalothorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalothorax). The etymology of its name means ""[gilded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded) [silver-face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argiope_(spider\))"". Males range from 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) females from 19–28 mm (0.75–1.10 in). These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed, but the venom is seemingly harmless to humans.

Germany being the villain in the First World War is not strictly true. Post-war history tends to evaluate it fairly and swing between painting Germany as a victim of European politicking or, yes, more widely accepted, as the architect of the entire war.

Many leading accounts charge that despite the aggression of Austria in July 1914 - issuing unacceptable ultimatums, threatening mobilization - it was that Berlin allowed for this to happen that gives it the title of puppeteer. As Max Hastings puts it - Vienna was given a 'blank cheque' by Berlin, the carnage it laid down afterwards can be traced back - like an associate in the murder of European peace - the offices of Berlin. 

Berlin let its hotheaded ally run free with aggression, aware of the possibility of war with Serbia, and ultimately, Russia. Germany, ever eager to spring into action against France - had persistently ever since 1890 been the instigator behind a series of international crisises which brought Europe to the edge of war. Germany was undeniably the ill tempered young child freshly installed to the council of Great Powers. It banged its fist for more respect, more colonies and more power. Its Prussian militarism was unchecked - even despite the ravaging of the Junkers class in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 - and problems like the naval race of 1906 onwards or the consistent German machinations against France simply promised war, and painted an dishnourable picture in the eyes of many other powers. 

This view of Prussian militarism was widely accepted. General Schlieffen had in 1908 published the entirely of his plans for the invasion of Belgium in a Berlin newspapers in protest against changes wrought by von Moltke. This was so wide-read it reached the British Committee of Imperial Defence - and the likes of Sir Henry Wilson. It also didn't help that members of the German General Staff or the Emperor himself, even, openly discussed the inevitability of war even when dining in London or Brussels. Prussian militarism was an open secret of the pre-war world, and begged for distrust before the first shots were even fired. 

So it was a combination of unchecked, open jingoism combined with the clear visibility of the puppet strings in the crisis of July 1914 that gave birth to a natural distrust of Germany then - both history and contempoary public opinion were prejudiced to view them as the instigators and 'villain'. 

Though you say that Berlin was the cultural centure of pre-war Europe, this isn't entirely true. All of Europe was basking in the glory of a golden cultural age, but the undeniable centre was Paris - the envy of even Emperor Wilhelm himself, who yearned to visit. While many saw Paris as the culture capital of Europe, the booming factories of the Rhineland or the great innovations of Brandenburg were just as much the envy of many. Germany was the economic powerhouse of Europe, nearly outstripping the other Great Powers. Its population in the Fatherland alone neared on 100 million - almost more in 2 million square miles then all the French in double that area. Germany was investing double what France was in North America, and nearly as much in Latin America. It was growing by the year, and the young pup was threatening the old order of empires yearly. Naturally - even in the racial ally of the British Empire - the burgeoning German Empire was viewing with distrust and suspicion - both themes which tinted the eventual perception of the Germans. 

Of course, Allied propaganda had to paint them in a bad light after war was declared. Especially in Britain, where the aristocratic society in particular constantly flirted with an obession in all things German. While France was seen as old and uncouth, the new German culture - so similar to the UK - was beloved by high society and even popular opinion in Britain. Even the government was tempted with co-operation with Germany in 1899 and 1904 (by times rejected by Berlin). So, once it appeared that militaristic Germany was going to threaten the treasured balance of power on the continent - and that London would have to step in with France - propaganda had the mighty and unenviable task of convincing the British people that the Germans were their natural, hated enemy; and what better way then painting them as barbarians pillaging poor Belgium. It's just another case of war-time propaganda dehumanizing the enemy. 

Historical hatred between France and Germany did provide such a feat of propaganda for the French - the Franco-Prussian War, as Bismarck predicted, provided anti-German sentiment alone. 

So - as a summary of this - Germany was and is painted as the villain in a combination of valid and understandable reasons, historically. They were seen as jingoistic and warmongerers even before the war. When the war eventually did come, they made no fuss about being seen as the instigators (e.g. openly invading Belgium, mobilizing against Russia etc). They were the upstarts of Europe, rapidly growing in power and responsbility. And finally, they were, naturally, part of the wartime propaganda to breed hatred for the enemy.

What's the answer? Just keep shooting people, because the right to bear arms is so sacrosanct it is basically a religious belief, and damn the consequences? 

I think this comment on the Economist sums it up pretty well:

&gt; Oh, poor misguided TE. Surely what is needed, in order to make the USA less of an outlier in the global gun-deaths league, is for wimpy European countries to start handing out firearms to their citizens?

Sure, you were just joking. A rather pathetic way to qualify your statements.

This narrative of yours reveals a fundamental flaw in your logic that is quite common among libertarians where the root of all evil and the usual scapegoat is the government.

&gt; you can be charged multiple times for hate speech already.

No, because calling an idiot on the internet a moron and another dude fatty after he suggests that being overweight is totally the same as being born African-American or part of a religious group is hardly hate speech. 

""Hey, it's not your own fault you got fat and it can never be changed either, just like being born Asian.""

I pointed out quite often how you amateurishly try to play the victim and willfully misinterpret these laws in favour of what crumbles down to an inane attempt at a tu-quoque-fallacy. The definitions are quite clear as to which groups need protection. How severe the discrimination is then and which punishment is justified is something that will be decided case by case, but that's not more or less arbitrary than every other legal scenario. There is no completely strict definition of how inflicting physical harm has to look to justify this or that punishment.

&gt; I just need to find a prosecutor willing to charge you, a jury willing to convict you, and a media circus that'll stir up sentiment against you. This shows how arbitrary it all is.

Yeah, you just have to fullfil a ton of completely unrealistic and hypothetical scenarios you're just moronically pulling out of your ass for it to work...again, hate speech laws are not abused by a moron that got called out on his bullshit. Fun fact, the jurisdiction is a bit ahead of a dense dipshit on the internet who believes he has outsmarted the legislative of several first world nations.

&gt; Immorality is objective

That's a brave claim. Completely idiotic and neglecting the reality of this world, but brave.

&gt; so no one ""says"" what is immoral in a libertarian system

So you mean people magically agree to a set of rules that are already clear to everybody because they are ""natural""... wonder why nobody in human history ever thought of this and successfully established such a system where everyone is already aware of what's wrong and right.

&gt; Right, right. I forgot that freedom of speech holds no real value for you people

Well, the way you use it it's a mere buzzword. Like freedom is an empty phrase that long lost it's meaning for you folks, constantly abused by libertarians as the one knockout argument, manically stammered like a religious doctrine. What it crumbles down to is, you claim people wouldn't be free because they decided that using the word ""nigger"" to discriminate against members of our society was something black people should be able to protect themselves against.

&gt; It's the same as telling a psychopath that ""murder is wrong,"" and he responds ""You don't even make an argument.

A majority of us decided that murder is wrong just as a mojority decided at one point that slavery was wrong. People like you made the same bullshit arguments then. ""It's my right to own a slave, he's my property...nobody infringes on my right to treat my property how I want etc."" If you were actually consistent in your assertions about how majorities dictate laws and how that was bad...but you completely contradict yourself.

&gt; freedom of speech is valuable because it's a guarantee of personal liberty and a check against government tyranny

Because not calling black folks ""niggers"" is literally tyranny. We saw how amazing ""all men are created equal"" worked out in America. In fact Ferguson reminded us last week how that turned out. The shit you come up with. I don't know why I even agreed to reading this nonesense this time. Such a waste of fucking time.

&gt; No, no one has the right not to be offended

Who says that? You? The government? The highest bidder? Who defines what a right is? A philosopher? A banker? What decides what a natural right in a society is? The good in all of us that is just there? 

You're quite naive.

&gt; See above, about the legal texts

Yeah I read that and you simply insist for your argument to work that you could willy-nilly bend these definitions to fit your moronic view despite being completely delusional.

&gt; ven though I find it ridiculous that people ""defend themselves"" by jailing others who say things they don't like.

A fine and an apology is usually the way to go...but k. For some time in jail that would have to be something really severe. Last case of hate speech I heard about was a dude that openly propagated we should be killiing and slaughtering gays at the Christopher Street day. Some people feared he could really do something like that or incite someone else. He had to pay 280bucks.

&gt; In a country with freedom of speech

The first amendment has limitations.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_words

And there is quite the heavy censorship besides that. You can't even swear on television or in songtexts. Straight up tyranny.

And because I like to laugh:

&gt; Smells like oppression to me.

Stop smelling your own farts, dimwit.

&gt; This is why in America, where hate speech is not punished, the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and the Westboro Baptist Church can openly express their views but are not taken seriously

The real nutters and political extremists hide in the political ""elite"" of your country. Denying climate change, spreading lies in favour of certain political lobbies etc. ""War on terror"", ""war against the evil axis""Creationism in schools, the list of ignorance is very long... The NSA is probably the biggest threat to the rights of human beings all around this globe right now.

&gt; Meanwhile, in Europe where far-right parties are banned and hate speech punished, both neo-Fascism/neo-Nazism and radical fundamentalist Islam are taken seriously and are gaining legitimacy

No, it's not that easy and again you reveal your lack of insight into the actual matter. Your view is based on parroted talking points, myths and lies. Far right parties are not banned, the political discourse is not hindered. Parties are banned that see themselves in the direct tradition of the NSDAP. Now there is an actual legitimacy to that. The NSDAP was responsible for the death of millions of people and the most horrible war in human history so far. US-Communists are apparently worse than that however considering how many actions were taken against them in the 50s.

What it crumbles down to is that you believe you could control extremists groups by laughing about them. How did laughing work out for your beheaded journalists? 

Organizations like the KKK are not held at bay because you can make fun of them, it's because times changed and the society as well as the educational system brings light to the atrocities committed in the past. They became less popular with the progress of the society and the globalization.

Westboro Baptist Church is a nice example considering you talk about giving somebody legitimacy. Well, here we have a family with a handful of members that constantly manages to make national news.

&gt;  ""discrimination""

The word itself is quite the broad term, that's why legal texts specify the parameters.

&gt; Would Christians be protected?

You asked that before, of course they would...read the fucking definition. Religious groups are in there. It simply doesn't happen that often since most of our western societies are based on Christianity and progressed quite steadily to the societies we live today. I was babtized but consider myself an agnostic. I can openly criticise the church for questionable practices in the past, just as I can criticise Islamic nations or the US for still enforcing death penalty. Keeping it technical and factual is key in these instances. Something the inter-US debate would benefit from, too. You're too busy openly insulting and amateurishly defaming the other political side (in your two party system of liberal vs conservative) over long known talking points like abortion etc.

&gt; What if they believe that criticism of Christianity is ""hate speech""?

Criticism is not unlawful. How did you still not get that?

&gt; Would the mentally challenged be protected? Why or why not? If so, then you're already guilty of hate speech.

If I would advocate on a public platform that mentally challenged or disabled people are unworthy of living and need to be euthanised because they are no actual human beings I would have to face the consequences. That should be common sense.

I called you a retard because you argue like an idiot basing your opinion on half-truths and misinterpretations. That's not hate speech...unless you would like to make the point that you are actually mentally challenged and I therefore discriminated against you as an individual. As I said before however, I believe you're more the product of a poor educational system and the neglect of your parents and general surrounding. You were not born that way, you had a chance, it's just that you loser blew it.

No, there was no overspending of European governments (except perhaps Greece, but that was outright fraud), the problems only started when they had to bail out the banks when *their* irresponsible overleveraging scheme collapsed. That caused panic on the market until the ECB was allowed to play its role of lender of last resort medio 2012. In the words of Draghi: ""The ECB will do anything necessary to support the Euro."" Bam, the sovereign debt crisis stabilized. Now we only need to get the economy going again, and that won't happen unless we activate the money that sits idle.

&gt;and the current EU crisis which was caused by states spending way more than they can afford.

It's not because you keep repeating it that it becomes true.

No, it's a punishment. It only makes sense in the moralistic framework of sin and punishment. When there is a crisis you need to *support* the population, otherwise there will be even less spending, less business, more bankrupcies, more layoffs, less spending etc.

&gt;The point is that these states have been living way beyond their means and austerity is a way to reform their unsustainable systems.

&gt;However, the Tactics Group company is also well introduced in the field of defense manufacturing: it is the sole European distributor of the C-More M26-MASS modular assault shotgun system also used by the United States Army, and cooperated with Rheinmetall to take part to the ""Kampwertsteigerung"" program, which led to the spawning of the Mg3-KWS 7.62x51mm-NATO modernized general-purposes machinegun for the German Bundeswehr.

&gt;That's why the Tactics Group's latest and more fancy creation − the MG-14z − might actually have a future: conceived to enhance the firepower of these military units that still issue the Mg3 or other Mg42 variants − including the Italian MG-42/59 or the former Yugoslavian SARAC-53 − the MG-14z is as close as you could get to a double barrel MG.

&gt;Only the receivers of two separate MG3s remain in the MG-14z; everything is re-engineered and rebuilt from the ground up: new barrels with ventilated metal shrouds, new feeding ports, new twin feeding systems with downwards ejection, new single pistol grip and trigger, new common chassis.

&gt;As the project is currently ongoing, there's no further information currently available about the MG-14z; the Tactics Group GmbH company however seems to believe in it, going as far as to call it ""a low-cost alternative to Miniguns"".

I believe that your question has been answered to have both printed+digital editions, but I'd like to add some thoughts.

I agree that best option is to have printed copy and preferably also digital edition (especially if sold in one package - I like to read both offline and online). But digital edition for me means all three formats: pdf/epub/mobi (second and third formats are just variation of one another; and pdf is ""digital variation"" of printed copy - so basically there are only two forms of book).
Also when we think about 3d models, which probably will be colourful, on Kindle they will be shown as black/greyscale but when viewed on tablets/PCs they will have colours. I think it can be tricky to prepare good colourful images, that will be also acceptable when displaying in greyscale, but for me Kindle is a second reader (primary is printed book).

If I have to choose beetwen, say for example, one 800+ pages  book (one volume), or two 400+ pages books (two-volume), I would better like one volume. A thing to thought about is that possibly when vol 1. is about ""fundamental knowledge"" and ""program implementation"", and vol 2. is about ""other factors"" and ""excercise infomation"", then it is possible that more readers will buy vol 1., and less of them will also buy vol 2. But I don't know how to estimate/predict that.

As I'm living in Poland (Central Europe), I must ask about possibility of translation to my native Polish language (and for German, Chinese, Brazilian and others, of course). When self-published, or published by publisher, this should be possible. Any plans in that matter? You know, to try to take over the world ;) (for me English is okay, but not every gymnastics enthusiast here speaks English).

---

&gt;

&gt;The tradition of __Saint Nicholas' Day__, on December 6th (19 December in most [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox) countries), is a festival for children in many countries in Europe related to surviving legends of [Saint Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas), and particularly his reputation as a bringer of gifts. The American [Santa Claus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus), as well as the British [Father Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Christmas), derive from these legends. ""Santa Claus"" is itself derived in part from the Dutch *[Sinterklaas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas)*.Saint Nicholas is spelt 'Sankt Nikolaus' in German.

From what I've found - its very hard to find excellent singaporeans in large numbers.  There are definitely some as I work with a few but there's an awful lot of cruft to cut through.  Part of the problem is just the absolute tiny labor pool.  If you need 100 people and there's only a thousand or two graduating a year, you can't be picky about picking the top 1-5% like you can in larger labor markets.  What inevitably happens is you get very few who pass the qualifying interviews and even fewer who can perform once you get thru.  This doesn't mean anything about the quality - no matter what, all labor pools have a normal distribution of talent.  Top singaporeans are just as good as top US or europeans in their respective markets.  Its just that the top 1% is only like 100 people spread across 1000 companies all clamoring to get them.   

The other problem is like you said - there is a bad mindset among many I've seen.  Now this may be due to the distribution problem above or may not.  But I have seen a large sense of entitlement and an honest over-estimation of their skillset/capability and in the end - their worth.  Many think they're smarter and better than they really are and demand treatment or have attitudes that would get them instantly fired in larger/multinational companies.  I've had one former employee threaten me saying I better do this or they'll harass me until they're satisfied.  WTF.  They're freshly graduated so I wrote that off as not really understanding the real world doesn't work like an action/drama movie where they're the big star and things are supposed to work out for them in the end.  Needless to say - I would never hire them again and would never give a good referral.  

So yeah - my reactions are similar to you.  There are good ones but many need to stop being so sheltered and learn how the world really works.  ",False,nenmoon,t5_2qh8c,1417442913,t3_2nxpom,cmhvhci

It is basically all NATO nations minus Turkey. I am not arguing whether the sanctions are proper or not, I am merely pointing out that seeing this as a multi national response is farcical when looking at the relations the nations  imposing the sanctions have with one another.

How do else you explain why the other independent large economies have refused to sanction Russia?

Whatever the reasons, the fact that it is entirely NATO vs Russia only feeds Putin's spin on the situation.

Being an EU citizen myself, I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that my government are US stooges, ever since George W Bush was president, and Fogh got that sweet promotion as NATO secretary. There is not a foreign policy decision made without US consent.

Case in point the drawer of the Muhammed drawings got assaulted some time ago, the criminal fled the country but got caught and arrested in Turkey. Subsequently the Turkish government released him in a hostage exchange, the Danish public was outraged, and wanted a response from the Turkish government, and so did our politicians. Until the US told us to back off because they feel Turkey is a more strategic partner, suddenly the government flips 180 and drops pursuing the matter entirely, after a week of aggressive communications sent to Turkey.

Another recent example is the NATO/US base in Greenland. In the contract for lease of the base it is stipulated that facility's maintenance must be sourced to either a Danish or a Greenlandic company in order to keep Greenlands economy afloat. The US has now hired an American company instead, and basically changed the contract to fit its terms.
How many people can change their lease contracts and basically tell their landlords to suck it? The governments response is non existent, beyond a strongly worded letter. Some even praising it as it might bring profits from tourism.

 [**Universal health coverage by country**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal%20health%20coverage%20by%20country): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;[Universal health coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_coverage) is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such programs is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal health care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually some costs are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs are paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care. The UK government's [National Audit Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office_(United_Kingdom\)) in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine universal systems against one non-universal system (the U.S.), and their relative costs and key health outcomes.  A wider international comparison of 16 countries, each with universal health care, was published by the [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) in 2004  In some cases, government involvement also includes directly managing the [health care system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system), but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.

All of the cops on here are basically giving you bullshit excuses that they heard from the people who taught them as if it were scientific fact. It is not. If in fact they only pulled out their weapon as a last resort then shooting center mass would be acceptable. The problem is they don’t. They pull out their weapon at the first sign of trouble. Police in other countries are taught to fire a warning shot if necessary, to shoot to wound if necessary, and to shoot to kill if necessary. In other words they are taught to use their brain to assess the situation. Cops in America act like they are totally on autopilot because of their “training”. This allows them to shoot to kill in every scenario and not get in trouble or lose their jobs. These are grown thinking adults and they can easily assess a situation and determine if deadly force is needed or not. Yes when a suspect is trying to kill the cop *and* actually has a chance of killing the cop, of course the cop can kill the suspect. There is never any question about that. The problem is most people aren’t really try to kill the cop or the cop is not in that serious of danger.

Here is an article about German police vs US police and “contagious shooting”:

http://rt.com/usa/us-germany-85-shots-022/

Notice something: They fired 85 shots and 49 were warning shots!
Here is what police in America will tell you. Aim for center mass because you should never pull your gun out unless you mean to kill because a gun is only used to kill. That is incorrect. A gun is a tool. Sometimes a warning shot (generally fired in the air by European police) is enough to get a suspect to stop. Sometimes you can shoot a suspect in the leg. Sometimes you have to kill the suspect. A gun is a tool and can be used in more than one way. 

Here is another article about German police:

http://www.dw.de/why-german-police-officers-rarely-reach-for-their-guns/a-17884779

“Berlin's RBB TV channel found out that two-thirds of the people who were killed by police gunfire over the past five years were either mentally ill or known to the police as having mental problems.”

This is the thing, most of the time sane people will surrender given a chance. Mentally ill people won’t. Police in America don’t give them a chance to surrender. They don’t try to talk to the suspects. They open fire to kill and empty their clip.

Finally, I am going to address one more point which is really the bottom line when talking about this. Police in America have actually forgotten what their job is. The job is to protect and serve the public. This includes the people you are arresting. Police in America play on your sympathies and want you to side with them because they are the “good” guys and the suspect is the “bad” guy. They say things like “We should be able to do our jobs safely and return home to our families at night”. Here is the thing. NO YOU SHOULDN’T. As a citizen of the United States, I have an expectation to be able to travel and live in safety in this country. As a police officer, when you are OFF duty, you have the same expectation. As a police officer, when you are ON duty, you do not have that expectation. You signed up to risk your life to ensure other peoples safety, including people committing crimes. Drawing and firing your weapon at the first sign of trouble in an attempt to lower the risk of your job means you are not fulfilling your oath as a police officer. Because in the end that is mostly what is happening here. Police draw and kill with their gun quickly in America in an attempt to lower the risk of the job because they either don’t believe in doing their duty as a police officer or they don’t know what the job is actually supposed to entail (and if they did they wouldn’t have signed up for it). That is what it is all about. Lowering their risk because they value their life over the job.
