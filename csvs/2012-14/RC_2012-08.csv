Other cultures, not so much, but ours do. That means though that both progressive and conservatives positions can be taken. A woman can be deeply entrenched in all the stereotypical ""female"" things and no one should have an issue with it. She would be reinforcing stereotypes merely by existing (i.e. ""girls"" do like pink, throw softly, spend large amounts of money on make-up, etc). She can embody that entire concept in a gender fluid society. It would be impossible, given this is the case to eliminate gendered phrases. We could possibly dilute them, which I also think we are doing. 

I don't know if your understanding of such a society differs from my own. I also don't know how beneficial it would be, for people that like those things naturally. I'm a relatively stereotypical guy, and while I don't feel forced into the position I'm in, I might have to go on the defensive if these stereotypes became abhorrent for some reason. Would I be mocked for my ability and choice to adhere to ""archaic"" stereotypes in the new society's eyes? Shifting things around, broadening, and restricting can all have *some* negative impact. 

On topic, I don't have an issue with your objective, but I challenge how you are trying to bring it about. You shouldn't take a position of superiority over those that *do wish they hate bigger boobs* to appear more feminine in order to be ""fair"" towards the woman that gives no consideration to her breasts because they don't embody her gender. I metaphorical minefield if I've ever seen one. 

As for policing their actions, societal pressures are strong. They have little to do with gender itself as they do what the majority is comfortable with. I obviously don't want people to act in a manner they are uncomfortable with, but I can also be against society's freedom to be uncomfortable with certain individuals. I'd rather build up the individuals comfort though. In spite of what the majority (or minority) has to say about you, you are free to act in whatever responsible/safe manner you see fit. That message should be more important than the superficial changes you've listed, although they too seek to achieve the same end goal. Think about it this way, if aren't a gender-fluid and tolerant society how do those that go against expectations manage to do so? Without support of family or friends, or society at-large they can literally thrive as individuals. That is what I want to see more of, not the safety bubble around public perceptions. 

Sorry, this got a bit ranting and mostly due to a personally issue on the issue. I do hope I was able to make some sense though.

t1_c5mb71w,False,False,True,t1_c5liun1,"But the point still holds. I did not claim that we have a priori names for everything; I claimed that we do not go about naming things. Certainly, for lack of names, we use language to construct phrases and expressions which we intend to pick out various things in our surroundings. But those expressions are not names. They are prone to confusion; they are ambiguous; they are contextually dependent;... of course, for the same reasons, most proper names aren't ""names"" either--- that is, not in the sense that philosophers want to discuss.

Indeed, my whole point is that we stumble around to denote things as we can; but, for all the stumbling, we aren't giving names. Whereas in programing we're giving names all the time. We give names to new types, give names to new functions, give names to local variables. Even in languages with large standard libraries, we rarely have the breadth and depth of vocabulary that we do in natural language. Natural and programming languages are very different in this regard. We're stumbling to denote in both of them, but that stumbling looks very different. And in particular it looks very different with regards to naming, which is at the heart of ideas like RT.

When Frege and Russell and Carnap and Quine and everyone else was talking about RT, they were worrying about how it is that names denote. Not *what* it is that names denote, but *how*. But the fact that there are certain contexts where we can exchange one name for another, and other contexts where we cannot, throws a wrench into their attempts to understand and explain the phenomenon of denotation. That's the reason why they were concerned with RT. But if you go back and read the papers, their examples are all about the use of names. My argument is that their focus was due to the fact that their object of study was (European) natural languages, whereas in PL theory our notion of RT must necessarily diverge because of the differences between natural and programming languages with respect to names.",winterkoninkje,0,1,,0,0,1343780634,t5_2qh36,haskell,c5mb71w,,,1429520161,t3_x8rr6,1,

With a lot of help and studying on forums I made about € 800 from that first investment within a week. I started and thought I would just do it until I got back onto my feet......it lasted for about 4 years before I stopped, I was making a living traveling around with a laptop and collecting goods from post office boxes or social engineering tricks and selling them through fake credentials hours later, on average I made anywhere from € 2000-3500 a month which is a very good salary in my country. I quit because I started to feel guilty about what I was doing and also became paranoid and had trouble sleeping at night. 

Current carding scenes are really big, some user forums have up to 500 members active at any moment of the day an. Carding has become much harder and the European scene also is starting to fill with 14-16 year olds which instead of becoming ""Script-kiddies"" try their luck at fraud and get caught very very often.

The thing is, technology makes it possible to increase the bang for your buck on all those links in the chain. I don't foresee the entire industry ending anytime soon, but I see the model moving away from major labels for just about everything but the real mass-produced pop stuff (which does require the major label infrastructure for big ad campaigns, stadium tours, etc.) And if they all fizzled out and blew away I wouldn't shed a tear.

What's going to be left are the small labels with rosters of artists that they personally believe in and work in the trenches for. The profit margin probably isn't going to be as high but they are going to stick around because there is, as you said, still a need for gatekeepers--just not necessarily at the indulgent scale of the major labels of old.

Plenty of bands and labels are finding out that, yes, they need the label ""machine"", but it's not as big a machine as once it was. They don't need a huge corporation in order to get heard in Europe or Japan because word of mouth spreads without borders on the Internet. They don't need advertising--advertising needs THEM! (I still have moral quandaries about songs being used in commercials, but can't deny that bands can really catch a break these days with a good placement, and they're basically getting paid good money to have their music heard by millions.) Maybe we'll see fewer big arena tours, and that doesn't make me sad until I think of the kind of crazyawesome productions people like Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead are/were known for, but it will probably still happen.  

The main problem, as you've said, is the signal-to-noise ratio gets pretty horrible as the medium democratizes. But I think we'll still be able to find good music because the ways to do so keep multiplying. I'm finding better stuff now on blogs and shit than I ever did when I was a dumbass kid spoonfed by the radio, and I'm going out and seeing bands for $7 and paying like $25 for an LP and a t-shirt that I'm going to love for years and that is going to get them to the next town, and actually meeting these people who live for what they do even when it's playing for a handful of strangers in some bar, and at some level I have to take it as an article of faith that everyone's going to be ok. As long as people love playing and listening to music, no one's going to starve. I hope.

I just have to hope that enough people essentially want to support the music that enhances their lives, as I try to. I really do think things are going to reach a new balance sometime soon--what it will actually look like is yet to be determined.

Also totally off-topic, but the way horse slaughter was done when it was legal is very inhumane because horses were treated like cattle.  Horses are a much more flighty animal (prone to panic and run into fences), they fight with each other more than cattle do (so need more room), and the captive bolt method of slaughter isn't effective on horses for a quick death [\(a diagram of their respiratory system shows why- there's really no good spot to kill a horse using a captive bolt](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/image-of-the-week/2012/07/24/horse-respiratory-tract-in-3d/)).

Although I do think that horses are animals and people do have a right to eat them if they want, the way it used to be done wasn't right.  

I quite like the Swiss system for horse slaughter, horses are denoted either for consumption or not for consumption.  They have a different set of drugs each group is allowed to be administered (in the US, there are a lot of dangerous drugs that you can give horses, but no laws to prevent those horses from being used for human consumption).

Access to technology and medicine

&gt;Or why the U.S.'s life expectancy is far lower than the U.K.'s and Canada's despite having better technology and by far spending more on healthcare per a capita?

The healthcare system in the US is wasteful and engenders competition based on coverage regardless of quality which causes costs to rise dramatically by encouraging cutting corners to provide more things that are ""covered"". They don't have the same healthcare systems at all so comparing spending per capita isn't a fair comparison.

Technically it is. What did those women do to not have equal consideration for a nursing job?

The point of my exercise was to show how problematic it is to enforce ""social debts"" by the examples we would use to ""pay back"" men. People who were held back then aren't necessarily held back now, so to inherit social debts is very bizarre to me. I mean I have German and Celtic ancestors; should I get something special for that considering how they were treated by Europeans before America came to be by people whose descendants became ""privileged whites"" somewhere else, or does it not matter because I ended up being white?

In case you don't understand, that's five million people that Israel excludes from living in their former homeland based on their ethnicity. I am, quite frankly, fucking terrified at the fact that most Westerners and folks like you either do not admit, acknowledge, believe, or know about this system of racial apartheid, when we are bankrolling it. Could someone please tell me whether it's ignorance or racism? It totally sucks that a solid portion of Palestinian people, mostly in Gaza (a squalid gulag regulated from the outside in the style of a maximum security prison by Israel) hold very conservative religious beliefs (ie the periodic stoning of women and gays), but this has FUCKING NOTHING to do with another nation's right to control, regulate, invade, bomb, occupy, starve, imprison, racially segregate, economically exploit, and plunder the resources of these people. It is an internal problem. Sorry pick again. Find another distasteful attribute of Palestinians to justify your completely lopsided and entirely unfair view of the situation.

Edit: To respond to your other paper-thin arguments: The Iroquois were never a formally recognized country, but does that justify a system of racial apartheid and consistent ethnic cleansing and genocide wrought by Europeans? Are you insane? As for peace negotiations: First of all, it must be said that Palestine is militarily occupied, because of... nothing. There's no initial reason for it, other than aggressive Israeli expansionism. What a ridiculous situation to ask for ""peace negotiations"" in. Since you will dismiss this because you don't appreciate ethical/moral consistency (the phrase 'put yourself in ___'s shoes carries a lot of weight here), I'll say this: Israel is the dominant military power in the Middle East. They hold complete and absolute power over the physical lives of Palestinians. They demand negotiations that deny Palestinians the right to all of their land, military and political sovereignty, and control of their own resources, and Palestinians are therefore nothing but self-respecting for giving them the finger at "" peace talks"" (administered by the U.S.! The sole world power supporting Israel materially economically and ideologically! The irony is almost unbearable!) where this is the proposal. That said, the PA, Hamas, and the Arab League have more-or-less continually left a peace offer open to Israel and the U.S. since the '70's that involves a Palestinian state, '67 borders, no attacks or incursions (by Israel), etc. It was in the form of a unanimous agreement in the UN general assembly (unanimous except for, of course, the US and Iarael) in 1976, and Arab states carried this position through with them to 2002 and beyond, with the Arab Peace Initiative, involving the same basic elements.

With all rules one has to draw formalized distinctions even if the actual distinctions are somewhat fuzzy. For practical purposes white can be defined as any white gentile of European descent.

I would also exclude Albanians and Bosnians because even though they are white genetically their Muslim roots align them more closely with the Turks.

t1_c5mdmud,False,False,True,t3_xguvj,"Gallantry, chivalry, and ""women and children first"" are throwbacks to an ignorant era, just as slavery and class castes are throwbacks.

There once was a time when educated people - educated for their time and place, that is - thought that people with dark skin were inferior, intellectually, morally, physically, and in any other way you choose, to people with lighter colored skin. The idea today is completely ludicrous, though it lives on in pockets of ignorance pretty much across the globe.  It was born from the European dominance of the tropics, especially Africa, during the colonial era. Many otherwise good people felt fully justified in these beliefs, at the time. In fact at that time white europeans were likely to be richer, more educated, more technologically advanced (ships, tools, navigation, printing presses, etc), and all of this point-in-time advantage was used to justify the idea that it's the natural order that white people are superior.  

Likewise, the idea that women and children are more precious than men stems from a time when populations were fragile, and in order to remain stable, societies needed breeding women. Children were also fragile, and many died young, which means a group needed lots of children to get a few mature adults. One man could mate with 4 women and produce 4 offspring, therefore the stability of a micro-society depended on the health and survival of at least as many women as men. This is the same reason women were kept in the home - to protect them from the dangers of life.  

But times are different now. By and large we no longer have frontier societies. The Oregon Trail is the stuff of memory; the failed Jamestown colony is not likely to happen again. Infant mortality is low, and we need less than replacement rates of reproduction. Life expectancy has nearly doubled in 100 years. The dangers of regular life have greatly lessened. There is no reason any longer to prefer women, or to hide women indoors so as to protect them. Let them join the society! 

In some areas where tribalism and the old way of thinking still dominates, there is still a preference for breeding women, and large families, and restricted movement of women, in order to increase the population and overcome nearby competitive societies. But in enlightened places we're learning to get along with each other. The threat of expiration of the group is non-existent. Women have a purpose other than breeding. It's better for society that women enjoy full liberty, rather than ""enjoying"" a protected existence locked in a safehouse.

The next logical conclusion of that, is that ""women and children first"" makes no sense any longer. Really. No sense at all. 

A man is as valuable as a woman. A man is as valuable as a young child. To suggest otherwise is as repugnant as to suggest that a brown person is less valuable than a light-skinned person, or that a European is ""worth more"" than an Arab, or that a rich person is more deserving of human rights than a poor one. All wrong ideas.  We are all humans, and we should respect that.   
  
Let go of the emotional irrational tie that is telling you, ""But... it's always been this way."" It once was that way, but it need not be that way. 

The ""Chivalry"" and ""gallantry"" that encourages men to sacrifice themselves arbitrarily for women or children is backwards, throwback thinking. It's outdated and dangerous, it leads to other societal problems, it encourages discrimination in human aspects other than gender, and it's time for it to go.  
 
Let any man, any person in fact, make the decision to sacrifice his body or his life for another. But let's stop calling it ""manly"" to do so.  It's not ""manly,"" and it's backwards and ignorant to suggest that it's manly. It might be selfless, but it is no longer important for societies that men sacrifice themselves.

t1_c5mdn8r,False,False,True,t1_c5mblzf,"I like the conversation. You are not wrong, but you are not fully informed. Let's see:

9) I can not write a detailed business plan, and I am having a hard time managing my finances. You talk of these things like they are trivial and something you do between brushing your teeth and applying deodorant. [A business plan is a massive document (7 actually) that should take incredible amounts of time, as it sets up your entire business.](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/printthis/38308.html)

8)""Market yourself"" is not relevant in this conversation. Marketing describes product packaging, among other VITAL aspects to the 'market image' one is trying to produce. It's a very complex field, and one does not simply 'market themselves' in business. We are talking business, right? [Just look at the key concepts on the Wiki page, it's a ton of information to properly present your products in a market environment.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing) This is not MySpace, point-and-shoot cameras need not apply. Marketing is not even advertisement placement, that's called [Advertising - see paragraph two.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing#Further_definitions)

7) Good, let's not argue.

6) I wont bring age bias into it, I'm young as well. The more important fact is that 'shitty music' in my terms is less qualified music. Non practiced, and poorly recorded. This is the core of the industry lately, from major to indie. Don't use that as a stance to stop the furtherance of it, before the entire industry is swamped by it. Cream is not rising to the top, there's too much churn for that to happen. Songs don't stay around, and so don't have to be crafted to do so.

5) Golden Rings.

5) You must be kidding. Even iTunes takes 30%, and that's digital distribution from the biggest distributor. Them taking it after the sale, or you paying for it up front - it's same difference (best use of this phrase to date). Distribution is the act of producing the copies, and moving them to places where they can 'retail.' This can be digital, but how many people whine about **not having physical product?** B, please. It takes truckers, it takes gasoline, it takes Gantt charts and accountants to make the necessary changes in the right column when you have to buy back the merchandise. B, please.

4) Your number four has no information for me to go off of, so let me research that, because it's likely a very important point that I should explain to help lighten your darkness.... *holy shit, I was right*. As mentioned in 5, you don't understand distribution. Maybe I don't either, but one thing **I do understand is the shift from using trucks to move products to store so you can buy it and drive home in your car and pop it in a CD player.** Nowadays, you have provided most of the backbone needed. You purchase an expensive computer, pay monthly for a fast internet service to have these products delivered to you, and *then* we look at the cost of the music product, which using the definition of the old music industry, would hardly be a product at all. Can you imagine the following?: sitting in a recording studio, playing back your latest single, and thinking, likely very high *""Man, we should just sell the muuusic, man...*."" That's what you want for free, sound vibration. **Distribution is a whole process, and is not simply the act of uploading it to a place like YouTube for another to download.** Especially if your product is super-high audio quality, as YouTube can simply not handle that much data distribution.

3)** Don't debase yourself with an insult in my direction.** I will point you to the following shitty band webpages:  
[Acoustalyn](http://www.acoustalyn.com/) - I met the guy that started this group in Austin, and I believe he actually might be an idiot. I don't mean that in any real sense of the word, but he's a regular guy, trying to make a go at it, which I have always applauded them for. They actually play and record and have more success than I do, because I think about shit like the state of the industry. He just tries to get gigs and play out. Is *this* what you want the glorious music business to be?  
[Gerald Massoud](http://geraldmassoud.com/) - Actually a close friend of mine. I like his website, and had input on it. He's an amazing bassist, because he didn't spend his time learning web design. A functional webpage from a working musician. I believe this is what you think is 'okay,' and in the interest of this conversation, it is not. He deserves a label paying for a top-level website, from his performances and dedication. I wish I could be that for him, and one day, I plan to.
[Yes, it's not a shitty site, but **Fiona Apple**](http://www.fiona-apple.com/) - She is a Sony artist, and pretty major in my eyes. This website is different from the others. Care, time, and design were all put into it. Let me know if you don't agree with me, I'd be interested in your taste opinion as much as all of your other opinions.  

2 are we done yet?)
The proliferation of guitar players today is a direct result of guitar based rock. The piano sheet music industry of the late 1800s produced massive amounts piano sales, because it was the primary way to get music back home. I could (and have) easily brought boom boxes into it, because without them, you wouldn't have any way to pay 5 bucks in the first place. It's all connected. Please realize this, don't just debase what I am saying. **I am silly, though.**

1) Yes, the shit on my desk as I type this would have made the Beatles cream their Mod boots, but no. You DO need amazing studio gear. [Here's a clip of Goyte in some home studio environment](http://vimeo.com/39364414). Yes, you can do it, and yes it sounds okay. Frankly, I still listen to this digital shit. But today I had the luxury of hearing a 1/300 microphone that was refurbished in EU at the tune of $15,000. It was mixed with six other mics, all for one fucking Ovation guitar. There was no EQ to speak of, there was not much else. It was amazing to be listening over the ~cans~ headphones on the set up to my shitty songs, and how amazing it all sounded. Pretty much tears-to-your-eye kind of stuff. In all my years I have only had a few opportunities to get in these kinds of settings, and each time I am blown away.

Maybe the bigger point is the consumption factor. It doesn't matter that the recordings today were done using $50K in mics, and the control room had [THESE](http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/Images/MediaImages/medium/MZ1--Sound--studio-to-livingroom.jpg) behemoths at $20K each to listen to the recordings. If I took a copy home, it'd still come out of my $150 a par monitors, through my shitty mixer, and if I was on the road out of my tinny laptop.


Fuck, I hope someone appreciates this. I spent a long time learning what I know, and I am trying to give some of that back, but I'm done typing now. I'll post more later if the word Silly can be left out of your reply. Feel free to call me on my hypocrisy too.

t1_c5me05b,False,False,True,t1_c5mcfjm,"&gt;The Quran explains perfectly what is necessary to perform Salat. There is no specific way as described in the Hadith. The Hadith just makes prayer into a ritual, which it is not supposed to be. 

mmmm... I don't think so. Give me a step by step method of how to pray using only the Quran's instructions. This is actually a new one, because usually the line I hear from Quranists is that Arabs already knew how to perform Salat so there's no need to explain in the Quran.

&gt;And regarding Hajj: [1] This is just an example of the ample information provided by the Quran about Hajj.

That website is run by an organization that believes that a man named Rashad Khalifa (1939-1990) was a Messenger of God. They're heretics. Or are you part of their group, AKA a submitter? Because that will change the tone of this discussion a lot.

&gt;There are a ton. [2] This is an example I quickly found on Google.

That's another heretical Submitter website. Also, I want to see the sanad supporting the hadith they used. Can you source them?

&gt;one Hadith says to [3] cover your face leaving only one eye exposed but obviously most Muslim women do not do that, which goes against the Hadith.

I read the site and it looks like the idea of only having one eye exposed comes not from Hadith, but from Tafsir al-Qurtubi... which was written ~600 years after the death of Muhammad. It's just one middle age scholar's opinion.

It's unfair to categorize all Muslims as believing in some middle age scholar's personal opinion. There are a lot of different views on it in Islam, some people say it's fard (obligatory) but others say it's mustahabb (favored but not required). It's a fact that Muhammad's wives veiled themselves so some Muslim women have the idea that they should emulate Muhammad's wives... others don't. It's really not that big of a deal in places where it's not legally enforced. Other people go further and say that it's not Islamic at all, the former dean of Al Azhar in Cairo said that it's just a cultural practice and has no place in Islam. When you paint all Muslims with the same brush it's not right. There are a lot of different madhabs, please see [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Madhhab_Map2.png), and they all put weight in various Hadith and have differing scholarly opinions when it comes to Fiqh.

&gt;Here are some more crazy Hadiths.

Again, it's really irresponsible to just give a list of Hadith from all over, possibly stripping them of their context. What's their sanad? Which madhabs accept them?

&gt;That does not say to follow something that people wrote down of what they remember about him years after his death.

The Quran and the Hadith were written at the same time...

&gt;The Hadith isn't ""preserved."" In fact, [5] read (""Do not write anything from me EXCEPT QURAN. Anyone who wrote anything other than the Quran shall erase it."") what Muhammad said that directly opposes the Hadith!

That was only a temporary injunction so that Quran &amp; Hadith didn't get confused with each other. [They were both being recorded at the same time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hadith#Prophetic_Period). Then later on when there wasn't any more chance of confusion Muhammad said it's okay to write about his teachings.

&gt;The Quran says to listen to Muhammad, so I am listening to him by only reading the Quran, which he told us to follow.

You're a Muslim right? If you're a Muslim then you believe that the Quran is God's words, not Muhammad's words. Listening to Muhammad is completely separate from listening to the God, AKA the Quran.

&gt;No, not that I know of. Are you Persian? There are a lot of Persians in America who I know are atheist.

blech. The word ""Persian"" makes me cringe if it's used for anything besides the name of the language. Sorry if this sounds snooty but no I am not ""Persian"". I'm not a cat. I'm an American of Iranian descent.

I was curious because I've never met an Iranian family that was all atheists; then again I've never met a Tudeh/Marxist so that's why I was asking. Where do they hang out, sounds pretty cool actually.

&gt;Why don't women walk around in public showing off their breasts? It's common decency for women of all religions (or lack of religion) to cover their ""ornaments,"" not just Muslims. Most Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, atheists, etc. do not expose their breasts in public. And breasts are special, don't deny it (just kidding...).

Because there is a culture of sexualization regarding breasts. In lots of places in Europe it's not a big deal for a woman to go topless in appropriate places for example the beach... although those places usually have a bunch of pervy Americans/foreigners that camp out with binoculars... gross.

For me, breasts are primarily for providing milk to infants, that's their basic use. Just because they've been sexualized doesn't really mean much. All of a woman's body has been sexualized at some point. For example, there's people who have a foot fetish who get a kick (:P) out of looking at feet... does that mean women shouldn't wear sandals/flipflops anymore? And there are guys that sexualize a woman's face/mouth with oral sex, so should women have to cover her face/mouth?

Bottom line is that it's women who should have control over their bodies, and that should be the deciding factor, not whether or not a man thinks it's sexy. If it's not okay to look at breasts, then how about MEN turn their heads away, instead of women having to cover themselves up? This whole idea of men being sex fiends unable to control themselves is also rather sexist too. A woman should wear whatever he/she is personally comfortable with. If she wants to wear pants, that's okay, if she wants to wear ankle-length skirts, that's okay, if she wants to wear knee-length skirts, that's okay, if she wants to wear thigh-length skirts, that's okay too.

&gt;I want to get back to you on this after I read this verse in Arabic.

Sure. Are you fluent in Arabic?

&gt;Also, if you don't mind me asking, are you atheist?

Yes, I've been an atheist for about a decade (I'm 23). I've been studying Islam &amp; other religions since then. May I ask where you're from and how you got introduced to Islam? Thanks btw for responding.

They're no match for the US, but they're a hell of a lot better prepared than either Iraq or Afghanistan. They have a much larger population, and a better organized state that, while repressive, seems (to my layman self, please correct) to enjoy much more popular support. This analysis leads me to believe the end game will be pretty much the same as it is now in our other wars, but it'll take much longer to get there. If this is true, just think of how much that'll help out our economy.

Good post.  I've felt that Iran would be a more formidable opponent than Iraq or even Afghanistan.  I don't know if your last sentence was sarcasm though, the unpaid wars we have now haven't exactly helped the economy.   

Iran doesn't have ICBM's, but there is the (slight) possibility that they may pass on a portable 'suitcase' bomb and get it into the US, if  they wanted to attack us directly.  I don't think that's a realistic scenario though.  I think Pakistan is more dangerous in that regard.  But considering how much nuclear material has become unaccounted for in  Russia's de-nuking process, for quite some time now, I don't think that's going to happen anyway.  If that type of strike did happen, it would be in Europe, Israel, or maybe even Turkey.  Regardless, the US would respond, and Israel, as you say.

Initially, gold was held in banks at a 1:1 reserve ratio. After some time, banks found that only 33% of people needed their gold at any one point in time, so they changed the ratio to the 1/3 fractional reserve. After some time, the depression came in Europe and people stormed the banks wanting all their gold back, but they didn't have the gold, since they had already invested 66% of the people's money, so they closed their doors and searched for a solution. The USA came to Europe and told them that they held the world's largest gold reserves, and they would guarantee a 33% reserve if European countries based their currency on the US dollar, and they accepted. Some time later, Nixon decided to remove the fractional reserve entirely and base the entire world's currencies on the value of the US currency, which was both smart and incredibly corrupt, but these rulers are scum anyways so it's not unexpected. 

Today we have the fiat standard, and no, it's not a Riba contract, because Riba in Islam is an agreement to pay back or trade more currency for less currency, whether due to delayed payment or an immediate need by one party. Fiat currency does not match this situation. 

Fiat is Haram to establish, but not haram to use. In other words, the Islamic State is forbidden from setting it as the State's currency, but we are currently (without the Islamic State/Caliphate) allowed to use it as a medium for trade until the Islamic State is re-established.

Romans, on the other hand, had a cultural tendency for the men to cut their hair short as a sort of sign of military order and submission to the state, wheras Greeks tended to have longer hair and beards.

My professor back in college seemed to suggest that long hair continued to be valued in Western European countries after the fall of the Roman Empire and that short hair was picked up during the late 18th and early 19th centuries with the resurgence of republicanism and Roman political ideas.

The example still stands, you don't try to make people feel a certain way out of some misguided sense of morality.

&gt;For the next few paragraphs you go into how white people are being judged by being called privileged and how your wife doesn't see an issue so why should any other person of colour (and one therefore all, right)? You are basically proposing colour-blindness, the idea that if we ignore race, all racism will just melt away, but the fact of the matter is we do not live in a post-racial society. White people still systematically gain advantage for being white, and by lamenting the fact that 'white people are being judged for being born a certain way', you are forgetting that what is being judged in a social phenomenon: what is being critiqued is the fact that white people have disproportionate privilege compared to people of colour, and if you want people of colour to shut up about it because of some silly colour-blindness ideal: tough.

Huh? It seems like you are actually more racist than most, no where did I say anything about ""people of color"" shutting up about anything, we should all talk about our culture as much as possible and embrace each others differences. It seems you are a proponent of another stereotype... The ""passive ethnicity"" sterotype, which states that European Americans lack the right of self-designation and the right to a continental-origin or ethnic voice. The media would have me feeling guilty for being white, I am not,  I have already dealt with my white guilt. I am also not a racist, but a have been a victim of a hate crime, because well i lacked the right skin color and social standing to be walking around Riverside.

&gt;The fact of the matter is all of the posts in that rape thread were, in fact, highly upvoted. In a major, mainstream subreddit. This is probably the most damning evidence that Reddit has a problem with this stuff because it's the core to the site. Again I relate the example that to call America a racist nation, not all Americans need to be racist, it just needs to be a core component of the culture.

The thread that said that it was dangerous was also highly upvoted, the only way to explain that is there are many differing viewpoints here.

Another stereotype: the ""White Racism"" Stereotype states that European Americans are somehow more racist, or especially racist, when compared with members of other ethnic groups. This is the white racism stereotype. Please stop with the stereotypes already JEEZ!

&gt;Actually, 'sperm-jacking' is an idea propagated by the MRM. You can go to [1] /r/mensrights and ask about spermjacking if you want.

Sperm jacking:

*Term used to define the involuntary collection of a man's sperm, generally comitted by females who desire to have a child with a male with no such desire.
*

So you are perpetuating a sexist term created by misogynists? How does that make any sense?

&gt;Ah, citing the dictionary. Lovely.

Where else do you get definitions from, I don't know if you know this but you can't just change the meanings of words to fit your stance.

And then you perpetuate the ""white racism"" stereotype some more.... Are you sure you know where you are right now? Stop being a bigot please.

EDIT: It's strange how you say that the US is racist, considering that that it's the 5th most diverse country as far as languages spoken, and the 3rd most diverse as far as religion (out of 196 countries in all). And New York City is the 3rd most diverse city in the world. http://www.esler.org/2010/07/09/worlds-most-diverse-nation-2/

EDIT2: I completely understand that I have ""privilege"" as a white male, but I refuse to feel guilty about it. That would simply be internalized racism on my part. I ALWAYS give people the benefit of the doubt, I see good in all races, creeds, and genders. I fight racism whenever I see it, and just because I'm part of this ""privileged"" class of people doesn't mean that I can't get offended at this: http://www.reddit.com/r/KillWhitey/. and it doesn't mean I can't be just as offended at this: http://www.reddit.com/r/niggers/.

2) Kairo: Japanese; original version of the US's (super, super, ridiculously shitty) 'Pulse'. The premise (ghosts haunting computers) is so hokey and silly sounding but this movie is at times beautiful, heart-breaking, hopeful and bone-chillingly creepy (Please watch [this scene](http://youtu.be/Y0FTKqEnGKI) as Exhibit A).

3) The Eye: The HK original, not the crappy Jessica Alba remake. All 3 in this series are excellent (though all are unrelated and the third one is a comedy/horror), but the first is just incredible. So chilling and the ending is so beautifully done. (You can, apparently, watch [the entire thing](http://youtu.be/fGLKHKwwAiI) on youtube, which is awesome)

4) Phone: Korean flick that is, apparently, being remade in the US (*sob*). This one is a favorite, based more on the fact that the little girl is the creepiest little fucker I've ever witnessed in a horror movie (and I've seen a lot). Whatever the Korean equivalent of an Oscar is, she deserves one. 

And I saved the best for last... 
5) A Tale of Two Sisters: Korean original of the US's ""The Uninvited"", and is superior in every way imaginable.

[The dinner scene](http://youtu.be/Ea4PeEHlTJA) is what I consider to be the best ten minutes of suspenseful horror ever.

Here is what i consistently hear (Mind you not some bumbling person from one party but the president, which for all intensive purposes should and is held to a higher standard) , Rich don't pay their fair share, the ""other"" guys are just trying to help big business and lobbies and don't care about the people, businesses do not care about their employees, if you became successful it is not because you worked harder, apologizing because many american do not agree with European policies. 

The point is the average Obama speeches has a fairly simple path. 

1) he says something inspiring

2) states a problem

3) states what fixing the problem will do

4) targets a individual or group who is against the way he wants to fix the problem

5) says they are in the way

6) restates why problem needs to be fixed


Now this is a ok trajectory for speeches by individuals or public organizers but as the president your words carry a lot of weight. By targeting these groups you create consequences.

For example saying we need to raise taxes on the rich. 

Saying something like ""The rich do not pay their fair share"" is divisive whether or not you agree with the policy. On the other hand you could say something like ""We need to look to the wealthiest among us to raise revenues in order to create a sustainable fiscal path. "". THE difference is that one paints a picture of a enemy who is trying to screw you the average person. The other creates the image of someone helping another. 

Also saying things like ""they just cling to their bibles and guns"" does not help.

To summarize what I gathered (some points might be conflicting/contradictory as I'm including mixed perspectives):  

1. The British Empire depended on India's wealth for a world-wide presence, and power within Europe.  
2. The Indian Independence movement was not started by Gandhi, but he brought it to the masses, making the movement nationwide. His policies were primarily non-violent, he also partially abandoned the movement mid-way in the 1920s when it took a violent turn.
3. WWII had weakened the British, but it's hardly any reason to give up on your primary source of money, in-fact it's more reason to hold on to it, India. The reason they couldn't was because they lost control over the masses of India, because of the non-violent agitation led by Gandhi.
4. After WWII the situation was also reaching a tipping point, it might not have remained non-violent for ever. The idea of mutiny was brewing among the Indian armed forces, especially since the capture of Indian POW's such as those with Netaji's INA. Note that the INA was originally composed of Indians who fought for the British in SE Asia, captured by the Japanese as POW's. This might not have gone down well with the remainder of the well-trained armed forces in India. Violence and mutiny against the British rule in India could have erupted any moment. This might have led to nuclearization of India, into a bunch of states not friendly to the British. The British still needed the money, and they would get it from continuing trade with a friendly unitied India.
5. Gandhi worked out pretty well for the British in this case. His control over all of India, his friendly attitude towards the British and his non-violent nature, all of it.
6. Colonies around India, such as Burma and Sri Lanka were not of much use given maintenance costs to the British since they no longer held India. Also, Burma and Sri Lanka were colonized more to work as a buffer around India. The British left these countries soon after India.
7. They however held African colonies for a much longer period of time. It is more likely that the British empire fell because of Indian Independence rather than the other way (re. point 1).
8. Gandhi might very well be the reason India is united, for several reasons including the one mentioned in points 4 &amp; 5.

For example, various members of the Bush Administration, including even as high up as Dick Chaney - are wanted for war crimes in Europe. Donald Rumsfeld was wanted in Germany for war crimes in 2006, and this is why he didn't visit Munich and stayed in Nice when the rest of the Bush Administration visited Munich, in fear of arrest. 

Germany dropped it's war crime arrest and said they would no longer prosecute due to America saying they would investigate Rumsfeld internally. That never happened (publicly at least) and as we know Bush cut all ties with Rumsfeld and Rumsfeld stepped down that very same month, although both say unrelated to being wanted for war crimes. On the flip side of that, that is why a lot of people feel sorry for Rumsfeld as the Bush administration basically left him for dead on that one - and fired him putting all the heat on him.

Some countries, Malaysia for example, have even tried Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld in their absence and have already convicted them. For example, trying someone in their absence is very common, a practice that the US even did for Bin Laden in January 2001 over the embassy bombings in Africa and the bombing of the USS Cole.  Like bin laden, Bush Chaney and Rumsfeld have been found guilty in Malaysia.

So what can they do about it? Easy, don't go to Germany, Malaysia, Sudan, and the countless other countries that either want to arrest you or have convicted you of war crimes. Which is what they are doing.

It's very easy to get someone in a 3rd world nation and try them, especially if it's a western nation that swoops in and gets you.

Less than you think. I took a large backpack and got annoyed with it. Less is more, you'll enjoy the freedom. My advice would be to take 1 big good travel book for visiting all the places (I used Lonely Planet - Europe). Tear the pages out after you are finished with a country or place to reduce the weight as you go.

-What are hostels like?
For 90%, clean, friendly and shared. They usually have place for lounging around and you can usually buy a beer or two and just chat with people. You'll find people playing guitars, checking their email and chilling out after exploring. It's practically impossible not to make friends. The only thing you might struggle with is people snoring or coming in drunk later at night. It's usually 6-8 people to a room. BRING EARPLUGS! They will be soooooo useful.

-How many clothing items do I bring (if I have just a backpack)? Where do you wash your clothes?
3 pairs of socks, 3 pants, 2 t-shirts, 1 warmer top, 1 shorts, 1 trousers, 1 raincoat. You will wash your clothes much less than you imagine and they can be washed frequently at hostels and campsites. Be a little bit less clean and live free would be my advice.

-How easy is it to overcome language barriers? In non-english speaking countries, how do I order food, book hostels, pay for transportation etc.
Very, very easy. Any young person will have fairly good English (all hostel staff will speak English). Anywhere you go they are used to people from all surrounding countries coming over. People are patient and welcoming. You will point and show your guidebook and you will learn very quickly. 

-Generally speaking, what is the fastest way to get around?
Trains are fast, buses are cheap(er). If you have a long time then I recommend buses as you might stop in a smaller place you like the look of and just hop off.

We've both been speculating to be sure, but assuming that the presence of a CCW holder means more people get killed is pretty far-fetched. 

&gt;Guns that can be concealed (without a trench coat) are not easy to make.

Really? Derringers and other ""Saturday night specials"" are of very simple construction and can be made using only a file and a drill bit. Statistics might be your gig, but I machine parts for a living in a large shop and I've seen even mechanically inept people possess enough skill to make a crude firearm.

&gt;On the other hand, it's impossible to stop murder by outlawing it, so why bother?

On the other hand, it's possible to stop murder by allowing people to defend themselves, so why take that right away from someone?

&gt;but I feel safe enough because I live in a socially stable town with a functional police force. If you live in a crappy town, that's a problem

Aurora, CO seems like a pretty nice place. I certainly wouldn't call it crappy. I hear Port Arthur, Australia is a very nice place as well. Yet massacres happened there and the police cannot simply respond in time because its impossible to get to a location that quickly. When you have only seconds, the police are minutes away. You still have yet to make a good argument against concealed carry.

&gt;Interesting how the latter case is exceptionally rare, especially in comparison to gun violence.

Interesting how you fail to separate types of gun violence which is critical to understanding the statistics. Most gun violence is against one targeted individual for one reason or another, in the same way most stabbings are toward one individual for a (usually poor) reason. What Aurora shows is not typical gun violence, it is randomly targeted and is at the whim of an unstable person. Although some bombings are targeted, they are usually the product of a deranged individual without regard to the targets. An out of control cheated on wife doesn't use a bomb to kill her husband, she uses a gun (or knife) because that is the only person she wishes to cause harm. The distinction is incredibly important if you're going to use gun violence as a statistic. 

Why not consider knife violence in western Europe? 
In 2006 there were ~60 Million people living in England and Wales, and there were ~160,000 knife crimes. In the US, there was ~300 Million people and ~400,000 gun crimes. In the UK, there was a knife crime for 1 out of every 374 people while in the US there was one gun crime committed for every 750 people. So this means you are more than twice as likely to be stabbed in the UK than shot in the US. You are the statistics master so feel free to poke holes in this, I just thought it was interesting.

&gt;I don't think an artillery cannon requires too much precision manufacture

I suppose you could create some type of mortar device somewhat easily, but many people (depending on the application) would probably choose to make a gun instead for one of the reasons I listed above. Not to mention most people aren't trying to kill large amounts of people as a cannon would, and would prefer to have a weapon that is much more portable and easier to load.

&gt;Interestingly, though, by listing that, you're agreeing that allowing guns and disallowing artillery cannons is an entirely arbitrary social choice, that could very well have been made differently, and has in fact been made differently in different countries.

Allowing firearms and not allowing howitzers is perhaps an arbitrary choice. However allowing firearms is not, there are many valid reasons why an individual should be allowed to have an equal weapon as a potential attacker. Self defense is a basic human right and if guns were looked at with less emotion and more logic it would be easy to see why people should be allowed to use them in self defense.",jgwentworth420,0,1,,0,0,1343806964,t5_2qh0u,pics,c5mh5gg,,,1429523080,t3_x7v62,1,

t1_c5mhnms,1343811155,False,True,t3_xhcdk,"- Olympics - annoyed at transportation effects and at blatant lying by politicians to justify spending money we'll clearly never get back.  The relationship between politicians and the public involves the worst kind of empty 100% cynical PR garbage.

That said, the actual Olympics atmosphere has been pretty cool.  It seems like things are holding up logistically and lots of people are turning up for the free events (eg, torch rally, cycle races), with good infrastructure support.  Many areas of London near Olympics events have been redone or have good food stalls set up in them (eg, Greenwich on the river next to the Cutty Sark).


 - Not that hard to get last minute / returned tickets to many of the more common events, like Beach Volleyball.  Friend of mine managed to get top tier tickets to the Men's Gymnastics final a few days ago about 20 hours before the event.

 - Spend time mostly in central-north / central-east London (Clerkenwell, Angel, Highgate, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, etc).  This whole area of London is very much a pan-European area, and in a lot of ways has become very similar to young people areas of continental cities like Berlin.  It's expensive though.  But not as expensive as west London where all the Americans live.

 - Don't know much about the London universities, sorry.  Though I know many of the higher ranked universities in the country are in London.  (Note: almost no English speakers aside from Americans use the word 'school' to refer to universities, and it can actually confuse many people so try to remember the difference if you're talking to non-Americans. 'School' is primary/secondary only.)  (I'm an American, btw.)

 - I am definitely in the minority in that I actually kind of like the weather.  It's cold almost every evening, which makes it a lot easier to sleep.  Air conditioning is rare here and I have my windows open about 80% of the year.  Once you get used to constant fresh air, it can be a bit hard to go back to the enclosed environments of the States.    The past few summers have obviously been rainier than usual, which is annoying, but rain here is nothing like the kind of heavy persistent downpours you get all over the States and it doesn't interfere with daily life that much, even if you walk everywhere.  


Edit: I'd add that my girlfriend and I have both been here about ten years and she's desperate to move to California.  So, you know, grass is greener...

However, Sweden and Denmark have extremely extensive welfare states - it is not only universal healthcare. Japan manages to have universal healthcare and have lower tax rates than us, and they also have benefits such as mandatory vacations. The US is pretty much alone when it comes to developed nations in having neither. 

For one thing, though, we have a very extensive military. However, European nations are also sort of discincentivized to military spending because of the fact that they're largely protected by collective security agreements with the US anyway.

Well all this was horrible before the crisis as well (but for a segment of the population). 

There are two reforms going on in Greece right now. Banks are bailed out continuously (to the tune of billions) and salaries and pensions are slashed. Nothing else. This will mathematically lead to a further default, this time ECB (read- the EU taxpayer) will pay the burden.

&gt; Certainly not the taxpayers of Europe. Most of the debt that the banks previously held in Greek bonds, are not instead held by the taxpayers of the EZ.

There was an idea where I'm currently living to have a fee to out of town drivers. So if you're driving into town, you would have the option to leave your car in a large free parking lot at the city border and use public transport to move around in the city instead of paying that fee.

This is Eurocentrism. This is a problematic viewpoint that's been used as the linchpin of narratives that justified the *very real* oppression and abuse of thousands of people all over the world for centuries. This is not some ivory tower purely academic argument; this is about buying into or denying a narrative that more or less *exists to justify oppression*. The argument isn't about facts but about their framing, e.g. the whole language of ""discovering new continents,"" ""spreading culture"" and its ilk. With it, come all the unexamined assumptions: Those continents were ""new"" because the people living there didn't count; what non-europeans have isn't *culture*; and so on. This isn't about offence but about how you're taking a mode of historiography, indeed an entire worldview, that is complicit and even necessary for the actual suffering of millions of people and acting like it's objective, innocent fact.

Most European public transportation is actually a joint venture between public and private companies, allowing for an optimal blend of the benefits of both forms of ownership dependent on the area being serviced.  By regulating privatized public transportation properly, governments can actually see an increase in ridership, efficiency, and revenue.  One very prominent example of this is the blend of private and public transportation provided throughout Switzerland, which provides access to every city and village while minimizing the amount of net profit loss routes via strategic implementation of competitive privatized routes and subsidized public routes.

No. Music like this has been around since the radio became a household item. Ever heard of Disco music? Making simple and catchy music to accompany dance moves has been going on for so long that you can easily go back to the 70s and find examples, if not even further back (Come on baby, let's do The Twist). It's a gimmick, and it works (for a consumer audience).

While the style of the song may be modern, anyone who knows electronic music will probably tell you there's nothing really new about them. It may be new to a mainstream audience, but even when Rihanna started making electro house-inspired pop music a couple years ago that sound had already begun to lose its luster within EDM circles because it was so played out.

&gt; What sort of electronically produced music were popular before them?

Most hip-hop is electronically produced, but I guess that wasn't really your question. Well, in the 90s, especially in Europe, dance music was very popular. I know that because I was a young teenager in the mid-90s, and like most young people I too had a very unrefined taste at that age. When I listen to it now I cringe at how shallow and intellectually offensive it really is. It wasn't good, but it's hard to realize that when you actually like it, especially at that age.

&gt; You don't become mainstream by making bad music.

Of course not. It's not like The Bee Gees, The Spice Girls, Nsync, The Backstreet Boys, One Direction, Justin Bieber, Madonna, Rihanna, Britney Spears, Aqua or freaking Miley Cyrus ever made any bad music. /sarcasm

While associated with South Korea especially, BB cream has been around since the 60s in western cosmetics for awhile now. It was first made in Germany by a dermatologist (Dr. Christine Schrammek) as an aftercare cream for plastic surgery, specifically the more nastier skin peels and facelifts. [The history timeline here on the official Schrammek website](http://www.schrammek.com/company/history.html) has BB creams advertised from 1967 onwards in catalogues, and the first big marketing campaign for BB cream happened after that a few years later.

*However.* BB Creams on the market now are pretty much dominated by South Korean companies like Missha, and their buzz made the bigger American/Euro brands take notice of the popularity and cash in on it.
Since South Korea has more of a plastic surgery culture (as in, more people do it) it makes sense that BB creams broke big there really.

BB Cream is also a fairly innocuous title; it's one of those catch all terms that could mean anything from: foundation, skin whitening, acne treatment, after surgery care, tinted moisturiser to a serum.  Not everything with the name BB attached to it will be the same thing, and if you are expecting it to be a miracle cream from one company only to get a skin bleach from another, that's normal. The branding for it is very odd.

Also, the BB creams as they are being marketing in europe and america do not have bleaching qualities, but are essentially a tinted moisturiser with SPF, which is hardly innovative.

In short: BB Cream is not new to America or Europe, but what it was and is now are very different.

PS: the Garnier BB Cream is pretty shit and smells like cheap candles.

**NOTE:** Edits made for grammar.

**First off, the economic doom and gloom he gives is ridiculous on ridiculous.** The world is not headed for complete and utter collapse. We are currently in a paradigm shift in the world's economic system and none of the major publishers seem to notice it yet. The 3 major economic engines of the last 30 years have been the EU, China and America. Of these three, two are headed for very hard times: the EU (due to it's links in economic free trade, shared fiscal policy and lack of cohesion in anything else - military, nationality, labor, etc.) and China (a gov't manipulated economy that rests on loaning to gov't owned companies and exports to keep economic churn and thus employment high, but with the EU, their number one overall buyer going down the toilet, their exports have no market and America won't pick up the slack).

There will be other countries/economies that step up, but of those 3 economic engines, only the USA is still keeping up and will remain a major player. Also, his comparisons offer no statistics, but adjusted for inflation the average wages in the USA fell 60% during the Great Depression, whereas it fell by less than 5% from 2007-2009.

**His assertion on PRC's gov't is COMPLETELY wrong.** This line made me laugh out loud, ""And, if democracy is applied in multiethnic societies, it can lead to discrimination and even violence against minorities."" I guess the riots in Xinjiang and Tibet that were VICIOUSLY repressed by the majority Han government because the minority locals were being treated unfairly, had no jobs, no power and no future in their own homeland is a perfect example of the fair practice of the CCP. I could go on, but his statement that a majority dominated, non-democratic gov't would NOT be as racist/discriminator/violent against minorities as a democracy is a joke.

**Niall's suggestion that there's not much technological innovation going on in the last 25 years is totally laughable.** I guess DNA fingerprinting, genetic sequencing, the proliferation of the internet (the largest database of information in the history of the world), the accessibility and speed of internet (including mobile internet), the proliferation of mobile phones, computers (and the amount of change in size + power we've witnessed in the last 25 years), sat phones, etc. were all just child's play.

Ryanair staff sometimes do the checkin/boarding but it's still the responsability of the airport. I would've complained/shot a video because Ryanair have no say over whether people can leave an area unless it's a security related matter.

Re-routing - The rules are clear. If you purchase a £20 Ryanair flight don't expect them to pay you £500 re-route if flight is cancelled. They will either re-route you with other Ryanair flights or refund you. Nowhere in EU law does it say they have to pay you for another airline flight.

Surchage - I've searched the Riga airport issue and what happened was that Riga airport lost some govt subsidies and decided to charge passengers more, independent of the agreed contract with Ryanair.
Ryanair did well not to simply add that to their customers, its an airport issue and they don't want to get mixed up into any of that since they pay as much as their contract stipulates, not more.

Control of Syria also has Geo-strategic advantages one of which is further control of Kurdistan and the oil rich Mosul region. Syria has a coast on the Mediterranean Sea so if the U.S had bases in Syria we could use them transport supplies into the region bypassing Turkey who have been problematic in past with allowing U.S supplies to flow through their borders.

t1_c5mjo2w,1343830671,False,True,t1_c5misoe,"Let me explain something to you.

A decision in the EU has called into question what companies once assumed was safe territory for the resale of software licenses. While the ruling isn't definitive in establishing selling used digital licenses, it is a step in that direction.

Countries that do not protect class actions (i.e. America, for some ungodly reason) can have it waived under contractual clauses. Valve and others are crafty in that they are forcing people to waive their rights to a class aciton (which is one of the most effective ways for low-income groups affected by a corporation to have their matter heard by the judiciary because they split the costs among multiple parties). In Australia we would call this 'duress' because you are being coerced into agreeing to something you don't want to agree to: in particular I have about 20-30 games on Steam (probably more - maybe even 50) and I don't want to sign this agreement because of clause 12 (the waiver), YET I cannot access my games unless I do so! That seems like duress to me, and I can tell you that I am getting legal advice tomorrow on the matter.

Now, take into account the EU ruling and the future possibility for legal precedent.

If Valve denies the opportunity for US citizens to resell their digital purchases each individual consumer will have their matter dealt with by an arbitrator which is NOT a judge. Furthermore, arbitration CANNOT be appealed. This means that the decision is final, is confidential and any result is left at that. So then you have a bunch of pissed consumers demanding they be allowed to resell their used digital purchases, they don't have the money to get around the clause and fund a litigation all by themselves - they could REALLY use a good class action right about then. NOPE. You agreed to a legally binding clause which waived that right.

A class action generates a lot of public scrutiny over the company it is being litigated over. It also allows low-income parties access to justice. Access to the court system allows for appeals to the highest courts. Appeals to high courts cost lots of money which can be spread amongst members of a class. If you have a final decision made in the highest court of a country's jurisdiction that decision becomes binding on all lower courts.

Thus Valve has effectively protected itself from A LOT of legal heat in many situations.

But it's cool, Reddit will keep on circle-jerking.

What I really hate is that EA did the same thing with Origin and we heard about how evil they are for about a week. Now there's a community split because it's Valve.

This is a shitty move on their part and I've already filed a letter and am getting legal advice to protect my interests.

You may want to give up the possibility of a class action, but I like to be assured that I can always have that option if the time comes (and judging by how the state of the world has progressed, I'm sure it's only a matter of time). In closing, this isn't a 'moral high horse', this is a goddamn legally binding agreement that is SERIOUSLY depriving you of what little power you already had as a consumer. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK?

EDIT: just in case someone tries to poke holes in my argument I'd like to quickly address the 'games are licensed, you don't own them' thing. I think this should be regarded as completely different to normal licenses. For example if Microsoft shuts down you can still use windows on your PC no problem. If iTunes shuts down you can still play the MP3's you bought off it in another player. However, the license you get with Steam is locked - if it shuts down you lose everything. I would argue that this distinguishes a video game license in its current form (i.e. cannot access it without the DRM login) as completely different from that of something like iTunes or Windows.",[deleted],0,35,,0,0,1343827880,t5_2qhwp,Games,c5mjo2w,,,1429524328,t3_xhipr,35,

Once when I had hitch hiked into Austin, A bunch of people I had just met and I got really drunk on 4 loco,  and hiked a long wooded path to a river.  We swam naked for a while, then jumped off a 30-40 foot cliff into water.   we were eally drunk and its amazing we didn't die.  Also, my harmonica and guitar was out there. So there was some naked, moonlight music happening.  The same people and I were naked in a hot tub the next night or was it the night before) when a drunk Eastern European guy shoeved his foot in my crotch (I am a straight male) when I told him to remove it he shouted angrily ""I will put it where ever I want.""  I explained to him again and he removed it.  There was some sex going on in the hottub so you might call it an orgy, there was another orgy the next night which I did not participte in.

When I was 19, I was drinking with about 7 friends.  Early in the night I suggest a 3-some with a cute girl and my ex-girlfriend (also cute).  We stood up, with everyone staring at us, walked to the girls room and got it on. Halfway throuch f*5King cute girl A I remembered my best friend had a crush on her and he'd be mad at me.  So I ordered her to go out into the party, completely naked and f*%k him and she did.  He had been a virgin up to that point.  The party became an orgy and I was god for a night.  I  put a belt around her neck like a dog collar and made my ex-girlfriend crawl around naked on the floor, in front of all the other people.  I also made her pee on the lawn like a dog, just to humiliate her, all the while she was begging me to take her back.  Eventually we ended up with all 7 or so of us naked in the same bed.  That was probably my craziest night.

Then again there was the night in Argentina I somehow ended up selling beer at a club, behind the bar 100 km away from anyone I knew.  To this day I am not sure how that happened.  

Then therre was the private party at the Fulsom street fair I got invited to (San Francisco).  Naked men and women with collars being whipped as far as the eye could see.  My friend walked up to his wife smiling and said ""Hey I think that girl wants to f*%K me""  his wife said ""have fun"" so he walked across the room and behind a barrier and did.  I continued chatting with his wife while we could hear them moaning.  Also the wine and snacks were very high end catered stuff.

Burning Man.  Burning Man  Burning Man.  Girls in bikini's dancing while shooting off flame throwers around them.   People giving away hits of LSD and shrooms and god knows what else complete for free.  I saw a giant bus, rigged to look like a sandworm from Arrakis and chased it down and climbed on top of it, just Like Paul Atreides from Dune.  More naked and tied slave girls, including one I had just met who I tied up and led around until she said ""Please just take me back to my tent and f*&amp;k me sir""...  I could go on for paragraphs about Burning Man alone.

Yes, because it limits our knowledge. But the problem of subjectivity is as old as history itself, it happened always and everywhere.

But - sorry to step on a couple of toes again - in my eyes, some history is more important then others. I wish I'd know more about Inuit history. Yet I think that Rome's history is more important. Not because they're ""superior"" or because they're closer to me, but because they shaped the world so much more.

This discussion is getting very meta... History itself plays a big part in cultural evolution. We'll always know more about the writing class than about poor people, because the left more remains. The same goes for cultures. Who knows, maybe the Celts would have influenced Europe much, much more if the left more records? Historic Darwinism.

Mas vai por prazer. Eu entrei em informática e deixei por falta de interesse e hoje em dia arrependo-me um bocadinho.
Despois disso fiz Design. E sobre Design, tenho uma (ou duas) opinião:

- Se o curso se chama ""Design e Arquitectura"" não vás.

- Se o curso de Design é numa faculdade de Arquitectura, não vás.

A sério. Design e arquitectura estão no mesmo campo, sim. Mas de certeza que o que te vão ensinar é Arquitectura. Ou Design baseado na Arquitectura. E isso não é bom. Por exemplo, eu tive uma prof de História de Arte que era tipógrafa. Conclusão: esse ano não aprendi nada de história de arte, mas sim de história da Tipografia. Not the same.

Depois há outra coisa em relação ao Design: o Design Gráfico e os outros Designs (moda, interiores, industrial, etc...).

Eu quando entrei no IADE, em Lisboa, já sabia que o que queria era Design Gráfico. Mas não, para eles é tudo o mesmo e vão-te ensinar mais design industrial que gráfico. E pelo pequeno background que nos deste, eu diria que tu também queres design gráfico.

Há ainda outra coisa a ter em conta, se bem que quanto a esta não possas fazer muito. O Design Gráfico mudou radicalmente nos últimios 15 / 20 anos. Muito, mas muito, muito. Os profes e as universidades não, por isso prepara-te para levar com coisas desactualizadas à brava.


Último conselho:
Eu, apesar de estar ""triste"" por não ter feito Informática, continuei a ser bastante geek, e a mexer em linux, e fazer webs, etc etc... e acabei por encontrar o meu sitio no ""meio termo entre Design e Informática"" (muito entre-aspas, caso alguém me venha matar) e sou webdesigner. 80% do que aprendi na faculdade não serve para nada.

I have been scanning the results for the olympics and it is amazing how often there is a Kiwi in the semifinals for swimming, in the top 10 of slalom kayaking, pushing for a win on a bike... just a token kiwi everywhere.

I believe just a little bit more diversity in our sporting interests will transform our overall competitiveness into true results. We are an inherently sporty and talented bunch. Then again, we are happy to play the underdog role. Maybe we CAN'T specialise in more than rugby and rowing...

We are always very proud of what we achieve in any sport. National pride makes us very gruff when it comes to who can represent us and who can not, because we work so hard for what we get. You go overseas? Hard luck, you miss out. (_a quiet voice in the back of our minds might call you a traitor_)

Hosea Gear was offered a contract to play in Japan at the start of this year. He shook the dollar signs away from his vision and stayed here, to have one more crack at being in the All Blacks. That's pride right there. I am very surprised that Sonny Bill Williams hasn't immediately been ruled out of contention for the All Blacks by taking a contract in Japan.

We care a lot about where someone's roots lie. That is a strong part of the NZ mindset, drawing heavily from Maori culture. A lot of people were annoyed, for example, when Quade Cooper initially chose Australia over NZ (though now we couldn't be happier that he did!). At the same time, when a talent amongst us competes for their home nation we respect that. A friend of mine is at the Olympics competing for a Pacific Island.

This roots business makes 'imports' a contentious thing. Some people I talk to still can't get over the fact that Irene van Dyk first played international netball for South Africa, despite her being our best goalshoot and being a key for Silver Fern success for the last decade.

The rise of mystery religions (Christianity being the winner) was a sign of the times.  The most decisive reason for the dawning of the ""dark ages"" was the political, economic, and infrastructure damage unleashed by the Roman Civil Wars of the third century (C.E.)  This marked the beginning of serfdom in western Europe, as people were forced to flee the cities and enter servile employ of rural land owners.

This and other economic and political factors dictated the course religion would take.

Julian's attempted ""restoration"" failed largely because it was not sufficiently popular, either with the masses or with the political hierarchy.

There are serious and deep-seated economic and structural reasons why public transit hasn't caught on in America the way it has in Europe. As the population density of America continues to increase, Amtrak will probably begin to extend into more areas. But that will happen over many decades. For now, people mostly get around by ways that work for them, which is mostly cars and planes.

(2) It won't go to the airport which sits directly between Raleigh and Durham and obviously has the most need for public transit.

t1_c5ml07j,False,False,True,t1_c5mk0h5,"&gt;The truth is that the Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.

They're using the negative connotation of the word ""cartel"" to cast the Fed in a bad light.  The Fed isn't trying to increase the profits of these banks, or give out private donations.  The banks that join the Fed accept much stricter regulation in exchange for a better guarantee of loans from the government.  Essentially, they sacrifice some of their risk-taking ability in favor of stability.

&gt;that has been designed to systematically destroy the value of our currency, drain the wealth of the American public and enslave the federal government to perpetually expanding debt.

I mean, really?  It should be pretty obvious that this is sensationalized, but I'll point out the fallacies anyway.  The Fed is designed to maintain the stability of our currency, and keep the inflation rate stable.  They have done a superb job at keeping our inflation rates stable around the 2% level, and in fact they are a little under that right now, implying the value of the USD is greater than it should be.  Links have been made between inflation and employment, whereas economists overwhelmingly agree that deflation is one of the worst things that could happen to our economy.  Look at the problems Japan has had with deflation the last decade or so.

As for ""enslave the federal government to perpetually expanding debt,"" if the Fed hadn't been there to help keep inflation rates stable and increase the money supply, the real value of our debt would be multiplying at an alarming rate.  If the dollar is now worth 2x what it was 5 years ago, then the $15 trillion dollar debt we have to pay back is actually worth $30 trillion in real terms.

The ""drain the American public"" part is plain incorrect.  Inflation expectations are priced in to our economy, and it actually encourages people to spend their money earlier and stimulate demand, since the real value of their money is going to slowly diminish if they stuff it under their mattress, so to speak.  Inflation encourages people to invest in the economy through stocks, bonds, or by putting their money in a bank which can then lend the money to entrepreneurs and home buyers.

&gt;#1 The Federal Reserve System Is A Privately Owned Banking Cartel

This is technically correct.  It doesn't change the fact that the Fed isn't trying to make a profit, or that they have some of the smartest economists in the world whose sole goal is to maintain economic stability.  If we didn't have the Fed, we'd almost certainly be in another recession.  And Bernanke is practically begging Washington to engage in some kind of fiscal stimulus, because he recognizes the fact that QE is only going to do so much more before it becomes completely ineffective.  The gridlock in Washington has really held us back.

&gt;#2 The Federal Reserve System Is A Perpetual Debt Machine

Not true.  They buy U.S. debt in order to increase/decrease the money supply as needed.  They actually have a huge surplus right now because a lot of the junk bonds they bought off the banks in 2008 churned them a profit.  In fact, their last QE program, dubbed ""operation twist,"" did not expand their balance sheet a single dollar - it was all reinvested profits.  The U.S. government goes into debt by spending on public projects, military, entitlements, etc.  The Fed's balance sheet is less than $3 trillion, and that money is a surplus, which means they could help the U.S. debt levels if they needed to.  Also, they have lowered interest rates which actually reduces the cost of government borrowing.

And later in this number they say ""In fiscal 2011, the U.S. government paid out 454 billion dollars just in interest on the national debt.  That is 454 billion dollars that was taken out of our pockets and put into the pockets of wealthy individuals and foreign governments around the globe.""  Although some of that will go to foreign governments, more than 70% of that is owned by people in the U.S. in things like mutual funds, pension funds, 401ks, retirement funds, etc.  The debt is paid to Americans who are looking to make their money do work instead of sit in a bank account.  It's not ""lining the pockets of the rich,"" although I'm sure some of the money does go to the rich.

&gt;#3 The Federal Reserve Has Destroyed More Than 96% Of The Value Of The U.S. Dollar

Sensationalized bullcrap.  That was over the course of a century (the Fed was created in 1913), which means the value of the dollar decreased an average of less than 1% a year, and that number doesn't even account for the fact that inflation compounds.  Like I explained above and like 99% of economists would agree, a small amount of stable inflation is very good for an economy.

&gt;#4 The Federal Reserve Can Bail Out Whoever It Wants To With No Accountability

Not true.  They are audited by a third party.  I sure as hell wouldn't want congress auditing the Fed, as they seemed to have proven pretty conclusively how economically clueless they truly are recently.

&gt;#5 The Federal Reserve Is Paying Banks Not To Lend Money

Technically true, but not bad.  I could explain, but the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_reserves#Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008) article does it very well so I'll just leave that to them.

&gt;#6 The Federal Reserve Creates Artificial Economic Bubbles That Are Extremely Damaging

It says in this that ""Right now, the Federal Reserve continues to set interest rates much, much lower than they should be.  This is causing a tremendous misallocation of economic resources, and there will be massive consequences for that down the line.""  But it also says earlier in the article that they're paying banks to hold reserves.  Those interest rates are the same, so why are they so outraged?  They are saying the reserve rates are too low in one instance, and too high in another - which is it?

The interest rates are so low because it encourages banks to lend out money, since they're currently hoarding cash due to economic uncertainty and exposure to Europe.

&gt;#7 The Federal Reserve System Is Dominated By The Big Wall Street Banks

Executives of Wall Street banks are **required by law** to be on the board of the **New York Fed**, which deals with day to day operations on the FOMC.  This has nothing to do with regulating the banks, which is done by a different entity.  This is basically to get a feel for the economy from the people who are running the banks - definitely a good idea.

&gt;#8 It Is Not An Accident That We Saw The Personal Income Tax And The Federal Reserve System Both Come Into Existence In 1913

It also says: ""Without a personal income tax, it is hard to have a central bank.  It takes a lot of money to finance all of the government debt that a central banking system creates"" which is laughably dumb.  The central banking system does not create debt any more than it can also destroy debt.  It just so happens that right now they needed to increase the money supply, so they're creating debt to do so.  In good economic times, they reduce the money supply to curb inflation.

&gt;#9 The Current Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, Has A Nightmarish Track Record Of Incompetence

No he doesn't.  They can take whatever quotes they want out of context, it doesn't change the fact that Bernanke knows a hell of a lot more about the economy than 99.999% of the people in the U.S.

&gt;#10 The Federal Reserve Has Become Way Too Powerful

By 1945, there was very little left to loot besides raw materials which would require massive amounts of investments in infrastructure. Please keep discounting the wealth of other countries the British ruled (for a while) like the Americas and its mountain of gold, the middle east, trade ports in China, etc.

2. This is a fact, so no problems here.

3. India was not the primary source of money, please link to actual facts. India was only important for cheap raw material and as a trade route. The British had to take loans from the US and Canada.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_loan

4. Yes, they did not trust the INA due to Subash Chandra Bose, not Gandhi. After his death it didn't really matter. The first mutiny was started by the Indian soldiers, the British still ruled India for another 90 years.

5. Your point being?

6. Burma has natural gas resources, Sri Lanka would have served as a trade point, completely bypassing India. Again, just shows more narcissism on your part and disrespect towards the independence movement of other countries.
7. Wow, ego much? African Independence movement started after the WWII.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria#Colonial_era

Please note that the US president told all European countries to free their colonies. Also, look at Franklin Roosevelt's view on colonialism. You can't just say ""No"" to one of the world's superpower who is bankrolling your reconstruction plans. Also, they were held longer because you can't just go ahead and leave a country in seconds. there will be anarchy. Finally, Africa is between Europe and India, not the other way around. It would have been easier to maintain control over Africa.

8. Gandhi is the reason why India is ""NOT"" united. If the movement in 1920 was not abandoned and we gained independence, there would be no Pakistan or Bangladesh. Jinnah switched sides in 1940.

Technically, voting ""no"" on such a bill is voting ""no"" on both of those things. I think it'd be more fitting to say that we need to know *why* representatives vote ""yes"" or ""no"" to such bills, and hold accountable those who attach unrelated riders to bills simply for political reasons.

My hope for the country and for the future is time. Each generation is more liberal than the one before it, and the prejudices of earlier generations will fall by the wayside in due time. Right now, ""Socialism"" is a dirty word in politics thanks to those blinded by memories of the cold war and confused by pundits who are all too happy to make direct comparisons between socialism and The Red Menace. But what happens when the majority of those alive were born after the days of the Red Scare? People raised playing Tetris and watching Jackie Chan movies without any notion that they've been exposed since childhood to cultures that their parents abhorred?

And meanwhile, the rest of the world moves on. Canada, much of Europe... more countries every day are proving to be examples to the US of better ways to do things. And while many in the US seem to prefer the blind and comforting belief that we must, by our nature, be the best at everything in the world, at some point people will awaken to the harsh reality that the world has left us behind, and at that point they'll demand that we catch up to the rest of the world, and all this absurd scare-mongering over socialism will be dismissed for the garbage it is.

In the meantime, I wait, I speak with my vote as best I can, and I try to do my part to push us forward, hoping that one day my voice combined with others will breech the dam holding back progress. And progress *does* happen, albeit slowly and in at times unpredictable places. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is an example of that. To some, it was a long time coming, but in many ways it was ahead of its time, in that it passed without the overwhelming populist outcry backing it up.

I tend to think I'm fairly cynical too. I don't have any great hope that America will suddenly push off the idiocy of right-wing punditry and return debate to sanity any time soon.

If he doesn't win it this season then what about the next? Well, maybe, but then there's only so long you can keep playing at a top european level as a 30 year old forward. Oh this is without mentioning the fact the past 7/8 seasons he's been injured for most of it. There's a huge possibility this transition to a new league, team will cause him to flop again. Put simply, Robins time is running out, and if he wanted the best shot at big stage glory he'd be off to City/Madrid/Barca, possibly Bayern. 

Also, by the looks of it, Juve simply cannot afford Robin Van Persie. £20 million for an excellent, but injury prone nearing 30 year old is quite an insane price from a club that isn't oil rich. Jovetic would be better business for Juve.

Arsenal have already had some great positive *ambitious* business in the market and are looking to keep it up with Cazorla and Sahin. If reports are true then Arsenal have broken their transfer record on a player regarded as one of the best in La Liga. This plus a proven German international, the top scorer of Ligue 1 and possibly the supremely talented Sahin on loan from Madrid. And its not over yet, we're looking at 1 more signing. If robin doesn't think that's ambition he can fuck himself. RVP to Juve on the other hand hand is pure speculation, nothing has happened yet. Arsenal aren't becoming a smaller club, its just the league they play in is getting stronger and Serie A is getting weaker. Thus, Juve look much better, Arsenal look much worse. I'm tired of the anti-Arsenal meta circlejerk... seriously I've never seen a place that hypes up serie a more than this.

- The Spanish Civil War in the 1930s

- The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.

- The Conquest of Mexico

- The wars of India/Pakistan

- The Mejii Restoration in Japan

- The Crusades (especially the 3rd and 4th)

I have experience with various setups, but mostly xrd, saxs, and exafs (often combined). On most beamlines, the software for raw data collection is called a command-line interface called [spec](http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/TBS/BLISS/documentation/spec-tutorial/first.html) - which is good so you don't have to re-learn everything when going to a different beamline. But some others stick to their own home-made software, which can be LabView (reasonably bad) or something worse (the software controlling the exafs acquisition in an otherwise extremely good beamline [looks like this](http://hackingthevalley.com/images/desktops/dtwm.gif)).

&gt; Last year I went to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne and the beamline we were on used a program called Fit2D which was painful, so I'm a bit curious.

Hehe, I feel your pain. It's probably the worst-designed interface ever, but it's damn good at treating data, so when using 2d detectors you are almost forced to use it. I never used it for more than just integrating images, because the peak fitting routine is not very stable. In general, we do most of the analysis back home: for xrd, we use the much praised [GSAS](http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/solution/gsas/gsastutorials.html); for exafs, we use both the overlooked [Viper](http://www.cells.es/Beamlines/CLAESS/software/viper.html) and the user-unfriendly [GNXAS](http://gnxas.unicam.it/XASLABwww/pag_gnxas.html), and for saxs we use a home-made code which we made available on the net but I won't link here.",zen_arcade,0,1,chem,0,0,1343836156,t5_2qm4e,askscience,c5mlins,,Structural Chemistry,1429525198,t3_xg677,1,

Did we get richer in the West by indebting ourselves? No, though debt did help. Western market economies allocate (and allocated) the majority of their resources using the market, that is on supply and demand. This meant that areas where there would be a god return on investment saw higher levels of investment think the railways in the 1800's or car manufacturing after the war. This led to a greater accumulation of capital that allowed for more investment, increasing both wealth and income.

Non-market economies allocated their resources though other means, in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Bloc for example resources allocation was largely through the state, which did not take into account the principles of supply and demand. This led to a substantial increase in the production of some goods - such as steel or weapons, and a stagnation or decline in the production of some goods such as consumer goods. As they did not allocate their resources as efficiently the level of growth in capital and in income was lower in non market economies.

We should be arguing about this, because no they all weren't. :-)

You can't be a deist Christian. Christianity is a theistic religion. The main difference between deism and theism is that a theistic god interacts with people, so by being a theist you have to take on the burden of justifying revealed truth and/or establishing miracles as fact.

So right off the bat the theist has some very difficult questions to answer. How does one distinguish between Andrea Yates who drowns her kids in the tub because god told her to do it and Abraham who would have willingly sacrificed his son for the same reason? How does one distinguish between those who led the slaughter of the Amalekites and Hitler, or followers of allah that perpetrate terrorist attacks? How does one authenticate the ""right"" miracles (of one's religion) while discounting those of other religions?

Since the deist cannot rely on revealed truth, s/he must deduce right and wrong. There are no clearcut moral answers that prohibit abortion but demand execution.

The deist has none of these problems. The deist also has no need of prayer or other forms of wish-thinking, which a good deal of Christian tradition revolves around. Your statement that deists can go to church...so what? I can go stand in a kitchen, that doesn't make me a chef. The deist belief cannot be incompatible with scientific discovery, including evolution theory and abiogenesis.

&gt; We shouldn't even be arguing that the US wasn't founded on Judeo-Christian principles. Rather, the key thing to keep in mind is that despite their religiosity, the founders very specifically prohibited state religion and set up a firm separation of the two. Historical revisionism is completely unnecessary.

By saying I'm engaging in historical revisionism, you are begging the question.

If the US had been founded on Judeo-Christian principles, from which of these does separation of church and state itself originate? It seems to me the god of both the Old and New Testaments was very clear in the first three entries of the Decalogue that such a separation is not to be tolerated. To say the US is founded on this theology, there would *have* to be statements to the effect that the Judeo-Christian god is the right one. Admitting any other possibility is straight-up blasphemy.

On the other hand, if you're trying to establish a secular society that values freedom of thought, then you can't demand everyone be secular. It's self-contradictory.

It's also worth pointing out that many of the Constitutional principles that Judeo-Christians like to claim for themselves are not after all exclusive to Judeo-Christians, are they? They are human, secular, Enlightenment values, and common to all major religions. We may as well say the US was founded on Zen Buddhism, there is a pretty healthy intersection between their values and Enlightenment values, too.

&gt; I know 100s upon 100s of Christians who have just about the same conviction and zeal about their beliefs as those secular deists did. Hell, almost the entire American left and European center fits that description. It doesn't mean they're atheists...

I'm not getting the point here. Are you saying that conviction and zeal doesn't make one automatically an atheist? I must be misunderstanding you because this is so obvious as to be not worth stating (as in, yes, of course having lots of conviction and zeal about the existence of a deity doesn't make you an atheist).",severoon,0,1,,0,0,1343838625,t5_2sokd,explainlikeimfive,c5mm6vk,,,1429525516,t3_xfzw6,1,

In the 19th century, the Russian Empire wrested from Tehran's control what is today Armenia, Republic of Azerbaijan, and part of Georgia. Iranian elementary school texts teach about the Iranian roots not only of cities like Baku, but also cities further north like Derbent in southern Russia. The Shah lost much of his claim to western Afghanistan following the Anglo-Iranian war of 1856-1857. Only in 1970 did a UN sponsored consultation end Iranian claims to suzerainty over the Persian Gulf island nation of Bahrain. In centuries past, Iranian rule once stretched westward into modern Iraq and beyond. When the western world complains of Iranian interference beyond its borders, the Iranian government often convinced itself that it is merely exerting its influence in lands that were once its own. Simultaneously, Iran's losses at the hands of outside powers have contributed to a sense of grievance that continues to the present day."" -Patrick Clawson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy

In order to measure a really fundamental change, 100 years seems a little short-sighted and 10,000 years seems a little far-fetched. So in the year 3012, what will society be like knowing what we know about ourselves? 

It's probable that some more-developed countries will advance more than others. Think about the European Union, China, Japan, Korea, USA, etc... They'll all change at slightly different rates, just as they do now. China will continue to have amazing exports, grow it's economy, and do well in education. Japan has always done well in the field of robotic technology, (hopefully not leading to singularity), and Europe has been doing very well with physics lately, as per the recent Higgs Boson success, but the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) most likely isn't done yet discovering great things. 

So society in the next 1,000 years will go in 2 directions: 

* Scientific advances will increase with time, which will change all fundamental things like computer technology, medicine, engineering, etc...

* Some countries will be more quick and perceptive to these changes than others,  perhaps only dividing us further, unfortunately.  

So ""society"" as it seems is headed in two places depending on how you define it. There are too many depending circumstances to say where for sure, but I suppose that's what science-fiction is for: dreaming up blue prints to our future and it's many many outcomes. 

So what will be required of people in these instances? It really depends on where you are, who you are, when you are. Things like learning a language, learning simple math, learning some basics about science, etc... that won't change. What will change is **how** and **what** we learn in these processes. 

**tl;dr:**
&gt;*Where do you feel society is headed in this regard, and what do you feel would be considered required in that instance?*

**That which is ""required knowledge"" varies even today among countries, so it can be difficult to pinpoint how it will change as all of humanity changes. Science will only improve with time, but there's always room for hindrances  which will greatly slow down this process.**

t1_c5mmq91,False,False,True,t1_c5mitmw,"I'm not arguing there was no cultural mixing. America had been practicing open immigration far before other countries had even conceived of such a thing. It was probably harder to move from a British colony to Great Britain than it was to move from a British colony to America. The difference is exactly what you pointed out, and much more. Cultural mixing is not equal everywhere. Immigrating across oceans is not the same as moving into the next-door country. Let me explain.

The difference that I focused on, however, was that in Europe, given the proximity of the nations and the constant border shifts and changes, even if there was cultural mixing, most cultures retained their identities. For example, the French and Germans living near the border. If you're a German on the French side, of course you learn French (more likely you've already learned it since you live there). But being so close to Germany, you still have the power to maintain your cultural identity.

That is something that simply isn't true in America. Here, not by intent but simply because of practicality, immigrant are assimilated into American society. I would know, I'm an immigrant myself. And even in this progressive, modern, cosmopolitan globalized era, I can barely consider myself Asian. I'm first generation (parents moved here in the 80s), and I'm only a passable speaker of my own mother tongue. Now my children will be pretty much entirely American, with no trace of having immigrated here except their physical differences from white Americans. See what I mean? Now imagine the Irish or Germans or italians immigrating here. Sure, there's cultural mixing and racial tension, but over the course of two or three generations, their identity is completely assimilated and they are now simply American. With no holdovers from their old culture.

American society as a whole has assimilated various facets of different societies, like St. Patrick's Day, but that's just it. We absorb. We're called the melting pot here because they toss ingredients in and we all become the same soup. Sure its made of many ingredients, but we all end up the same soup. In Europe they mix, closer to the salad-bowl analogy (sometimes used, erroneously in my opinion, to refer to America), where they are all different ingredients and remain different ingredients. You mentioned the influence of Native American and African culture; yes, we've absorbed their culture. Don't you see? Hip-hop is decided derived from African roots in music, but hip-hop is not considered an African development, it is considered an American one, or at least an African-American one.

Essentially, imagine an African moving to America. After five generations, his family goes back to Africa. They're going to be completely different and probably oblivious to African culture. Now imagine a French person moving to West German. There aren't French people all over Germany, but there are French near the borders. Five generations later his family can go back to France and still be entirely French. I mentioned the only foreign culture America experiences is Mexico. I know we get a ton of immigrants from everywhere, but only Mexico's culture is strong and near enough so that Mexicans can move here and retain their cultural identity (something which a lot of Americans hate). That is why we have a perception of ignorance: intolerance, not because we are discriminatory, but because we expect everyone to be American when they spend enough time here.

Any American who wishes to learn can learn. But it is not a priority in mainstream education to teach the culture of Europe, since it's so far away. Europeans probably teach American history more due to a combination of factors; current American global influence, or just generally higher levels of education these days.

This is exactly what's happening. The only difference is that instead of individual profiteers, we have an extraction system consisting of the state, banks and various corporations.

|Rather everything is divided up by warlords. Now left wing anarchists would say ""well in that case the warlords are the state"".

Yep. I reject your distinction between warlords and the state. The state is simply a geographic monopoly on violence (ie. warlord), so the world is already run by a few big warlords. But I agree that some warlords are ""better"" than others.

|what would happen if a modern liberal state collapsed.

Anarchists aren't advocating a ""collapse"", but rather progress beyond violence.

|What would happen is that warlords would take over.

There's no clear reason why the removal of a warlord necessarily results in multiple smaller warlords. Even if it did, there is no guarantee that these smaller warlords would be worse than the big warlord. For example, I think it was good that the USSR broke up. I hope the EU breaks up. I'm not a fan of the u$a federal government and I don't think the states would go to war without it. Etc.

|It is simply a gateway stage from one type of state with the rule of law to another far worse state where warlords will become a sort of local absolute monarch.

That might be your definition of anarchy/chaos, but that's not a representation of what anarchist theory advocates.

|You don't need a state to have private property or rather in the absence of a state warlords will take over and assert ownership of everything secure in the knowledge that there is no higher power to constrain them.

Yes, like how bigger warlords took over the united states.

|It is simply a gateway stage from one type of state with the rule of law to another far worse state where warlords will become a sort of local absolute monarch.

This is just your hypothesis. There is a continuum of warlords and there are many ways that they can evolve, collapse, expand, transition, die, etc..

|it's where Kings, Queens and aristocrats come from. Basically they came from warlords who guaranteed property rights.

And where presidents and prime ministers come from... 

|If you shop lift in a modern state and are caught the police would probably caution you. If you shoplift somewhere where there are no police, the store owner is likely to shoot you... There'd be no gun control, no police and no courts. If he can afford to own a shop, he can certainly equip himself with a gun.

You're envisioning an arbitrary hypothetical world where police/armies/courts don't exist but capitalism is otherwise stable? I think you're confusing anarchism with chaos. It's not about regressing to the stone age, but about progressing beyond violence. Why does shoplifting exist in the first place?

1. If a car wants to be street legal it has to meet certain criteria, and one of these is behaviour at normal speeds. Not sure about sweden, but the typical speed on out-of-city roads in europe is normally around 50-60 mph. So you expect a car to behave ""normal"" at these speeds. A car that can only be driven at 40 mph is unacceptable, it would be an obstacle for the rest of the traffic.

2. Moose are common in Sweden. And people don't swerve because they like moose, it's because they value their health (and car):

So sweden has all right to call this car unsafe because it's not capable to do a manouver that you might need driving in sweden at speeds that are normal in sweden.

t1_c5mnsq8,False,False,True,t3_xihng,"Whenever i've seen Peter Hitchens  on television, especially Question Time  and The Big Questions ( sundays )  , i always agree with his views , and this is no exception either .
I find The Olympics was ""over sold"" by David Cameron , Seb Coe  etc... right from the start .
In A time when many people are genuinely struggling , we've just seen a multi-multi- million £.  opening ceremony for The Olympics ; i realise it's to be celebrated , but , deep down , i feel it's an opportumity to make money again from the gullible Public , but , it isn't quite happening the way Seb Coe thought it would !
London's streets  aren't  teaming ( excuse the pun!)  with  thousands  of visitors spending millions of £'s . 
I also heard last night that G4 security have been ""training"" security staff ho can't speak English and also only for two days ; also the un-named journalist giving the radio interview who applied and was accepted ( apparently ) found his references hadn't been checked , and that the Government has bought the cheapest metal detectors and scanners , which he said ""don't work well at all"" , and prooved it by walking straight past all this three times with metal objects on him ; he also said they were told by the two security companies that at times when huge numbers of people were arriving to simply ""swicth off the scanners""  . Apparently, according to the journalist , G4 also were overheard saying they they thought the Public were scum .  
He sounded completely genuine ; he posted this radio interview on YouTube under The London Olympics - Warning .
The interview lasts quite a long time , probably about 45-60 minutes.

He aslo said he'd approached Channel 4 News  regarding this , but , they  refused to want to know ;  we learnt only a few days  before The Olympics  that G4  were completely incompetant ;  now it appears  they really are !

If David Cameron was as concerned about the British people and our genuine suffering all over Britain ( ""the worst ever reccession""?)  , maybe we wouldn't be so despairing or dislocated from happiness  , apart from times like this when we're  TOLD  to be ""happy"" by David Cameron , who is so far removed from ""normal""  British life , he simply feels unaffected, making his enforced comments even more wounding to people like Peter Hitchens in the first place , who , i imagine isn't suffering as the poor Working classes are , but , it's the enforced way in which David Cameron speaks to people that rubs us up the wrong way .
Also , he manages to have very cosy relationships with people such as Sir Andrew Witty , head of Glaxosmithkline , the people who made Avandia ;  the drug that killed my mother two years ,on 17th May 2010 . No accountability regarding Doctors or Drug companies .
If you google : DrMarcia Angell ( former Editor in Chief of the New England  Journal Of Medicine ) you 'll see why she wrote the book entitled :""How Drug Comapanies Deceive Us And What To Do About It"" ;  another  MD who opted out of the ""medical profession"" is Dr. Howard Brody , who wrote ""Hooked"" , showing the truth of the total corruption of Doctors and Drug companies . Quite a few other MD 's have opted out to speak the truth of vaccines , Doctors , skewed  drug trial results , overplaying the  benefits and underplaying the side effects of modern medical drugs .
Doctors and drug companies in Britian want to outlaw all safe , natural health products and practices - they've already started .
Modern medical drugs do NOT have to be ""in use"" even for a day before being leashed out onto an innocent Public yet they've lobbied ( pushed )  for the EU to force herbs that have not been ""in use"" for 15 or 30 years( depending on which herbs)  in the EU to be banned . They've already severely restricted Accupuncture ( it's been used for over 6,000 years) , now it's Homeopathy .
Medical drugs are not 100% safe , as confirmed by a letter i eventually received fromThe European Medicines Agency in London after i'd enquired about Avandia , the drug that gave my 69 year old mother a fatal heart attack ( i can say this legally as AvMa in London noted she showed severe yet common side effects of both startins and Avandia , and other medical drugs also) .  In the USA , it's now been shown statins do cause diabetes ; nobody on the Welsh side of my family ( my mother) had heart disease or diabetes. in fact they lived into their late eighties and ninties. My mother was a strong Welsh woman before being loaded with pharmaceutical drugs by her GP .

I suspect David Cameron views The Olympics in the same way he views Glaxosmithkline  - profit .

Sir Andrew Witty (Glaxosmithkline) is one of his closest Business Advisors , not Health or Medical , so this shows how moral (?) David Cameron really is .

Each time i've emailed the Andrew Lansely Dept. with proof of how dangerous medical drugs are and how my own mother suffered HUGELY for 5 years before she ""suddenly""  collapsed of a massive heart attack  , after having shown severe but common side effects of Avandia for a long time , which the ""nurse team"" and GP ( DR RALPHS of Abbottswood Medical centre - pershore) completely ignored and bullied her about her ""weight"" , which was mostly fluid ,as having seen my mother lying in her coffin , she was very small ; we don't lose fat within a few days of dying.
She was very scared of seeing her GP and the ""professional""  ""nurse team""  because they bullied her about her ""weight"" .  google Avandia to see the awful side effects.
At least in the USA , Glaxo have been made to cough up 3 billion $'s  for families like mine .

In the EU , WE ARE WORTH NOTHING , because DOCTORS AND DRUG COMPANIES can do whatever they like withour ANY accountability whatsoever .
A bit like ""family"" courts , Judges , social workers ( did you notice NOT one social worker has ever been prosecuted over the  terrifying life and death of Baby Peter , nor the last Doctor to see him , the night before he was killed , nor the lawyer ?

Maybe DAVID Cameron should stop hawking down and arrogently telling us we should ""be happy""  whenever he hopes to cash in on an ""event"" ?
By the way , lots of strange symbols on the Olympic medals !

I hope and pray to Jesus that there isn't an attack of some kind on the Olympics because  are the Public being protected as they enter the Park  or has David Cameron etc..  used the cheapest scanners and metal detectors , as told by a London based  journalist on a local radio station recently  wich , apparently don't work  well , and G4  staff  told the recruits  when they expected  large crowds of people , they'd "" switch  everything off to get them through more quickly"" .

I hope and pray this isn't the case , but the journalist sounded very worrried , and sincere in his description of how he was successful in his application to be a security personal there .

You are not emotionally equipped for dating right now.  That thing you posted up there zips through what I'm willing to refer to as a ""rant"" and goes into the territory of *diatribe*.  Even if you still wanted to date (which on some level, by the way, you do, or you wouldn't be so worked up about this), you shouldn't, because you're a mess.  Let's explore that.

&gt; The last girl I 'dated', which lasted 4 stomach wrenching weeks, rejected me on Friday because she wants a man who can, although she could personally take care of herself, to pay for her, for example, when going to a restaurant.

Well, you're closing in on thirty.  Was she?  It's not unusual for women, as they age, to increasingly want someone who's in a position of stability, and being able to treat her to a meal is a solid sign of that.  (I'm not saying that's a universal trait, before anyone gets upset!)  Anyway, you can't right now, so that's it.  Maybe chill out rather than freak out.  But...

&gt; The female before her told me that I don't fit into her 10 year plan because I am in school, because I don't have a steady job. I understand that having a career is really important, especially at my age, but (I am in school working on my Ph.D (4 more years to go, just started it) does money and experience REALLY FUCKING TRUMP LOVE?

Woah!  *Woah.*  Love?  That's not a word that you should be tossing around in whatever timeframe this relationship occupied.  If you're ""falling in love"" that quickly you're probably frightening them off, as they don't want crazy inside them.  You being a student is likely the polite excuse they're using instead of, ""You're unsettlingly intense and I feel increasingly uncomfortable around you.""

&gt;  I am not bitter or going to say that all women are like this, but I am offended by anyone, man or women (women in my case) who have this fucked up and twisted idea of what an ideal relationship would need to survive, which in their grand totality trumps love.

This is a really naive sentiment.  If ""love"" were always enough then there'd never be marriages or other long-term relationships that collapse because of the stresses of one partner having to support the other.

&gt; Both of these reasons have dominated why I have been rejected by the last 20 or so woman I have tried to date over the last 4 years. In total I have been rejected by about 51 different women. I dont have heart for a 52nd rejection. 

This entire post comes off as fishing for compliments, as so many of the things in here do.  I'm not going to do that.

I agree with your subject line.  Give up.

Maybe just in the short term, while you attempt to fix your attitude, either by yourself or with the help of a professional therapist.  You come across as a bitter, angry person.  I wouldn't want to have to be around you as a friend, much less as a romantic partner.

The Western Roman Empire fell due to economic stagnation which minimized the strength of their military force. Western Rome became a shadow of itself without the money pouring in from the East to fund the West which cause infrastructure to begin to crumble and provinces to pull away. The Western Roman Empire was finally ended when Justinian I of the Byzantine Empire invaded in an attempt to reunite the two empires.

The Byzantine Empire ended from poor economic management, reliance on mercenaries, and civil wars. It would finally be crushed when the Ottomans conquered Constantinople. The Ottoman rise is tied to the Eastern Roman Empires fall because the Ottomans were first hired as mercenaries by the Byzantines which allowed the Ottomans to gain power and then to take over the empire. Leading up to the Ottoman takeover Constantinople had been sacked by Crusaders and borne the brunt of any Muslim attempt to respond to the Crusades.

**The Church and the Papacy in sweeping strokes since 546 CE**

The Papacy becomes the only legitimate power after the fall of Rome. Even Charlemagne needed to be confirmed in his power by the Pope in order to be legitimate to all. The apex of the Papacy and its power was the Crusades since they were able to mobilize thousands of soldiers and Knights with the promise of salvation. However, this promise only worked because it also promised these soldiers that they could keep acting as they had been in Christian Europe but in Muslim Middle East. What essentially was being said is “keep killing, pillaging and all those bloody things that you like doing but do it over there and you’ll go to heaven.”

The Pope’s legitimacy was damaged with the falling out of the Pope and King Henry VIII since it demonstrated that a King did not need the sanction of the church in order to continue ruling. The role of the church was also damaged by Martin Luther being excommunicated by the church for making grievances about the role and actions of the church. From that point forward the strength of the church and the Papacy dwindled from actually being able to deploy troops to where it is today.",Cold_August,0,1,,0,0,1343846069,t5_2ssp3,AskHistorians,c5mof2r,,,1429526574,t3_xihwm,1,

t1_c5moucx,False,False,True,t1_c5moe2o,"&gt;  A player not wanting to see out the contract he signed? Poor lamb.

That is the whole point. Players have an option of signing 5 or 6 years contracts or nothing. Would *you* sign a 5 year contract? Who the hell even knows where you will be in 5 or 6 years. It locks you out the prime of your career if you improve.

The point is that there is zero choice. Want a pay rise? Sign 6 years. Want to play for us? Sign 6 years. You think you are going to move to another club? They also want you to sign for 6 years. We. Own. You. From the age of 24 to 30, ours. These types of contracts are illegal anywhere else. The clubs are creating assets out of humans, the last time we had that was with slavery. 

And the club has an artificial limit in how many players they can sign through their revenue. A club can't spend more in wages than their revenue, which creates an artificial ceiling. With being able to buy player contracts it means players not being played can force a move. It works more that way than the other way, because players not being played in top clubs is more of a problem than players wanting to move to a top club and getting it.

You make my contract idea sound so far fetch, when so many other sports implement a similar system. 

As I mentioned before, the *least* that the EPL could do is to allow release clauses. Forget everything else for a moment. A release clause would have prevented the Modric situation, because there is *no way* he would have signed the deal without a release clause in it. Without release clauses his deal had to become a verbal promise with Levy, and the federation shouldn't be allowing players to resort to off-contract promises that are so important.

Next step is to have a value to the release clause, which Spain already has and a lot of other federations.

Next step after that is to fix the release clause to a value of the contract. You make this sound like some far-out system when part of it is already in place and it is just some tweaking to add to it. Of the three steps a lot of other countries are already at step 1. Most other sports are at step 3. It is football that is way behind. 

This idea isn't as far fetch as you make it seem, far from it - I think there is a very good chance that it will happen at some point. Afterall, the EU aren't going to continue to give football exemptions from trade and employment law. As soon as the first politician who wants to make a name for himself picks that out, this thing is *gone*. Maybee the Modric situation may even trigger something like that to happen.

t1_c5mp5zs,1343850632,False,True,t1_c5mnus0,"&gt; Please see DSM IV.

DSM IV is exactly what I am talking about. Please see [ICD-10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10). Europeans use this system which was created by the World Health Organization. Funnily enough, DSM IV is about four times more likely than ICD 10 to diagnose someone with ADHD, which has lead some to theorize that ADHD [may be a social construct.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construct_theory_of_ADHD#Criticism)

This is clear once you look at some of the criteria for DSM IV:

* Often does not give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes

What does ""often"" mean here? Is it a scientifically defined unit of time? If I am not interested in a subject of course I will not give attention to a subject and that leads to careless mistakes. In which direction does causality flow here? My math teacher would have confirmed an ADHD diagnose but my history teacher wouldn't have. Finding a lot of grammatical errors in this text could be a clue that I have ADHD. It could also be that english is my third language and it could also be that I'm writing from a computer that does not have spell check activated. [Correlation does not imply causation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)

* Often does not follow instructions or duties in the workplace

My more conscientious workmates would say I do it quite often, while others define me as relatively thorough. What the definition of ""duty"" is also varies. Some colleagues think being pleasant to customers is a duty, others think staying professional is enough. Whose measure does a psychiatrist pick? Can he truly be objective or is he a human being, victim to a subjective perception of reality as much as others?

* Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat.

A pychiatrist might see me do this and tick off a mental box. But is she an attractive woman? That might make me nervous enough to fidget and squirm. Did I bike there? My heartrate may be accelerated and now I'm suddenly sitting down. Did I have too much cofee at work earlier? Maybe I have to pee? Etc. etc...

---------------------

The list just goes on and on. If a medical professional sees some symptoms but feels unsure whether I have the common cold or a variant of the SARS virus, he can order an analisys that will empirically establish whether the microorganism within me is genetically related to a deadly pandemic or just a common ocurrence. What he does based on that information may decide whether hundreds of people live or die. 

However, in diagnosing a mental disorder that may lead to extensive psycotropic medication, a mental professional is just asked a bunch of subjective questions. Imagine if before administering treatment that could save your life your doctor was asked to fill a bunch of questions like: ""does he sweat *a lot*?"". You'd get the fuck out of there as soon as you could and seek a hospital that could do actual tests. However, I'm not expected to hold psychiatric evaluation to the same standard?


&gt; You're asking a question, wanting a scientific answer, but have not provided enough definition, scope, etc. to answer scientifically.

I want a scientific, quantifiable answer, not a subjective qualitative answer. Look up [Falsifiability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability). For example, getting a brain scan showing an area of reduced activity in my brain compared to average people would constitute empirical evidence of ADHD.

Thus we, or I at any rate, can only speculate that history would have continued in a relatively similar manner, yet the formidability of the Britain would have been that much stronger. If Australian, Canadian and even Indian auxiliary could be sent to fight the campaigns alongside the British regiments, then expect to see an army that when combined with the American militias, would be a truly sizeable force that might even dare fiddle with Europe, although simply out of respect for the other nations there, I imagine they would have been largely left alone until they started interfering in the hedonism of the British gentry.

At no point do I wish this had happened, for I feel history has been fascinating enough seeing the world's premier, and at one point only super power watch as it's power peaked, and then fell, only to see its former offspring take the mantle for itself.

I do not think the Russian Empire would have claimed the western coast however.

The Europeans have a long history of coalescing around Christianity and, in later years, whiteness, that has helped to further intellectual and industrial undertakings.

The problem is especially bad in parts of Eastern Europe where public policy does not aggressively address the issue as well as Italy and Greece, where social services cannot keep up with refugees and immigrants.  

In England, with a population of 53 million, the number of homeless individuals can be measured in the hundreds.  There the state is required to provide assistance to homeless residents as well as people on the brink of losing their homes.  Sweden, Norway, Finland, Holland, Switzerland, Austria . . . the list goes on of nations that actually have reduced homelessness to levels as low as practical measures can.  Meanwhile the United States has over 1.5 million homeless children.   You are part of the problem by raising your voice to obstruct action to resolve a problem that is well within the means of this nation to address.  Yet you probably still think you are upholding noble principles rather than monstrously perpetuating horrors sure to result in lifelong disadvantages for many of that legion of unsheltered youth.

Regarding taxation, again, no one is forcing you to make money.  You really do have a choice not to pay taxes.  You instead make a choice to participate in the mainstream economy.

Not one person forces you to do these things.**  Therefore, when the time comes to pay taxes on your income, the obligation is one you incurred by entirely voluntary action.  The argument that big bad ol' guv'm'nt points guns at people to force them to pay taxes is predicated on the notion that you have some sort of God-given right to the benefits of the system you refuse to acknowledge as legitimate.  If you don't like it, stop participating.  If you do like it, stop being a disgusting little bitch when the time comes to pay your share of the upkeep on that system.

In HC this is especially risky, given your proximity to mobs, and though possible, it requires a lot of money to get the right items (high LOH is very expensive when accompanied by other desirable states, ie, intel/vitality/crit/all resist).

t1_c5mpnel,False,False,True,t1_c5moy9w,"Once again you are reading a lot more into my posts that I ever intended. I said we pay high taxes to keep up the level of prosperity because we *cannot* use more than 4% of oil revenue in each national budget. Its called ""handlingsregelen"" and it is accepted and agreed upon by all the political parties at the moment.

Tiny population is a curse more than a blessing, but I will leave that to another thread. Homogenous is relative as we have different views of what constitutes plurality and diversity. 

Without petroleum we would not be like any other country in europe. We would probably have kept on beeing the poorest country in western europe, a claim to fame we shared with Ireland. The oil that was found was such a blessing that the state and politicians at the time made very strict rules to avoid overspending which would lead to the Dutch Disease.  It is because of these strict rules that we have managed to build up *other* industries because quite simply a country cannot rely on one form of income alone. Which is why we, like all other western countries, have a varied income from taxes, industry, investment, loans and any other source of income avaliable to us. This *includes* petroleum, but if we ran the country like a Saudi Sheik we would not have the very very low income inequality we enjoy at the moment. Which in turn creates a safe and stable country.

The reason I even bother to write this is because people seem to think oil = wealth when it in fact in most countres = instability. Take most of south america, africa and the middle east. Sure there are issues (historical/regional) to explain some of the instability, but in reality there are quite a few conflicts that come from oil revenues alone. 

So without those 4% covering about 25% of the national budget each year we would absolutely be in a worse situation, but it issnt like the cash is just being shared by the population and we all drive around in Lambos eating caviar out of a Manolo shoes. Most norwegians pay close to half their paycheck as taxes, live in homes about half the size of the average american home and will on average own 1-3 cars in their lifetime.

They are also much more open to women's participation in sports than say, Islamic countries are.  Some of the poorer countries that do succeed at the Olympics do have a large middle class even if most of their populations are poor, like Brazil and South Africa.  Most poor countries either are uncompetitive in all events or succeed in one sport only (Jamaica in sprinting, Kenya in distance running).

The other group of strong competitors are dictatorships that can just decide to make sports a priority and allocate resources towards that even if they have severe needs in other areas that aren't being met - the former Soviet Union, East Germany, and Cuba were Olympic powers, and now China is, and North Korea is even winning a couple of medals.  They can also take young children away from their families and make them train full-time for years in ways that American or European athletes and their families would never stand for.

Most Indians are very poor, and struggle to survive.  The population who are middle-class by American standards is at most 10-20 million.

For instance, when I studied the Roman Republic, and later on the Diadochi, my conception of that period was very disjointed until I could put them in the same context (which for me was actually a video game, Rome: Total War and it's mods).

On a related note, if you enjoy playing some video games, many of Paradox Interactive's grand strategy games and the Total War series helped me recognize geography, family names, and the large wars between the many nations of Europe.

In 1887 the Italians added the Vitali magazine system to convert the rifles into repeaters.  In 1891 they switched over to a more modern, 6.5mm rifle we now know as the Carcano.  The Vetterli rifles were shelved for a time until World War One began to strain Italian resources.  In 1915 the old guns were dusted off and a conversion process began.  The barrels were drilled out and a sleeve of steel was fitted down them and soldered in place.  This was then bored for the 6.5x52mm Carcano cartridge.  Manufacturing new barrels would have been faster but this saved material, which was the bigger priority.  The short, wide Vitali magazines were replaced with Mannlicher magazines from Carcano patterns and required wood plugs to fill the gaps left behind.  This also meant lengthening the opening in the receiver.  The accompanying bayonets were shortened to a fighting knife length.  

The Vetterli 70/87/15 rifles were an emergency development for second line units and should have been disposed of after the war.  They were shelved instead and again dusted off for the Italian invasion Ethiopia.  Native African soldiers, known as askari, were equipped with these and even unconverted 10.35mm Vetterli rifles when recruited by the Italian forces.  With the invasion of Ethiopia complete, the region was folded in with Eritrea and Italian Somaliland to for the Africa Orientale Italiana (AOI).  The AOI forces invaded British Somaliland in 1940 and represent the only Italian victory against Allied forces without German intervention in WWII.  Unfortunately, for Italy, the entire AOI was overrun and surrendered only a year later.  Many captured rifles were sent to India as trainers, but it appears quite a few of the 6.5 Vetterli guns remained in African hands post surrender.

The example pictured has some wear but is otherwise sound.  It was originally produced in 1890 and survived military service long enough to receive the AOI brand on its stock, which could have been no sooner than 1936.  It most likely served until the surrender in 1941 and perhaps beyond with regional forces.  I have not had the occasion to work up a reduced load to shoot the rifle yet, but with a barrel length of 33 inches, weight of nearly 10lbs, and pushing only a 6.5mm round through very clean, strong rifling I imagine it will perform well.

Anyone interested should note that these guns are common on the surplus market and regularly sell for under $200.  

TL;DR:  The gun is from 1890 and the design from 1870.  It went through several modernizing conversions.  It served through WWI in Europe and WWII in Africa.

&gt; Hello. Longtime fan. I just have three questions
&gt; 
&gt; 1. I've seen activity on your twitter between Kimbra, St. Vincent, and Deantoni Parks about a possible record. Any news beyond the chatter?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Speaking of Kimbra, she has admitted in interviews that she is a fan of The Mars Volta. Assuming you've met during festival and touring, how is she and what do you admire about her music?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Since Flea played on the first Volta record, could you enlighten me to how his style is different than the bass parts in the latter Volta records that you play on. And is it a challenge in anyway to cover his parts live or do you add your own spin to things?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mnwsh?context=1) (JuanAlderete):**

&gt; I would love to record with that lineup.  3 are on board.  Bomb St Vincent twitter and let's see if she will agree.  I think D is recording with her and David Byrne.  Maybe that will start it.
&gt; 
&gt; Kimbra is the coolest.  She is going for it, musically.  I bet a lot of industry execs want her to go more pop but she is legit.  She wants to stretch stuff.  She is a true artist.  
&gt; 
&gt; Omar wrote those basslines so it was more, getting used to playing what Omar intended, as opposed to what Flea played.  I learned Mother's Milk when I was younger.  Flea destroyed it on that record.

&gt; Thanks for pedalsandeffects.com! It's really helpful for a lot of us out there experimenting. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why did you switch to Lakland basses and then back to Fender? Also, what makes vintage basses better than new basses?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mny7t?context=1) (JuanAlderete):**

&gt; I loved Lakland when Dan owned it.  There were a bunch of dudes working in an industrial complex and they were all dedicated to making great basses.  A true punk rock company.  When Dan left, I felt I should to.  
&gt; 
&gt; Plus...I always ended up playing my Fender fretless.  I think, over the years, basses woods start to age and sound better.  New woods don't have that density and you cant find that wood any longer.  All the new basses are from trees that have not been on this earth very long and you can hear it.

You guys have been very influential on me and a lot of musicians my age from my region, leading to a lot of bad experimentation with time signatures in the middle of Holland ;)
&gt; 
&gt; What's the recording process like with TMV? Do you get parts, do you guys improvise on a groove that Omar and Cedric think of?
&gt; 
&gt; What's that red Digitech pedal you use in the Rig Rundown vid, is it the 20/20?
&gt; 
&gt; How do you study odd meters? Do you use the Indian konnakol / 'takedimi' system?
&gt; 
&gt; How big is the Mahavishnu Orchestra influence in you guys?
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, I'm a guitar player myself (jazz student in Amsterdam, lots of fusion and prog in my own time) and looking for using a bass amp for extra low end and effects purposes. Aren't you using the new portaflexes? How are they?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh and do you ever do session work for young composers like myself? ;)

&gt; Hello! I just want to first say thank you so much for doing this AMA. You and the Mars Volta as a whole is a huge inspiration to me as a person and a musician. Everything you've done with Racer X and Big Sir has all been so awesome as well, and I'm excited to hear more of Big Sir. I am a huge fan of jazz music, and the way you incorporate the sounds of jazz, and Jaco Pastorius in specific, dazzle me.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, I had a slough of questions ready for this AMA, but it seems they've already all been asked! So, I just wanted to hear one of your favourite stories from on tour or even with just the TMV guys. Thanks again!

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mob8f?context=1) (JuanAlderete):**

&gt; I would have to say the grammy story.  In the grammys, there is a two part to it.  The stars part that get's televised and then the ghetto part where we were.  They give out over 100 awards in this convention looking setting.  Everyone was hungry, thinking ""why did we come to this shit?  We are never going to win"" mentality.  We sit in the back of the hall and our award is slated for 96 or 98th award to be given.  We are cracking on everyone around us and just thinking about where to go after the ceremony.  Then ours comes up...Motley Crue, Judas Priest, blah blah.  And the winner is... The Mars Volta""   We then all started yelling at each other ""this shit is legit!  This shit means something!""  We all started laughing our asses off.  We never thought we would win ... and I mean, never.

&gt; Hey Juan. Just wanted to say thanks for doing this, and that you've been my inspiration not only for learning how to play bass (I started on guitar and then singing) but also for getting more into pedals and stuff, and learning how they work. I check your website every other day, so thanks for putting in the time for that, it's been really helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, what do you think the next few Mars Volta records are going to sound like since Omar relinquished some of his control to the rest of the band? Is there anything new in the works right now, in terms of TMV or anything else you're working on? And what sort of advice would you give to somebody trying to start a band (probably an overasked question, but it's worth hearing your answer :) ) Thanks again for doing this, you're awesome.

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mocj7?context=1) (JuanAlderete):**

&gt; I have no idea...and I have no idea.  
&gt; 
&gt; As far as starting a band...play with musicians you get a long with and that inspire you.

&gt; Is it true Ikey was fired because of his habits?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5moi0o?context=1) (JuanAlderete):**

&gt; Hell no.  He had some conflicts in his scheduling and then it all just naturally evolved into what it is today.  Ikey is awesome.  I miss dinners with him.

**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mnhcq?context=1) (Aarny):**

&gt; Hey Juan, can you tell us what happened with Ikey? How come he wasn't part of Noctourniquet?

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mokyj?context=1) (JuanAlderete):**

&gt; He wasnt on the last two records because they were records that didnt have organ.  Omar has a vision and he follows it.

**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mndn3?context=1) (wilkil):**

&gt; Hey, big fan. Was the beginning of the band weird with learning how to fit in to Omar's style of a band? Have you ever wanted to quit the band as a result of his authority? Just curious, seems like an interesting band on the inside.

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/xijzu/_/c5mopn2?context=1) (JuanAlderete):**

&gt; Never wanted to quit.  I always knew what I signed up for.

&gt; First off, thank you for doing this. I am a huge fan of yours and so this is exciting.
&gt; 
&gt; -Can you spare any thoughts regarding the new TMV album? Bass sound/Direction etc.
&gt; 
&gt; -Have you noticed a change in band dynamic since Omar has decided to assume less of a dictator role for the band?
&gt; 
&gt; -Least favorite TMV song to play?Favorite?
&gt; 
&gt; - Do you have any regrets about the past 9 years?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again, Juan.

t1_c5mrjfl,False,False,True,t3_xizqn,"Here's Ron Gourlay talking about potential transfers.

You mentioned the team's performances earlier. Where is improvement needed before we kick off the campaign?
It's a question better aimed at Robbie, but we need to understand that this is pre-season training and we have been getting ourselves ready against teams who are midway through their seasons in Seattle Sounders and the MLS All-Stars, whereas we are just getting there.
We've had players filtering back into the team, some guys have been with the squad a few days, others only just over a week, so it is very difficult to get things right immediately. People expect us to win every game we play, but it can't always be like that, and in pre-season we have other measures, such as the intensity of training which has been very, very good.
Results will come, of course the fans always like to see us win, even in pre-season, but more important is that we are ready for the Community Shield and the start of the Barclays Premier League a week later when we play Wigan.
And finally, what is the latest news on the transfer front?
The situation is that we are still looking to potentially strengthen the side. The manager feels there are maybe one or two areas where we may need to strengthen but that will only happen if we find the right personnel to bring in.
We are already very strong and have a big squad, but if we feel there are players out there who can strengthen the side in the right position, we will continue to do so but it has to be the right player at the right cost, because both these things are very important. However, if we have to go with the pool we have now then we are in a very strong position going into the season.

How does it feel to be linked with Champions League-winners Chelsea?
I am very happy. They are the European champions and the best club in Europe at the moment. For me, it is a huge achievement that they want me to play for them.

You won't get kicked out of class for wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt to classes, you shouldn't get any more than a sideways look at worst. As long as they don't mistake you for a tramp gatecrashing the lecture you should be fine. Also bear in mind that you may be wearing your trousers for much of the summer aswell, expect wind, rain and cloud as the norm, especially when you get there in Spring.

You should be generally at least as safe as you would be in a US suburb, so don't worry too much about that. Be as sensible as you would be at home and you'll be fine. The drinking age is 18 in pubs, and 21 in clubs and there are many fine examples of both. If you are under 21 and look it, and have a US fake ID it might help you get into clubs. The Native beer is different to the Lager prevalent in the states. For gods sake don't write it off until you have had a good pint of [Deuchars](http://www.caledonianbeer.com/deuchars.htm) (if you take one thing from this post, let it be this). Also never drink Tennants Lager or Buckfast under any circumstances.

I can't really compare Edinburgh to the US, having never been to the US. What I can say is that Edinburgh is one of the of the more expensive places to live in the UK, but is architecturally striking and has great culture and nightlife. It is really quite small compared to London and the big cities in the US. You wont have the slightest need for a car, you can walk pretty much everywhere you will need to go, especially if you live near the University, which is near to the centre of town. A bicycle is a good call, but beware of all the hills and bike thieves. Public transport in general will be way better than the US (from what I hear at least), Edinburgh has a great bus network to get you to the outskirts, and is connected by passenger rail to all the big cities in the UK if you want to explore the rest of the country. Booking well in advance and getting a [railcard](http://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/are-you-eligible/eligibility) will save you a lot of cash if you plan on using the trains.

You may well hear many strange and unfamiliar accents and dialects in the UK. If you run into anyone who speaks like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z08kiQ-5hI&amp;feature=related) just nod along politely. 99% of the time you will be fine though.

As far as advice for being at a big University in the city, just enjoy it. There will be hundreds of people from all over the world doing the same thing as you, so don't forget to get to know the locals. Get to know your housemates and classmates, and take the chance to do things you can't do at home (partying and activities wise.) If you have the time/money for a wee trip then go and check out the rest of the UK. Also pick the City(s) you would most like to visit in Europe, and as soon as you get your university schedule book cheap flights in advance and have a nice weekend away or two while you have the chance.

They needed capital and high grade production equipment to develop, which they got from the West, who wouldn't exchange in anything but their own currency, which Eastern bloc countries often got from loans. When increasing trade deficits and debt levels met with a resource bust in the 80s, the IMF stepped in to force austerity policies on these countries. Poland had a number of structural adjustments, beginning as far back as 1970. This sort of ethos has stayed with Eastern bloc governments, who still work according to right wing economic policies (the party that emerged from the Hungarian Communist Party was actually seen as more Capitalist in the 90s and 2000s than their Conservative competitors). This was heavily detrimental to the people themselves, if you look at death rates for example they still haven't recovered to their 70s levels in most of Eastern Europe, but it kept debt levels low and corporations rich.

I have this fear. Saying that it wasn't real doesn't matter, because if you don't believe in ""life after death"" it's not a huge logical step to realize that when the synapses stop firing, your personality winks out. You just ""stop""

And sure - while ""afterwards"" there's no ""you"" to care that certainly doesn't assuage the sheer terror of anticipation of the end of one's life. We grow up and live in a world of ""I'll do that next week"" or ""I'll learn a second language next summer"" or ""We'll go to Europe when we've saved the money in a few years."" We're used to time being cyclical, and always having a second chance. 

Thinking about death as finality is realizing that it's *not* cyclical - that there's an end point. (I believe this is a major factor in ""middle life crisis"" - when we dream or fantasize we always kind of think of them as things we'll get to do ""eventually."" Hitting middle age, especially if you have parents pass away, really brings home that ""next summer"" is not eternal)

From my experience, the *only* way to get past the nihilistic terror of the finality of death is simply to not think about it. It's there, it's real, it's not going to go away. All you can do is make the most of the time you have.

t1_c5mrusj,False,False,True,t1_c5moaj5,"&gt;I do agree that oil is what powers the nation today, and by continuing to eschew alternate methods and to support these oil companies, we're going to continue to be at their mercy as we deal with raising oil prices. 

The only organization we are at the mercy of is OPEC.

&gt;If we're subsidizing them to make our personal gas costs lower, we're still making up the difference in taxes that go to them anyway. Why not let the consumers decide if they want to spend a lot more on oil? That way, maybe more people would invest in or try to start alternate energy sources.

That sounds reasonable. However, I would keep in place subsidies for locating more oil and building new refineries to try and lessen the effects of the OPEC monopoly.

&gt;Can you please explain how 10 of the top 20 companies in the world (based on revenue) are going to have a difficult time still maintaining their profits if the US doesn't subsidize them?

http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/04/16/which-megacorps-pay-megataxes/

&gt;How bad are those oil “tax breaks,” really? The deduction for oil drilling costs isn’t much different from the deductions that pharmaceutical companies are allowed to take for research and development costs (no one has proposed taking those away). And as for the domestic manufacturing deduction, every other company that manufactures anything in the U.S. can deduct up to 9% of the income they generate on those goods. Right now, oil companies only get a 6% deduction on the oil and gas they produce. Why single them out?

http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mef45fkfh/1-exxonmobil/#gallerycontent

To be honest, I am surprised that liberal/progressives have not moved to have the government take over all energy companies as a source of ""revenue"" that doesn't really mean ""Taxes"". You can't pay for endless entitlements on tax dollars alone. Any successful socialist European country owns the energy companies in it's borders for that very reason (and they *still* need to go through the austerity attrition....)

&gt;You mean the policies of propping up the housing bubble to watch it crash a few years later? Really great stuff there. /s

Please. The housing issue started long before either.

&gt;Let's go more in depth though, since we're talking Mitt policies. While he was governor of Mass, he refused to sign Norquist's anti-tax pledge.

Yes. It is fairly well known that if you promise ""No new taxes"" and then raise them, it reflects poorly on you. As an incoming governor to a state that was loosing jobs at such a high rate as well as facing a deficit, I'm sure he was well aware that he may need to raise taxes tto balance the budget (In Mass it is the law that you have to balance the budget yearly. Something the Feds should also do... And something the Obama Administration hasn't done even one time.)

&gt;So he added government and bureaucracy, while pushing costs onto mostly small businesses.

Actually, according to your chosen quote, he increased existing fees and did not ""add government and bureaucracy"" as you falsely conclude.

&gt;So he raised taxes

Actually, he didn't raise taxes. As you pointed out. It's your source that you cite, yet you draw a false conclusion. Again. He also didn't raise taxes on business. 

&gt;Then he instituted Romneycare (before it was unpopular as Obamacare). 

Yes. States rights VS. Federal and all...

&gt; He's currently against all of these things

The economy being quite different now than it was in 03 is the reasoning behind the objection to raising taxes on business and stifling growth. Yes.

&gt;So he raised taxes, closed loopholes and instituted a government run healthcare program? He's currently against all of these things, as is the entirety of the GOP, so why would the results of his governorship translate?

First off:

http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/31/news/economy/Romney_tax_record/index.htm

&gt;Among Romney's cuts was a one-year delay in a capital gains tax increase enacted before he took office. That resulted in a one-time savings of $250 million for Massachusetts taxpayers.

&gt;The verdict: Gov. Romney cut select taxes while in office. And he even proposed some new tax cuts that didn't pass the legislature -- like a 0.3 percentage point reduction in the 5.3% state income tax rate.

&gt;But he also had an obligation to balance the state's budget every year, and when he came into office he was facing a big deficit that he plugged using a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases.

&gt;""He solved for a $2.1 billion problem. Half of it came from revenue,"" Widmer said. ""He brought a balanced approach.""

&gt;The revised tax plan Romney has proposed in his bid for the White House would cut today's individual income tax rates by 20%, reduce the corporate rate, eliminate investment taxes on the first $200,000 in income and kill the estate tax. 

It's an example of the policies in place that did not raise income taxes, did not try to create a class warfare divide in our society, and helped to foster Job Growth.

&gt;paid for by everyone else: Source 1 and two. 

http://washingtonexaminer.com/obamas-independant-non-partisan-study-neither-independent-nor-non-partisan/article/2503728

&gt;“You do not have to take my word for it,” Obama said. “Just today, an independent, non-partisan organization ran all the numbers on Governor Romney’s plan. This wasn’t my staff. This wasn’t something we did. Independent group, ran the numbers.”

&gt;There is just one problem. As Looney’s bio at the Brookings Institution website shows, Looney was on Obama’s staff from 2009 through 2010. He was a Senior Economist for Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.

http://www.brookings.edu/experts/looneya

As well, The study you link to assumes no growth in the job market and business growth, which in turn relates in to no revenue growth. It states:

&gt;Summary of Results:

&gt;Absent any base broadening, the proposed reductions in individual and estate taxes specified in Governor Romney’s plan would decrease federal tax revenues by $360 billion in 2015.[7] 

Meanwhile a CBO review of actual current policy reveals:

http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43419

&gt;CBO estimates in its latest Monthly Budget Review that the Treasury Department will report a deficit of $905 billion for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012,

There are then shared competencies which member states can legislate in assuming the EU has not yet legislated in them. These include social policies, agriculture, trans european networks, transport, health and safety, etc. The EU coordinates foreign and military policy amongst member states as well.

There are a few others, but these are less important. Effectively, EU member states have 90% of the power. You can see that right now, with the eurocrisis. Had things been more centralised we would probably not be facing this as we could move funds around the EU (plus there would be eurobonds).

While I was there, we decided to fly to Rome for the last week I was in Europe. There, I purchased a cheap, sharp metal dagger from a street vendor that said ""SPQR"" on it. My dad is a history buff and I thought it was a cool gift for him. Anyways fast forward, I thought I had put it into the bag that I checked, so that it would not be on me during my flight or stop me at security. It turns out my friend had taken it out and put it into my carry on when he was packing our bags while I went to check out of the hotel for us. (He had gotten which bag I was checking and carrying on mixed up). So I get through security, get on the plane, go to get my iPod and find my dagger still in there. Well, fuck. I thought, ""Im totally fucked if any security finds this thing."" so I stuck it at the very bottom of my bag. Here's the best part: my flight was going from Rome, stopping in Munich, then I had to go to another gate to get on a plane that was going back here to DC. Somehow through both security check points, at both Rome and Munich, neither of them had found the dagger at the bottom of the bag.

t1_c5mt35a,1343865527,False,True,t1_c5msw3d,"Hard money lenders.  Find a property that is sufficiently undervalued and needs work.  Refinance, son. (However, spend some time playing the credit card system to build good credit like I did, never pay interest)

Example:

House would be work 100k in good condition.  House needs 15k work.  House is probably worth 70k in current condition. House has been foreclosed on, bank is trying to get rid of it.  You offer them 50k.

You get a hard money lender, who charges you maybe 8k to borrow all the money needed.  You hire someone, fix up the house for 15k, pay the lender 8k.  You have now spent 73k to buy a house and fix it up to be worth 100k. and then run to a small lender (whom you have scouted out beforehand, portfolio if need be) who can refinance cash out to 75% of the value of the house.  After paying $1k to refinance, they give you 75k, which you use to repay the hard money lender (who is probably charging you 10% interest to hold, so you want to do this fast).

50k purchase price + 8k hard loan origination + 15k repair costs + 1k refinance costs = 74k spent, plus holding costs if it takes you more than a month.  Refi gets you 75k at 3.5% interest.

You now have a loan at 3.5% for $75,000, and actually ended up with a tiny bit of money in the bank. The house is worth $100k and you could probably sell it for a quick $15-20k profit after fees involved.  Alternatively, you could put a renter in there for huge profit margins since your loan interest is so low and you have decent equity in the house.  Better yet, resell the house owner financed at a higher interest rate (say 7-8%), while paying down your loan at 3.5% and pocketing the difference.  Profit on borrowed money.

When you build up enough capital, start doing it yourself without the hard money lender for bigger profit margins, and in between deals or using HELOCs on the properties you have at low interest rates loan hard money to similar investors who lack capital to grab quick high returns.  If they default, you get the house they bought, which you're happy with since you're an investor, so the risk isn't so high.



When you don't have to pay a hard money lender, your profit margins end up large and you can actually end up with money in the bank on each house purchase after the refinance (or refi just to costs and tack a HELOC on to it), as well as having added a ton of home equity to your net worth.

So, Ireland would go back to UK, Portugal to Spain, unified Scandinavia + Baltic states etc. The general idea is to form a EU of 5-6 super states of roughly equal population size and removing the smaller states off the map. This would reduce intra-EU discussion to 5-6 nations instead of 27, this would fulfil the reason *I* want a federal Europe but for those who desire full unification the 5-6 new states can continue to do so.

t1_c5mth8i,False,False,True,t1_c5mjg8s,"Indeed, the rules are very clear.

Here is the relevant [EU Regulation 261/2004](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0261:EN:HTML) section:
&gt; Article 8

&gt; Right to reimbursement or re-routing

&gt; 1. Where reference is made to this Article, *passengers shall be offered the choice between*:

&gt; (a) - reimbursement within seven days, by the means provided for in Article 7(3), of the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought, for the part or parts of the journey not made, and for the part or parts already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose in relation to the passenger's original travel plan, together with, when relevant,
- a return flight to the first point of departure, at the earliest opportunity;

&gt; (b) *re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination at the earliest opportunity*; or

&gt; (c) re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination at a later date at the passenger's convenience, subject to availability of seats.

I'm not sure how you can interpret this to mean that Ryanair can cancel your ticket whenever they wish and not offer what they are obliged to do under this clause. In fact, this is exactly why the EU261 was drafted - in order to prevent airlines from cancelling on undersold flights and offsetting losses directly onto stranded passengers.

As I'm sure you know, Ryanair charge a separate EU261 levy with every ticket sold, in order to cover for these losses. And yet they still don't fulfill EU261 requirements. Do you consider this fair? I consider that to be simply stealing.

As for Riga's security surcharge, as I have already said, it is not absorbed by any airline, and instead appears as part of the taxes &amp; fees when buying a ticket anywhere else. It was a govt subsidy for air travel as a whole, that now is removed for every airline working at the airport equally, I don't see why Ryanair should be exempt from that. It's not like the airport agreed to keep the same fees for passengers forever, no matter what the circumstances are, and is now breaking their promise. There are plenty of airports in the region, and Riga claims it is still the cheapest one, so if Ryanair are willing to take their business elsewhere due to this surcharge, they have every possibility to pay extra and do so (like [they did with Greek islands this year](http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2012/05/18/40524/ryanair+cancels+greek+island+flights+citing+failure+to+honour+agreement.html)). But they don't, and instead lower their displayed prices by 7EUR (in addition to the 6EUR credit card fees) and pretend their tickets are cheaper than they are.

To summarize, my opinion is that Ryanair engages in both acceptable (albeit often shady) and unacceptable (and sometimes illegal) practices. For instance:

* Blackmailing the airport with moving their business elsewhere in order to get a better deal - acceptable
* Forcing passengers to pay surcharges &amp; taxes at the airport in order to show a lower ticket cost on their website - unacceptable
* Lobbying against EU261 as unfair and over-invasive regulation, or using it as an excuse to raise ticket prices - acceptable
* Not fulfilling requirements of EU261 (or any other law), while every competing airline does that - unacceptable
* Charging an extra fee ""for complying with EU261"", yet not complying with EU261 - completely unacceptable
* Charging payment fees for payment methods that are more expensive to process than others - acceptable
* Making payment fees absolutely unavoidable in order to shift part of the ticket price into them and pretend their tickets are cheaper - unacceptable
* Charging more money to passengers that use more services than others - acceptable
* Creating horrible inconveniences for passengers, even though there is little to no revenue loss from eliminating such inconveniences - unacceptable
* Making passengers pay more when they are booking a ticket over the phone as opposed to booking online - acceptable
* Making passengers use high rate telephone numbers in order to resolve issues that on every decent airline can be resolved online, but cannot be resolved online with Ryanair - unacceptable

Are you aware that it was so bad that his son committed suicide?

There were others who were taken down, and they're just as culpable. AIG traders in Europe are more to blame than the bankers who bought their CDO's, and nothing was done to them. Nobody knew the underlying assets were credit cards, sub-prime mortgages and car debt except AIG.

Most of the bankers never broke any laws, they just sold garbage to each other and it was completely legal. The people guilty of fraud were obvious when their hedge funds collapsed overnight, and they're either dead (suicide), a vegetable (attempted suicide), or in prison (wishing they would've committed suicide).

Maybe you should try remembering the cause of the 2008 market crash: the inflated housing market, the sub-prime mortgages bundled into AIG CDOs, and the banks that bought AIG's CMOs to bet against their mortgages. The effect of the crash was the exposure of pozi schemes (aka fraud), dry credit market, and unemployment. AIG never broke the law since CDOs were deregulated during the Clinton years.

&gt; I don't know if there was mistake or not, but they don't take me. American consulate, they don't ask my religion. They look at my family, they ask if I want to take my citizenship. I say ""I don't know, I don't know how I'll like America."" He says, ""You will like it, it's ok."" So we decided to go.

&gt; You had mentioned that when the war started a lot of the Soviet citizens were happy because they thought that it would bring an end to their poor way of life. In a way it did that for you in eventually leading you to ending up in America. How do you feel about something so tragic having a positive impact in your life? If that is how you view it.

&gt; Well, was not too bad. It's crowded with people crowded in one room, 2 or 3 families sleeping together. Food was okay. Big army barracks! There was a group called UNRA. They help us with food and clothing. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have no hostile feelings for nobody. I am only hostile to the Communist Regime. For Nazis, I had not too many contact, but I do not hate German people. 
&gt; 
&gt; In Germany, after the war, life was very poor. Everything was destroyed. All houses were destroyed. People had very little food. We had very little job. People were not happy. They hated the war. Lot of woman lost husbands, son, brother. I liked to emigrate to another country.

An Overview - PDF](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5397.pdf)

&gt;This paper sheds light on the labor market situation of ethnic minorities in the European 
Union. Facing a serious measurement challenge and lacking adequate data, we apply 
several measures of ethnicity and examine various data sources as well as secondary 
evidence. We find significant gaps between ethnic minority and majority populations in terms 
of labor market outcomes. In particular, ethnic minorities appear to face disproportional 
difficulties in finding a job. Although experience in the host country improves the status of 
immigrant minorities, we do not find any clear assimilation of further immigrant generations. 
Roma people seem to face particularly grave integration barriers in European labor markets. 

It seems like you tend to ignore similar problems that are ongoing in Europe. You also have a whole list of points, but most of them aren't really related to freedom. Economic equality across demographics is an ideal that different societies are addressing, but in the US there's no freedom to economic equality. There's no right to a job. There are very few positive rights in the US granted by the government. 

 Removing these disparities is going to take time. The barriers of institutional discrimination were only removed a few decades ago, and wealth is often passed on from generation to generation...so it's easier for the majority to maintain economic wealth. Combine that with the way public education is funded locally in the US, the persistent disparities in the criminal justice system...even when the judges are Black. There's no easy fix for these systemic problems. There's not going to be a massive wealth transfer from whites to blacks to even things out. It's going to take years to untangle these problems, but we've made a lot of progress. 

Compare the ghettos of NYC today to the way they were in the '80's. Without question things are better. Look at the initiatives we have in place, look at programs like the Harlem Children's Zone. Look at the minority scholarships for Universities.

&gt;Water pollution.

Due to government.  Seriously.  [The problem is not allowing private ownership of water sources.](http://mises.org/daily/5978/The-Libertarian-Manifesto-on-Pollution)  Tragedy of the commons.

&gt;Cheerios claiming they reduce cholesterol.

They do.  The issue was the FDA wanting to regulate it as if it were a drug - not that the science was wrong.  The FDA explicitly *did not* say that it was a bullshit claim, but that ""would cause it to be a drug because the product is intended for use in the prevention, mitigation and treatment of disease.""  The problem here is not ""Cheerios can lower cholesterol"" but *the FDA is bullshit.*

&gt;Thalidomide Tragedy

Total luck.  And the inverse is often true - for example, useful HIV drugs were available in Europe for years before the FDA approved them for use here.

Meanwhile, the FDA kills people every day.  A doctor at the Cleveland Clinic invented a medical app that helped physicians calibrate the amount of radiation to give to women with breast cancer. The FDA demanded so much extra and expensive proof of its safety that he abandoned it.  Potential lifesaving treatments are denied terminal patients because ""not enough testing has been done"" (even though they will die without it anyway).

&gt;Paying taxes isn't slavery, it's a bill

Really?  I should go around forcibly mowing people's lawns and charging them 2% of their salary.  *It's just a bill, right?*.

Taxes are not a bill.  You do not pay them based on using a service.  You can work from home - never leave your house - and still have to pay taxes.  That is not how a bill works.  Nor, in the case of an actual bill, is the burden of proof on me to demonstrate that I have in fact paid it to men backed up with guns.

&gt;In what way is that slavery?

I cannot ""run away"".  Not without having my property taken - I am forced to leave my home.  In fact, the US will even tax you if you live and work in another country.

&gt;Well, that's not true. The British Government had acquired this piece of property a short time before

The British Government did no such thing.  It had some guy plant a flag on a beach.  That's not a way to gain property of vast swaths of a continent.

&gt;The actual facts and the history that exists. The government did build the roads, and does maintain them

It built some roads.  And it maintains them now.  Private businesses used to build them, prior to WWII.

Some even build them now, although they are strictly controlled by government.

&gt;not a single business I'm aware of has so much as offered to pay for the job themselves.

Are you going to let them monetize it?  Because you have to remember that - unlike government - they can't hold everyone at gunpoint to extract the necessary revenues.

And perhaps they remember the case of the American Mail Company - Lysander Spooner was driven out of business forcibly for *daring* to successfully compete with the USPS.

&gt;If you don't vote, you're just not even trying

Nonsense.  Voting *will not* help.  You get to pick between Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs.  Fat lot of good your vote will do.  Even if, by some miracle, you were the deciding vote.

&gt;If a congressman broke either my arm or leg, I could essentially fire him AND even get to pick his replacement

Are you the only voter?  Perhaps he demonized you as a crook who deserved it, and the people still support him.  Guess you are just SOL.  Because there is no justice under democracy - only tyranny of the majority.

&gt;Rights based on what, exactly? You seem to reject the Constitution, and let's just say for the sake of argument that appealing to my belief in a higher power would leave me... unconvinced. So on what do you base your rights?

"" the nature of man is such that each individual person must, in order to act, choose his own ends and employ his own means in order to attain them. Possessing no automatic instincts, each man must learn about himself and the world, use his mind to select values, learn about cause and effect, and act purposively to maintain himself and advance his life. Since men can think, feel, evaluate, and act only as individuals, it becomes vitally necessary for each man’s survival and prosperity that he be free to learn, choose, develop his faculties, and act upon his knowledge and values. This is the necessary path of human nature; to interfere with and cripple this process by using violence goes profoundly against what is necessary by man’s nature for his life and prosperity. Violent interference with a man’s learning and choices is therefore profoundly ‘antihuman’; it violates the natural law of man’s needs.""

&gt;""Around"" is a difference of hundreds of billions of dollars.

If one looks at the actual numbers, the ""around"" we are talking about is less than $100 billion a year - less than the cost of one war, much less the rest of it.  And, again, I point out that Obama has merely increased spending (and so would McCain and Romney), and Clinton just lied to make everyone think he had balanced the budget.

&gt;a lunatic fringe of extremist conservatives who see taxation as a concept as an affront to them personally

Not a conservative.  Further, you have no moral right to declare that you should own the result of my labor.  And that is what taxation is.

Blaming Bush's tax cuts for a debt of $16 trillion is intellectually lazy, and incredibly foolish.  Regardless, it has virtually zero bearing on my point that the US government is time-limited.

&gt;Your ideal is a world without law. 

Not in the slightest.  It is a world with many laws - but none of them determined by governments, and none of them relating to private voluntary behavior.

&gt;You seem to be under the impression that if you just believe hard enough, you can opt out of a system of law. Well you can't. In fact, there have been cases brought to court on that very issue and I assure you the judiciary is quite in agreement on the matter.

Why on Earth would I expect a judiciary with full power to allow for competing sources of law?  That has absolutely no bearing on what is *right and just*.

&gt;there are even more laws dictating the use of force

I just need to find a badge.  And then I can do whatever I want.  So much for ""laws dictating the use of force"".

&gt;But - and this is the only point I'm trying to make - neither you nor I have a choice in the matter.

And that is why it is immoral - because of the force involved.

&gt;There have been a number of attempted revolutions in the US that planned violence as a means to an end.

I don't understand why you presuppose I want to plan violence at all, much less as a means to anarchy.  I merely want to defend myself from agents sent by people like you - people who propose violence to prevent others from living their own lives peacefully.

&gt;Alternatively, there have been a number of attempts at revolution through the normal democratic means throughout history and a great many of them have been incredibly successful.

No, they really haven't.  Tyranny continues to advance.  Instead of having black slaves, they made everyone a slave.  And so we march on towards a Brave New World.

Its political culture is one of continuous corruption and unaccountability. The previous mayor was thrown in prison for obstruction of justice. And even though the city is broke the public library just shelled out 2.3 million for $1000 new chairs.

The South Wing is stocked with 20 yellow and orange European lounge chairs that cost $1,092 apiece, artistic pendant light fixtures and two alcohol-burning fireplaces. The project morphed from a $300,000 furniture update to a $2.3 million overhaul with new floors, study rooms, lighting and built-in, wood-framed book shelves.

""$1,100 per chair is reckless spending for a public institution,"" said Todd Kelly, president of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1259, which represents 125 workers, including clerks, janitors and security staffers.

Iti indemni suporterii sa nu mearga la vot dupa ce Parlamentul si Presedintele interimar au promulgat legea aia a referendumului care necesita cvorum? Asa ceva NU este acceptat in orice tara civilizata din lumea asta, este NEdemocratic ca un lider politic sa isi indemne suporterii sa NU mearga la vot.        
             
Ai 7.5 milioane de voturi impotriva ta cand tu ai fost pus presedinte de 5.2 milioane? Daca e sa o luam pe baza a jumatate din jumatate, adica de cat ar fi fost nevoie ca Basescu sa fie demis daca pragul de 50%+1 s-ar fi intrunit, Basescu ar fi putut demis doar cu 4.5 milioane de voturi, dar nu a primit doar 4.5, ci 7.5 MILIOANE. Stiu ca sunt multi care acheseaza la propaganda Basista care o sa batjocoreasca acest rezultat, dar este cel mai mare numar de voturi exprimate de dupa revolutie pentru 1 optiune, nici-un alt candidat din istoria post 89 a Romaniei nu a primit 7.5 milioane de voturi impotriva sau pentru.         
DW intr-un fel arata si pozitia Germana, fiind un fel de RRA, care a trecut de la a-l sustine pe Basescu, la ""well we made a mistake"".            
                
Tind sa cred ca multi dintre cei care au fost ""ingrijorati"" de situatia politica din Romania au crezut ca aceasta chiar era o lupta politica, dar cand a venit votul populatiei, presupun ca nu au mai avut dubii. Dupa referendumul acela din 2007 care a fost castigat de Basescu cu vreo 70%, acesta a primit felicitari de la alti lideri Europeni, acum? NIMIC, spune ceva despre legitimitatea sa in strainatate.

Poate multi nu il plac pe Antonescu, dar pana acum absolut toate discursurile sale ca Presedinte interimar au fost CORECTE, a fost impartial, a fost cu 2-3 clase peste Basescu.

A similar structure is present in Europe with the European Union (admittedly, the EU has much less power over the member states, but the over-arching structure is similar; a grouping of independent states that want to cooperate economically).  We only see them as so different because of the length of time that has passed since they first joined together.

If you mean religious American Christians, they seem nice but I'm very suspicious of their support for Israel.  Their position is either ""they should be there so Jesus can come and Israel can do no wrong"" or ""Israel is literally hitler, and Jews generally suck"".  I don't think those religious organizations are capable of any sort of nuance or not talking about a political issue.

The problem is mirrored in American political organizations.  Significant chunks of the right wing are unwilling to accept that Israel does wrong, which is silly, but not really harmful for me.  Bits of the left (including some commonly found on reddit), though, would make me quite uncomfortable if they were more significant minority or a majo.  [This article](http://forward.com/articles/159911/when-the-right-is-right-about-the-left/) explains that alright--people who are vocal about Israeli-Palestinian peace slide quite easily into being extremely naive about the situation and being generally ridiculous.

If you mean Christians living in Europe, it depends on the sort.  Western Europeans are generally pretty nice to Jews.  Eastern Europe hasn't really admitted or repudiated much of their anti-Semitic past.  Though a number of them did help Jews in the holocaust, there's a reason survivors of the Holocaust got the hell out of Eastern Europe but maintained some communities in Western Europe.  However, I'm not sure whether or not they're ""western"".

In general, the sentiment is fairly accurate.  Western countries are better for Jews than any other place in the exile.  The worst thing I have to go through is confused gentiles, which is better than the treatment my ancestors got.  In the past, my ancestors have been displaced by the Romans trying to crush Judea, the Crusaders trying to kill them off, and the Eastern Europeans rampaging.  Western Christians simply don't do that anymore.  That's really where that notion comes from.

&gt;Also on that note, throughout the last couple millennia, your people have been mostly persecuted by Christians while Islamic Empires have generally protected you and your rights to worship. Does it seem odd to you that the last 60 years or so have turned your friends to enemies and your enemies to friends?

Yes, and the difference is especially bizarre in Western Europe.  The descendants of those conspiring against Dreyfus in France are really nice to Jews, while their neighbors, the descendants of Muslims who treated Jews pretty nicely, are generally terrifying.

It's not quite so simple as Israel making things do badly though.

I only die when I fuck up big-time, which isn't really a fault of the build; I can't remember a time when I've felt like I couldn't have easily lived if I hadn't missed a SS or whatever.

Explanation/excuses for why I do what I do:

Entangling Shot/Chain Gang: I think this is a pretty underrated Hatred generator. From what I understand, Hungering Arrow with Spray of Teeth is the more popular choice, but I like Entangling better. 60% weapon damage spread to up to four targets means that you're nearly always doing 120%-300% of weapon damage per shot, AND you're applying a slow effect, which frees up disc/skill slots that you'd otherwise be using on Caltrops or Vault or something.

Multishot/Fire At Will: Again, not really the conventional choice, I think most people go with Cluster Shot. I mostly use it to clear out trash, since it nearly always one-shots weak but large packs. It's also great against Illusionist and Horde packs.

Impale/Overpenetration: This is the real crux of the build. Once you get the hang of stringing elite packs through doors and around obstacles so they line up, it becomes cake. Critting all 3-4 mobs in an elite pack for 200k is an easy and consistent damage source. Grievous Wounds is another good rune, but I think Overpenetration is better for the AoE.

The other three skills and the passives are pretty self-explanatory, though you may want to tweak the runes. I use Battle Scars instead of a better rune because I find it really helpful with Reflect Damage mobs and I don't like the luck factor of Backup Plan. Focused Mind is really good if you're good at planning ahead and knowing when to use it, but I'm not, so I prefer just having the oh-shit button.",corpuscle634,0,4,,0,0,1343877153,t5_2qore,Diablo,c5mwpmx,,,1429530540,t3_xjjwa,4,

They had to be the best of the best to win resources, while Africa is so spacious and devoid of the same resources, especially in the center where its all desert.
When you look at resources available to the Africans versus say, the Europeans or Chinese its easiest to see how successful a society has been based upon their access to key domesticated plants and animals. Almost all of Europe and most of China is suitable for raising animals like pigs, chickens, cows, horses, sheep and other traditional farm animals as well as edible plants like wheat, beans, and apples. These animals and plants are key parts of diets to make sure people get enough essential vitamins and minerals, as well as being staples of the military for hundreds of years. In Africa, the climate is not so suitable for raising the animals that Europe and China had access to, as well as having an abundance of animals that aren't able to be domesticated or take far too long to be useful like lions, elephants, or the African buffalo.
Additionally, it has been noted that technology and domesticated animals are easily transferable along the same longitude as all areas along this will have nearly the same climate. Plants and animals that are successful in say, Germany, will most likely be successful in France, Russia, or the United States since they are pretty close to the same longitude.

But the MLB can't really do that because it would interrupt the season in its most crucial stretch. So the IOC took it out. It wasn't American domination issue in baseball, as the tournament was traditionally dominated by Cuba and only recently became more competitive. It was the IOC throwing a fit that the MLB wouldn't budge in their negotiations to get their athletes into the Olympics.

Olympic False Flag Or Total Diversion-

July 20, 2012

Hi Steve,

By now you have heard the speculation regarding the possible false flag event at the London Olympics. You have also likely seen the Illuminati Card Game card referencing the attack.

Most postulate that the attack is motivated by a desire to “clamp down on us further.” I'm not convinced about this though as the “clamping down” is occurring almost daily without any such draconian measures needed. Therefore, allow me to offer another possible motive….**but to do so I need to remind you of a few pre-911 events.

    Gold and silver bullion were removed from the World Trade Center vaults prior to the 911 attack….although amounts, values, &amp; ownership have never been confirmed as far as I can tell.

    Just weeks prior to the 911 attacks, Larry Silverstein took out $3.55 billion dollar insurance policy on the WTC which included terrorist attack provisions….although in fairness, not having sufficient insurance on such a large purchase, and not having “terrorist coverage” (after the 1993 WTC attacks) would have been imprudent and irresponsible.

    Irregular short selling of stocks (in particular airline stocks) took place prior to 911.

The point of the above is to highlight that financial losses were minimized and some amazingly “prescient” speculative trades were rewarded as the result of 911.**

Moving forward to today….what do we know for certain?

    Last week the venerable 137-year-old London Metal Exchange was sold for $2.19 billion to the Chinese state-controlled Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx). The price was 134 times earnings (!)---a stunning number---but the purchase gives China insight into metals markets it never would have had otherwise.

    London is the center of the physical gold world (not New York). The London Bullion Market is the biggest over the counter wholesale physical gold market the world….by far.

    There are increasing complaints from investors that they cannot get their “allocated gold” delivered to them. (Remember, allocated gold is gold set aside by serial number, in a vault, in your name. It is not “unallocated” or “pooled” gold.)

    Those who have gotten delivery of their allocated gold…usually after threat of legal action…say the bars they are receiving are not the bars they were told they had.

    The LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offer Rate) scandal affected trillions of dollars in the financial markets. Manipulation meant winning trades became losers and vice versa. Legal recourse measures are just beginning.

    Stay with me on this one…..London Olympic Opening Ceremony Artistic Director Danny Boyle labeled the ceremony a reflection of “our green and pleasant land”---a reference to the song “Jerusalem” ----famously sung in the movies Chariots of Fire and also sung at Prince William's wedding. The song uses the words of William Blake's poem, which suggests the new Jerusalem would be in England. This fact will make sense in the bigger picture later in this email.

What we can only speculate on:

    There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that large amounts (i.e. tons) of gold have moved from London to China and other points east.

    There are rumors that “allocated gold” has been used to satisfy bigger (government) transfers and is therefore no longer available for delivery to the rightful owners.

    The LIBOR scandal is so far-reaching it is impossible to estimate the damages to the banks involved.

What would a catastrophic “terrorist attack” (say a low-level nuclear blast in the London Underground (subway)) accomplish?

    The theft of the allocated gold would be covered up. “We're sorry, all that stored gold we had for you was destroyed in the blast.”

    The LIBOR scandal goes away (all records destroyed)…. along with the current London Banking system. A new system will arise with the same leadership at the top.

    The pound sterling would fall like a stone and the dollar would suffers collateral damage since the London-New York-Washington nexus is so tight. Worldwide markets would roil. Banks close. All economic woes would then be attributed to the attack and “devaluations and write-downs” would be “justifiable” emergency measures. The loss of wealth would be massive….especially to everyone except the uber-wealthy.

    British and US debt holders (Japan, China, Middle East) seem like the losers---except that they (minus japan) received the gold prior to the attack. Gold &amp; silver would soar, blunting their financial pain, but not erasing it.

    “Lock down” would occur for citizens in the US (and many western nations). The legal framework is already in place. The power-elite would maintain (and tighten) their grip.

    Obama's election chances would soar as “why change leaders during a crisis” mentality would set in.

    War will likely follow…but not immediately. Do we use the attacks to strike Iran? Or, do other countries make the connections and realize the magnitude of the theft, deceit, aggression, evil of the false flag attack? Do they (China? Russia? Germany? Others?) decide to take a stand and attack the US? Dump the dollar? Isolate and contain us economically?

What would expect prior to the attack?

    Gold would move down (!) or sideways…..movements up would bring too much later attention.

    The stock market would go up or sideways…..same reason.

    You might see big institutions going long and reducing their short precious metals positions….something that is happening now.

    The “safety” of bonds would be the prevailing thought.

    Rising tensions in “terrorist” countries would provide possible perpetrators/motives….something happening now.

    Many leaders would send surrogates to the ceremonies rather than attending personally….especially from important countries…or they would leave immediately following the ceremony.

So why the reference to Jerusalem?

    The Olympic opening ceremonies begin on the evening of Friday, 27 July (right after the markets in the US close and with the European and Asian markets having closed hours earlier). The ceremonies end in the early morning of 28 July…or the 9th of Av in the Jewish calendar….although the 9th doesn't officially start until sundown.

    The 9th of Av (as you know) is the day Solomon's Temple was destroyed in 586 BC. It is the day the second Temple was destroyed in 70 AD. It is also the day of the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. It is a day of mourning.

    On the “illuminati card” the time on the clock that is falling is 11:11. 1-1-1-1. Day one, one hour, one minute, one second into the ceremony?

    Or, since the 9th of Av doesn't officially start until sundown on the 28th, does the attack come (in Blake's new Jerusalem) one day later when all the dignitaries are gone?

Steve, I know this is “way out there.” I have had no visions from God. I'm just connecting dots and trying to recognize patterns from previous events. I have debated whether to send this to you. I don't even know what you would do with it. But I think you're supposed to have it.

Your Brother in Christ,

Greg

* Africa and the Americas are longer north-south, while Eurasia stretches east-west. This makes it easier for cultural innovation to spread in Eurasia, because climate differences are less drastic. Agricultural techniques that work in Canada aren't likely to work in Mexico, but techniques that work in East Asia can work in Europe. Plus it's just easier to travel when climate differences along your route aren't so drastic, and easier travel means more trade and more exchange of ideas. Easier spread of new ideas means civilization advances faster.

* Africa is home to a particularly harsh climate if you're from the northern hemisphere, as well as lots of tropical diseases, which makes it unwelcoming for traders from Eurasia, or sometimes even from other parts of Africa. Again, this cuts down on the spread of new ideas.

* Domesticable plants and animals. Not all plants and animals are equally easy to domesticate; for instance, there's a reason we have domestic sheep and not domestic deer - sheep instinctively bunch together when startled, making them easy to herd, while deer scatter. Similarly, all serious attempts to tame zebras have failed. As it happens, Eurasia has lots of useful crops and animals that are relatively easy to domesticate. The Americas and Africa and Australia, not so much. (The absence of the horse from the Americas and Australia, in particular, is a serious disadvantage.)

* Don't forget that humans didn't arrive and settle down in the Americas ~~and Australia~~ until much later than pretty much anywhere else, so sedentary civilizations in the rest of the world had had a lot more time to develop.

It's also worth realizing that mainstream education as a general rule tends to downplay the achievements of American, Australian and African civilizations, as they weren't seen as really worth studying by Western scholars until quite recently.

Someone buying a gun without a waiting period and successfully defending themselves in the time it would have taken a waiting period or B. Someone buying a gun out of anger without a waiting period and used it within that time frame.

I entirely understand the logic of this statement, but I look at things the other way around.  This way of looking at things puts otherwise law-abiding people in the crosshairs rather than identifying the individuals that must be restricted and then ensuring they are restricted, such as the Federal background check I mentioned.  This background check serves the purpose of identifying people who do not qualify to own a handgun and stopping them from buying one.  I don't think our government should be in the business of second guessing the motives of people who have done nothing to warrant the suspicion, which is exactly what waiting periods do because by their very nature they target law abiding people who are going about their purchase in a correct and legal fashion.

I don't like the tendency of a lot of modern gun regulation arguments to basically say ""well, prove you're capable and that you are innocent.""  It should be the other way around.  There are a lot of good ways to restrict gun ownership and they're already in place, for the most part.  If you've never done so, read over the [Form 4473](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf) (PDF!!!) that you must fill out *every time* you purchase a rifle, shotgun or handgun from a store.  Just look at the extensive list of disqualified persons.  Everything from convicted felons to ""habitual drunkards.""  Even lying on that form is itself a felony, I believe.

The other tendency I don't like is to assume that an otherwise-lawful firearm purchaser has nefarious plans (or at the least, negligent behaviors) for their purchase.  Similarly, training requirements for ownership or carry assume that the person is otherwise unfit.  I would rather go on the assumption that people are capable of intelligent thought and will seek training and practice.  Of course, not all people are that way but I don't think we can operate on such cynical assumptions.  Recognizing the right of owning and carrying these things opens our society up to negligent practices and general asshat-ry, but this is the downside of having a nation of rights and of capable citizens.  

Perhaps it sounds callous, but I think that these essential freedoms and others are worth it.  How many people have been killed as the result of mob behavior or crazy people going off their rocker and acting out violently as the result of reading some sort of writing/speech made possible by the First Amendment?  Or violence as the result of religious motivations, made possible by the First Amendment?  I'm sure the number is not zero, but I also think that this is part of the cost of a free society.  Perhaps levels of safety and health can be raised from an excessively paternalistic society in which many abilities are taken away in the interest of public safety or health, but I don't think that is a world in which I want to live.  That is a path taken by some European countries and they have, through their own unique circumstances, benefitted from it.  However, I don't think it would work here and I don't want to see basic rights further restricted under the promise of more safety.

It's an entirely different issue, but I think that things such as safety and general overall health are better approached through means other than regulating guns and who, within the limits already set, can possess or carry them.  Magazine capacity, semi-automatic, bolt action, utilizing military calibers, styles, designs... these are *not* the problem and restricting them, by that very definition, are *not* part of the solution.  We have a country where people cannot even agree on the best way in which to go about securing reliable and affordable health care for its citizens, where a basic university education is damn-near unaffordable without entering into massive debt, where the amount of wealth between the very rich and the very poor is widening, a society that is increasingly heterogenous in its beliefs, being unable to reach a consensus on much of anything.  People have less of a support structure now than they ever have, in terms of a cohesive family unit and of a structure in place to support our mental needs in times of stress.  There are so many things that we, as a society, should be discussing in polite terms and coming to compromises on in order to assure our mental and physical health and that of our children.  I don't think getting angry at a law-abiding citizen who posseses a rifle that does nothing more offensive than hold a lot of rounds and look similar to what our soldiers carry (and who might be able to get a handgun without waiting for two days) is going to solve our problems.

As far as actually locating numbers, it's a very complex issue and is rarely as simple as comparing two statistics or looking at simple causality.  For example, looking at the states with the strictest gun laws and seeing that they also tend to have some of the most violent cities in the nation is misleading.  These rates of violence are obviously caused by something other than strict gun laws, and in my opinion these reasons have everything to do with what I discussed in the preceding paragraph.  It will be exceedingly difficult to find this information that is not accumulated by either anti- or pro-gun people.  Something that I *have* noticed, though, is that there are some pro-gun websites out there such as guncite.com that do actually have some useful information, despite the obvious bias.  Of course, it is my opinion that the reality of the situation creates a rather pro-gun pattern of thought (as well as pro-personal responsibility), so I'm not entirely turned off by seeing pro-gun people accumulating this information.

I'll be honest with you, I probably come from a background and belief system very similar to yours and in many ways, very left-leaning.  Over the years I've learned that a saying like ""reality has a liberal slant"" is applicable to gun laws, as well.  Liberal (that is, not restrictive) gun laws seem to not be a detriment to society *in the United States.*  In other countries, I cannot say.  One thing that seems to be true, though, is that restrictive gun laws here in the States are *not* helping things and *are* hindering the people who actually seek to follow them.  The reality is, however, that politicians and other people will continue to attempt to use gun laws, either lax or strict, to control your vote and your actions.  At the very heart of it, just like many drug laws, gun laws are about control over you, your neighbor and your society.  We should have a say in who controls what, especially who controls what we can do, whether it is to own a scary black rifle, a marijuana joint, or the ability to get a university degree without falling into depressing and committing suicide because of the debt.",aikidont,0,2,,0,0,1343883066,t5_2qhc8,guns,c5my67j,,,1429531240,t3_xj6b1,2,
