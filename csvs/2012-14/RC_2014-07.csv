&gt;* GOG ([During GOG sales, the games get really cheap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/108uek/both_rct1_rct2_are_currently_on_sale_at_gog/))

Both expansions add significant amounts of content to the game and are highly recommended. ""Deluxe"" and ""Gold"" versions include both expansions. The cheapest location to buy RCT1 is:

* [GOG - $6](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/rollercoaster_tycoon_deluxe) (digital)
* [Steam - $6](http://store.steampowered.com/app/285310/) (digital)

If both stores are selling for the same price and you can't decide which one to buy:

GOG games are totally DRM-free. You can install them as you please, on as many computers as you want. If you don't play many video games on your computer, GOG may be the version to get.

Steam games have DRM. People who play a lot of games on their computer generally like Steam, and would prefer it over GOG. If you already have other games on Steam, it might be more convenient to buy RCT on Steam. Steam Family Sharing also allows you to share your game with other real-life friends (to be confirmed whether RCT1 / RCT2 work with family sharing).

###Where to Buy RCT2

 &gt;

&gt;* eBay
&gt;* GOG ([During GOG sales, the games get really cheap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/108uek/both_rct1_rct2_are_currently_on_sale_at_gog/))

There are three main components of RCT2:

* RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, made by Chris Sawyer
* Wacky Worlds, made by Frontier Developments
* Time Twister, made by Frontier Developments

Frontier Developments went on to make all of RCT3 (Chris Sawyer was not involved). The Wacky Worlds and Time Twister expansion packs do not add much, and they can be safely removed or ignored. RCT2: ""Triple Thrill Pack"" (USA) and RCT2: ""Deluxe"" (Europe) include the game and both expansions. There are two major unofficial add-ons to RCT2:

* RCT1 scenarios for RCT2, made by Chris Sawyer and fans
* [RCT2 UCES](http://www.reddit.com/r/rct/wiki/rct2_uces), made by fans

Several other fan-made scenarios, rides, and scenery options are available.

###Where to Buy

* [GAME - £5](http://www.game.co.uk/en/rollercoaster-tycoon-2-deluxe-48216) (Europe only) (physical disc, all expansions)
* [Amazon - $10](http://www.amazon.com/Rollercoaster-Tycoon-Triple-Thrill-Download/dp/B004APAELG/?tag=childsplaycha-20) (USA) (digital, all expansions)
* [Amazon - $18](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000695GX/?tag=childsplaycha-20) (USA) (physical disc, no expansions)

If you want to buy digitally, these two are your best bet (unless somewhere else has a sale):

* [Good Old Games - $10](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/rollercoaster_tycoon_2) (digital, all expansions)
* [Steam - $10](http://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/) (digital, all expansions)

Let's leave the media to do the sensationalism. America suffers from a myriad of issues that these shootings stem from, many of which Europe has not dealt with for centuries.


Crime issues, racial issues, mental health issues. America is unique in both it's size and history. You cannot compare the small and old nations of Europe to the young and incredibly complex nation that is America. To suggest that lax gun laws, a policy that has been in place for all of Americas history, is the cause of a very recent string of shootings, is silly. It's pulling at straws. It's jumping to conclusions. You can't compare America to any other western nation because it's not like any other western nation.

go to training lab and learn.

-bread and butter combo/simple high damage combo (usually used after jump in or crumble from focus attack)
-anti-air
-normal or special move that could be cancelled and lead to ultra (dp FADC ultra 1(ryu))
-safe combos (jab jab jab cr.mk hadouken) best used if your opponent blocked your jump in
-pokes such as cr.mk into hadouken
-safe jumps (IMPORTANT) this is gamechanging! scoring a knockdown usually leads to a 50/50 situation and if your opponent guesses wrong, it could lead to a 300-500 damage combo and a possible knockdown which can also lead to another safe jump depending on your character.

thats it pretty much, if you learn all that, you are now ready to play online, ofcourse doing combos on training lab is way different than online with all that pressure, so you just want to get used to that. ",0,,0,,,t3_29gxlw,1434489458,True,0,2,t5_2r4cj,2,cilatnp,1404174104,t3_29gxlw

From the article --

' When I was a dissident in the former Soviet Union, one of my regular activities was monitoring anti-Semitism, and smuggling out evidence and records of such activity to the West. I believed then that the free world, particularly after the Holocaust, would always be a staunch ally in the struggle against anti-Semitism.

' Unfortunately, I was wrong. Today, as a minister in the Israeli government in charge of monitoring anti-Semitism, I find myself regularly summoning the ambassadors of West European states to protest anti-Semitic attacks on Jews in their countries and the often meek response of their governments.

' Over the past four years, we have witnessed a resurgence of anti- Semitic activity in the democratic world. In Europe, synagogues have been burned, rabbis have been abused in the streets, Jewish children have been physically attacked on the way to school and inside schools, and Jewish cemeteries have been desecrated.

' Moreover, the so-called ""new anti-Semitism"" poses a unique challenge. Whereas classical anti-Semitism is aimed at the Jewish people or the Jewish religion, ""new anti-Semitism"" is aimed at the Jewish state. Since this anti-Semitism can hide behind the veneer of legitimate criticism of Israel, it is more difficult to expose. Making the task even harder is that this hatred is advanced in the name of values most of us would consider unimpeachable, such as human rights.

' Nevertheless, we must be clear and outspoken in exposing the new anti-Semitism. I believe that we can apply a simple test - I call it the ""3D"" test - to help us distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from anti-Semitism.

' The first ""D"" is the test of demonization. When the Jewish state is being demonized; when Israel's actions are blown out of all sensible proportion; when comparisons are made between Israelis and Nazis and between Palestinian refugee camps and Auschwitz - this is anti- Semitism, not legitimate criticism of Israel.

' The second ""D"" is the test of double standards. When criticism of Israel is applied selectively; when Israel is singled out by the United Nations for human rights abuses while the behavior of known and major abusers, such as China, Iran, Cuba, and Syria, is ignored; when Israel's Magen David Adom, alone among the world's ambulance services, is denied admission to the International Red Cross - this is anti-Semitism.

' The third ""D"" is the test of delegitimization: when Israel's fundamental right to exist is denied - alone among all peoples in the world - this too is anti-Semitism. '

' Nevertheless, we must be clear and outspoken in exposing the new anti-Semitism. I believe that we can apply a simple test - I call it the ""3D"" test - to help us distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from anti-Semitism.

' The first ""D"" is the test of demonization. When the Jewish state is being demonized; when Israel's actions are blown out of all sensible proportion; when comparisons are made between Israelis and Nazis and between Palestinian refugee camps and Auschwitz - this is anti- Semitism, not legitimate criticism of Israel.

' The second ""D"" is the test of double standards. When criticism of Israel is applied selectively; when Israel is singled out by the United Nations for human rights abuses while the behavior of known and major abusers, such as China, Iran, Cuba, and Syria, is ignored; when Israel's Magen David Adom, alone among the world's ambulance services, is denied admission to the International Red Cross - this is anti-Semitism.

' The third ""D"" is the test of delegitimization: when Israel's fundamental right to exist is denied - alone among all peoples in the world - this too is anti-Semitism. '

False,,False,IWantOut,t1_cilaxy2,[deleted],"&gt;Most important to me is a country with a bit liberal social policies, limited religious influence (just personal preference, not disparaging other beliefs)

Czech is one of the most atheist countries in the world:http://www.salon.com/2012/08/29/eight_of_the_best_countries_to_be_an_atheist/. 

They still celebrate Christmas and Easter,  but it's more for the tradition than out of any religous importance. For Christmas the big celebration is on the 24th. They eat carp soup(it's an acquired taste), carp as a fish dish, potato salad, and loads of other traditional foods, pastries and breads. On Easter the men chase the women with sticks! A tad mad but fun. The markets have these big massive fish swimming around in massive drums of water. You get to pick out your lad and some Czechs then keep him in the bathtub! You will have a lot of WTF moments living there.

&gt;Looks like a beautiful place with a great culture. Am I missing something?

It is. I don't really know why more people on this fora aren't looking into relocating there. I think there is an element of ""Eastern Europe/there be dragons there"" to it.

It's a beautiful country, lovely hearty cuisine, unbelievable beers, drinker friendly licensing laws, great social policies for bringing up kids, excellent public transport in the cities, ideally located to use as a hub to see the rest of Europe, beautiful scenery and excellent opportunities to partake in winter and out door sports.

Wages are lower than in the west, but that's relative to your cost of living there.

Take a trip and make sure it's the place for you. Try and get the basics of the language, if you can. It takes a lot of time to learn so best to get on that early.

False,,False,Psychonaut,t1_cilay66,Dusty_Bottoms159,"Worry not friend, me and many others includes have gone through the same situation and have battled the same type of cyclic thinking. And for the people who haven't gone through this yet, they will, everyone has their appointed time to reach for higher truth whether they know it or not. About a year ago I went through some intense ego loss but I didn't understand the nature of it, so I renounced my religious beliefs and social learning's and became a semi-recluse and delved into topics ranging from spirituality, the occult, ancient history and literature, conspiracy theories. So I go through all this shit, learning the world is as fucked as I presumed. We are controlled by a cruel system of enslavement by money, government, social norms, and demoralization, and the reigns are in the hands of global elites and century old banking masters. 

Now I'll play a bit of the ""bad guy."" The people and forces that currently control and oversee global events are preparing for something big. They are planning on ushering in a New World Order. They want to ""depopulate the planet"" to something disgustingly small like 5% or less of the current population. They'll create false flags bigger than 9/11 to usher in more war, likely escalating to another world war. You may have noticed there was a push to attack Syria last year. If the New World Order gets Syria and Iran they have secured the petrodollar. From there they can build a One World Government and One World Currency. The ""Mark of the Beast"" mentioned in the Book of Revelation is misinterpreted. The Greek word used for ""mark"" means money. No one will be able to buy or sell without this new currency. Obamacare seeks to integrate RFID chips by 2017, I can't verify this now because I'm on mobile, but RFID tracking is slowly being integrated with the dollar. Oh and our dollar, backed by nothing, being dropped China, Japan, Russia and a few EU countries, is on a fast track to collapse, perfect for introducing a one world currency.

I am unsure how much of this will happen. The Book of Revelation describes mass destruction and promises that the cruel entities that control the earth will be destroyed and a new earth and new golden age will take its place. But not just the book of revelation, Eschatology as a whole shares these themes. Eschatology is the study of apocalyptic, apocryphal or ""end times"" stories and texts. The Mayans believed this too, their calendar didn't describe and end date, but a transition into a new age. Read ""New World Bible"" by Brandon Levon. He proves that many cataclysmic End Life Events were coinciding with the precession of the Equinoxes, or changing of zodiac signs. The Age of Aquarius (man) was the first destruction age in the most recent 25,920 year cycle. Then Scorpio (eagle), then Leo (Lion), then Taurus (Bull). These 4 signs are described by the prophet Ezekiel in his famous vision surrounding a ""wheel within a wheel"" (zodiac and the precession of the equinoxes) and are also described by Saint John in the book of revalation. Brandon Levon became semi depressed after learning this. He died shortly after publishing this book under ominous circumstances. Personally I think he knew too much and was bumped off, but I don't fear having this knowledge. The things we fear are true, but it will pass.

But then so what? Is this world worth living in? Kind of sort of. I also learned that the less clutter I have in my head the more I can just be with the present. Sure I can't expose the atrocities and crimes committed by The Powers that Be, but I've become satisfied with becoming a very approachable, cool, calm, collected individual who cares about the evolution of consciousness and eventual enlightenment of fellow man. Some people I still hate dealing with but I see a potential Buddha in everyone. 

As for things you can do now, just do whatever makes you feel best right now. Acting on your highest excitement opens up gateways to more things that will excite you. This is the Law of Attraction in its simplest form. I'm not a big fan of The Secret or the Law of Attraction, because they're heavily watered down occult sciences. Try reading ""Initiation into Hermetics"" by Franz Bardon if you want a deeper, more wholesome understanding of the Universe.

Some practical things you can do might include:

-Spending time in nature. Climb a mountain, swim across a lake, sit under a big tree, explore a tide pool, or spend time with animals. These will calm your nerves and give you some spiritual nourishment. 

-Try some good MDMA. Sounds like you've tripped in the past. LSD might be fragile for where you're at right now. Someone on this thread mentioned MDMA and you yourself mentioned somewhere that you have PTSD from childhood. We all have a little PTSD and recent scientific study has shown that MDMA is beneficial in treating veteran's with PTSD. So get with some close buddies and take a dose of some pure MDMA, which may be tricky to find. The purer the better, avoid heroin or meth cut pills. 80-150 mg of some good shit will give you the experience you need.

-Talk to someone. Maybe it's just us here, but I would challenge you to go seek out people who think like you. Get a girlfriend or boyfriend. I can't prove that this will help, but I've been single and lonely all my life, but I know intimate partnership with another human is something I crave. You're 21, I'm 20. We have time to work on that. I'm baffled women aren't as interested in my open and loving mind as much as I am, but the Universe works in strange mysterious ways sometimes. I simply haven't met her yet, and we need to be OK with our lonely selves before we try to support another conscious being.

-Find a new hobby. For me personally I have grown to be fascinated with reading and studying tarot cards. It has a lot to do with my interest in the occult, Kabbalah, and Hermeticism. So much lies in these cards. Symbols and archetypes galore. I've learned so much about myself and the human condition from the Tarot. It's a fun little party trick, to say you can read someone's fortune. Tarot isn't as much about seeing the future, but more as a complex system of divination, which seeks to assign meaning and guidance to an issue or question framed in the present.

You aren't alone here. I am you and what I see is me. It's a big game of God, or whatever higher power or name overlooks us, playing a bunch of different roles so that they might reintegrate with the divine spark or source of creation. Walk quietly and peacefully my friend. Better days are in our future, if we can love and appreciate today for what it is.

Your ignorance is so apparent its not even funny anymore.. A trade agreement made to make a country less dependant on another's trade directly effects said nation when you leave aswell as long term economic plans both nations had for the future.

&gt; Ukraine was acting quite sensibly in wanting to be part of a political union that promotes trade, economic stability and universal human rights.

How is it sensible to take a shittier deal than offered by Russia in hopes of getting a chance to join NATO, an organization that likely wont last long enough for them to join. The EU deal literally had nothing really worth the stress of dividing the country but was littered with ways for them to sink their own ship, aka loans.

Riiiiiiiight, thats why half of the country didn't want it, some of which to the point of hosting a referendum to leave the country entirely. For the people, by the people right? ahahahah

&gt; but the old bear decided that this offense to it's pride wouldn't stand, and so armed invasion, land-stealing and what for all intents appears to be state-sponsored insurrection has ensued on top of avoidable loss of Ukranian lives and livelihood.

AHAHAHAHA it keeps getting better... Russia first moved its stationed Crimean soldiers to the edges of their allowed territory to stop the civil unrest happening in the area. After Yakun asked Russia for aid in quelling these fights, they began to expand their operations to important locations in case of disaster happening. They stayed there **peacefully** until the appointed PM(by the maiden government) also sent a letter to Russia asking for assistance and aid in holding a referendum. They did not ""invade Ukraine"", they helped Crimea stay stable and hold a vote to decide their own fate. Oh and dont you dare try and say Russia is fighting in Ukraine right now, thats just utter bs that is founded by nothing. In fact, those type of statements are actually the opposite of what all reporters in Ukraine have found (even simon from vice).

So, to be clear, you are implying that good economics is caused solely by technological advancement? Since that is the driving factor behind those technologies becoming cheaper, after all.

&gt;Norway, Sweden very small wealthy population due to very natural resource rich economies.

You realize that Sweden has a massive industrial sector? Their primary exports are pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles, and industrial machinery. Resource rich? Their primary resources are timber, iron ore, and and hydropower. News flash: most European countries have significant access to those resources. News flash: the US has incredible access to them. Norway really isn't better off on resources. Denmark has almost no natural resources beyond fish. So how did these countries get wealthy populations? They invested in their society, pooling resources to spend less money collectively than they would have to individually.

Germany absolutely enforced austerity. They still spend and tax more per capita than the US. Their version of austerity is STILL more tax and spend than we have here. Austrian economics? Hardly.

&gt;Canada, Norway, Sweden have some of the longest waiting times in the world, over a year to see a cancer specialist for example.

A very extreme example. How does it compare to NEVER seeing a cancer specialist because you can't afford it?

Further, those countries DO rank higher than the [US, and any, free market health care system](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-s--ranks-last-out-of-11-countries-in-health-care-quality-162331309.html).

But there are innovations that are unique to Gothic (and presumably other East Germanic languages) but that aren't found in Proto-Germanic or the other branches. One of them is that PGmc \*fl &gt; becomes Got. þl (compare PGmc **fleuhaną*, OHG *fliohan*, and Goth. *þliuhan*.)

So, yeah, it has a lot of older features, but you definitely don't want to say that N. Germ or W. Germ are descended from E. Germanic (I realize that's not the claim you're putting forth.)

&gt;Couldn't one therefore argue that Gothic wasn't in a separate branch from the North and West Germanic languages, and was instead just another dialect of Proto-Norse/Proto-Saxon?

I guess I'm not entirely sure what you are claiming. 

I guess the simplest thing to assume case is a ternary split, something like below, which is 


      +----------------------N. Germanic
      |    
      | 
    --+----------------------W. Germanic
      |
      |
      +-------------E. Germanic
    

I think it's currently also not super controversial to have something like below:


          +-----------------N. Germanic
          |
      +---+
      |   |
    --+   +----------------W. Germanic    
      |
      |
      +-------E. Germanic



What would you propose? Something like 

          +----E. Germanic

      +---+
      |   |
    --+   +----------------N. Germanic

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The __*Jyllands-Posten* Muhammad cartoons controversy__ (or __Muhammad cartoons crisis__) ([Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark): *Muhammedkrisen*)  began after 12 editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam) prophet [Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad), were published in the Danish [newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_Denmark) *[Jyllands-Posten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten)* on 30 September 2005. The newspaper announced that this publication was an attempt to contribute to the debate about criticism of Islam and self-censorship. Muslim groups in Denmark complained, and the issue eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries.

&gt;Islam has a strong tradition of [aniconism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniconism), and it is considered highly [blasphemous in most Islamic traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_blasphemy) to make a picture of the prophet Muhammad. This, compounded with a sense that the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish [imams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam) visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. As a result, the issue received prominent media attention in some Muslim countries, leading to protests across the world in late January and early February 2006. Some escalated into violence resulting in more than 200 reported deaths, attacks on Danish and other European diplomatic missions, attacks on churches and Christians, and a major international boycott. Some groups responded to the outpouring of protest by endorsing the Danish policies, launching ""Buy Danish"" campaigns and other displays of support. The cartoons were reprinted in newspapers around the world both in a sense of journalistic solidarity and as an illustration in what became a major news story.

""Is non-existent! It is merely a copy of the old church in old port.""


""Can we really defend new art if we are hypocrites ourselves? We must admit that we too have committed this crime of imitation, only to enhance our reputations.""


""This is true.  However, I must stand with the board.  This candidate shows no real potential in making himself noticeable. All in favour of rejection.""


Hands rose. I did not.


""Gentlemen, I guarantee you do not actually want to do this. On my life.""


Quiet murmurs and nervous shuffling.


""I'm sorry, but the Board's decision is final.""


The stamp of rejection had been stamped hard, and finally on the candidates application essay.


As the members began filing out of the board meeting room, I stayed, and hovered over the creamy piece of paper. The circle pattern, known to all who once thought they might make it into the Vienna School of Art knew this to be the bane of their miserable lives.

It's more likely that it will simply be large swathes of the first world slowly sliding into second and third worldish conditions, which is basically happening as we speak.

You've also got to keep in mind that those with power are going to do anything in their power to keep the masses just content enough to stay quiet and to make the potential of losing everything simply too high a gamble because there *is* too much to lose.

Also, and I'm going to use these terms loosely, in my own country, the hierarchy of peasant, freeman, gentry, and noble still are mostly maintained, though in different ways. Now, as of now, the gentry and landed gentry have lost many of their people, but this backwards thrust into the freeman class, or even peasantry, has largely stopped for now. All the while, the nobility are pitting the gentry against the peasants, and the peasants and lower freemen are still getting enough charity to keep them fed and non-violent, though evidence of this collapsing can be seen in things like food stamp cuts and what is going on in Detroit. In most of history, at least from what I've seen, it is only when the minor nobility and the landed gentry start getting screwed by the higher nobles in large numbers and start getting thrust into peasant and lower freeman status that social change occurs, and *that* is when the social order in each specific country will begin to collapse.

In my own country, the United States, I expect to find out that we are entering a new recession and that the employer based mandates of the ACA kicking in will make this worse as it will mostly affect the gentry and minor social nobility; I also expect that things like asset forfeiture over a certain amount will start taking place in much of Europe and the credit bubble to burst hot and heavy in China. This, when you see these things happen on a large scale, *that* is when the ""collapse"" will happen, because it is these things that will screw over the landed gentry and the minor nobility.",0,,0,,,t3_29il41,1434490312,True,0,8,t5_2qhw9,8,cilciun,1404177998,t3_29il41

I hear that, but unfortunately, I/P is the very definition of politics.  I see Israel killing kids, too, and I want that to stop. And I definitely don't ever want to see anything like these 3 Israeli teens being brutally kidnapped and murdered, or rockets fired at Sderot, or forbid, a Second Intifada, ever again.   

In other words, I want peace, and I think the only way to it is through a 2 or 3 state solution.  

&gt;Every Palestinian living there hasnt immigrated by force or by choice, theyve been refugees in their land, since the Nakba

You're damn right, and it's an unconscionable damn shame that needs to stop immediately. I wish Mahmoud Abbas had taken Ehud Olmert's offer in 2008 or that Arafat had taken Ehud Barak's offer in 2000 or that Bibi Netanyahu had agreed to the Kerry Framework when Mahmoud Abbas was ready to sign off on it or when Shimon Peres brought a deal to Netanyahu in 2011.

&gt; You make a good case for Jews having ties to that land, but even if only half of them are descended from European immgrants, I think the majority of them did immigrate there, from Arab expulsions and such

This is sort of the point. Israel exists for a reason. Right now, there's a rising wave of Aliyah as a result of French anti-Semitism and another potential wave of Ukranians and Hungarians.  Isn't it a good thing that these potential refugees have a safe, good place to go?  *The Israelis are there to stay, and we must find something better for the Palestinians AND the Israelis than the status quo going forward.*

The trouble is that Palestinians don't have that refuge, too. Palestinians who comprise *the majority of the Jordanian population*, and are refugees throughout Syria and the rest of the middle east. Palestinians deserve a sovereign nation-state and self-determination, too, and I really believe there can be one in their shared homeland.

&gt;Area C

Agreed.  Totally. And I think that EU support for a Palestinian state following independence, along with Israeli, Egyptian, and Jordanian support will be necessary in the establishment of a first class, first world, developed state that affords a very high standard of living.  And I think *that is totally possible under Fatah, under a Fayyadist approach.*

What I meant re. Fatah as the de facto government was more the split between the West Bank (Fatah) and the Gaza (Hamas.)  Obviously, the PA works in close coordination with the Israelis but that's a good thing as far as security concerns go.  It'd be even better if it was more widespread and economic. Naftali Bennett is precisely the wrong road, but so is one-stateism.

That's sort of my point.  This is nothing that innovative thing, a commitment to peace, and a Marshall Plan-type program can't improve dramatically in Palestine, for Palestinians, alongside Israeli for Israeli Jews with mutually agreed upon borders, defense pacts, and economic cooperation.",0,,0,,,t1_cilbrfh,1434490314,True,0,1,t5_2qh13,1,cilciz6,1404178007,t3_29fgxq

False,,1404178277,AskHistorians,t1_cilcjg8,CarlinGenius,"No, it was not inevitable from the beginning. Certainly, following the First World War, Germany was at a disadvantage given the restrictions put on it by the Treaty Of Versailles. However, Germany closed much of the ""armament gap"" in the 1930s (under the Nazis, but this process had its beginnings before their rise to power). However, the French in particular still, to most outside observers, possessed an army capable of holding their own against Germany, and the UK maintained their powerful navy's advantage. 

A key event changed the situation though, in August 1939. After negotiations for an alliance broke down with The Western Powers, Stalin signed the Molotov-Ribbentropp Non-aggression Pact. This of course meant that Germany would not face a two front war (at least not for a while) as it had immediately in 1914. Still, things were not inevitable. While it would be difficult, the war still seemed winnable for the British and French. Their defenses on The Maginot Line were still formidable. Of course, as it turns out, the Germans ended up largely bypassing the line through the Ardennes defeated the French, and drove the British off the continent. There was nothing inevitable about this victory though--it turned out the German doctrine was superior (massing their tanks in formation, greater radio coordination between air and ground forces) but it wasn't as if the Germans knew that this attack through the Ardennes would be a success, it just seemed like a better alternative to repeating Schlieffen (attacking through Belgium). The speed and success of the campaign in the West astonished the Germans almost as much as it did the British and French.

It's hard to argue that by the end of the year 1940, and the beginning of 1941 the Germans weren't sitting in a good position. True, they did fail to win air superiority over Britain and drive them out of the war, but on the other hand, the British could not inflict catastrophic damage on Germany either to drive it out of the war. At sea, the British were losing more in the tonnage war than they could build. On land, when German forces engaged Allied the Gemrans tended to be successful. 

Keeping these in mind there are several things that make 1941 the key year in which the war became, in hindsight, unwinnable for Nazi Germany.

1) The Lend-Lease Act, March 11, 1941--The US now gives billions of dollars free, or nearly for free, in weapons and supplies to countries fighting the Axis. Most importantly the USSR and British Empire. This ensures that the gigantic industrial might of the United States would now be against Germany. 

2) Invasion of the Soviet Union, June 22, 1941--The the largest invasion of world history. This front will tie down more than approximately 2/3 of German troops for the majority of the rest of the war.

3) German advance on Moscow stalls on December 5, 1941--BARBAROSSA ends, German troops settle in for a protracted war deep in Russia and their strained supply lines are inadequate to the task. 

4) The United States declares war on Germany, December 11, 1941--this makes official what has already been an undeclared war for months. FDR agrees with Winston Churchill on a ""Europe First"" strategy--Germany, the most important opponent, must be eliminated before Japan. The majority of US production goes toward Europe.

By the end of 1941 Germany finds itself outnumbered and outgunned, on multiple fronts. In 1941 The Big Three (US, UK, USSR) have a combined 4:1 advantage over Germany in GDP; in 1942 it is 4.2:1; in 1943 it's 4.5:1; in 1944 it is 4.7:1. It became a war of attrition the Germans simply could never hope to win. ",0,,0,,,t3_29i48j,1434490320,True,0,4,t5_2ssp3,4,cilcjg8,1404178038,t3_29i48j

Polytheism, definitionally, will be broader than something like  Christianity, which holds that there is a single correct God and a single correct son. There's a reason that when Romans encountered new peoples and religions, they immediately incorporated those peoples religious practices into their own - polytheism *denotes* many paths, and you can't claim that one of its main points prevents it from being a religion. Think, *that's not a bug, that's a feature*!

Secondly, you can generally call pagans of the European descent nature based, so that in some way they are  pantheistic.    

More broadly, in my opinion you are onto one of the reasons that paganism lost out to Christianity. I'm mostly Hellenic focused, and I know that the emperor Julian, when trying to revive polytheism, lamented that there wasn't a single book upon which all people of his faith could dedicate themselves, like Christians had the Bible. But, that being said, my faith is mostly Platonic and neoplatonic, and often different deities will be held to be the demiurge, Proclus thought it Aphrodite, Julian thought it Helios. I don't think it much matters, as in all cases you're imposing human perspectives on something far greater. But I do like that neoplatonism was not torn apart by their disagreement, it was really quite incidental. Compare to Christianity, which went through untold schisms because of matters that were far more trivial. This is why I like paganism, because the sense of uncertainty it has *allows for the experience of the divine*. The divine does not fit our preconceptions, and is greater than we could possibly imagine, and it's those disagreements and the diversity of perspectives that really start to outline the scope of true divinity, in my mind. This is also why I feel that modern man is drifting away from  Christianity, and will approach something like paganism.

As for the ""anti"" subcultures. Like I said, I was in one so I have that innate respect for them, but I can't help feeling like it's been done. And more than that, it's easy. Sometimes we need to rage, but let's be honest, raging is easy. I respect punk for its contributions to gender, and social upheaval (at least in Britain), but there was never an end point. They didn't get that much done. Maybe I'm just getting old and practical, but I don't see much value in anger. We've deconstructed  so much since the 60s but youth culture hasn't contributed much to reconstruction. Maybe that's just not what youth does, I don't know.

I feel like people are beginning to listen in a way they haven't before. If you look at gay marriage, for example...we've made astonishing progress in just a few years. People are *finally* starting to understand rape culture and the essential violence of beauty standards. We've got a long way to go, but I can honestly say I've never seen this level of openness in my life. Lord knows there's still stupidity and intransigence but I feel like now is a time for a more nuanced discussion than ""Fuck the Police"".

And yes, they do steal from Native Americans. I've noticed that but it wasn't foremost in my mind when I was talking about reforging Italian coffee culture into something more authentically American. I don't know if you're from here, but there's a tendency in the U.S. to see cultural quality as largely European. The hipsters are stealing it, but they're at least trying to make it new. I don't think they're going to beat the French at cheese-making, but at least they're not pretending to be french. They're still being pretentious, but the're being pretentious in a way I haven't seen before. 

I'm just rambling now. You wrote a thoughtful post but I'm not sure I can respond point-for-point. I haven't given the Hipster movement all that much though, which is why it's strange that I even started this thread.

Put something together you believe it, make a new product, form a nonprofit, or find something to stand behind and change the world you live in.  

I think the problem is that you are sick because you want the world to change but did you ever take the first step to change them? or do you do nothing and watch the world burn?  

I think you also need to travel!!!  I highly recommend booking at ticket to China!!  See the world for what it is, it is not all gloom and doom everywhere.  I lived in china for 4 months just because I could. I did not know anyone, did not have a job, and did not know much Chinese. (I knew a few words). I almost moved there but I had a year of college left. 

I ended up finding a Job in Shanghai as a teacher that paid for my apartment. I could survive on about $5 a day without a problem, even in the city, taking subways and taxis, buying food, ect.  I started dating a girl, and we traveled all over eastern and central china the last month before I left. We did it on a budget (she was Chinese) so she could find all the deals.  (We found day trips to other cities for only a few dollars). 

Why travel? because you forget all the bullshit that is going on. your only focus is you and your experience everyday. I would walk around cities, see temples, even volunteered in the country side (where people made $0.60 a day) and taught English for a week (took my students with and they helped me teach, it was a blast).  I was the FIRST NON-ASIAN PERSON IN THAT CITY (it's debatable, since my co-worker was sitting in front of me on the bus), but both of our pictures are literately hanging on the wall of three restaurants.  

Did I plan that? No, not at all. I just made friends with someone who asked me to come along and I was allowed to bring my students. 

What I am saying is this:

 I forgot all of my troubles the second I landed in Shanghai.
 Made 100+ new friends (and I am an introvert, if you love to socialize you will make a 100 friends in a weekend).  

People you don't know will ALWAYS take care of you.  

You don't need to know any Chinese, but it is VERY fun to learn! 

Don't waste your money, you can live on a budget if you stay at a hostel, or have a school pay for your living cost, or you find an apartment to split (more expensive).  

Some schools started to require ESL teaching certificates, but many smaller schools and weekend schools don't care, they will also pay you under the table.   

Their are hundreds of websites that foreigners use to socialize, meet some people who have been there for awhile, they will show you around because it is fun for both people.  they know all the cool places to visit, will give you tips on getting around, and even help you get a job!  

It does not have to be China, Costa Rica was really fun and i would recommend it.  Try anywhere, but avoid Europe since it's loaded with English speakers and politics =(  Nothing will change in your life since you will hear the same politics and see the same greed that is currently making you struggle in life.

  Those attitudes persist around the world regardless of the label I place on it, or what label you place on it, or society places on it. It's not rabble rousing to speak out for people who are subjugated. Thats a key difference in what you and I believe. I'm used to standing up for what I believe in. Insert a jab about americans here in your response, its fine and I totally understand. We're used to it by now. 


 Nothing about this is about public sex. Its about the ability to do something as simple as show simple affection.( i.g. holding hands, hugging etc.) Regardless of law, its wrong to imprison people due to thier sexual preference. It is in poor taste for a company with a fan base encompasing millions to choose a country with backwards ideaology on this issue. It's a human rights issue, not an issue about sex or public display of affection. Even in the US the LGBTQ crowd is fighting a battle for human rights. In Russia, and  in many parts of the world. Progress will eventually happen, whether the small minded can handle it or not. 

I have a wonderful present. My outlook on the future is great, I call it like I see it, and you sir/ma'm are acting like a small minded individual, maybe you just want to be a sophist and ""win"" the argument. I don't know at this point. 


To clairify one last time for you: People should be able to love whoever they wish, without the threat of violence, imprisonment or tyranny. I am not saying go make a public display of affection.( Seriously ,read the post again, and look for the meaning in context, its about an idea.) In most places in the world it's indecent action and can get you fined or imprisoned albeit not because of your sexual preference. Being gay in singapore holds a prison sentence and serious consequences. Thats fucking garbage and your excuses are garbage. I'm not saying that you are garbage by extension, but that defending a policy that subjugates others, with an excuse, you are making a garbage statement.

If you are not the one being subjugated, its just fine and dandy for you, huh?
 
 In America, people fight actively against our government, we hold rallies, pressure politicians, and take it to the courts to determine constitutionality. I'm sure it works similarly in your own country as well. Whichever particular country you are from. 


( I will not make any more assumptions, because I won't fall into the same attack pattern twice. It's really the only semi valid point that you have. Even though I targeted this post at the *majority* of english speaking countries in lcs world wide. Hey I made a mistake and I can admit that, but how about that?  Someone *else* in the world speaks the world's second most spoken language, English! )

(Behind Mandarin of course, which is the most spoken langague in the world by volume.) Did I mention my soon to be wife speaks it? Both of my cousins live in China and Taiwan. It's really difficult to learn though. My cousins had to move to China for immersion. My crazy aunt followed them and has been spreading evangelical christianity. Which is illegal as well. We fully expect to see her on the news someday. ( I think she followed them, because she was evading taxes in the US from her failed business that was audited!)I have stoutly western conservative Irish Uncle by marriage. (I mean conservative with a capital ""C"".) So by now you are asking yourself: ""What the hell is the point of this guy telling me all this stuff?"" The point behind me telling you this is so that you will stop assuming that this is a singularly ""american"" cultural background from which I draw ideals about the world. It's a little annoying when you insinuate that I can't understand the differences in south east asian politics and ideals vs western ideals. You are the person who assumed this and so you are the one who falls in the ""dumbass category"" to quote you. We have a saying in American English: You make an ass out of yourself when you ASSume.    

If you want to continue, go on I'll let you have it. I'm tired at this point, let me wind down without anymore ad hominem attacks. I really couldnt resist the assume line. It was just really poignant, and I apologize. I don't think you are an ass at all. I'm kind of an ass for making that attack. Lets continue and finish. 


 If you don't stand up for what is right, regardless of the circumstance and you make excuses out of convience, then you don't deserve any better than the people who are being subjugated, and I hope the next time you find something ""unfair"" happening to you, you stop and place yourself in the shoes of someone who is dealing with with it consistently, because of your convience, complacency and excuses.

Americans, Europeans and the Chinese provinces and even parts of Southeast Asia buy electronics devices that are manufactured on the backs of the poor, in what is essentially slave labor. Should we not stand up and say something, simply because its not illegal? 

Should we see chinese workers with benzene poisoning, die of cancer related to it and say nothing? Even though in every other country it's been banned and classified a class 1 carcinogen?  

After all its not on the books. Maybe they can avoid it some how?  

The answer is NO. We should challenge that. We should not purchase things made on the backs of slave labor, and we should reject companies that mistreat and endanger thier employees. 

Do you fucking know why this happens? Convience. Convience for the markets that sell these and for the consumers. We keep coming back to this word. Convience. 

It's more convient for you to make an excuse, rather than to stand up for human rights.  This is of course me making an attempt to parallel with another argument, in an effort to help you understand my reasoning. It bears no relevancy to the original argument, only serving to highlight another great injustice in the world and parallel the argument.

Not every american fits your sterotypical mold of god fearing, gun toting, flag waving, faux freedom, democracy slinging tool. Some of us give a shit about the others in the world. Some of us can identify countries on a map.(Sadly a skill that the world really has a genuine right to make fun of, I mean the school system is terrible here...You have to learn about critical thinking skills via college.) Some of us care about human rights, regarless of the border and the ethnicity. Everyone bleeds the same way, and every human on this earth suffers in someway.  Go on say something about world police and such I'm waiting for the stinger.....Yawn. Human rights are a human problem and a part of the human condition. We should strive wherever we can to show that we are more than the sum of our conviences and half truths, we should take a stand and say. "" It's wrong to discriminate against others."" Not just singapore or russia, but the human race.


 Look at the US. It hasn't fully rejected that religious dogma, or at least some of the right leaning politicians have not. Individually the states are not united in this way at all. At least you can't be imprisoned for being openly gay here though. It's a country in flux. At least those of us who support the rights of the LGBTQ community speak out against injustice. Which is more than what I can say for you. 


""According to my logic man eating lunch with another man = gay."" Wow, if that's what you recieved from that message, your english needs a lot of work, regardless if it is your first language or your fiftieth.  I'm sure I could work a little harder to make it more understandable, but I am not accustomed to people missing the intent behind something that is said in english. Reading between the lines is a skill some native english speakers never master, so i'm not sure that it would make a difference in this case anyhow. I just don't know how else to put things. In English, literal case does not always contain retain meaning and context. You missed the point over and over again, so I'm certain that if we continue the conversation further, you will continue to IGNORE the point, because this time I've have made it abundantly clear how I feel about the topic, why I think you are wrong, and why I feel that way. (My English is also shit, I can't count the amount of mistakes and run-ons in this post.)


America may be faux freedom, and the butt of a world wide joke, but that doesn't really matter. The people can't make excuses for the government. America has done reprehensible things to most countries in the world. Proxy wars, intrusive intelligence gathering, unjust war, illegal wiretapping, war crimes and that list can go on and on. I'm am aware that america is essentially the most corrupt country the world has ever seen. At least people like myself actively try to change things, by supporting human rights and peacefully protesting and spreading the word. 

As an American, I can't do anything about where I was born, or what my government does in secret, or what corporation buys off which politician, but I have the power to reject greed, religious dogma, inhumane practices, peacfully. 

I hope you have a great life, This is my last communique with you. Unless you want to have some fun 1v1 on LoL (UID=ohjunkitswindy) I hope that you see that injustice differently as you age. Even one person can make a difference when it comes to equality, in any country around the world.

False,,False,soccer,t1_cilef87,hiphopwop,"&gt;That is not an MLS game; you suggested that US Soccer should respect the international schedule, but that MLS should not follow the international club standard schedule.

You don't have to play in the winter to not schedule games on international dates.

&gt;You do realize that by following your own suggestion, your US-Costa Rica snow bowl game would still have happened, yes?

Yes, I'm well aware of when the game took place and I even took you it was an early Spring game, but the fact that MLS is already pushing it with how early the season starts doesn't help your argument.

&gt;(Russian and German leagues have winter breaks to compensate for worse winter weather than the UK, and yet still adhere primarily to the international club schedule without problems).

Russia recently changed their schedule to please FIFA's love for Western Europe weather to get the 2018 World Cup. In terms of cost to the host country to win a World Cup bid that's not too much of a sacrifice since after 2018 they can change back to the Nordic/MLS schedule. 

&gt;In my estimation it would benefit the MLS, and subsequently the USMNT, if more international players were in the league (or leagues), rather than fewer. ""Steel on steel,"" and all that. If the MLS schedule were standardized to the major leagues around the world, it would likely have a better chance to synchronize loan deals and transfers of younger internationals. This would, in my estimation, increase competition in MLS, thus increasing the standard of play, and subsequently improving the development of US internationals.

MLS actually doesn't really have a problem getting foreign players to play in the league and actually caps the number of foreign roster spots. The key to getting better foreign players is being able to pay more money( which will come in time as the league grows) not being able to say, ""hey you'll be playing games at the same time as Chelsea does even if it's in the snow."" 

Leagues in the US, Japan, Brazil, Sweden, etc. set up their mid-season window to overlap the preseason in window as Spain, England, Netherlands, etc. and most manage to set their preseason windows to match the other's mid-season windows so that isn't really a problem. ( MLS could move their preseason window back a little to make it match better without moving the season to a different schedule.)

I was there with my rangers fan cousin who was talking a lot of shit. Pure excitement exploded out of CAA.

A few years later, in what would be the last devils victory at continental, Jamie Langenbrunner scoring on a breakaway in double overtime against the Sens. I was in 217, and flipped a shit when the puck went in. My dad was already screaming for a penalty shot... none needed.

First or second (I think second) season at the Rock, devils rangers regular season. We went up 5-0, rangers tied it at 5 and their fans were unbearable. We scored the next 3 and won a laugher, 8-5.

Kovalchuk's first game, that incredible 3 goal comeback in the  third period against the Leafs. I was in 230.

Kovalchuk's first goal, I'm 90% sure it was against the Predators. I was in my same seats, 230, and remember the fans throwing hats on the ice. 

First round against the Panthers a few years ago. My beautiful (and newly devils obsessed) girlfriend came to all four games with me in sunrise. For game 7, we sat 2nd row in the corner that Henrique scored. When Florida scored late in the third I was close to crying. When the Devils scored, I was bawling.

Obviously, the Henrique goal. Funny story, I was in Europe for a school trip. In rome, the games started at 3
2:30 in the morning or something crazy like that. Of course, I didn't miss a game. When Henrique scored, I was in a hotel lobby with a TV that had ESPN America on, and I would not and did not stop screaming at the top of my lungs. The next day it felt like I was walking on clouds.

&gt;___Cuscuta___ (__dodder__) is a genus of about 100–170 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) [parasitic plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_plant). Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the [morning glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_glory) family, [Convolvulaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolvulaceae), on the basis of the work of the [Angiosperm Phylogeny Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group).  The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe).

False,,False,AskHistorians,t1_cilfg8i,TectonicWafer,"&gt; Besides... woman or not, if you were poor, you likely had to work, which cuts out a lot of luxury garments like corsets.

I really want to strongly agree with this.  I took a fashion history course n undergrad; it looked a clothing fashions in the approximately 1550-1950 era (with a focus on 1750-1900), as a window in to ideas about class and gender roles).   One of the themes that the instructor really pounded hard on was that a great many of our ideas about 18th and 19th century women's fashion were really just upper-class pathologies that had no relevance to the daily lives of the majority of the population.  Especially from the mid-18th century onward, popularity of Hogarth-style prints and the rise of a ""middle class sensibility"" meant that there was a constant effort by sub-elite women to both ape the styles of their social betters, but also to keep the fashions practical enough for someone who still had to do some form of domestic labor -- they worked *alongside* their servants.  These types of clothing, while not nearly as well documented as the ""haught corture"" styles, are much more representative of what ordinary people wore, or at least aspired to wear.  The increasingly redicuous styles of the 19th century (big hoop skirts, corsets, etc) were in many ways an elite reaction to the fact the increasing numbers of middle class women were able to afford clothing styles and materials that had previously been accessible only the elite (taffeta, bright colors, silks, etc).  As a result, upper class women in both England and France resorted to increasingly impractical garments as a way of telegraphing their social status and an attempt at reinforcing their place in the social hierarchy at a time when the old social and political structures were constantly being challenged by the massive economic, social, and political changes going on.  The constant and frequent fashion changes of Paris in some ways reflect the political turbulence of 19th-century France.

This ties in with another of my instructor's main bugabears: Anglophone scholars who do 19th century cultural studies focus entirely too much on developments in England (""they still call it 'victorian' -- so ethnocentric"").  While England may have been the foremost economic and political power of the time, Paris was still the major cultural center that all the European-descended peoples of the world tried to imitate, not London, at least before 1871.  The Francophila of the Russian aristocracy is a good illustration of this.",0,,0,,,t1_cil8sxi,1434492306,True,0,8,t5_2ssp3,8,cilfg8i,1404184731,t3_29gzd2

&gt;It is estimated that—at the beginning of European settle-
ment—in 1630 the area of forest land that would become
the United States was 423 million hectares or about 46
percent of the total land area. By 1907, the area of forest
land had declined to an estimated 307 million hectares or
34 percent of the total land area. Forest area has been rel-
atively stable since 1907. In 1997, 302 million hectares—
or 33 percent of the total land area of the United States—
was in forest land. Today’s forest land area amounts to
about 70 percent of the area that was forested in 1630.
Since 1630, about 120 million hectares of forest land
have been converted to other uses—mainly agricultural.
More than 75 percent of the net conversion to other uses
occurred in the 19th century.

German and Dutch had changes at the same rate, though the shift did not go as far. Look at changes in English morphology from 800-1300 (it mostly disappeared). English used to have a system of noun-endings that would make a Latin-speaker hesitate. In the same time-span, this almost entirely disappeared, with just traces in pronouns (he, him, his). In a few thousand years, Proto-indo-european (the ancestor language of English, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and more) ""dw"" sound became ""erk"" in Armenian. Crazy shit happens in linguistic change.

We have all these interesting changes and patterns in English to look at, *only* because of English's extensive written history. Almost literally, all languages have gone through such dramatic changes, if not in sounds, then in word-formation or sentence structure.

False,,False,IAmA,t1_cilgxk5,JohnnyBoy11,"Here's my take on indulgences. Martin Luther claimed the Church was buying and selling salvation. But Church Doctrine says indulgences is only for the remission of temporal punishment that had already been forgiven. Only God, not the Church, is the judge of souls. 

Not that there weren't abuses in the medieval period. At one point, the Pope, the highest ranking Bishop of the Church, had to address the issue of people misusing, misinterpreting, and sometimes forging indulgences. Europe was a scandalous place. It doesn't surprise me there were sketchy people back then, as there are now. 

And even if there are a few thing's you're iffy with, what about the big picture? Even a pretty girl might have a couple moles that are distracting but that shouldn't blind you from the truth. Was the Church of Rome not established by the Apostles Peter and Paul as Jesus commissioned His apostles? Did not Peter himself appoint Bishops? Were not the early Church Fathers Holy men? And don't their work and writings support the Catholic Church? The answer to all those questions is an astounding YES! 

On the other hand, Luther told King Phillip to secretly marry another wife and practice polygamy. When this secret was found out, Luther then told the King to 'tell a good, strong lie' and deny the allegations. We now know the truth about the matter. I personally would not trust that man's theology or the church he founded with my salvation, or any of the other church/denomination derivatives based on Luther's views.

I think the difference may stem from the fact that American soccer fans are super cognizant of the hurdles that need to be faced before soccer is seen as an American sport as well. It's the 5th most popular sport here, I don't think that's true of many other countries, if any. Some examples of these hurdles are increasing the legitimacy of CONCACAF, expanding the MLS while maintaining a solid pool of talent, taking Mexico's title as the premier CONCACAF team, etc, etc, etc.

It's actually surprising to see so many people see the CONCACAF solidarity posts from American fans as some form of circlerjerky shit posts devoid of any serious motivation behind them other than some sort of simplistic ""us vs them"" mentality. It's really not. It's a self motivated attempt at increasing this sport's legitimacy in the US as well as CONCACAF's perception abroad, which helps legitimacy within the US as well.

As this sport takes further hold here, the legitimacy of CONCACAF will become an ever more serious concern among US fans, as we're kind of ""stuck"" in this federation (for lack of a better term/phrase). 

**TL,DR** It's interesting to see American fans interest in CONCACAF's strength, which IMO is a serious concern and a demonstration of an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the sport and its nuances among Americans, be portrayed as some kind of moronic shit posting. It occurs because American fans are coming to understand just how far CONCACAF has to go in relation to more prestigious federations, and it makes perfect sense to not ever see Europeans or South Americans care about their percieved strength.

European Sunscreens tend to offer some of the best UVA and UVB protection around. Some kind soul has made life a little bit easier for the rest of us by listing out different options:

Basically cover up, wear sunscreen with good UVA and UVB protection (most people say at least 30 is fine, just remember that it's a log relationship between SPF and protection so the higher you go the less protection you're actually adding on so anything above 50 is generally a wash, although my mom's radiologist told her that whatever the highest SPF we can find she needs to use but I digress) AND reapply it after swimming or sweating and/or every 90 minutes. Make sure she puts on sunscreen every day, even if she's not going to be spending that much time outside doing different activities.

False,,False,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,t1_cilhjpa,GeorgeDouglasMcFly,"I think the thing about African art--at least from pre-modern eras--is that it's not directly approachable from a strict Western study idea. The styles are so different from what the eye is trained to see and analyze in those fields that it can feel almost overwhelmingly foreign. I think the only reason I really gained an appreciation of it is because the African Wing at the Met used to be the quietest place in New York. I used to hide there when I needed peace in high school.

I wrote my thesis on Keith Haring, mostly tying that into American subcultures of the 1980s. My arguments eventually diverted into talking about drug culture, the AIDS epidemic, New Wave, and subway vandalism, which I guess sums up what I really look for in art. The way it's presented means as much to me as the messages that were around it, the extratextual meanings that were either planned or imposed upon it. My favorite piece of art is [""I Saw the Figure Five in Gold"" by Charles Demuth](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/49.59.1), which at first glance is a big five. But then you can look into the poem from which it drew inspiration, the relationship between artist and poet, the sound and sensation that Demuth was trying to drag out of the canvas and into the mind of the viewer. The longer you look at it and the more you study it the more the meaning is revealed; in fact, there's more meaning if you're a careful and cautious viewer.

Okay, I can talk too much about art. But if I'm narrowing it down, I focus on the East Coast artists of the 20th century, as fascinated by Jasper Johns as I am by Andy Warhol or Willem De Kooning. I was a cinema theory major, so a lot of what I love to look at is the interplay between various forms of art, whether it's music and tapestry in Medieval Europe or film and pop art in Current America.

Some guy came up to us and asked if we could watch his bag for 15 minutes (didn't know at the time that that was a big no-no). He takes *way* longer than 15 minutes. We start to worry because we need to catch up with our group and it's going on 45 min-hour since he left us with his bag.

Finally the guy comes back and he starts talking about his job--he's a photographer for some sports magazine or shoe company or something. His current project is that they're making an add for a shoe, but their ""unique concept"" is that they're going to make the picture of the shoe by creating a collage out of pictures of other people's feet (the way he said it we thought the feet would still be in a shoe).

We politely decline and say we need to get with the group but he keeps insisting it will be quick and he keeps asking us to help him out. Finally we agree because he won't stop asking. He tells us to follow him. We follow him all around the airport until he finds some dead end hall way and he tells us that's the spot. He takes us to the end of it and asks one of the guys to take off his shoe, that's where we started to get weirded out. Our friend is told to sit down and stretch his leg out with his foot upright. The guy proceeds to lay on the ground and start snapping a bunch of photos. Then my friend is standing up, and facing the wall with his his hands against the wall, he then has his heel raised so he's on his toes and the guy gets more pictures.

Finally, a security guard notices and tells us to clear out. At that point we said we really had to go and then we left. At this point we fully expect our friend's feet to be all over European foot fetish magazines.

I think an important thing to remember is that every place has its own set of problems, they are just of different nature.

I grew up in Czech Republic and moved away when I was 19. My parents, my brother, my high school friends all still live there. My mum is not Czech, but she's been living there for around 30 years now.

There are certain things that may be quite challenging for a foreigner. Compared to Americans, Czechs tend to be overly negative and cynical; English proficiency even among young people isn't as high as one would expect; the bureaucracy is mind-boggling, and corruption levels are some of the highest in Europe. People also generally have trouble finding work these days unless you have some pretty good connections; that's something I keep hearing from a lot of my family and friends, some of whom are forced to live with parents even with a masters degree. I frankly have no idea how the job market is for foreigners these days (the foreigners I do know had been living in the country for 10+ years now), but be aware that you will have to start learning Czech because it's very hard to function in the country without it.

I think that overall, it's not a bad place to live. The salaries are low compared to western Europe, so you might not be able to travel Europe in style if that's something you dream about, but they are enough to live well in the Czech Republic. The Czech way is to backpack around with a tent, which can be really fun if you make some friends and go as a group. :)

Then shit went down between the Catholics and the new Protestant faiths, and the entirety of central Europe was consumed by religious war. This war lasted A LOT longer than anyone anticipated, and a few years in, many lords found their coffers empty, and were no longer able to pay their mercenary armies. These armies, bearing no loyalty whatsoever to these lords, or even the country they were in, promptly turned on their former employers and went rogue. For years, even after the war finally ended there were roving bands of thousands of mercs turned bandits that burned hundreds of cities and castles and killed god knows how many people. 

At the end of the 30 Years War, Germany was a burned out shell, 11,000,000 people were dead, over 3,000 towns, cities, and castles had been destroyed, and it had become the deadliest, most destructed conflict in European history until World War One.

Western America - Caesar's palace in Las Vegas, large and easy to identify. Plus, it will probably be around for a really long time. Long enough to set up another point in that region if necessary.

Eastern America - Monticello (Thomas Jefferson's House), it shouldn't be too far of a trek from many densely populated areas in Eastern America, plus it is rather old and would make the perfect haunted house for anyone that would like to stay there for awhile, but don't mess with the president's stuff, there's too much history there to be a dick about it.

Canada - Okay, I'm not really familiar with Canadian landmarks, but somewhere in the vicinity of Toronto sounds pretty good to me, since it's probably not a trek from most of the population of Canada. 

Mexico and Central America - Maybe the Mayan Pyramids? Seems like the perfect place for a meeting of ghosts. It's spiritual and would probably be pretty easy to get to the top of a designated pyramid to meet.

South America - Macchu Picchu is the only landmark that I can think of to host a gathering. I am taking suggestions for better landmarks.

Europe - Since there is not a lot of ground to transverse, I think that one large meeting ground would suffice, this is why I think that the Eiffel Tower would be best suited as a meeting ground for Europe.

UK - Since we're ghosts and potentially floating, we should meet in the face of Big Ben. On the off chance that we can't fly, we should meet around the entrance of Big Ben.

Northern Africa - I think that the *Left Paw* of the Sphinx would be a pretty good meeting place, just to be as specific as possible, since there probably aren't going to be too many people coming to this internet meet up from Egypt. 

Southern Africa - (I actually had to look up a landmark for this one) Heroes Acre, there will probably be tons of ghosts already wondering around this area, so we can get them in on the club as well. Their spirits will probably be pretty down as well...so this will be a really nice break from all of the general morbidness of their existence. 

China - I think that the Great Wall would be a good meeting place. It spans pretty far, so I think that the furthest west...chunk in Gansu would be a good meeting place for the Western China inhabitants, while Eastern areas around Beijing would work well for Eastern Ghosts.

[Here](http://www.chinatourmap.com/great_wall/images/great_wall_map.jpg) is a reference map of China and the Great Wall.

Southern Asia - The Taj Mahal is pretty well known and while I understand that India is kinda polluted in most parts and that might not be where you want to hang out after death, but this is a good meeting place nonetheless. 

Japan - The Tokyo Tower stands out as a pretty good meeting place for Japan, easy to distinguish and a nice visit for any ghosts.

False,,False,AskHistorians,t1_cilig4o,AsiaExpert,"That katanas were renown for their light weight, grace and finesse compared to extremely heavy, unwieldy, club like European swords. Or that the katana was of much greater quality because of the uniquely Japanese technique of folding the metal to eliminate impurities. 

Across most of history, the weight of swords has been pretty much the same, whether it's a sword used in the Crusades, a katana, or a cavalry saber. And this weight is pretty much universally all fall within 0.5~2kg. Even massive swords that were known for their size and weight generally did not weigh much more than 2.5~3kg, and indeed 3kg for a sword would have been considered heavy indeed by nearly all fighting men. Katana are not exceptions to this. 

Katana in general were not spectacularly known for their quality. In fact, they were usually seen as a sidearm at best and considered mostly useless in a true battle. Samurai would often be certain to bring multiple spears to a battle but a katana would have been a mere after thought, more of a symbol of status than a weapon. 

And while there are some katana that were forged with great skill and craftsmanship (like every other sword), cheap, workable and certainly sometimes shoddy katana were forged as well. 

They would have been made with the exact same techniques as the masterclass katana but would have suffered from various things, like an unskilled smith, poor ore quality (this was an endemic problem for Japanese smiths), complications during forging, faster production sacrificing quality, etc.  

A sword was not somehow magically stronger by virtue of it being a katana. And the metal folding technique is not uniquely Japanese as other cultures and people have used the technique, though it's arguable that the Japanese come to discover the technique independently.  

Also, that Japanese samurai armor was significantly more flexible or lighter than seemingly clumsy and overbearing European metal armor. Japanese armor was, much like the swords, pretty much comparable to contemporary European swords in weight and flexibility. 

As time went on, European armor only got better, and even plate armor was never as inflexible as many people imagine it to be, because that would be counterproductive for a soldier who's goal is to move around and bloody murder other people who could move.

This sentence manages to be wrong in four different ways.

First, the [Treaty of Brest-Litovsk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk) was enormously ambitious. It was breathtaking, really. It ceded a *quarter* of the population of Russia, *nine-tenths* of its coal output, and perhaps a third of the agricultural output of the Russian Empire. Germany took possession of Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia and Ukraine, and Russia renounced its claims to Finland and its territories in Eastern Turkey. They conquered so much territory they had to allocate a *million* soldiers simply to occupy it. 

Second, Napoleon didn't plan on conquering that much. The [French invasion of Russia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia) was primarily designed to force the Tsar to stop trading with Britain, and was part of a broad economic campaign to pressure the British to accept peace. If he had any territorial ambitions at all, they would have been to cede additional territory to the Grand Duchy of Warsaw to recreate Poland as a French client state.

Third, the first phase of Hitler's [Generalplan Ost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost) wasn't much more ambitious than Brest-Litovsk. It was bound by the same limiting factor: Germany simply didn't have the manpower or infrastructure to occupy any more territory at one time. Of course, he intended to continue expanding into the East at some later date, maybe a few decades down the line, but once the Allies were broken, that could be done at Germany's leisure. In World War II, Hitler's plan was more-or-less a do-over for WWI.

&gt;the regime that followed turned out to be way more powerful than anyone expected

Fourth: Not really. In 1914, Russia was the dominant power in Eastern Europe, and had been for centuries, given its size, its natural resources, and its population. It was only ""held back,"" so to speak, by lagging industrialization, poor organization, and a backwards political system. A Russian Revolution promising industrialization, centralization, and world-wide ideological expansionism was a frightening prospect for Europe. 

How frightening? Here's how frightening: Britain (plus Canada and Australia), France, Japan, Estonia, China, Greece, Poland, the United States, Serbia, Romania, Italy, China, and (at an earlier point) Germany *all* sent in military forces to put down the revolution, even though Europe had just spent four years bleeding itself white.

False,,1404193971,AskHistorians,t1_cilio6y,Quartz-N-Quarks,"There are many reasons. Many African Americans didn't move west because of employment and work. Even today the majority of African Americans still live in the South, about 55%. Only around 8% of African Americans reside in the West today. In 1910 90% of African Americans resided in the South. The only significant populations of African Americans outside of the South were in the North mostly in urban areas. The North was very economically and industrially developed and populated. 

One of the reasons they remained in the South is Sharecropping. This system of farming had already existed in the South which used both poor white farmers and freed blacks prior to the Civil War. Afterwards, when the freed slaves were allowed to own property and land, many entered this system. This system isn't slavery but it certainly was no real improvement and bears resemblance to feudal agriculture even. Blacks to support their families entered into the system where they would practice subsistence agriculture and part of the harvest would be given to the landowner. While landowners would provide things to the sharecroppers, they would sometimes charge exorbitant prices. Often the working conditions were poor as well. Many blacks remained poor and stuck in this systems for many years.

Assuming they are not stuck in sharecropping leaving the South was difficult after the war as the U.S. government with military backing was restrictive on the South, black and white, to prevent insurrection and rebellion. The Southern States took time to be readmitted to the union.

Assuming they can leave they would need the money to go west. Going west wasn't something anybody just did it was a major decision and families in the east risked everything going west. It still cost a good deal of money to go west. The financial burden would have also kept many African Americans from going west.

If they they had the money to move, why go west? What will they do there? As previously mentioned it was a big risk to go west as reliable employment was not to be found out west. Meanwhile the North was economically booming and they would have a far better chance of finding employment there. There were fewer population centers in the West and none as populous as in the North.

Even then, not as many went North. Many African Americans would not be able to afford the move out of the South and were stuck in sharecropping. While more employment could be found in the North thy would have had competition. Millions of immigrants from Europe were arriving such as the Germans(around 20% of Americans have German ancestry), Irish(15%), and Italians(5%). I skipped many other European ethnicities that also came over.

By 1900 there were few significant communities of African Americans outside of the South. Far fewer after taking out the North. So while as you said cowboys of other races probably and most likely did exist, based on demographics I would predict there would be few though. In the West the larger minority would probably be Asians of various descents though mostly Chinese. Though later exclusion acts slowed immigration. Hispanics is a tricky thing to discuss as they weren't counted in the census until the past few ones. Hispanics are also not a race. They are part of culture influenced by Spain and Spanish colonization. They could be of any race. That being said the majority of Hispanics in the U.S. identify as white. After that would be people of mixed descent though mainly mixed European and native descent.

African American migration out of the South was best seen in what was known as the Great Migration during the mid 20th century where many moved to urban centers around the U.S.

When the war stalled, they became mouths to feed, so they starved and shot them. When the war created labor shortages in German factories, they shipped laborers back to Germany to work since all the Germans were busy dying in Russia/Ukraine/Belarus.

* Japan does not have a cultural history of whaling, where as some of these other countries do (e.g. the Inuit in Canada are permitted to hunt whales because it is a traditional part of their culture and diet). Japan's diet does not traditional contain much, if any whale, and many people don't like it. As a result a lot of the meat ends up as filler, or ""mystery meat"", or sold in school lunches. Others have questioned the cultural aspects of whaling in some European countries that these practices only really became established in the late 1800's and early 1900's when whaling technology improved. That being said, some countries like Norway have a recorded history of whaling as far back as the 8th century.

* Other countries are hunting species of whales that are either not endangered or more tightly regulated than the Japanese, such as the [minke whale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minke_whale#Whaling).

* While the Japanese are whaling under the guise of ""scientific research"" very little has been published or advanced in the way of our knowledge of whales. There is a moratorium on whaling since the 1980's put in place by the [IWC](http://iwc.int/home) but certain exceptions are made for scientific and cultural purposes. Everyone know Japan is lying about the scientific aspects of their research and that they are illegally whaling for meat that is intended for sale at market.

* Countries like Iceland don't have many alternative industries - they don't have a lot of good land for farming, and only a few hardy domestic animals can be kept there like the Icelandic horse.

1. I was not restricted from coffee and caffeinated soda, but I was restricted from alcohol. I know that the two are seen as sufficiently different ,but my european upbringing included religions that saw no wrongs in non-drunken alcohol consumption. So, I thought it strange that my parents would bring me to such a church that preached this after experiencing what was accepted under my family's european church. 

2. I could not date Mormons. I know! It is strange but there are churches out there that desire to be mutually exclusive as well. I left because I believed that my eventual ""soul mate"" was either mormon or secular. It turns out that my wife (who I love more than I could ever imagine loving somebody) is a ""secular humanist"". What that means is that she is without religion, but WITH extremely strong moral convictions on the manner in which people should treat each other. In many respects I would consider her secular philosophy more religious than I have ever been, though raised through a church. In contrast her family hiked on Sundays her whole life. 

3. My grandmother is sure that my lack of religion will produce my soul's demise. I am not without faith. I am without religion. I am without a structure. 

4. My church asked for all of my free time for (1) mentoring the youth younger than myself; (2) feeding the homeless under various highway overpasses; (3) participating in various church upkeep services; (4) volunteering for 6 weeks at a time at rural summer camps; and (5) conducting prayer meetings at my own high school. Beyond that, the church offered support in times of hardship. When my family went bankrupt, they would not help me financially. Keep in mind that all I was asking was support to head to Africa to serve on a mission trip. 

The most heartbreaking experience was perhaps my own grappling with what God expects of me. Does God expect me to adhere to a set of bright-line rules; i.e. ""thou shalt not/thou shall."" Or, does God expect me to treat every being I meet with love? 

I left when the person I was supposed to be mentoring hanged himself. It was extremely distressing. I asked myself: If the love God has taught me cannot prevent my protege and friend from doing this, what are the deficiencies of the philosophy that is being taught to me? Is this religion/denomination the be-all/end-all? Are there better ways? Do those ways necessitate a religion in order to be full of love? Do those ways necessitate a religion in order to enact social change?

Then they will cite this ruling and say ""SCOTUS has ruled it is fine for us to get rid of employees who disrespect our beliefs."" 

I think about what other countries have done when battling Islamic exceptions to the law such as in Turkey or Europe. They've become very successful in the courts at attacking abortion and contraception. As well as the entitlement to discriminate in the workplace against gays, Christians, Jews, and atheists.

The law is the law if you start making exceptions based on religious beliefs then you are opening the floodgates for a lot of different opportunities for religious people to be privileged and excepted from following the rules.

Think about the different religions and how they can use this in different ways. Some don't believe in Western medicine. Others don't believe in psychiatric treatment. This ruling can have huge consequences.

One guy made a joking comment about ""head scarf as part of the uniform"" but in many grocery stores in Turkey it's becoming a standard to have headscarved women as the only type of clerks. Some may say that this ""can't happen in the US."" But it absolutely can because Turkey was way more secular of a country than the US.

I mean think about the implications to criminal law. You could then impede all sorts of police investigations by claiming that religious grounds make you unable to attend something, or give out your DNA, or unable to provide evidence etc.  These rulings can have ripple effects of unintended consequences and as a lawyer I'm already reading a ton of documents about this ruling because it is very relevant to my job.

Some of you may be skeptical and that's understandable. However, having lived in Europe and seen the effects of Islamists on a legal system. Having lived in the Middle East and seen the effects of moderate Islam turn quickly into Islamism which turns quickly into extremism and terror. I can definitely say it is very much the ultimate goal for Islamists and it's not something you should underestimate just because here in the United States it is very uncommon to see. The inclination and tendency for such skepticism is due to our distance and lack of exposure from seeing such things on a daily basis.

Here's **some quotes from the dissenting Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg**:

&gt;""Would the exemption…extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah's Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations[?]…Not much help there for the lower courts bound by today's decision.""

&gt;""Approving some religious claims while deeming others unworthy of accommodation could be 'perceived as favoring one religion over another,' the very 'risk the [Constitution's] Establishment Clause was designed to preclude.""

&gt;ProtonMail is a new email service that is developed by a team of scientists working at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. Our goal is simple: we want to protect people around the world from the mass surveillance that is currently being perpetrated by governments and corporations around the world.

From their blog entry, above:

When we pressed the PayPal representative on the phone for further details, he questioned whether ProtonMail is legal and if we have government approval to encrypt emails. We are not sure which government PayPal is referring to, but even the 4th Amendment of the US constitution guarantees… 

And, most importantly, they add,

&gt;As a result, we have disabled PayPal as a payment option on our campaign page, but it is **still** possible contribute with credit card and Bitcoin.

You said it's a lot like Spanish. It's nothing like it. A lot of those 40% Spanish loan words already have different meaning in Tagalog and Bisaya.

Look at my Bisaya phrase above. Notice the word ""sturya"", I believe it comes from the Spanish word ""historia."" In bisaya, it means ""talk, to talk"", in Spanish it basically means ""history"". 

You're saying that Tagalog is a lot like Spanish because it contains a lot Spanish words. No it does. Spanish and Portuguese is mutually intelligible, meaning even though one does know the other language, one can actually understand a great deal of it. Why? Because the syntax, grammar and lexicon are very very similar. Just take a look at the how Porto and Spanish count numbers. 

Porto 1-10: Zero, Um (pronounce un), Dois, Tres, Quatro, Cinco, Seis, Sete, Oito, Nove, Dez
Spanish 1-10: Zero, Un, Dos, Tres, Cuatro, Cinco, Seis, Siete, Ocho, Nueve, Diez
Tagalog : isa, dalawa, tatlo, apat, lima, anim, pito, walo, siyam, sampu
Bisaya : isa, duha, tulo, upat, lima, unom, pito, walo, siyam, pulo

Basically the languages are so further apart. Porto and Spanish are similar because they both belong to the group Indo-European, Romance Languages while Bisaya and Tagalog belong to the family Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian.

I don't really want to seem boastful but you seem to have limited knowledge on Languages. The reason why I am very firm on this, is because I don't BELIEVE this, I KNOW this. I am a polyglot and I have a great interest in Linguistics even before you showed up with your wikipedia article.

On the 40% stuff you posted. English is also composed of various loan words. Not just from latin but from saxon, celtic, french and germanic loan words. Even before modern English, English is already a mixed language. It is interesting to note that English is actually a Germanic language and it's closest relative are Frisian. It has several loan words from other languages but it does hide the fact that it is Germanic to the core. Ask the Germans, Icelanders, Swedes, Danes, Dutch and Norwegians... Do you find English easy to learn, and they will answer yes, because they are similarly Germanic in origin. Ask Spaniards, French, Italians, Portos, and Romanians the same question and they will not have the same answer. ",0,,0,,,t1_cil5q9j,1435484727,True,0,1,t5_2qh0u,1,ciljdyz,1404196344,t3_261x1l

- Why did you roll 7% IAS on your Shard of Hate? Reroll that for dmg% or CC/CDR
- Gamble your bloodshards for gloves and boots to replace those rares
- Craft a new Aughilds helmet for socket + CC/CDR

But being snarky aside, let me try and break down (most of)the other Transformers fiction for you so you can decide where to jump in:
(PLEASE NOTE that this won't be in perfect chronological order and I'll definitely miss shit)

Transformers Generation One Cartoon: This is what started it all. Classic 2D animation, the beginnings of most of the characters you now know. 'G1 continuity' has been rebooted and reworked often, but the show holds up pretty well for an 80s kid cartoon. The last season is not so good, but there are actually some rather good episodes scattered around.

G1 Movie: The original animated movie. Excellent. The origin of the whole 'Unicron' thing, as well as a host of characters that fans have taken many years to finally accept. It still holds up after damn near 30 years, which is saying a lot. DEFINITELY make time for this.

Note: There is some Japanese G1 stuff that didn't release in America, along with multiple other Japanese cartoons vaguely based on the G1 universe. People seem divided on how they feel about 'em.


Generation 1 Comics: This is split into two parts. There was an original run of 80 issues(plus some spin offs like 'headmasters' and a GI Joe crossover) and then much more recently, they did issues #81-#100 and called it 'ReGeneration One'. These are based on G1, but tell a different(and deeper) story than the cartoon. The art and writing style honestly don't hold up terribly well, but they were neat. 
Note: There was a British G1 comic as well that sort of included the American comic but also had a bunch of other crazy stuff going on.

Generation One Toys: Honestly most G1 toys aren't exactly pinnacles of engineering, but they sure as hell have a distinctive look. Some really stand out as awesome, and there's a lot of variety as newer waves came out(headmasters, powermasters, micromasters, pretenders, etc etc etc etc). Obviously, most of them are now rare and pricey - but keep an eye out. I'd recommend waiting until you have a good handle on what characters and such you like best, then hunting G1 figures based on that.


Generation Two Comics: Once all the G1 stuff went away for a while, the TV show started rerunning on TV along with a new toyline and a new comic. The comic was the pinnacle of 90s ""EXTREME!!!1"" and was supposed to pick up where #80 of the original comics left off. It's since been dismissed as no longer canon, but remains a crazy little story. They even recently did a Masterpiece version of Sideswipe from the G2 comic, in which he's black instead of red and all heavy-metal'd out. It's also the origin of the 'Jhiaxus' character, who they've been re-inserting into other stories since.
Note: The G2 comic technically got it's start in the GI Joe comic at the time in a big crossover event.

Generation 2 Toys: Most of Generation 2's toys were old 80s G1 molds casted in new EXTREME 90S colorations, sometimes with new weapons or sound-boxes included. The Dinobots, Optimus Prime, and a bunch of Autobot cars and Decepticon jets got rereleased in this period - as well as a couple of the combiner teams. Eventually, original new molds started popping up as well, including new gimmicks like rotor-spinning guys, guys with light up swords, guys with air-powered missiles, guys who'd color change under warm water, etc. This line also gave us the beloved 'Big Green Tank' version of Megatron and the 'Laser Sword Optimus'.

Beast Wars Cartoon: The American Beast Wars cartoon had great CG for the time that doessssn't quite hold up now, but it's still a good show. It was very divisive among fans, spawning tons of ""TRUCK NOT MONKEY"" arguments - but people slowly came around when it was revealed to actually be a technical part of the ORIGINAL G1 continuity. As the show goes on, they tie it very ingeniously to the original 80s cartoon story - including cameos by beloved major characters from the G1 world. Highly recommended.
Note: There were a couple Japanese Beast Wars offshoots shot in 2D animation. Spawned a lot of neat toys and stories, and I'm not familiar enough with them to recommend or not.

Beast Wars Comic: This actually came out well after Beast Wars, and it's short. It's okay, I guess.

Beast Wars Toys: These were great. While some fell prey to 'Shellforming', which is when a robot winds up just wearing his alt-mode like a big turtle shell on his back, they were almost all super poseable, had great gimmicks, cool transformations, and a lot of variety in style and size. Transformers toys until this point had mostly been bricks with arms that went up and down, so the Beast Wars toys were great. Between the tons of American ones and tons of Japanese-based Beast Wars toys, there's a lot out there. Finding loose ones shouldn't cost you much and I highly recommend the line.

Beast Machines: Beast Machines was the immediate followup to Beast Wars. It's...weird. Real weird. CG of a higher quality than Beast Wars(mostly), a more complicated plot, mostly new-ish characters. Not too long, not particularly cared for by most fans. I'd skip it.

Beast Machines Toys: Despite a lackluster show, there were some great toys in here. It brought the term 'Vehicon' to us, and was the first appearance of Transformers turning into vehicles for many years. Some of the toys were kinda silly, like a housecat-sized Cheetor, but many of the Vehicon figures were real gems.

Machine Wars: Machine Wars was a way to take a bunch of European toys America hadn't seen during G1 and repackage them for America. Some are neat, some not so much. Most heavy collectors prefer the original versions, obviously. It led to odd things like a tiny little Optimus Prime and a Starscream three times the size of Megatron, since they just slapped more-popular names on what had been random other figures.

Robots in Disguise cartoon: A very very very anime-style 2D cartoon, it was hailed as a grand return to the (sort of) G1 world. Weird.

Robots in Disguise Toys: RiD was a weird show for various reasons, including that it took characters/molds from all over the Transformers universe and just sorta threw 'em all together. However, some of the molds are SPECTACULAR and still highly sought-after today. Optimus Prime and Megatron/Galvatron from this line are phenomenal figures, and there's a lot of other winners in there as well. Not terribly pricey, either. Give 'em a look.

DW Comics: A comic company called DW picked up the Transformers license at one point and went bonkers with it. They had a distinctive art style I can only call 'blocky', rebooted the G1 continuity, and started working at telling stories from the beginning of the great war - as well as other spinoffs like 'Micromasters'. At the time people were thrilled to have the original G1 characters back and this brought in a bunch of new fans, but most people look back on this stuff poorly now.

Armada Cartoon: Armada was the beginning of the 'Unicron trilogy' of cartoon series'. It was 2D and had a G1-ish style, but was a completely new story. While characters like Optimus and Megatron and Starscream(sort of) stayed true to form, most other characters were new - and often had the names of G1 characters despite being very different guys. It wasn't bad, got better as it went on.

Armada Toys: Armada toys introduced us to 'Minicons': real little Transformers who could plug into the bigger figures, sometimes unlocking various features. It was a neat gimmick, giving you tons of little bonus figures that either came with the bigger guys or could be bought in separate teams. Armada also gave us the first toy of Unicron, a really well-done version of him that was also pretty damn big. The toys were overall hit-and-miss.

Energon Cartoon: Energon followed Armada story-wise; it was 2D and got kinda anime-style. Most fans aren't really that into it.

Energon Toys: Energon brought back combiners, which was a popular decision. They also tried a gimmick in which the Autobots could all sort of combine with each other in various inevitably ugly-as-sin pairings. Optimus had a sort-of Voltron-team thing going on, as he had little drone vehicles he could join up with to get real big and ugly. The Decepticons had these big translucent-plastic 'energon weapons' that could sort of combine and become giant unwieldy messes. There's some good stuff in there.

Cybertron Cartoon: Cybertron followed Energon and ended the Unicron trilogy. It was, unlike the other two, CG-style. The cartoon is generally frowned upon by most for being bad. 

Cybertron Toys: Cybertron gave us some decent toys. The main gimmick were 'planet keys' which were little plastic keys you could jam into various slots to unlock weapons/features. We also got a big ol; ""Primus"" figure out of it.

Armada/Energon/Cybertron Comics: These things were a mess. I didn't even read through them all. Who knows what the hell was going on, but they tried to do some kinda dimension-cross-thing and import G1 characters to liven it up at one point.

Transformers Animated Show: Animated was divisive but I think most fans came around. Flashy 2D anime style, new story with heavy G1 themes, characters were true to their original themes but sometimes in new roles(i.e. Optimus not being in charge of all the Autobots, just a small team). Good stuff.

False,,1404198963,investing,t1_ciljx4h,HPCer,"From working with international equities, the US has it really easy (Canada's really not bad either).  Things are centralized over one currency.  When you start looking at Europe and Asia, you have different currencies, exchanges, clearing firms, as well a myriad of different laws and regulations (and that doesn't even include unionized ones like MiFID in Europe - similar to Reg NMS in US).

US has a fairly well-organized system for clearing house through the DTCC while many international (relative to the US) have a variety of central counterparties to choose from.  This doesn't sound like much, but these choices along with the limited regulation (not to mention almost no real consolidated data feeds) makes brokerage systems a headache to attach to international exchanges.

Without going into too much detail into US/European/Asian market micro-structure, the easiest way to explain it is the US is one country with a set of regulations and a centralized clearing through Fedwire/DTCC.  Europe and Asian both have a variety of clearing houses to choose from as well as different laws from different countries with a fairly immature (at least in my opinion) regulation system throughout.  The US system, while not simple, is a piece of cake to program up compared to Europe/Asian when the system is already created for the US.  This doesn't even include any taxation laws and of the like.  Also, there have been talk about MiFID II coming out, which may cause issues for smaller US companies like RobinHood to expand out.

If anyone reads this and notices I made any mistakes/missed anything, let me know!

Edit:  Missed your second question: if anyone has attempted to program an app like RobinHood, they're probably going to have a lot of issues.  The main one regarding foreign equity (stocks).  Programming the app might be tough, but it's certainly very possible.  The issues will come with all the laws and regulations of foreign countries.  Currency conversion and clearing houses (again mentioned from above) will become another major issue for a small company looking to start up.  There's likely a massive amount of requirements to connecting to foreign exchanges (I'm not familiar with this point yet).",0,,0,,,t3_29j50k,1435484978,True,0,2,t5_2qhhq,2,ciljx4h,1404198548,t3_29j50k

False,,False,japan,t1_cilkb0b,typesoshee,"&gt;Being able to come to the defense of friends/allies is not the same as endorsing aggressive war. It is a step towards being able to realistically participate in non-aggressive actions that help to preserve international peace.

I think there is legitimate fear over interpretations of what are ""non-aggressive actions"" and what ""preserves international peace.""  For most people, if Japan did limited logistic and supply work for US forces in the middle east it may not be considered non-aggressive.  For fundamentalists, this alone may cause them to add Japan to their list of enemies.  Once they attack a Japanese camp, Japan may then feel the need to enter more forces on the US side, etc.  Some people on TV (I forget what show) were commenting on how Japan drew the line between helping US forces on Middle East land versus being limited to on the sea (refueling ships).  The guy said that the refusal to land on the Middle East enabled Japan to not be marked as an enemy by fundamentalists, even if they did do things on the sea to help the US.  Same thing with what ""preserves international peace.""  Does the War in Afghanistan preserve international peace?  TL;DR Interpretations may vary.  



&gt;If Japan brings itself into line with global norms on constitutional interpretations of defense, it does not mean that Japan is seeking to participate in wars of aggression.

But it does mean that the rest of East Asia is seeking to ramp up tensions with Japan.  Japan has a few options - sit back and take it, beef up its military as a response, or ask the US to make sure that the rest of East Asia doesn't get too cocky.  Article 9 enables them to depend on the third option.  In a strict sense, Japan allowing itself collective self-defense shouldn't affect how it deals with China since it should only affect how it deals with threats to its (Japan's) allies, i.e. the US.  But with Abe at the helm, it's inevitable to see it as a whittling down of the staunch non-military spirit of Article 9.  If you can't rely on the US for defense, the only realistic alternative is to beef up your own military.  The result is a cold war between Japan and China, basically.

&gt;It just means that Japan, if asked to contribute combat troops for a questionable American war, will no longer be able to hide behind its constitution. It will have to do what America's other Allies do all the time: come up with other reasons not to participate in the war.

I admit I'm not that well-read on the intricacies of US-Japan relations, but I think it's true that the US-Japan relationship is NOT a relationship among equals or 50-50 allies, and Japan is much more keenly aware of this - or at least Japanese people are much more keenly aware of this than Americans.  US allies like Canada and Western Europe probably feel much more equal and ""50-50"" across the negotiating table with the US.  Japan, with its post-war history, stance, and existence and relationship/reliance on US military bases, is not like that with the US.  It seems as though if the US says, ""Hey, Japan, you need to help us with our war in the middle east.  If not, we want concessions, like more military bases on Okinawa, or blah blah,"" Japan should just be able to reply, ""No, your war in the middle east doesn't qualify for our notion/interpretation of collective self-defense, so we aren't helping you there.  You don't get more bases in Okinawa either.  Thanks.""  Like you said, replies given by a normal country, global norms, like any other US ally.  Again, I'm not qualified to give a comprehensive answer, but there is real apprehension on the Japanese side to dealing with the US in this manner.  It could be a fear that the US will completely abandon Japan and form strong ties with China, thus leaving Japan ""exposed"" to more Chinese bullying (and thus a need to seriously beef up defenses, which may lead to the scary reality of a cold war with China).  Or just the loss of a reliable trading power and ally in the US that Japan has had for the last 6 decades.  Or even that the post-war generation (which includes Abe, born in 1954) is simply not that afraid of future conflict with the rest of East Asia and that in the future, the nationalism and passion of the right-wing unchecked may overwhelm the left.  Again, I'm not qualified to give a really good answer, but the fact is that this seemingly unbalanced relationship has served Japan very well since the end of WWII, and an unraveling of it is seen and felt by some Japanese to be a very fraught and unknowing road.",0,,0,,,t1_cild3f2,1434494517,True,0,3,t5_2qh2u,3,cilkb0b,1404200307,t3_29gg96

He writes: ""The Welshman left his hunting; the Scot his fellowship with lice; the Dane his drinking party; the Norwegian his raw fish.""

I don't know about English stereotypes of the Scot and the Welsh, but Danes are still known for their drinking and, at least in the Nordic countries, Norwegians are still known for an indulgent consumption of fish. What's more striking is the barbarization of the northmen, a stereotype I don't think has any presence in the modern world outside of nostalgic history.

False,,False,DotA2,t1_cilkqq7,Zeruvi,"The meta is constantly changing over time and location. Eastern teams favour certain heroes over Western teams, for example, Doom has been a #1 pick in China for several months, which Europe/US are now starting to pick first. Also each tournament develops its own mini-meta, because one team will see that another team is favouring a certain few heroes and play around them, or a team will pick a random hero and then everybody starts picking/banning it - like Brewmaster at the SEA/China TI4 qualifiers. Playing around the meta at the time/place is a key thing for a team.

As a dedicated DotA viewer of the top tiers (and the lower tiers of SEA/Europe) of teams/tournaments I just barely keep up with what heroes are in and out - especially in the latest patch where it seems almost everything is viable. If a pro team doesn't watch a ton of their fellow competitors, they fall behind and it really shows in their drafts, and slightly less so in their play.

In Brazil where I assume the Dota scene is a lot quieter, your players probably have the time to do this research themselves (though I highly recommend it is done as a team, not individually, as some top teams do) - get them to watch their fellow competitors matches, and see what the top teams in the world are doing/picking to give them an edge. To give you a scope of time commitment, outside of a full time job I do almost nothing except watch Dota, and I JUST keep up with the Europe, China, and SEA Tier1/Tier2 teams.

In a more hectic schedule you absolutely should hire a coach or analyst to keep tabs on all dota going on in the world, and suggesting strategies, picks and plays to the team accordingly - even looking to lower competitors - for example a fairly low tier Australian team recently brought out the ""offlane faceless void"" which has become a number one pick in China and is moving to the West. 

I'm nowhere near good enough to coach, even if my schedule allowed it, but I've watched ~1400 hours of dota over the past 6-8 months (not including streams, which are more than half), so if you want a just above ground baseline insight onto how various teams in various scenes are drafting and laning at the current time I'm happy to throw informed opinions your way.

Some questions about TS and XCOM:

1) For TS, how did you decide which historical events would go into the game and get their own cards, and which ones to cut? I imagine linking the card mechanics to the actual events was fairly challenging.

1a) What is your preferred method for remembering to move the action round marker? This is the bit of upkeep I *always* forget.

2) For XCOM, which design elements from Enemy Within did you have a specific hand in bringing to the table? I understand that you were 'lead designer' but that role is somewhat nebulous.

2a) For many players including myself, the best part of XCOM is the emergent narrative that stems from the randomized nature of the gameplay. Yet a lot of effort seems to have gone into scripted missions such as the ending, the base assault(s), the various council missions, etc.

During development, did these two goals seem at odds with each other? What is your personal take on which is the 'better' XCOM?

2b) XCOM on all difficulty levels suffers from a somewhat inverted power curve, in that the early game is significantly more difficult than the late game. While I appreciate that balance tuning is a significant nightmare especially with 4 difficulty levels to cater to, are you satisfied with how the progression curve was in the shipped product? Was this curve intentional?

2c) Have you managed to try the Long War mod?

The city centre at the moment is having a massive revival: a lot of the ville-basse has been demolished and they're building a massive shopping centre/open plaza. 

Worth knowing that Charleroi centre is practically two towns, the Ville-Basse (older part, more run down, being made better again) and the Ville-Haut (More modern, grid streets, etc). There are pedestrian shopping streets connecting them. There's also a shopping centre called Ville 2 which has everything you'll need, it's walkable from the city centre but also on the premetro. 

You should also know that Gosselies is actually a town of its own that's been absorbed into the entity of Charleroi. Charleroi town centre isn't actually that big, but they brought a lot of surrounding commune's into Charleroi to make it more of a city. Gosslies still has that nice village feeling IMO.

Public transport is great. Or at least compared to where I come from. The [TEC](http://infotec.be) runs it all and it's cheap and quite widespread. The network consists of the premetro: trams in metro infrastructure around city centre and some places, tram elsewhere. A central loop with 3 antennas (and one antenna that was built but never opened). Gosselies is on line 3 and it's very regular. There's also a dense bus network. There's integrated ticketing between all of these. For example you buy a ticket that lasts 1h and you can change as much as you want. 

Getting out of the town is really easy. The SNCB gets a lot of bad press because of the strikes and delays but if you're not traveling on peak you won't really get any. There are IC trains to Brussels and Antwerp every half an hour, an IC to Namur-Liège every hour, and an IC to Mons-Lille (France) very hour. There are also plenty of IR and L trains to take you to nice places around the region. Very well priced as well.

In terms of things to do I've never run out of them. I might make a list of day trips up for you but the best thing is that you don't really need a car for a lot of stuff. If you like exercise you'll be near the Canal which is quite nice, and there's a network of greenways called RAVeL which has a website somewhere with a map. These are along old railway lines, canals etc. There's a really nice park on M1/M2 at Morgnies. 

Lack of French is the only thing that might get in your way I think, depending where you are. Is it the airport you'd be working at? Maybe try starting Duolingo in French to get the pleasantries down. 

There are comments about Charleroi being Detroit but really, it's not that bad. It's not the prettiest place but services and things to do are plentiful. That's about it, it's quite unremarkable. I think you'll really like your trip, remember it's only 5 months. You won't be shot or stabbed etc, and it's going to be a great experience to leave the US for a bit and live in Europe.

Sa va prezint o situatie intalnita intr-o clinica dintr-o retea privata de sanatate al carui nume nu il dam.

Eu bucurestean - prietena din provincie, ea neavand medic de familie in Buc si fiindu-i prea lene sa stea la cozi prin policlinici de stat, am arondat-o la Regina Maria (ups, scuze, sunt scumbag, stiu) unde am inscris-o la un medic de familie. Dupa vreo 2 ani de cand am arondat-o, a avut si ea pt prima data nevoie de un concediu medical, pentru ca suferise o interventie chirurgicala dentara din cauza careia nu s-a putut duce la serviciu. 

Ne-am deplasat la medicul de familie din reteaua privata de sanatate nr 1 din Romania, unde am fost informati ca medicul de familie de acolo nu poate elibera concedii medicale pentru ca:
1. Nu orice medic din reteaua privata de sanatate are dreptul de a elibera concedii medicale, doar anumiti medici pot face acest lucru.
2. Initial a dorit sa ne trimita la un alt medic de familie din retea care avea acest ""drept"", dar din pacate pentru prietena, nu s-a dus la un stomatolog din cadrul retelei, astfel ca doamna medic s-a razgandit si a conchis ca trebuie sa mearga la medicul de familie de care apartine ea (gen in alt oras).

Nu ne-am mai obosit sa cautam un alt medic de familie in cadrul RM, cei din call centerul lor au confirmat partial explicatiile doamnei doctor, completand cu faptul ca oricum nu ne putem duce la un alt doctor de familie de la ei pentru ca nu mai exista locuri libere la nici unul (nu poti sa mergi spontan daca ai nevoie  ""medic de familie"", daca ai nevoie doar de un medic generalist pt consultatii, e alta discutie), pentru a o inscrie la medicul meu de fam dura cam 30 de zile pentru ca birocratie, asa ca a dat-o la pace cu Managerul ei foarte intelegator fara sa mai aduca nici o adeverinta.

It is not legally necessary for there to be a referendum. It's just considered to be a significant enough decision that the people deserve the chance the make their will very clearly and quantitatively known. The outcome of the referendum would not be legally binding on  the government either, as it's essentially just a very official opinion poll. Though of course, the government would abide by it.

The irony of UKIP being so successful in the EU elections is that, in a purely practical sense, it's utterly pointless for them to be there. They cannot achieve anything towards their aims from the EU, the decision must be made in the UK. Winning seats in the EU is literally just a PR exercise for them. No doubt it has been successful though, and may now translate into some seats in the national government at the next election. In terms of *why* they are more successful, it's two-fold. 1 - Proportional representation makes it easier for smaller parties to get seats. That;s why they managed to get their foot in the door over the previous few elections. 2 - Because the average person has no idea whatsoever what our European politicians do, and don't really see it as having an effect on their lives. Therefore they are happier to make protest votes. Also, combined with the proportional representation thing, they are more likely to vote for who they want, rather than in national elections where they vote for who is least worst out of people *likely* to win.

It's called a Private Members Bill.  Not all laws however are legal if they are contrary to a signed treaty.

Technically it shouldn't be necessary to wait for a referendum, the government of the day or a private member in opposition could propose a bill to enact Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which signifies a two year negotiation period and the intention to leave the EU.  Added to that UKIP doesn't currently have a private member to propose such a bill.  Plenty of pro-Exit MPs, but the bill is going to go nowhere without a clear display of public support so seismic is the level of change. 

European elections are grouped into large regions and run on a proportional representation voting system.   General Elections are broken down into smaller constituencies and run on a First Past The Post system i.e. no prize for second place.

There has been some discussion as to whether the EU would legally be obliged to recognise a UK referendum on an exit, but the real answer is it is irrelevant.  It's whether the UK government at the time recognises it and acts on it.  The result isn't necessarily binding (and conspicuously the government hasn't said that they would consider it to be binding if the answer came back Yes), but if the government decides to invoke Article 50 *then* the EU are obliged to pay attention.

Following that, I was clearing up the posters misconception of why the UK was seen as small fry to EU trade (represents a tiny portion of EUs trade), compare to the other way around where the EU represented a large portion of UK trade. 

I fail to see how any of this can construe me as being in the 'pro-EU camp' when I'm relaying the facts on the ground to someone that's deluding themselves over the level of power the UK will have in negotiations. My only contention was that they wouldn't get a deal as good as Switzerland.

False,,False,explainlikeimfive,t1_cilllmx,BadDoggie,"A Virtual Private Network is basically a way to make a Public Network (i.e. the Internet) behave like a Private Network (like a normal office or home).  To make it secure the data is usually (though not necessarily) encrypted.

As an example - if you configured it at home (on your Internet Router or computer), and enabled and configured it on your iPhone, then you could send data to your home network over the Verizon Cellular network without anyone being able to intercept it.  

Where it gets really useful is the fact that the traffic will go through the VPN before it goes onto the internet, and thus will appear to originate at the other end of the VPN, not where you are.  This is good for: 

1. Accessing Location-locked content online.  For example in the US you can watch episodes of NBC shows on their website, but you can't do that from Europe.  If you set up the above, you could watch it on a German WiFi network on you phone, via your VPN (the site would see the traffic coming from your home).
2. Bypassing Censorship filters.  Many countries, like China and North Korea, censor the internet traffic so that people can't see what the outside world says about their governments^*.  This can bypass the censorship systems.
3. Protecting your privacy. By signing up to use a VPN product online, your home traffic appears to originate in another country.. maybe somewhere with more lenient copyright controls or something.  This makes it harder for people (including law enforcement) to track you down on the web.  Of course, in some cases, this will cause the opposite effect to part 1 - you might not be able to view some content, or web pages might appear in Russian when you try to view them!

While there is a dissemination of biological material, recent DNA testing shows that it's not as prevalent as people like to think. Instead, a minority ruling class sets the tone for the new social norm and the locals adapt to it, creating a blend of the two that, at the time, favors the dominating class but eventually morphs into its own unique culture over the many centuries that follow.

**Option 1**

Nice ways to do it, is say post an interesting news article in /r/European then post the same article in say /r/worldnews and in the title after the headline write in parentheses (x-post /r/european). If the article has been submitted already find a new one. We don't want to spam or ruin other subs.

So to summarise. If you find an interesting news story post it first in /r/european then in any other relevant sub with (x-post /r/european) in the title. Like this one: http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/29i3vq/european_commission_steps_in_to_help_bulgarian/

**Option 2**

Find interesting and popular threads in related subs and engage in the discussion like normal. As part of your comment suggest /r/european. As part of your comment Example: This is a really interesting topic, if you like talking european issues I'd recommend /r/european.

**Option 3**

If you see someone posting an interesting link or text post in another sub you can just write a comment to is saying: I'm sure /r/european would like this post as well.

**Important**

Absolutely no spamming the promotions need to be relevant. Respect the moderators of each sub. If they tell you that it's not ok etc. don't do it. Most subs are completely ok with it, but if you stumble upon one that isn't respect them. Do not do it too much all the time, people will get annoyed. Be relevant and be nice when promoting :)

I'd also suggest this one, it goes to great detail on how to make a sub grow, which we want /r/european to do :)

&gt; Current Black Culture is toxic to society at large.

Define ""Black Culture"". You seem to think it's the ""thug"" stereotype that is actually common across all ethnicities in the US. Eminem would probably count as a ""thug"" in your book.

&gt; Also, the media (particularly CNN and it's ilk) refuse to report Black on White crime as vigorously as they do the opposite.

Obviously you never watched COPS, which pretty famously shows quite a bit of that. Oh and by the way, [despite your preconceived notions, it actually isn't all that common for ""black-on-white"" to occur.](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homicides-fall-to-lowest-rate-in-four-decades-133967273.html)

&gt; I cannot stand the double standards. Social Justice Warriors piss me off even more, because they are more or less idiots who spout bullshit based on what's popular at this moment.

I cannot stand people that use Social Justice Warrior in a non ironic way. Regardless, this stuff doesn't come from ""what's popular at the moment"" it comes from conclusions that are researched and made and then peer-reviewed by sociologists. There is no double standard. 

&gt;Slavery is another contentious issue that a vast majority of people know nothing about. Every time you bring up anything against a person who happens to be Black, people accuse of being Racist and someone will bring up slavery.

I have yet to a black person that refers to slavery as the cause of all their problems. I also have yet to meet anyone that equates racism with slavery. Furthermore, you are bringing up a phenomenon thaf exists only in the wildest of the imaginations of ""racial realists"". Black people aren't idiots. 

&gt; Less than 1% of White Americans owned slaves and the first damn slave owner in the country was Black. 

Oh Jesus H. Fucking Christ this shit again? [It's pretty fucking hard to be the first slave owner in America when you were captured by slavers yourself.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_(colonist)/) Furthermore, the slave trade was already well underway when Anthony Johnson came to the party, but don't let the facts hit you in the ass.

&gt; Not to mention, Black Africans were the ones who sold slaves in the first place. It's a practice that still takes place in countries like Mauritania. 

PS, kinda hard to avoid that when the ""civilized"" Europeans were the consumers of the trade, and that the African raiding parties came only after the Europeans had established themselves fairly firmly in the slave trade. 

And actually, the slavery in Mauritania is still racialized, in that dark skinned *haratins* serve the lighter skinned Moors that enslave them. Good job lumping all Africans into one monolithic ethnic group, despite the fact that they have more distinct ethnic populations than any other place on earth.

Look at it like this, as it is right now, the most likely scenario is at quarter finals you will have 3 koreans teams, 3 chinese teams and 2 open spots where the contenders will be EU, SEA, NA and the korean-brazil hybrids

Playoffs might very well just turn into OGN Riot edition with koreans+chinese teams

Korea has never had an internationally event, and the korean fans loves a lot of the EU/NA players/teams like Froggen, CLG, TSM, Gambit etc. They want to see them play and possibly meet them, but that has most likely been taken away from them and they just get to see another version of OGN",0,,0,,,t1_cil2vh8,1434495656,True,0,1,t5_2rfxx,1,cilluqp,1404209242,t3_29hed7

They were never German colonies the way we think about colonies in Anglo-British culture.  They were protectorates of the German Emperor, with a governor given authority by his office (delegating the authority to Bismarck), until 1919.  thence control of German East Africa was ceded to Britain and the Kingdom of Belgium, which is a German kingdom (that is, a kingdom of historically ethnic Germans, who spoke Dutch, which is a Flemmishisation of Deutsch) and eventually to the League of Nations with Belgium and Britain footing the administration of the areas.

The confusion comes from the fact that Belgium was a) taken over by Nazi Germany and b) Belgians are primarily Germans ethnically, German historically, but were not enveloped by the German state when the major German principalities were absorbed into ""Germany.""

After the war, Burundi, Rwanda and Tangyanika were still titularly Belgian colonies since someone needs to own everything, but the adminstration was beholden to UN mandate as a new world political order was falling into place - primarily, if we didn't allow Germany to take Lebensraum, how could Britain et. al., justify colonialism they were engaged in?  The first answer was: because, like, we won, man.  The second answer was: can't do that.  Hence the creation of the current countries.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that the territories currently called Rwanda, Burundi, Tangyanika were NOT independent organized states as we understand them to have been from a Western lens.  The areas were a conglomeration of tribes, nations and peoples some of whom were sovereign, some suzerain to other African powers and some unincorporated but claimed by African powers.  The Sultan of Zanzibar claimed much of what would become German East Africa until Bismark pulled an Admiral Perry and sailed some warships to Dar Es Salaam.

The point is, Burundi, et. al. did not exist prior to colonization as they do today, but were created after WWII at the end of the UN mandate period by Belgian and other European diplomats trying to justify/white wash their Nazi-like land grabbing and colonialism in order to underscore how rightful it was for them to have won the war and been the prime architects of the world in which we currently live (when in fact they had done many Nazi-like actions, just to non-White people who could not then be included more or less in the definition of White).",0,,0,,,t3_29jt7u,1434495668,True,0,6,t5_2qh1p,6,cillvqc,1404209409,t3_29jt7u

That surely depends. I'm from Europe and I don't see this antique mindset here. It's more that women are shunned here if they decide to stay at home and be a housewife. Btw, nobody here would use the word ""Partiarchy"" with a straight face. It's a exclusively american thing, and it's due to your strange form of feminism that we now have to discuss the meaning of this word.

""Patriarchy"" means 'the rule of the father', it's a societal form where the father practically *owns* both the woman and the children and has absolute power over their affairs. It stems from ancient greece, where women basically didn't leave the house (much like in islamic states today). That's the meaning of the word. Now this whole feminism movement has tried to reframe this word, but why should we prefer their definition over the original one?

A society where women can become head of state, CEO's, lead their own lives without a man and have the same rights, that's by definition not a patriarchy.

False,,False,smashbros,t1_cilm166,OMGitsDSypl,"Here's my 2 cents on how spoilers can be dealt with:

1. Spoiler posts are tagged as NSFW so the images are hidden and those with RES can filter out the NSFW posts while on the subreddit. The only conflict imaginable is that any posts that are actually NSFW might be considered a spoiler, but those are extremely rare here.

2. There is a heavily enforced no-spoiler-in-title rule that disallows... well anything related to the spoiler being in the title.

3. The text ""[SPOILER]"" is tagged in the post, although that would be debatable if it's not on this subreddit. 

4. There could be a megathread or even a subreddit devoted entirely to the spoiler content of smash 4. This allows for people to react to spoilers as well as being able to create posts related to the content and the people that actually want to see the spoiler content will get to see it. 

5. Create a time window in which spoilers are not allowed to be posted, but once the duration is up, they are allowed on the subreddit. I'd say 2 weeks to a month is enough time that people would play the game and get most content. The big issue though is that the time would have to be based on the date that the last country receives the game. So it wouldn't be 2-4 weeks after the Japanese release of the DS game. If Japan gets the 3DS game in 9/13/14 but Europe or Australia gets the Wii U game in April 2015 (hypothetically), the duration of the time window would be set from the date of release on that date. 

Now the absolute important thing is that spoilers should be defined and addressed appropriately as everyone always has a differing view on what a spoiler is supposed to be. In my opinion, a spoiler would be just about anything that wasn't officially announced about Super Smash Bros 4 before the release of the game. For example, (hypothetically) if Isaac is a character in Smash 4 but isn't announced officially before the game's release in any country, it's a spoiler. If Paper Mario wasn't announced before Japan but was before America, it's still a spoiler. This goes for Characters, Stages, Assist Trophies, and everything else would require good judgement.

Had Britain been able to afford to hold onto the Empire, it would have. The only thing that let India achieve independence was its finally becoming too much trouble to sustain.

I agree with everything you say here.  But it could all equally apply to Scotland within the UK today.

Necessary maybe isn't the best word.  But certainly it was pretty inevitable.  If it wasn't Britain it would have been another power.

The second is that big multinational states, Empires whatever you want to call them aren't necessary in the modern world.  Trade is being globalised.  And for defence we have Nato and the general buddy-buddy system.  (Democratic countries stick up for their own.)

We're not sanctioning Russia because we don't care about Ukraine enough to take the hit. It's their sphere of influence and not in the EU or NATO so we don't care.

The reason why I'm saying MAD works even though you think no one would push the button is because there is enough of a risk that it will happen, if you push it too farm the difficulty is countries not knowing at what point they will cross the line, so they generally don't get close to the line.

There’s a guy in Boston going around ticklin’ people! Gross, right! We thought so. So we dug up this cold case from the bygone era of 2014 and solved the hell out of it. You’re welcome Boston.

* CASE 2 : JOHN TITOR TIME TRAVELER

John Titor – future man – the most important time traveler since Marty McFly, first showed up on forums in the early 2000′s looking for some old ass modem or something. He foretold of a disastrous civil war that would ultimately destroy the United States. You’re a little late, nerd! The civil war happened already!

* CASE 3 : DANCING MANIA

Do you ever feel the urge to dance? You might be killing yourself / all your friends by retroactively summoning dancing mania into your town or community. This fun little plague decimated medieval Europe, killing hundreds of would be medieval b-boys. Cute

For every 4 combined casts of either revealing strike or sinister strike, you insight will go in a cycle, from 0% extra damage&gt;10%&gt;20%&gt;30%, the 30% damage increase is a buff called deep insight. If you are sitting on 20% extra damage and have some cooldowns up, it is a good idea to wait out the extra 5 seconds until you jump to max damage buff, for the best effects.

You want a 2.6 attack speed weapon in your main hand (Seismic Bore is the best main hand weapon for combat rogues) and the off hand weapon comes down to what you have available to you, take any rogue weapon, but make sure it is your best one. I don't feel like I've missed any of the basics, if you have any more questions then message me on reddit or add my btag Jayjar#2647(EU) and I'll be happy to answer more questions and I feel this is more longwinded than it needs to be.

Edit: QoL killing spree note. Forgot to mention in the wall above, right before you use killing spree, you want to dump ALL of your energy, it doesn't matter what on. You could be spamming revealing strike for all I know but that's better than nothing. The energy will reach 100% every time you killing spree so you're essentially wasting 100 energy if you don't spend it

Edit 2: You asked about where to get weapons, obviously the best way is to run LFR, but if you're stuck on a REALLY bad weapon, you can get [this BoA dagger](http://www.wowhead.com/item=86519) which has a minimum level requirement of 86, there are many bind on account weapons around pandaria, you just need to know where to look and it's a good boost, you could go get one on a 90 now and mail it to your rogue before it hits 90 so you have at least 1 decent weapon standing by.",0,,0,horde-rogue,,t1_cilmxy7,1434496526,True,0,5,t5_2qio8,5,ciln5rr,1404216322,t3_29k054

Treaties do not have direct legal effect in the UK, they require an Act of Parliament to implement them. One cannot rely on a treaty alone in front of a court.

The UK could sign (and ratify) a treaty that said all British citizens had to wear a blue armband at all times, but nobody could enforce that without it being transposed into UK law.

Of course, the UK itself could see repercussions in international law for failure to live up to its treaty obligations, but that's something completely different.

&gt;It remains that a High Court judge has noted that the UK opted out of something and Luxembourg opted us back in! Leaving the EU meaning repealing the 1972 act.

Well, not quite. The court has said that the protocol doesn't do what we thought it did. In that case, we didn't really opt-out at all, so we can't be opted back in.

It may be semantics, but that's pretty much what courts are supposed to do - interpret the law before them. if the interpretation is not one we can live with (and, personally, I'm OK with being bound by the ECFR but it's not up to me) then we should change the law to make it say exactly what we want it to say.",0,,0,,Pirate Party UK,t1_ciln3c6,1434496554,True,0,6,t5_2qhcv,6,cilnac0,1404216858,t3_29jq38

http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infinite

Boundless, endless, without end or limits; innumerable.

Now since the obvious situation where this is relevant is in a teamfight where Kass will be chasing Tristana and Trist will be trying to avoid Kassadin, for the given time frame, Kassadin effectively has unlimited uses of Riftwalk compared to Trist's limited uses of Rocket Jump. Is this too difficult a concept to understand for you?

&gt;because saying it how you did gives a stronger presence to your point of Tristana being a trash pick in LCS.

&gt;*Terrible pick against a Kassadin in general*, oh you have 2 repositions? Too bad Kass has infinite blinks. 

No because it gives a stronger presence to Tristana being a trash pick against Kassadin. Do you not understand how context works? Unfortunate that your reading comprehension doesn't keep up with your vocabulary.

&gt;I'm sorry you don't understand how a thread works

No, I'm pretty sure the only one who doesn't understand here is you. Reddit uses branching threads; if this was a open bbs system I would need to reply to all responders in one post, but it isn't. I reply to others' arguments in their threads, I reply to your argument in your thread, see how that works? Nowhere did you dispute Doublelift being a poor theorycrafter, or Trist's inability to freeze lane, nor did you dispute Lucian being a better pick due to a more responsive and quickly activated escape ability. The only point you chose to dispute was whether or not she's a good pick against Kassadin. I've still yet to see any real argument as to why she would be, other than pedantic laboring over word choice and using language to convey meaning. 

&gt;I'm making a response to everything you said from point A to point B... 

Clearly not.

&gt;You come on here and flame everyone who thinks Tristana is good

Lol, flame? You one of those oversensitive types who just discovered the internet? Did I miss where I insulted your mother or something? Is Trist your long lost sister who's honor I just besmirched? The only backing into a corner I see here is coming from your sad attempt at being a clever little grammar nazi with a flimsy attack on my username and the word infinite. Frankly, little better than the cretins that post 'relevant flair' jokes or look up people's igns if they choose to display them and try to attack their ranking as a form of debate. FYI, recursion is repeating self-similarity, as in fractals, so unless we're talking about a mirror match in a G5 of OGN, that angle doesn't hold water. And when that fell flat on its face, you tried to pretend you ever had any meaningful argument whatsoever about the rest of Tristana's kit/viability. Hint, you didn't. 

As for Trist's overall success, the end scoreline this week is 2-2 with 1 ban. She only won when in a composition with Yasuo. Is it really her presence that's the determining factor in these games, or is it her ult's synergy with Yasuo, who's widely regarded as an OP pick himself? For comparison, Lucian went 4-1 this week, and works well in nearly any composition. Also it bears repeating that no one in KR, EU, or CN (home of the world's best ADC players) is picking Trist.

Once you have bought your coins you should indeed **not** store them on a hosted webwallet or anything. Research cold storage or use a very secure computer (Linux is preferred above a Windows machine) to store your coins. Don't forget to backup. I would recommend buying an old laptop, put Ubuntu Linux on it and use it as a dedicated wallet for now.

To answer your question: Yes you can and should move the coins to your own wallet asap after you are done with trading. 

I recommend Electrum client because of the easy paper-seed recovery key.

Qualitative:

I have been doing a lot less board gaming this year than last, both in person and online.  I did, however, find a good board game group earlier this year that I have started playing with about one a month.  I have also been trying to develop a group to meet at my apartment.  That is going alright, although not quite as well as I would like.

Quantitative:

This year so far I have played 48 unique games (22 for the first time) a total of 118 times.  46 of these playthroughs were with my copy of a game and 72 were with someone else's.

These 118 playthroughs took a total of 126 hours, 51.5 of which were playing my copies of games and 66.5 were playing other people's copies.

The total number of player hours (hours I spent playing games + hours people spent playing games with me) so far for the year is 513.5.

My most played game of the year so far is the Castles of Burgundy, which I've played 15 times.  

My win rate for the year so far is 44% (37 of the 118 games this year were 2 player games, 81 had 3 or more players).

The mean number of players per game for me for this year has been 3.9.  

So far this year I have acquired the following games (in general order of receiving from earliest to latest, bolded games have not yet been played): 

* **Fortress America**
* Coup
* Eclipse: Ship Pack One Expansion
* Eldritch Horror
* **Firefly: The Game**

False,,False,japan,t1_cilo27r,paburon,"&gt;  if Japan did limited logistic and supply work for US forces in the middle east it may not be considered non-aggressive. For fundamentalists, this alone may cause them to add Japan to their list of enemies....Some people on TV (I forget what show) were commenting on how Japan drew the line between helping US forces on Middle East land versus being limited to on the sea (refueling ships). The guy said that the refusal to land on the Middle East enabled Japan to not be marked as an enemy by fundamentalists

Japan [landed troops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Iraq_Reconstruction_and_Support_Group) in the Middle East.  It sent a small force to one of the safer areas of Iraq.  It was also [airlifting supplies](http://www.mod.go.jp/e/jdf/no12/policy.html).



&gt;  sit back and take it, beef up its military as a response, or ask the US to make sure that the rest of East Asia doesn't get too cocky. Article 9 enables them to depend on the third option

Even if Japan militarizes, it still needs America as an ally if it wants to stand up to China.  The old interpretation of Article 9 has long been a source of discontent from America.  The re-interpretation will strengthen the Alliance.  It gives America more confidence in Japan as a partner.

&gt;  I think it's true that the US-Japan relationship is NOT a relationship among equals or 50-50 allies

No relationship in the world is completely equal.  

Canada and European nations are well aware of the fact that America is a superpower and they are not.

Of  course, it is easier for Europe and Canada to give America the cold shoulder because they are in safe neighborhoods.  Japan has two hostile militarized neighbors - China and North Korea - and an American presence in the area is vital to Japan's security.

&gt;  Japan, you need to help us with our war in the middle east. If not, we want concessions, like more military bases on Okinawa

Increasing the number of bases in Okinawa would gain little for America and probably cause a public backlash that the Japanese government doesn't want.  Japan's real fear is that America would threaten to reduce its bases and pull its forces out of Asia.  (At the moment, America still considers it within its own interests to have bases there, but as America declines in power, one wonders how long they can maintain a global network of bases)

Another American ally in the region - the Philippines - used to have a lot of American bases, but the base agreement [was not extended](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Naval_Base_Subic_Bay#Closure) after the Cold War.  Now that nation finds itself getting horribly pushed around by China, and probably regrets the closing of those American bases.

Japan will never be a full equal to America.  That's reality.  But without Article 9 holding it back, America will see it as more than just a non-actor that provides some land for bases.  Japan will have far more capability to help America, even if it is just in a regional conflict.  

Whether Japan would actually need to join controversial American wars to maintain its alliance with America is unknown, but the non-participation in the Iraq War hasn't prevented America from still being friends with most of the Allied nations that didn't sent troops there.

False,,False,leagueoflegends,t1_cilo3j6,radonthetyrant,"Just want to clear up a few misconceptions:

&gt;DotA2 barely has any other significant tournaments outside of the big one

For dota2 players, there are plenty big tournaments all around the world. Around 10 major events like esl, dreamhack, mlg, d2l, joindota, from bts studio, asian scene as well, etc. are enough to fill the year long gap between the international. Events like esl frankfurt which concluded this weekend were big enough to draw in a huge chunk of non-dota2-players as well. The 3rd party tournament scene already has grown enough for the players to be sustainable.

&gt;They've made the players gather up the money for it, while taking a huge cut of it for themselves

This is correct. Difference between valve and riot being, riot knows the esports side is a negative business for them, I would be really really surprised if they can make positive numbers with it. They use it as their promotion tool to sell skins and paywalled content like champions. Dota2 doesn't have paywalled content and don't want to loose money, so they take higher cuts from the crowdfunded money which is entirely okay.

&gt;Nothing out of the prize pool comes out of Valve's own pocket, it's all paid for by the players

Wrong, valve put up a base prizepool of $1,6mil, see here: http://dota2.cyborgmatt.com/prizetracker/international2014 The rest is community funded.

&gt;Then compare this to DotA and realize that in reality only the people who get to the top at one annual tournament will be able to do much with it, while LoL has 16 teams in EU and NA living off of the game

There are enough tournaments that dota is a viable option already. The LCS format has other issues, I wouldn't say it is entirely better because it's not. This all comes for the price of starving off the non-riot tournament scene.

&gt;Compendium for LoL. We'd probably get $50m for the prize pool easily

The compedium succeeded because you got something cool for the money. This wasn't all goodwill from the community. We got couriers, weather effects, gametypes, fantasy league, immortal items which are comparable to legendary skins, battle booster, ingame analysis tool and much more. Riot couldn't even provide a fraction of those features given their poor track record of implementing features and their limited cosmetic system.",0,,0,,,t1_cill149,1435484638,True,0,3,t5_2rfxx,3,cilo3j6,1404219893,t3_29jaw2

The vulnerabilities of the world single largest national economy and what is 1/5 of the entire world's GDP would be greatly magnified and put at risk, with definite ramifications to other economies.

The research excellence funded by the DoD that spurs on civil sectors in biotechnology and information technology and aviation technology in the US would be severely compromised, if again, not outright lost entirely. 

Global peace would greatly suffer with the dissolution (and it would be a dissolution) over a year of the monopolar hegemonic security umbrella the US provides.

National militaries like those of the Russian Federation and People's Republic of China would be able to do whatever they wanted without repercussion to their neighbors.

Those more akin to feuding middle eastern states/Iran/Israel would have little guarantee of intervention in aggression from another party, and the specter of the first actor being the successful one would invite war, with the added bonus of the IAEA being de-fanged as all civil nuclear development would now have no real means of having any recommendations of sanctions enforced (though largely financial, they are *enforced* with the threat of military action, and there would be exactly zero militaries capable of doing so)

The entirety of the US DoD's humanitarian missions from aid delivery and development, to intervention in natural disaster's would cease without any funds.


The recovery (because presumably this is one fiscal year) would be long and slower than one year, would take place in the face of greatly expanded local world powers, and would possibly have to be done during a period of global wartime that had broken out.


There are definitely avenues for intelligently reducing US Defense spending while not compromising security and humanitarian missions, but this is not it.

The slots on the server will be reduced to 70-75 since all these maps got originally designed for less players. We will run the following maplist:

Songhua Stalemate Retro (Intense infantry combat in the swamps) [USMC vs. PLA]

EJOD Desert Retro (The classic) [GER vs. MEC]

Qwai River Retro (Return of the Little Birds and TOW HMMWVVs + JDAM Support) [USMC vs. PLA]

I'm talking to you, not to google. 

&gt; GST stuff

GST disproportionately affects the rich. The rich spend a lot more than the poor. They spend less as a proportion of their income, but they spend a lot more absolutely, which is what is important. The rich also already spend a lot more on rates, a LOT more in income tax, etc. 

GST is not a tax on the poor, it's a tax on consumption. And it's necessary to tax consumption, very necessary. 

&gt;Why is it terrible that ACC shoulder the burden of proof for removing entitlements?

ACC is an insurance scheme, fundamentally. If you want to make an insurance claim, you need to prove that you have a valid claim. 

&gt;Industrial relations: it specifically states promote, not mandate. Although that is how things are run in Northern Europe. It usually works out better for people, as it's far more likely to be people competing for jobs rather than jobs competing for people.

In a functioning economy, there will be competition for people, not competition for jobs. That might be less true of unskilled labour, but that's just a good reason to get skilled. The solution to the issue is to create jobs, not to make things difficult for employers to create new jobs. People definitely need strong employment rights to avoid abusive employer-employee relationships (in both directions, but primarily to protect employees from abusive employers), but that has nothing to do with trying to increase the number of people in employment. The way to do that is to create jobs, directly or indirectly. 

&gt;I do notice that is a policy from the 2012 election though, it's not on their current policy list.

It's linked to from their current policy page.

&gt;Approval of mana whenua is a recognition of sovereignty that was guaranteed by the treaty. If you take the treaty seriously, then approval of mana whenua is just a logical step.

Sovereignty lies with Her Majesty the Queen. The treaty did not give Maori sovereignty. The treaty was poorly translated, but that does not mean that the Maori version of the treaty takes precedence. Both versions are equal in status. What the treaty guaranteed is a tricky subject, but there is absolutely no doubt that today sovereignty lies with the Crown. 

An old treaty is much less important than human rights. People have an absolute natural guaranteed human right to be free from discrimination based on their race. Some iwi do have customary title, but that is not actual title. Iwi do not and should not have any special right over the property of others, because iwi are defined purely based on race. 

Any party that supports Maori electorates, special Maori representation on local councils or special attention to Maori needs in any sphere of the law including property is a racist party, and any person that supports any of those things is a racist person.

I believe the problem with Islam not 'catching up with times' is that it has no hierarchy and no central authority.

False,,1404224663,AskHistorians,t1_cilojd6,CanadianHistorian,"In short, no.  Whereas (as far as I know) most of American Indian's history is one of aggressive American expansion westward.  They used military force in armed conflicts with the American Indians or cleared out areas for future settlement.

Canadian history is not as clearly aggressive as the American example.  In Canada, a series of treaties were signed with Indigenous peoples (though not all) that legally traded their land in exchange for certain rights or title. 

For the early colonial period (let's say 1608-1815), indigenous people at least had some power in their relationships with European colonizers.  They were integral in the fur trade network that extended across the entire North American continent.  I should emphasize that they were not passive participants in it, but rather were intelligent fully capable actors in the North American commercial system. They benefited from it as much as Europeans, though perhaps in different ways.

As colonial expansion continued, Canada's Indigenous peoples also began to understand the political dynamics of these newcomers.  They played French off the British, Dutch off the French, and eventually, Americans off the British.  Again, they were often involved in European wars, but not as ""Indian Allies"" but again as cogent and coherent political entities seeking to make a place in the changing political and economic environment of North America. Richard White famously argued that indigenous people occupied a ""Middle Ground"" between European powers.  I keep emphasizing their agency because most often histories relegate Canada indigenous peoples to some sort of side role in the unfolding drama of North America, if not a prop.

By the end of the War of 1812 though and the death of Tecumseh, Canadian Indigenous people were effectively ignored and/or irrelevant to colonial authorities.  Indigenous had been promised in 1763, after Britain conquered the French colony of New France (present day Quebec, stretching down into Ontario and technically through to Louisiana), that they would have an ""Indian Territory"" stretching through present day Ontario into the American midwest, where they could live without interference.  At the time, this seemed so far in to the interior of the continent that the British didn't care if they controlled it.  After the American Revolution, the power balance of the continent changed again.  Loyalists fleeing the triumphant rebels began settling Ontario and thousands of kilometres of land were legally (though perhaps not morally) traded from groups that few other options as thousands of immigrants poured in.  The War of 1812 ended in 1815 and the British-American tie meant that Britain had little desire to protect the Indigenous peoples as Americans pushed westward into their lands.

As British colonies spread west through the 19th century, first to British Columbia and then through the present-day Prairies but was then known as the Northwest Territories, two different ""solutions"" were found to Indigenous land ownership.  By and large, the most common was treaties.  In Canada there are a series of Numbered Treaties that represent a treaty signed with a group of Indigenous peoples for some large tract of land.  You can look up what they covered - but they were generally poorly communicated and quickly signed.  Often a group of men would trek through the wilderness, finding some ""Chief"" and after communicating little of the meaning and intent of the treaty, secure a ""signature"" from the tribe that handed over several hundred kilometres.  Another ""solution"" was that of British Columbia, where people just showed and started building.  To this day, the lack of treaties in BC means that technically large swaths of that province are still under Indigenous title not that of the Canadian government (because of a long story of legal decisions and constitutional issues).

So the Canadian Indigenous experience is less overtly violent, but there is a lot of systemic violence.  One example of overt violence was the 1885 Northwest Rebellion.  There, Louis Riel, an exiled rebel (another long story we will probably talk about in another post) returned to lead another rebellion against the Canadian government in Ottawa.  He rose up with Métis (descendants of Europeans and Indigenous people) and some Indigenous tribes to fight against federal powers and the loss of influence as new European settlers began spreading west.  

There are a few other examples as well, but for the most part Canadian history is more about.. let's call it, passive aggressive tactics.  The most famous being our Residential Schools, which operated for nearly a hundred years, and saw young Indigenous children put into schools where there were countless stories of physical and sexual abuse, poor treatment, malnutrition, and cultural genocide for lack of a better term.  They were told to forget their past, forget their culture and their language and become ""good"" Canadians.  The 20th century history of Indigenous people is up and down (mostly down) but I hope this at least gives you a general impression of how we have treated them: poorly, but we didn't declare outright war against like the United States did.",0,,0,northamerica,Canadian History,t1_cilo17x,1434497270,True,0,56,t5_2ssp3,56,cilojd6,1404221293,t3_29k4z2

The current military budgets of the US and other major nations is actually at historic lows.  

The single greatest boon to Japanese development was the Korean War.  Not many realize that 90% of Allied war material was produced in Japan for that war.  The American plant was already producing at three shift, wartime production, supporting our Cold War efforts, and rebuilding Europe.  It simply could not produce any more.  So the US poured in capital investment to produce the Korean War material right across the straights.  In effect, we rebooted the entire Japanese industrial plant only years after the World War.

For their part, the Japanese leaders saw their big chance in this, and acted in a very disciplined and methodical way.  They took every single cent of profit and reinvested it into further industrial plant.  They then supplied the American rebuilding of South Korea, and worked their way into being the supplier of our similar efforts in the Philippines and other Asian countries.  By the end of this process Japan was again on it's way to being a major industrial power.

Most important of all, the US maintained open sea-lanes for Japan free of charge, and enforced a world free trade system based on gold back dollars.  This was the second greatest factor in Japan's rebirth.  Finally, for over thirty years after that we tolerated a one way trade.  Japan penetrated our markets while locking out our products.  This was the price, the black mail America paid to sustain their support for us in the Cold War.

It is worth noting, that almost to the year that we no longer needed their support against Russia, the Japanese economic position collapsed.  And their deficit spending has been 200% of GDP ever since.

False,,False,Everton,t1_cilon0x,FRDUM_FOOF_SPETGH,"Call me cynical, but no.  I've ranted on the subject a few times on here, but the whole European football system is broken and only exists to benefit the top few clubs, which doesn't include us and won't for the foreseeable future.

The ultimate success of a club is dependent on money, that's just a fact unfortunately.  The richer clubs can all afford better players and in greater depth, and European football doesn't have the collective willpower or capability of imposing things like salary caps.  The gap can be reduced by good management (as we have had with Martinez and Moyes) but can't be closed completely.

Rich owners aside, the majority of these clubs' money comes from commercial sponsorships and TV rights.  The top teams get more of their matches aired on TV, [so get more in broadcasting payments](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-broadcasting-commercial-payments.html).  In addition to these extra payments, [their increased exposure and profile allows them to demand more from their sponsors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_sponsorship#Summary_of_shirt_sponsorship_deals).  The top 4 teams also qualify for the misnamed Champions' League, which gives them even more money (through increased TV money and sponsorship money that accompanies it) and even further exposure throughout the world.

Everton can make inroads by playing good football, holding onto our star power (Barkley &amp; Howard in particular), and challenging the top teams, but without greater exposure in the media we will never have the same appeal to foreign fans as the clubs which they consistently see and hear about.

I do not think that the quality of play (technical skills, strategy) is worse in league play. especially in the big european leagues the argument can be made that is actually better. this has to do with the fact that clubs can go looking for what they want and or need in a player and buy one that fits the bill. as much as i would like to have some of the other countries players (and not just neymar or messi) in my team, germany will have to make do with what we have.

What is significantly different though is the volume of games, and because of that, a lot of times the effort put into them.

Simply put to take an example from germany: Muller doesn't run wild like he does in the world cup for munich. It has to do with a lot of factors but the one i want to focus on is that he simply can't. Over the season he will get tired and or injured at some point. and then he'll stand on the pitch and jog around a bit and not resemble the player you were expecting. 

Also because playing a long season is tyring, entire teams might not take some opponents seriously and not try their absolute best against everybody. of as has happened this season (and is a disgrace but what can you do about it) the opposite and teams think they can't possibly beat their upcoming opponent and just try to get it over with without getting someone injured or cautioned.

That being said, soccer is awesome and even when I don't have ""a dog in the fight"" i will enjoy quality matches.

""Pro russians"" tried to press gang at gun point several mines into fighting for them, on a regular basis and i heard they started to use some of the artillery for localized strikes.

2°) Some of it was yanoukovitch (and his buddies) trying to destroy their value to rebuy the land a bit later for a symbolic UAH and re open them to pocket all the revenue stream. Basically, they're still worth a lot, and he tried to simply steal it all.

I have some theories as to why that could be. Probably our culture influencing our style of play. Football in South America is much more violent than in Europe, and our skilled players are smaller, weaker yet faster. See Neymar, Robinho and Lucas Moura for example. So they tend to preemptively dive to avoid getting hurt. Our equivalent of the Champions League, Copa Libertadores, is probably the dirtiest competition in the sport. If you look for its historic moments, you will not see many beautiful goals and great plays, you will see field battles and fights. Neymar, for example, won it at 19 years old being the team's main player and without any injuries. So he tries to avoid contact at all costs. His teammate at the time, Paulo Henrique Ganso, is not a player that tends to do that. And now he has been trying to recover from many injuries he suffered since he started. In a result to that style of play, we do not see diving as an obscenity as Europe does. Of course we don't like it, but it's just not the same reaction.

As far as ""dormant"" and ""resistant"" goes, you can have [Spell Resistance](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spellResistance.htm) for the latter - it just forces me to make a caster level check when casting spells on her. She can voluntarily lower her own spell resistance as a standard action for beneficial spells if she chooses. For dormant, it sounds more like absorbing. A personal-only [Energy Transformation Field](http://dndtools.eu/spells/spell-compendium--86/energy-transformation-field--4443/), perhaps, that only works on spells cast directly on you and only produces an energy blast effect when absorbing sufficient spells. Perhaps with the type of energy blasted dependent on the energy received, with force as the default. It would also render you unable to use magical items that require a trigger or command - passive items like belts would work, but not wands or anything that needs to be activated.

As far as who answers your call, go nuts. If you want to roll into Trask with a posse, it'll just be more to keep track of, but also more people I get to brutally murder without consequence. So you can decide who comes along and what their general power set and relation is.

And finally, as far as Elsa van Buren and her clan being related to you, I'm not sure if you've seen mention of the van Buren family curse? It makes all their blood relations aware of each other's danger, constantly, over any distance - as adventurers, it means they all have a cloud of doom over their heads at all times. It also spikes just before one of them is about to die, but never quite soon enough for the others to do anything about it. It's how I justified my ""oh crap my character died, good thing their sibling shows up a few minutes later"" swaps in character. As the last living van Buren (aside from her retired battle sorcerer brother), it probably won't come into effect in this fight, but it'd also mean if she was related to you, everyone involved would know.

False,,False,AskHistorians,t1_cilprlt,colevintage,"Perhaps if we go back far enough, but that likely requires going back to pre written history in some regions when weaving of fabric was begun. Interestingly enough the manner in which textile bases are spun and woven today makes them very short lived and weak compared to their earlier counterparts (and rougher). Linen, for example, has a 7-8 foot fiber. All of that length is used when hand spinning. Fewer breaks makes for a very strong thread. Today we chop it up into 2-3 inch fibers to be spun on a cotton spinning machine. Hence why it wrinkles so much and looks bumpy, the machines can't feel the slubs like hands do. Todays wools are ""softer"" and fuzzier, but that makes them weaker as well. It also means we cannot produce the same types of wool fabrics they did (Callimanco was one of the most popular fabrics in the 18th century due to it's beauty and durability and we cannot reproduce the glazing process on modern sheep's wool). Silk was being woven in Italy by the 11th century, though that process dates back to at least 3500 BC in Asia and importation to Europe likely began with the Romans. There was silk production in France by the 15th century and in England by the 16th.

TLDR; I wish I could find fabric today as fine and beautiful (and strong) as what was considered common in the 17th and 18th centuries.

False,,1404227137,worldnews,t1_cilpwle,[deleted],"Also I think it is highly ironic there is hoopla about 'freedoms' in hong kong when it is hong kong that is far stricter on day to day living than Shenzhen next door and not just because it is more organised but because public laws are simply more strict. It is Singapore without the death penalty. Whip out a drink in the wrong metro carriage and get shafted with a $500 HK fine. Loitter around a street corner for too long and another fine. Eat in the wrong park and fined again or be told to move away by a policeman. I don't think mainlanders want these freedoms.

So one wonders, what are democratic ideals in practice? The freedom to vote for a generic muppet that is identical to the appointed muppet? Hard to tell from a practical standpoint. Seems like it is all about the pomp and ceremony. The theatrics. What truly matters isn't even up for discussion come election time. Just smear this, smear that, until something sticks - the staple of democratic legitimacy, the billion dollar media campaign.

Is it about economic freedoms? Hong Kong has every other spot on earth beat, can it go higher than no. 1 in that regard? Clearly not. This is why other Chinese fawn over it-wealth. Money. Cash. More ways to make cash with fewer obligations attached.

I think more Europeans and North Americans in particular need to visit these places they bandwagon or trend against just because the social media fad is ongoing. It looks very bizarre to somebody that has experienced day to day living in the aforementioned continents, countries and cities.

In terms of the freedom to simply LIVE and do your own wacky shit, here is a little rank;

1) Shanghai (the city of whores, scoundrels and general anarchy without the violence or crime; free to be free. Police might as well not exist, which is awesome given that there is little to no crime. Biggest danger is not the state censor, it is the taxi drivers and their 'democratic' form of driving.)

2) Hong Kong (Free to be a corporation/billionaire. The city of excellent police forces, happy fines for everything smaller than a local business; with organised crime leeching off lax taxation and trade regimes).

3) Singapore (Free completely until you fuck with the three strike rule, then jailed or hung until dead.) 

20) New York (free and vibrant until destitute and living in the other 70% of the city that is a genuine slum)

30) Los Angeles (free to be rich, poor and also violently mugged).

50) London (free to make a healthy living while being recorded on at least 30 different cctv cameras every hour of every day, police will eat you if you give them a reason-pretty much the same in every Australian city, the rest of europe is a little better.)

It is a regional thing, and even then a neighbourhood-dependent thing. These social media movements are stupid, clean your local shit I say. On the national and even city-wide level it is all theatrics.

False,,False,Guildwars2,t1_cilq5gq,tregregins,"Bill and I met with ArenaNet at E3 to get a first look at Guild Wars 2’s Living Story Season 2 content, and have been keeping our mouths shut about it for a solid month.  It hasn’t been easy, primarily because of the intriguing nature of what we were shown.  Also, we’re chatterboxes.

Season 1 recently wrapped up with a climactic event that saw the destruction and reconstruction of Lion’s Arch, and if you need to get caught up with the story so far, check out this short recap video.  Then, to get primed for Season 2’s “The Gates of Maguuma,” watch this video.  And if you’ve been frustrated that you haven’t been able to participate in some of the previous Season’s events, never fear: ArenaNet is introducing the Story Journal, which allows you to play through Season content at your own pace at any time, provided that you log in at least once during a particular live event’s duration.


ArenaNet’s Associate Game Director Steven Waller and Studio Design Director Chris Whiteside walked us through a tiny bit of the new Season content, which builds and feeds back on Season 1’s story.  In the game, you’ll be alerted of some strangeness in the Brisban Wildlands, and will come across these weird vine things that have been encroaching upon the human territory.  You’ll meet up with a Seraph outpost that is guarding a portal to a new area, and learn that some new threat has taken out a Zephyr ship that was participating in the Festival of the Four Winds.
The new area beyond the portal is called Dry Top, a region referenced in the original Guild Wars.  It’s an open world area similar to the other locales in Guild Wars 2, with soloable story instances that scale with your party size.  There’s a sense of verticality in the way that Dry Top’s map has been designed, and a shifting sandstorm will affect your visibility and act as a type of event that determines different objectives and rewards.  As you progress through the story, you’ll find out that (spoilers) the Zephyr leader is on the run, a saboteur is chasing after him, and you’re the man/woman/asura/charr/sylvari/norn to figure out what’s going on.
Dry Top is comparable in size to Southsun and synergizes the open world with Guild Wars 2’s story, aiming to address some pacing concerns with the previous Season’s content.  Apparently, the ArenaNet team has been working with people in other media industries to understand how to better make superstory arcs, interrelated Seasons, appealing characters, and other features that are common to good storytelling in television, films, and other forms of entertainment.  Additionally, Seasonal achievements will now unlock when you complete an episode rather than being the driving force of how you go about completing Living Story content.  You’ll get rewards upon finishing the episode for the first time, and can then go about tackling the achievements and experiencing the content with a different focus.

I’m a big fan of Guild Wars 2 and the direction that ArenaNet has taken with its Living Story content.  I know there have been some gripes about the lack of replayability and overdependence on achievements in Season 1, and while neither of those things have bothered me a jot, it does seem like the developers are seeking to address them directly with Season 2.  Starting today, you can jump in and see for yourselves - be sure to let us know what you think!

Carta abierta a la Comisión Directiva de CAPIF

Mi nombre es Ezequiel Jaroslavsky, tengo 25 años, y soy músico. Me dirijo a ustedes con preocupación respecto a su decisión de ordenar el bloqueo del sitio web conocido como “The Pirate Bay”.

Primero que nada tengo que decir que la medida me ha tomado por sorpresa. En estos últimos 10 años el Gobierno Nacional ha tomado todo tipo de acciones para fomentar la cultura en nuestro país, como el artículo 65 de la Ley de Medios que establece que el 30% de la música que se pasa en radios privadas debe ser de origen nacional, y la mitad de ese porcentaje debe ser de música producida de manera independiente; o la aprobación de la ley para crear el Instituto Nacional de la Música (INAMU); de hecho, esta última vino luego de que en el 2006 el presidente Néstor Kirchner derogase la ley 14.597, tras escuchar las quejas de músicos auto convocados, y aceptar ante ellos que cometió un error. Es por esto que una medida tan perjudicial como esta me asombra. Y cuando digo que es negativa, no solo me refiero para nosotros los músicos, sino también para CAPIF.

Hay estudios que demuestran que el peer to peer o P2P (el cual debe diferenciarse de la piratería en la que se busca un beneficio económico a través de la falsificación) beneficia a los artistas, como aquel realizado por la Escuela de Economía y Ciencias Políticas de Londres. En él se prueba que las personas que consumen contenido digital suelen gastar más dinero en entretenimiento que las que no. El negocio del entretenimiento ha cambiado junto con la tecnología. Esto es algo que ustedes saben con claridad, pero esta orden prueba que no comprenden de qué manera. Lo demuestra primero el hecho de que intenten tomar medidas legales para solucionar un problema que claramente viene de la incapacidad de responder a los cambios en los consumos de las personas. Sitios como Netflix, los cuales son pensados para encontrar un punto intermedio que beneficie tanto a consumidores como productores, son perjudicados por la falta de oferta que tienen, producto de la imposibilidad de las grandes empresas de entender que la gente quiere (y tiene) acceso instantáneo a todo. Lo que no consiguen ahí lo conseguirán en otro lado.

El problema es legal, sí, pero de una forma totalmente opuesta a la que plantean con esta medida. Si una ley dificulta el acceso inmediato de contenidos de entretenimiento, debe ser cambiada. Puede parecerles incorrecto, pero el mundo ya ha avanzado sin ustedes en este caso. La realidad es esta, e intentar bloquear un sitio de P2P es como tratar de detener la luz del sol con las manos, y solo perjudica su imagen. Les pido con todo respeto que dejen de pelear lo que no pueden vencer. El esfuerzo y el dinero gastado en abogados para bloquear este sitio han sido en vano. Mi proveedor de internet ya bloqueó The Pirate Bay, y aun así me encuentro en él. Existen cualquier cantidad de proxies que me lo permiten, que se encuentran en otros países.

El manager y productor británico Peter Jenner planteó en su conferencia en la edición 2013 de MICA que se llevó a cabo en Tecnópolis que si los proveedores de internet cobrasen a los usuarios 6 euros más por su servicio, eso cubriría por amplio margen el dinero necesario para compensar los derechos de autor perdidos por la piratería. Esta cifra viene de un modelo planteado en un contexto europeo, pero no veo por qué no se puede encontrar una cifra lógica en nuestro país.

En conclusión, intentar bloquear The Pirate Bay es inútil, y sólo da la imagen de que la Cámara Argentina de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas no comprende el mundo en el que vivimos, y no tiene ningún interés de proteger a nadie más que las grandes empresas multinacionales. Espero que la Comisión Directiva pueda tomar el ejemplo de nuestro difunto ex presidente Kirchner, admitir su error, y dar marcha atrás con esta medida retrógrada.

False,,False,WritingPrompts,t1_cilqnyx,cinemabaroque,"Major Bachmeier looked back over the map of Europe, the damned Americans over-running the French countryside and the thrice damned Russians slaughtering their way towards Berlin. The major smiled grimly and thought to himself about how things had changed since the first traveler from the future arrived and tried to kill the Führer. The Reich has learned so much from them and their devices.

It was so sad to think that the Germany of the present would have to be sacrificed. There was nothing to be done, far more important was the fight for the future. It mattered not if Germany won the war now if, in five hundred years, the Chinese ruled every piece of the earth. Reflecting on his family the Major became more convinced that the Führer was right, we must travel forward to the true battle. 

The Major finished rigging up the time traps in the bunker, the alarms had gone off earlier and they should be appearing within the hour. The inglorious bastards would find themselves caught in limbo until an interrogation squad could pick them up to see what can be learned. Their technology might be almost magical but these future-scum feel pain and talk just like any other human.

His thoughts turning to the future as he exited the booby trapped room the Major saw that the current crop of time travelers were coming from 28th century. It seems our actions in 2247, he thought, where the Führer has set up his main command, are having some effect. The new assassins are coming from further and further up the time stream. No matter, soon the time bombs will be finished and we won't have to worry about the future. Instead it will be stripped clean. A fresh landscape for us to spread out and flower on. 

As the major stood before the time capsule that would bring him to join the rest of his unit he paused and reflected softly to himself ""And to think, with all we've learned this war is tiny, insignificant in the grand flow of time. Without the time assassins the Führer would be stuck in this bunker with the armies of the East and West bearing down on him, with no knowledge of the future or the past and no way to control his destiny.""

It may seem out-of-place for a European, but try getting in to see a Colts game at Lucas Oil Stadium. It's a really impressive building.

The food culture in downtown Indy is really amazing... there's an event in August called Devour Downtown which has great deals on all the great restaurants there. 

If you're near the north side of Indy, find Fast Times Go-Karting if you haven't done a Euro-style karting experience... it's pretty amazing. The race culture in Indiana is pretty big.

I do have a fairly good understanding(I hope) of the Scottish situation and could only speculate the international connotations this might have but If your happy to have a discussion about high rise housing policy then I will do my best to keep up.

There does seem to be a cultural preference in SE Asia for high rise, possibly due to the lack of alternative but having never visited my opinion is formed through conjecture and discussions with friends from the region, I'm always willing to be proven wrong of course.  In Scotland there is a tradition for dense cities with Edinburgh old town in medieval times having buildings over 6 storeys(hardly compares to Singapore) with the buildings densely packed to get as close to the castle as possible. and as such highrise and high density living was more readily accepted in Scotland than it was in England.  Where i think the problem may arise is the fact that people were forced in to High rise living here(due to slum clearances) where as in Singapore it was maybe a choice to move to Highrise.  

To me a sustainable building is on which will survive for a long time with little maintenance and remain fit for purpose for the entirety of its existence and have the ability to change use or extend with minimal effort and expense.  It should be built to use minimal energy in its regular use and not rely on micro renewable bolt on solutions to cover up its inefficiencies.  Material choice should be suitable for the life span of the building i.e. don't use concrete for a building expected to last 2 years where timber would be equally suitable just because concrete is cool.  Materials should be locally sourced where possible and from managed sources.  60 years doesn't seem like a long enough time for a building as expensive as this to exist and I would question the ethics of developing in such a way but given the rate of growth in Singapore there probably isn't an other option.

That's not to say that a temporary building cant be sustainable but i would say its harder to justify the initial effort and emissions in erecting a building which will only be used for a couple of years.


The projects you highlighted still seem very european or at least international to my eyes, Im not sure quite what makes them Singaporean, they could easily be developments of or precursors to [bosco verticale in Milan](http://www.dezeen.com/2014/05/15/stefano-boeri-bosco-verticale-vertical-forest-milan-skyscrapers/).  I think this is more likely a symptom of internationalism in large scale architecture.  I would be interested in seeing any smaller scale projects you might know of in Singapore to see how they differ from the mega architecture of the Interlace. 

We are increasingly seeing the construction of new building typologies on scales never seen before so perhaps the newer mega architecture largely lacking in any regional identity is the only answer as traditional materials and forms are no longer capable of translating to such large scales.

On the same hand that shows that many teams are consistent.  Top ranked teams are typically not losing to teams much lower than them with the exception of C9.  So while I am not saying any team in NA is playing better than Alliance, many of them are still quite consistent.  But if they are losing to some teams around their level sometimes that doesn't mean they are inconsistent.. it just means they are consistently playing around the right level, and when it comes down to it one of the teams has to lose.

I guess part of that comes down to semantics and which way you are judging consistently, but my main point is there isn't a double standard because they are different scenarios.  If every team had a record like C9 (who is called inconsistent) yet no one was called inconsistent, then I would agree it's a double standard.

He was a brilliant college professor at Bowdoin (one of the most prestigious colleges in the US, especially at the time) when the Civil War broke out. He lied to his bosses at the college and told them he was planning to go on sabbatical to study foreign languages in Europe (he already spoke like 7 languages.) 

He signed up for the Army and they wanted to make him Colonel of the newly formed 20th Maine regiment, but he decided that he wanted to learn more about soldiering first so he asked for a position as Lt. Colonel. He was eventually promoted, was involved in several of the most famous battles of the Civil War and led the defense of Little Round Top at Gettysburg. For his service there he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

 He was wounded six times, had six horses shot out from under him and he was cited for bravery 4 times. He was promoted to Major General, was involved in the last fighting of the Civil War and was selected by General Grant to accept the Confederate surrender. Confederate General John Gordon, who led the official surrender ceremony to Chamberlain called Chamberlain ""one of the knightliest soldiers of the Federal Army"" 

After the war ended he returned to Maine, was the president of his former college and then won four terms as Governor. 

If a brilliant man who fought for the defense of his country and the ideals set forth by the founding fathers as a citizen soldier... who rose to one of the highest ranks possible and then ended his life with a dedication to civil service despite his gruesome war injuries doesn't encapsulate America, I don't really know what does...

Took under 10 seconds.

&gt;I'm not big on describing the mechanism but basically we have way to ensure that kids go out at least till they are adults (18h) if only by school registers. If people go missing, we notify child protection service, who do have wide discretionary powers. Also, sequestration generally make a big, biiiiiig scandale when found. They are extremely rare.

Ah, so that protects...well, practically no one. Most Muslims don't wear face coverings when they're children, and adoption among 2nd generation Muslims isn't too high either. So most people wearing them won't fall into this category.

&gt;Say the guys who never had nor bothered to deal with any of the salafist fanatism coming from middle east and just let others wade in it then are the first to become self righteous if we attempt to adress anything. I'm tempted to say ""fuck off"" :)

Grew up in an area that was right next to a 40%+ Muslim area. Try again.

&gt;No, they beat or stone to death women who don't wear it in their areas of control.

So essentially we're now admitting that a Burqa ban will do nothing to inhibit ISIS and has nothing to do with them. Good.

Yes, so you combat that. Once again: The veil ban will do nothing about this.

&gt;Actually they tried :) Making ""patrols"" to beat people on the street and such. And you know the best way to stop that kind of bullshit ? Sending cops after their enforcers and making the whole thing illegal from end to end by patching every single loophole.

Very, very, very, very few ""patrols"" ever existed(even with a sizable Muslim population). Deal with them the same way you would a drug-addled area: with Police.


&gt;The muslims are no problem. And most of them are even repulsed by the niqab actually. Extremists who tried to take root and enforcing their own ""religious laws"" ""because religious freedom"" are the problem.

Then oil priced in BTC could be cleared via the derivative contract (European oil buyer sends Euros to buy a BTC/Euro contract, transfers the contract to the seller to purchase the oil, who can then buys/sells the contract currency pair they eventually want to 'cash out' in so Euros become Yen, Dollars (or maybe even BTC))

BTC becomes a sort of neutral intermediary currency between buyers and sellers. It sets the price and acts as a hedge against fiat currency risk. The actual amount of BTC flowing into/out of the market might be very small compared to the trading volume, so a small BTC 'market cap' wouldn't be a problem.

So it is possible for a determined oil producer to do this relatively quickly if they decide to. A headache to be sure, but possible, and the benefits of selling your international good in a neutral currency might be worth the pain.

Even if it's not enforced by government, having the potential to negatively impact your readership by using one harmless word is not freedom in my eyes. In this case, you're being enslaved by society, not government, which bring the same end result. If government were involved, they'd fine you.

The Niqab, because of its symbolism and its lack of social/health benefits, hardly fits the standards upon which the French society has developed and thanks to which it flourishes. It's also unlikely that it could play any significant role in improving the well-being of its (lady) citizens.

&gt;Chia is grown commercially for its [seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed), a food that is rich in [omega-3 fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid), since the [seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed) yield 25–30% extractable [oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_fats_and_oils), including [α-linolenic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-linolenic_acid) (ALA). Of total fat, the composition of the oil can be 55% [ω-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid), 18% [ω-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid), 6% [ω-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-9_fatty_acid), and 10% [saturated fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat). 

&gt;Chia [seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed) are typically small ovals with a diameter of about 1 mm (0.039 in). They are mottle-colored with brown, gray, black and white. The seeds are hydrophilic, absorbing up to 12 times their weight in liquid when soaked. While soaking, the seeds develop a mucilaginous gel-like coating that gives chia-based beverages a distinctive texture.

&gt;Chia seed is traditionally consumed in [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico), and the [southwestern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States), but is not widely known in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe). Chia (or chian or chien) has mostly been identified as *Salvia hispanica* L. Today, chia is grown commercially in its native [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico), and in [Bolivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina), [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador), [Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua), [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala), and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia). In 2008, Australia was the world's largest producer of chia.  A similar species, *[Salvia columbariae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_columbariae)* or golden chia, is used in the same way but is not grown commercially for food. *Salvia hispanica* seed is marketed most often under its common name ""chia"", but also under several trademarks.

Going to international schools I was mainly around people with American accents and now being in London its all English accents yet I still have my Australian accent. My grandfather is Canadian but he has lived in Australia for over 40 years and he still has a strong Canadian accent. My sister on the other hand had taken to using a more American skewed accent in the American schools and now an English skewed accent in London.

False,,False,WritingPrompts,t1_cilsg3u,Saith_Cassus,"Framboise Benardouis patted herself down, not for the first time, reassuring herself of the familiar weight of her body armor concealed underneath a commoner's cloak. The threads of the ancient garment itched wherever she didn't have an under layer, and she suspected that she could feel something crawling on her back sporadically. She was fairly certain it was some form of louse, but she still had the uncomfortable suspicion it was a mammal of some sort. 

She tapped too on her weapon, a pathetic little time-appropriate pea shooter on the outside, a far more precise instrument of death on the inside, a century ahead of the technology the French currently had access to. 

She eyes the top of the Eiffel Tower, and held a baited breath. At it's apex she had planted five kilograms of genetic-activated explosives. The detonation would destroy one of France's national icons-- and with it, the man who would attempt to eradicate the Jewish people. Provided the Nazi stooges running a security sweep of it at the moment didn't find the explosives.

A soldier approached the edge of the observation deck and held out a hand. The all clear. Everything was in order for the Fuher's visit tomorrow apparently. Framboise released a sigh of relief. 

""Madame,"" the voice was curt and German. She stiffened, then forced herself to relax. The explosives would detonate upon seeing hitler's genetic code. She didn't need to be alive for the man to die. But she did need to make sure her plan wasn't discovered. 

""Oi?"" She replied, trying to keep a tremble out of her French. She turned to face a tall, Aryan-faced man in the black uniform of the SS. He bore an odd silver insignia on his lapel. She had never seen or heard of such an insignia in all of her research on the time period. The man shook his head. 

""Miss Framboise Benardois, you are the woman who kills Hitler. My name is Wilhem Artrung, Department of Order, I am here to prevent that from happening. I, too, am not from this time.""

Framboise worked hard to keep the shock from registering on her face, but she felt her heart hammer in her chest. What was this? A trick? Some form of-

""You are, understandably, skeptical. You were born May 13th, 2022. Your parents, Anthony and Ilsa, worked together as chemical engineers for the IBM corporation designing nano machines. You were raised Jewish and resented the amount of history that was lost to you. You are in a great many history books.""

Framboise could no longer conceal her surprise. Her jaw dropped. ""How-?""

""You succeeded."" Wilhelm said shortly. ""And the result was not as you anticipated. Hitler needs to remain in power. He is unstable, irrational, and overall the greatest weapon against the Nazi war machine that the allies have at this junction. If you kill him, he will be succeeded by Mr. Heinrich Himmler. Himmler is not the same as Hitler. In power, he seeks military dominance in ways that Hitler was unable to. He repels the invasion on Normandy. He perfects the technology for a supersonic aircraft and uses it to make radar far less useful to the British. 

You are the only thing that can bring that timeline to pass. If you kill Hitler, you let the Nazis prolong the war for another decade. The Americans still develop their atomic bomb. They eliminate the Japanese from the war, and manage to drop the bomb on London, Berlin, Prague, and Paris, finally forcing a Nazi surrender. But by that point, the Germans have succeeded in too many goals. Less than one hundred European Jews are still alive. The French, British, Czech, Polish, and Austrian cultures are eliminated. Millions more die than should have. Europe is an irradiated wasteland. The world does not develop. We do not see peaceful movements. The world is a place of military and pain. 

I came from that timeline, Ma'am. I do not wish to return.""

Framboise frowned. ""But... Why come here to prevent me killing Hitler? Why not go further back? Why not prevent the reparations after World War I from creating such an angered German population?""

""The same reason you didn't. The technology will not allow me to travel any farther back than one hundred years. The photon grappling technology still needs more perfecting, and by that point we will have reached the limits of time travel.""

Framboise gave a slow nod. ""I... Understand. I don't like it, but I understand. We're sacrificing millions to-""

""To save tens of millions."" Wilhelm nodded. Framboise gave a start. 

""But... Oh, lord, that tower is closed to the public... And I placed anti-tampering measures on the explosives."" She bit her lip. ""They will detonate if Adolf Hitler reaches the observation level. And I can't disarm them-- they aren't meant to be disarmed. I didn't... I didn't expect to have to *save* goddamned *Hitler*!""

Wilhelm winced. ""That... That is a bit of a problem, yes. But what if... What if he couldn't make it to the observation level?""

Framboise cocked an eyebrow. ""How will you do that without arousing suspicion?""

He smiled. ""I will do nothing. But I think... I think the games French resistance may be paying a visit to the tower tonight. And I somehow doubt that the elevators will make it through that visit intact."" He turned his smile upon Framboise. 

""Thank you, Madame, for helping me in this. I know it is... Difficult.""

She nodded. ""But for the greater good. I cannot kill *Hitler* of all people... For the greater good.""",0,,0,,,t3_29k2gu,1434499720,True,0,31,t5_2s3nb,31,cilsg3u,1404230854,t3_29k2gu

False,,False,femalefashionadvice,t1_cilsgii,nervous_lobster,"As I told you all a couple months ago, I’m going to Beijing for roughly the month of November this year. I graduate on the 12th of December, so the plan was to meet my husband in Japan for about a week before going home for the grad ceremony, but now he doesn't feel like a week is enough time and wants to just go next year. 

I would still like to spend about 6-10 days somewhere after I leave Beijing in order to decompress a little bit (this is going to be a VERY packed and likely stressful trip). My husband suggested South Korea, but after doing a little tiny bit of research, it seems like that might also be a stressful trip. I would personally love to get to the Middle East, Europe, or North Africa (those places would be more in my comfort-zone), but it seems like that would be extremely expensive and time consuming.  I've always wanted to go to Thailand, but that would add about $700 on to my plane ticket, which is a bit much once accommodations are factored in.  I was hoping that you all might be able to help me out with some ideas.  These are the criteria:


* Budget: about 1000USD max for 4-10 days, ideally including airfare/transportation from Beijing.  I can play with the length of the trip to accommodate the cost.

* Interests: Being comfortable and relaxed, learning about religions, good food, history and culture, ancient architecture, nature. *Not* interested in clubbing or nightlife for this trip. I’ve heard great things about temple-stays in different countries, but I want to avoid really touristy stuff in general. 


* For now, I’m planning on traveling with a rolling suitcase, but I guess that could change if needed (though I have to carry formal clothes for my stay in China).


* Japan is out, since my husband wants to be there when I go for the first time!


So if you guys have any country ideas, I would really appreciate them!
