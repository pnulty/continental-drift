True,"&gt; So, would have been a country if not for imperialism.

How so?

If the Europeans never came there, it would still be a part of the Ottoman empire. If the British destroyed the Ottoman empire but didn't acknowledge the right of the Jews to their own country, they would've never set up the mandate of Palestine in the first place, since its only purpose was to create a national home for the Jews. 

And even if everything until 1948 was exactly as it was, but the Arabs have won the war, there would *still* be no Palestine, because the plan was to divide the land between Jordan, Syria and Egypt - and indeed, the parts that were conquered by the Arabs in said war were annexed to the Arab countries. In fact, the idea that Palestine is just ""southern Syria"" or ""western Jordan"" was the leading ideology well after the war. 

The widespread idea that Palestinians should have their own country is a very new concept, even in the Arab world.",t5_2qzb6,1317427300,False,,1427670122,,t1_c2nx3dw,IAmA,t1_c2nwxqs,,2,0,0,0,nidarus,2,c2nx3dw,t3_kwx69,True

True,"Can you ascertain that all the people you met are native Mandarin speakers or speakers whose mother tongue is Mandarin, and not any other Chinese languages? 

You've already gotten many people attesting that they have found Mandarin speakers to have no problem distinguishing English Rs and Ls, so what you observe seems like something highly unusual and unlikely, but let's say it does occur.

So here are a couple of possibilities:

* One. What you say is really true, that the Chinese people you meet are all native Mandarin speakers AND they all mix up Rs and Ls no matter if its English, Dutch, or German in all situations.

* Two. The Chinese people you meet did not all have Mandarin as their first language, but some other Chinese language that does not distinguish R and L to begin with, and that's what causes them to turn all Rs into Ls no matter what. For these speakers, the spelling can potentially contribute to the problem, because whenever they see ""r"", even if in real native speech of the foreign language it can be trilled or uvular depending on context, they'll just produce L.

* Three. There are other more complicated reasons contributing to the phenomena, that may involve anything from what other language these Chinese speakers might have learned before, influence of the established overseas Chinese community that they may be involved in (I do know most established Chinese communities in Europe tend to be from the south of China as well)  

* Four. Less likely, but definitely probable: Some of them have dealt with too many new foreign languages at the same time (let's say at least two at the same time, English and Dutch). They mix the two languages because it's psychologically too taxing to consciously deal with all the different new sounds all the time and switching back and forth between 3 systems, so for ""simplicity"" and ""laziness"" they just put all the Rs and Ls together no matter the context and produce them all as Ls.

* Five. Also less likely, but not improbable: Actually, the Mandarin speakers do differentiate Rs and Ls in English if they spoke it exclusively in an English-only environment, but in a multilingual environment where they have to switch back and forth between languages with different Rs, it is just easier to not bother, especially if they are not fluent enough in English to begin with.

* Six. A combo of some of the above or other reasons or scenarios I can't think of right now.

Grievances:  
  
-The ratings agencies have abandoned their mandate to do due diligence on the ratings they assign, and have thereby undermined the ability of individual investors, and the market at large, to make sound decisions.  
  
-The large banks have moved off the partnership model which incentivized the long term health of the bank and have failed to adopt a new model that similarly incentivizes the banks actions. They have instead instituted models that provide warped incentives for high-risk behavior through awarding large bonuses for short term success.  
  
-They have leveraged themselves far beyond any sane level.  
  
-They have intentionally deceived investors and sold them assets known to be worthless as a matter of policy. Consequently they have engaged in unsound investment strategies, backed by the knowledge that they can sell their mistakes to unwitting investors should they go bad, before their worthlessness is publicly known.  
  
-They have embraced a vision of Wall Street that derives most of its profit not from the efficient allocation of capital and the attendant growth in the wider economy, but from the zero sum trading games exemplified by the Credit Default Swaps which were essentially pure bets.  
  
-They have taken taxpayer bailouts designed to ease credit markets and have refused to use them for their stated purpose of lending to businesses to allow new investment and growth.  
  
-They have bought and sold influence in Washginton with greater fervor than they have bought and sold investments, and have rewritten the laws that govern their businesses to the disadvantage of everyone in the country but themselves.  
  
-They have abandoned their responsibility to manage risk, both for their clients and for the sake of the stability of the wider system. They have at times allowed entire departments in their organizations to operate with no internal oversight.  
  
-They have engaged in, or encouraged, predatory lending practices, knowing that they could pass the losses from eventual default onto investors.  
  
-They have engaged in regulatory capture and evasion by either deceiving regulators, or buying them off entirely.  
  
-They have conspired to mask the extent of soverign debt outside our borders, for the express purpose of deceiving the European citizenry and profiting off of the economic turmoil of America's allies.  
  
  
Demands:  
  
-Robust oversight of all financial activities, both internal and through strong federal regulation  
  
-Reasonable leverage caps and fractional reserve requirements  
  
-Prosecution of any and all individuals who engage in fraudulent activity, especially activity designed to deny information to the market or act on privileged access to information  
  
-Robust laws requiring the documentation of all activities and internal decision making, and strong prosecution of any institution that fails to deliver such documents upon subpoena, for any reason

True,"&gt;Why are RF frequencies used to generate artificial plasmas? Why is is that RF frequencies are particularly good at doing so?

RF frequencies are used for nonthermal plasmas when they are configured as capacitively coupled (CCP) and inductively coupled (ICP) plasmas. The basic idea is that electrons will respond to the changes in the electric field and be able to reach high energies (~3-10 eV, 10,000s K) however the ions and gas will stay near room temperature because their mass is too large to respond to the electric field. [Basic idea, the x-axis can be treated as mass instead of frequency]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harmonic_oscillator_gain.svg) The reason RF is so suitable is: 1) there is a limited range of frequencies where this behavior is possible 2) RF power supplies were cheap and available. Interesting tidbit: RF (13.56 MHz) is dominate in US and Europe while VHF (70 MHz) is dominate in Japan and Australia do to the differing availability of cheap power supplies when these systems where first developed.

Since this might be a little confusing in the context of sputtering. I should elaborate on why sputtering works even though ions and the gas are low (near room) temperature while in the plasma you would not expect them to sputter your target. This is due to the plasma sheath, which is basically a region near any surface (in this case your target) that due to the nature of the plasma a large electric field will exist. This means that ions that get near this sheath become accelerated to high energies (very high velocities) into the surface and can basically knock-off (sputter) atoms on the surface.  

&gt;How does 'self-ionizing plasma' sustain itself? My understanding is that a plasma is struck, the power supply/gas supply is turned off, and the plasma continues to exist. What prevents the plasma from extinguishing itself?

Your understanding is incorrect. Likely both the power supply and gas supply remain on. A self-ionizing plasma just describes the ionization mechanism.

&gt;On all the plasma chambers I see a 'ctune' and 'cload'. I figure the c stands for capacitor, but what do these values actually indicate?

The impedance of the power supply must be match with the impedance of the chamber and plasma. In commercial applications this is generally done automatically, however the principle remains the same as a [Ham radio.](http://tymkrs.tumblr.com/post/5219965187/25-standing-wave-ratios-ham-lesson-o-de-day)

The basic idea is that a plasma and chamber have some impedance, in order to couple power to the plasma the power supplies impedance must be matched. In order to do this adjustable capacitors and inductors are used. Key words for google: RF matching network. There are basically two types used in RF plasmas T-type and Pi matching networks, depending on the frequency and mode of coupling (CCP vs ICP). These deal with the configuration of the adjustable capacitors and inductive.

&gt;We also have other chambers that dope the wafers with boron by generating a plasma with boron triflouride or diborane. How, if at all, is generating a plasma for a compound different than generating one for a diatomic or noble gas?

The doping chamber likely uses Ar as its main gas and dopant precursors as a small amount. For different types of gases the plasma can change significantly. ",t5_2qhi6,1317431241,False,,1427670319,,t1_c2nxilu,Physics,t3_ksej5,,2,0,0,0,usernameissomething,2,c2nxilu,t3_ksej5,False

so what i'm telling you is that it is a dick move to loan money to students so they can get degrees in things, when 90% of them can't possibly be employed in that field. and even if they are, lots of english professors don't even make the kind of money it would take to pay off that many years of school.

* The fact that China's larger northern capital Peking (which becomes Beijing later) was partialled up into several different ""Districts"" if you will, each completely owned, even by Chinese law, by large imperialistic countries. This influence effectively made the last emporer of China, essentially a young man (ruled from 14yrs through 20 yrs, I think) was a puppet.

True,"Are you inferring that there will be no freeze over in the arctic this winter?

Can you point to any winter where the Arctic did **NOT** freeze over?

The shelf was of glacial freshwater ice at the openings of the channels that lead to the Arctic Ocean. However Sea Ice refreezes each year. Nominal amount of ice varies only in certain areas such as off the coast of Newfoundland, Kamchatka and Northwestern Europe. The rest of the Arctic is pretty much land bound and once it freezes there ...there is no more expansion. This leads to a changed meltback over time, but the amount is buffered by the geographical characteristics and the state change from ice to water which maintains a near constant temperature 2 meters above the water in Summer.

So depending on the definition of God, you're possibly talking about something as well-defined as Santa Claus, but with an agnostic much more likely talking about a very nebulous concept, something similar to multiple universes, extra dimensions, a Matrix-like existence that nobody can escape from to prove, and so on.

Someone already mentioned fossil fuels and the world's been somewhat preparing for that...but what happens when we run out of fresh water?  People depend on fossil fuels for convenience, but they depend on water for survival; shit will most definitely get real when the demand for water outweighs the supply.  And then there's the economic situation we’re going through.  Bad economies spark wars, it's a trend throughout history.  If this continues for much longer or gets much worse, it's not long before we see people turning to extremist politicians (nationalist and xenophobic parties are already gaining ground in Europe.)

Even looking at well known women from the 1600s, I don't see the under 17 marriage you say happened.

Thanks to Google books, English population history from family reconstitution, 1580-1837 puts the average age at marriage dipping from nearly 26 to 23 between 1600 and 1850.  There are cultures that tended to marry off young teenagers (India, China), but it wasn't the European norm (though in Eastern Europe the average was slightly lower, more like 20).  Partly this has to do with how people made their living, but it also has to do with women tending to have a say in who they married, with fathers/husbands caring if their daughters were happy in marriage assuming it wasn't an alliance marriage.  A lot of child marriages were not sexual anyway, a claim was laid on the girl and in some cases (China) she lived with her future in-laws, but that doesn't mean sex was involved.

&gt; Immediately after the Napoleonic wars, the Illuminati assumed that all the nations were so destitute and so weary of wars that they'd be glad for any solution, so the Rothschild stooges set up what they called the Congress of Vienna and at that meeting they tried to create the first League of Nations, their first attempted one-world government, on the theory that all the crowned heads of European governments were so deeply in debt to them that they would willingly or unwillingly serve as their stooges. 

&gt; But the Czar of Russia caught the stench of the plot and completely torpedoed it. The enraged Nathan Rothschild, then the head of the dynasty, vowed that some day he or his descendants would destroy the Czar and his entire family, and his descendants did accomplish that very threat in 1917.

http://www2.ministries-online.org/thenewworldorder/illuminati1.html


&gt; In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln discovered that the Tsar of Russia (by then, Alexander II) was also having problems with the Rothschilds; as he was refusing their continual attempts to set up a central bank in Russia. The Tsar then gave President Lincoln some unexpected help: he issued orders that if either England or France actively intervened in the American Civil War, and help the South, Russia would consider such action a declaration of war, and would take the side of President Lincoln.

Can you imagine that 1l regular gas costs in Germany 1,55 €. Or 1 gallon = 7,7 $. Incredible isnt it? With the avrg. German wage of 22k $ a year its possible that they live a decent life, but you somehow can not?

""Money that does not do anything"".  It may appear this way, but this is not true, this money is INVESTED. -INVESTMENTS ARE IMPORTANT- 

But let me get this straight if a poor man has devoted his life to investing in Ford Mustangs, and he has 20 of them.  A poorer man (who already has a car, just not a nice one) has some sort of a moral claim to one of these Ford Mustangs? 

That is what is scaring businesses away as we speak.  

The federal government is the largest waster of capital in the world.  $300,000 spent per job created in the last stimulus?  Have you see all the new pavement Obama's workers have put down?  Yeah me neither, it had to be all torn up to replace the pipes underneath the roads.  How about the TSA, anybody want to donate to those college drop outs?  

The federal government doesn't invest in infrastructure, in fact our federal government doesn't do much of anything with our taxes except redistribute it, pocket it, and spend it on wars.  

Look in 2009 the minimum wage was bumped up by $0.70/hour, from $6.55 to $7.25, anybody who's marginal benefit to a company is greater than $6.55/hour and less than $7.25 an hour is now out of work and unemployable.  Something is better than nothing (protesting)...

Unemployment benefits were extended and widened to ease the ""recession""...sounds good on paper, but it only hurts the people it tries to help in the end...

Obamacare.  How the hell does an employer know what to hire you for if he doesn't know what your health insurance will cost them.  They don't know if it will be repealed, if the Republicans will take office and veto it, etc etc etc.  They'd rather wait to hire, than hire and decrease pay and have to ""lay blame and excuses"" on upset workers who will not understand.

The Federal Reserve.  Will they TARP, will they not TARP, will they EASE will they not EASE, will we see the TWIST, will we not see the TWIST.   As a large business all of this is important, and it seems that every year we get more unprecedented action from the Federal Reserve aimed to ""shock"" the stock market into rebounding, sure it's bullish for the stock market and it makes people feel good, but it's bad for long-term economic/financial planning.  There's no certainty, stability, etc.

These are just a few of the main reasons, that when you couple it with everything else, and then throw a recession on top of it, and Sovereign debt worries, and troubles in Europe, there just isn't going to be a lot of hiring.  

That's just how it is.

1. Take a German class in Germany if you can. Do everything you can to practice speaking. Speaking German in real-world situations is harder than in a classroom.

2. What is your citizenship? If you're Canadian, the immigration process shouldn't be an issue. You can enter without a visa, but you will need to get a residence permit within the first three months of your stay. The residence permit doubles as a work permit-- you will need to have work authorization added to it when you apply. 

3. Your lack of money will be an issue. At least for my study permit, I need to prove I have 700 euros a month for study or around 8,000 euros in the bank. I'm sure a similar rule applies for those looking for work, but double-check. 

4. Continuing with the lack of funds, no permanent residence = no residence permit. You need a permanent residence with a contract signed by your landlord. Keep in mind most apartments (and WGs too, I believe) make you put down a deposit of 1-3 month's rent.

4. Berlin has an unemployment rate of 17.5% and you will not have easy access to the job market. You will probably need a job offer letter to get permission to work, and the company may have to prove that they can't hire an EU national to do the job.

True,"A typical piece in which pseudo-logic brings you to the conclusion with which the author began. 

There are three chief issues that are in play. 

First and foremost is the basic question of how to get economic activity going again. The situation is uncontroversial: that investors and companies are sitting on heaps of cash, but are not using it to invest because they are uncertain of the future. Acting as they do on behalf of other people, this is understandable and is the fulfilment of their basic job. However, the result which this creates is more uncertainty. If the economy were to grow, both calls on the state would fall and income to the state rise, and this would solve most of the problem. A tax on cash holdings by companies might, therefore, be an interesting policy. (It would exclude the sums required for banks to hold against illiquidity, of course.)

Second, there has been vast over-borrowing by states and individuals. Consumer debt is a tottering, huge mountain that, if a mass default were to be triggered by very poor economic conditions, would not be open to any feasible corrective measure except purposely-triggered hyperinflation. That is one major reason why states are taking the slow route to economic correction, rather than accepting severe pain today. The upshot is that, by pure mathematics of the situation, we will see very slow growth for a decade or more. There are no policy levers available except low interest rates: people and nations have to pay back what they owe, or declare bankruptcy. 

State debt is slightly different. The third feature that is holding things back are first, the over-valuation of the dollar as a reserve currency and second and more acutely the issue, the innate instability of the Euro. If the countries that cannot achieve the disciplines necessary to stay in a common currency were to leave it, then their effective devaluation would relieve much of their stress. Yes, there would be negative effects on nations which held their debt. It would almost certainly be cheaper for all to accept this as a once-off cost than to continue to throw money at a situation that has no exit strategy. 

The Euro has proven a hugely expensive experiment and needs rapidly to be trimmed back. For Germany, with an artificialloy low exchange rate, it has been a tax on the general population in favour of exporting industry. In less organised countries, it is now a trap, worsened by the amount they were able to borrow within th Eurozone on effective guarantee by other, fitter states. 

Turning to wealth: the top two percent pay around 30% of tax in both the US and UK, and probably more in continental Europe. In the UK, only two million of thirty million households pay more to the state than they receive in subsidy from it. The rich support the entire welfare state right now.

That was very, very real, and it was not what one would call a good thing.

Secondly, the Cold War was not quite as simple as you make it out to be, strategically. There were plenty of complexities, plenty of conflicts, and plenty of proxy fighting. Chinese and Russian troops, for example, fought along side North Korean forces in the Korean war, though they avoided wearing the uniform for deniability.

Thirdly, it's easy to forget the consequences of Communist rule on the citizens of the countries affected. One hundred million civilians died from purges, massacres, pogroms, gulags, genocide, and starvation under Stalin and Mao. The scale of the human tragedy involved is almost impossible to reconcile mentally. North Korea is an ongoing poster child for the evils of hard-line Communist governments.

It's hard to chalk any of that up to societal progress or to the betterment of mankind. We escaped the annihilation of human civilization, but we also brought ourselves to the brink of it. The ending of the Cold War is perhaps laudable, in that it was relatively free of violence and it ended a great deal of oppression as well as geopolitical tension (and brought us back from having our head in the jaws of nuclear holocaust every second of every day for 4 decades, of course).",t5_2qh53,1317463335,False,,1427671610,,t1_c2o042b,history,t3_kxdhc,,10,0,0,0,rocketsocks,10,c2o042b,t3_kxdhc,True

True,"To be perfectly honest, I think the whole controversy comes from the fact that the US (along with the rest of western civilization) hasn't explicitly and honestly come out and declared war properly.  We are at war with radicalized, totalitarian islam.  It is the totalitarian islamic radicals who started this war on 9/11 and continued it in subways and streets of major European cities.  Now, instead of fighting the enemy head on, we're caught in a question of whether or not it's right to kill one of them depending on where they are.  We're getting drawn into a war that takes us into many countries - some as full out wars and some as specific actions (like the attack on Bin Laden in Pakistan or this one).  

Interestingly, we're kind of now fighting the way Israel was forced to years ago - taking out the bad guys in assassinations wherever in the world they could do it.  And it was always a situation that got Israel bad press.  

I wish we would just come out and say radicalized, violence-promoting islamic groups are at war with us and we will fight them with violence and seek their destruction as they seek ours.   But we're too worried that that will turn the entire Islamic world against us I guess.  I don't know enough to know whether this concern is founded or not.  

In the meantime, it's better to kill the bad guys wherever they are.  They're not going to turn themselves in.  We're not going to get the help of these fence-sitting countries like Pakistan and Yemen to the degree we need it.

True,"I disagree. I think they are pretty much spot on. The Euro experiment formed in the late 90s, and everything was fine, all the member nations had low and stable debt loads. What emerged thereafter was that nations that consistently ran a current account balance deficit developed debt problems. The PIIGS can be ranked in terms of the %GDP they ran as current account balance deficits from 2000-2007. Now, normally a nation with a current account balance deficit does a few things. They lower the central bank overnight rate, and their current depreciates. These two actions weaken their currency, and act to mitigate the current account balance debt load. If not, the currency will continue to depreciate (witness the almighty buck). 

However, in these countries, the actions of the central bank were dominated by the stronger large Euro nations. The overnight rate was kept aggressively high to target 2% CPI  (not even core-CPI) in Germany. And because the current account balance of the entire Eurozone was pretty close to flat, the Euro did not weaken - it strengthened. So those debts, well, they got out of control.

And the PIIGs nations did not get their current account balance under control, perhaps because the dynamics of the situation were different. Normally the central bank helps autocorrect such problems, and currency depreciation takes care of the rest. The only alternative now was austerity, which is a program guaranteed to reduce GDP in the future. Cutting spending and raising taxes will only push the PIIGS closer to default.

So maybe default is an option? However, the Euro nations are linked by a net of shared debt. Who holds a lot of Greek debt? Well, the Germans, French, and Portuguese do. When they default, the Germans will bail out Deutschebank, the French will bail out SocGen and BNP Paribas and Credite Agricole, but what if Portugal is expected to bail out the Greek debt load carried by its nation? The CDS on Portuguese bonds already indicates a high likelihood of failure (higher than Lehman Bros before failute). So suppose Portugal goes next. Well, as it happens, Spain holds an immense amount of Portuguese debt. And Spain is a LOT bigger. Who holds a lot of Spanish debt? Germany could go under. For another leg of the PIIGS net, Irish debt is held by Great Britain (who is not in the EMU and can depreciate its currency). However, the credit default swap on RBS is pretty dern high and its assets, in total, are equal to the GDP of Great Britain. 

The Euro nations are adamantly opposed to a collective pool of debt sharing in which the Greek, Portuguese, and Irish debt is paid for by other nations. Instead, they are tracking a road in which these nations default, and each member nation has to develop a plan for its banks. There is no tragedy of the commons problem here. Pretty soon there will be no here here. 

The big lesson from the Euro experiment, which still may end in failure, is that current account balances must be dealt with explicitly and aggressively if you share a currency with other nations. Otherwise the debt load will become unsustainable. If people do not migrate from nations with poor current account balances to nations with good ones, the whole thing will go under. This migration issue is how the United States can survive while its states have varying account balances. The economy sucks in one state, so people move. In Europe, not enough people move.

Well as a European I can say that you're completely and utterly wrong. In fact - now open your mind really wide and see if you can cram this one in - every European country actually has laws which say that you can stand for office *no matter what your beliefs*!

True,"From the OED:

Pronunciation:  Brit.	 /dɒg/ , U.S. /dɔg/ , /dɑg/
Forms:  ... (Show More)
Etymology:  Origin unknown.
The word belongs to a set of words of uncertain or phonologically problematic etymology with a stem-final geminated g in Old English which is not due to West Germanic consonant gemination and therefore does not undergo assibilation. These words form both a morphological and a semantic group, as they are usually Old English weak masculine nouns and denote animals; compare frog n.1, hog n.1, pig n.1, stag n.1, Old English sugga (see haysugge n.), Old English wicga (see earwig n.), and perhaps teg n. It has been suggested that these words show expressive gemination, perhaps due to their being originally hypocoristic forms. (For discussion see R. M. Hogg ‘Two Geminate Consonants in Old English’ in J. Anderson Lang. Form &amp; Ling. Variation (1982    ) 187–202.) For some of the words, substratal influence has also been considered (compare pig n.1). Because attestation of these words in Old English is generally rare and confined to glossaries and onomastic evidence (as in the case of dog n.1), if they are attested at all, and also because there is often a better-attested synonym (in this case, hound n.1), it seems likely that the words were stylistically marked in Old English, i.e. considered non-literary or informal.
 
The word is attested twice as a place-name element (in the genitive plural) in a 14th-cent. copy of an Anglo-Saxon charter of 941 granting land at Buckland Newton, Dorset (doggene berwe is probably to be identified with Dogbury Hill, an ancient hill fort):
a1400  (OE)    Bounds (Sawyer 474) in W. de G. Birch Cartularium Saxonicum (1887) II. 500   Endelang stremes on doggene ford þanen up on doggene berwe.
It is also perhaps attested (in the compound doggiþorn ) in a late 12th-cent. copy of another charter purportedly recording a grant of land in Gloucestershire made a959, although it is unclear whether the form here represents this word or its derivative doggy adj.:
c1175  (OE)    Bounds (Sawyer 664) in W. de G. Birch Cartularium Saxonicum (1893) III. 113   Of pislege on doggiþorn, of þam þorne to eadingham.
Compare also the following place names: Dogeflod , Surrey (1257; formerly Dogflood, now lost), Doggeworth , Devon (1281; now Dogsworthy), etc.
 
Also early as an element in bynames and surnames; compare: Syward Dogheafd (a1195), Richard Doggetall' (1201), Robertus Doggefel (1201), Robertus Doggisheued (1204), etc. Compare also Roger le Doge (1296).
 
The word occurs in a number of other European languages, considerably later than in English, and in many cases with the identifying attribute ‘English’. All of these instances probably show borrowing either directly or indirectly &lt; English. Compare Dutch dog (16th cent.; in early modern Dutch also dogge ), German Dogge (16th cent. as dock , docke ; 17th cent. as dogg , dogge ), Swedish dogg (17th cent.), Danish dogge , dog (a1700); French dogue (15th cent. in Middle French denoting a type of hunting dog; 14th cent. as an insult used to a Frenchman by an Englishman), Spanish dogo (1644), Portuguese dogue (1789; 1727 as †dogo ), Italian dogo (19th cent.; a1712 in the diminutive doghetto ). In all of these languages the word is applied more narrowly to particular varieties of dogs, usually mastiffs. This probably reflects the types of dogs which were imported from or associated with Britain, and probably has no bearing on the early meaning of the word in English.
 
The etymology of the English word is unknown. No likely cognates have been identified with a meaning at all close to that of the English word, and all attempted etymological explanations are extremely speculative. A word of this phonological shape is hard to explain as a regular development from a Germanic base, but nonetheless a number of attempts have been made. One attempt sees a connection with the Germanic base of dow v.1, assuming an original meaning such as ‘useful or faithful animal’, but this has not met with general acceptance. In this connection an Old English personal name Dycga is sometimes compared as a possible formal parallel from the same base, but it is quite possible that the personal name has no connection with dog n.1 Another attempted etymology takes the word ultimately from the Indo-European base probably meaning ‘run’ which is probably reflected by Sanskrit dhav- (see prothetely n.), but this poses a number of formal difficulties. Another suggestion is that the word shows a development from an Indo-European base meaning ‘to be or become unconscious’, but this involves a very large number of unattested stages in the semantic development (assuming a development ‘bundle’ &gt; ‘cuddly bundle’ &gt; ‘pet’ &gt; ‘dog’), and also involves a very uncertain original base form.
 
The β. forms (which are first attested in the second half of the 15th cent.) and the ζ. forms (which first appear only in the 19th cent., but are now characteristic of many regional varieties) apparently both show the same tendency to lengthen short ŏ before a velar, but at different times and consequently with different results (compare E. J. Dobson Eng. Pronunc. 1500–1700 (ed. 2, 1968    ) II. §53 note 2). The γ. forms, apparently reflecting a pronunciation with an affricate, are unexplained; it is possible that some of the Middle English spellings could reflect a similar pronunciation. The δ. forms show the development of a diphthong from an original velar glide (see A. J. Aitken &amp; C. Macafee Older Scots Vowels (2002    ) §16.4); Ling. Atlas Scotl. (1986    ) III. 345 records pronunciations reflecting such forms from northern and north-eastern Scotland. The ε. forms (very common in Scots, especially in central Scotland) probably reflect sporadic raising of short ŏ to ŭ before g and (in most cases) subsequent unrounding to /ʌ/ ; the raising probably occurred in late Middle English (compare the 15th-cent. form frugge at frog n.1 and adj.), and is apparently evidenced in both dog and frog in the speech of Isaac Newton (who was born in south Lincolnshire) in the second half of the 17th cent. (see E. J. Dobson Eng. Pronunc. 1500–1700 (ed. 2, 1968    ) I. 249); J. Wright Eng. Dial. Gram. (1905    ) 407 records pronunciations with /ʊ/ (or a sound close to it) from Lancashire and Derbyshire, and with /ʌ/ from Lancashire, Derbyshire, and Devon; Ling. Atlas Eng. (1978    ) (Ph40) records pronunciations with /ʊ/ in two discrete pockets: one in the north-west midlands (including south Lancashire and Cheshire) and the other in the east midlands (centred on east Leicestershire, Rutland, and north Northamptonshire), and pronunciations with /ʌ/ in two further discrete pockets: one centred on Bedfordshire and the other on Devon.

True,"&gt;Note that I've been talking about Al-Jazeera ARABIC.

Ok, I'm speaking about the whole AJ entity. It's Arabic speaking branch uses one set of terms, buzzwords and lingo, while its English channel uses another entirely different one, and yes, i am accounting for the obvious difference in languages. You can't honestly think that Al Jazeera is the one news network without an agenda. Do you? They have an interest in perpetuating an image of Israel popular in the Arab World. That's their bread and butter. 

&gt;The OP is lost in translation.

Can you verify this? Though, even if he is, it doesn't change my point. Al Jazeera double-speaks, saying one set of things in English and then something else in Arabic. It makes sense, they have two different audiences. 

&gt;his is a refusal to submit to your pro-zionist narrative so that you no longer feel you are a victim. Sorry about that.

LOL. I have no interest in portraying Israel as a victim. She's a big girl now. And i am a Zionist, but not every Zionist is a propaganda spewing bot who aims to smear Arabs, their character and their institutions. I just think that that the AJ's have different goals. 

O, btw, when i said Anglo, i mean't Anglophonic, English speaking, not White Americans and Europeans. 

Look, here's two articles that include words from the networks representatives:
http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/02/qa_with_al_jazeera_englishs_ay.html

Here's the important bit from the first one.

&gt;**What’s the difference between Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera Arabic?**
We’re speaking to two very different audiences. Al Jazeera English speaks to the international English-speaking audience. Al Jazeera Arabic speaks to the Arab world. The perspectives are very different because the viewers are very different. Viewers who know Egypt’s history and know a lot of the key players in the region and know the narrative of the event are going to be much more aware of the most nuanced pieces of information. Whereas for English-language viewers who might not know a lot about Egypt’s politics, you have to put it in a proper context with the mindset that you’re speaking to people from India to Indonesia to China to the United States.

&gt;**Do you have separate editorial hierarchies?**
We have two entirely independent editorial staffs. When I report, I report to my bosses and my editors in Doha. There’s a great amount of synergy and cooperation, and we share resources and information, though we don’t take our editorial guidelines from Al Jazeera Arabic and they don’t take theirs from Al Jazeera English. At the end of the day, we don’t share the same editorial policies. What we do share is the editorial code of ethics and the same editorial vision as the network.

True,"Hello there! 

CCPs, good topic. In my particular environment, the HACCP system we work with is reviewed regularly with various members of the sites teams (a cross functional and multi hierarchical review!).

We put a lot of emphasis on training, and the importance of CCPs and ultimately what that means to the end consumer. With any HACCP based system, there needs to be defined procedures and documentation, part of which ensures that the monitoring of CCPs is done regularly. All personnel are trained and accountable for their own CCPs, and understand the implications if any fail. 

Internal Audits are carried out by myself, my boss (also within the QA team) and trained members of the other departments. :)

--
EDIT: It's written in EU legislation (not sure about US) that all food manufacturers should adopt a food safety system based on HACCP principles. This is what I'm talking about here. HACCP = Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.

It's essentially a system of highlighting areas of a food manufacturing process that could introduce, or fail to eliminate, a food safety risk, and looks at microbiological, chemical, physical and allergenic risks. A CCP, (critical control point) is a step in the system specifically designed to reduce a risk, i.e. pasteurisation of milk, etc. 

A good system will ensure the appropriate risks have been identified through audits and system reviews, and have formal procedures and monitoring systems in place to ensure that control is not breached. (i.e., lots of paperwork proving that milk is pasteurised properly).

True,"That's a tough one. 

I do not agree that people should blindy follow an EU regulation with out looking at the appropriate risks. Or, more accurately, EU regulation should be cited to stop certain products which don't actually have a risk but fall into a particular category.

With regards to the latter part, I do think there is a genuine need to limit certain risky activities. Raw milk for example. Across all the dairy farms across Europe, the UK, or just the US, it would be very hard to apply exacting standards to all the farmers. Farm equipment, age of the kit, size of the farm, etc, all play a part in the risk. I feel that it would be unwise to give *the population* the choice of taking that risk because the population, at large (in general, assumption here...) are not informed enough. 

(I'll not get into the debate of impracticalities of trying to sell raw milk in a supermarket anyway) 

Selling Raw Milk from the farm, to locals? Different story, still the issue of education, but less people affected, and said people will be able to vouch for the farm and it's standards. 

I think giving people the information about their food is a great thing (hell, labelling laws change all the time, it's amazing the amount of information on packaging at the moment), but people really need to understand what that info actually means.

I guess that's pretty interesting to see and compare that to your experience of where you live. It's so clean and beautiful. The urban architecture almost makes it a piece of art. There's a picture here of a sky park in Singapore, it overlooks most of the city, it is beautiful: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Na4-LqYMghU/Tlqjw5kPM9I/AAAAAAAAATw/B7yLvr1KmpU/s320/SkyPark+Marina+Bay+Sands+Singapore.jpg

How about this?

3. We have a highly educated workforce that are aren't afraid to speak their minds. The amount of ""big"" decisions that occur in this city lend themselves to passionate and informed individuals.

4. DC IS awesome and it's because we have a diverse pool of immigrants from throughout the nation and the world. Ethiopians, Salvadoran's, Mid-Westerners, Eastern Europeans, and everything in between. From the seediest areas to the cleanest blue blood bars, this place is full of character.

5. Food? See #4. Vegetarian Messob, Cheese Pupusas, Vietnamese spring rolls, and all within walking distance from free wifi-having cafes and monuments unlike any other place in the world. If you still want a burger we've got plenty of good joints that serve those too.

6. Georgetown is simply one of MANY pockets of places that can indulge your sweet tooth and brain. You've seen some of our favorite shops on tv, and many more are still to be discovered if this is your first time visiting.

7. We're not NY, LA, Chicago, Boston, or San Diego. And we like it that way. In many respects we're all those places. Many of us started somewhere else and naturally gravitated here. See #3.

8. DC's train and bus system serve MD, DC, &amp; VA. Whether you come with a bunch of friends and stay in Northern VA or decide to get a hotel in Baltimore MD, we've got you covered.

So yeah, Redditcon in DC because this place is full of quirky, smart, classy, disruptive, whiney, brilliant, interesting people that know a city is its people. We also happen to house the coolest free museums, the president of the United States, the Pentagon, all the departments of the Federal government, the National Cemetery, and the Exorcist steps if you get bored with us.

True,"I do play WoW, I have played a healer, I never hit Gladiator, never did much hardcore PvP, and it is undeniable that clicking is the absolute worst thing you can do in that game.

As for SC2, well you can still meet the timing but let's say you're playing Zerg, have hatcheries hotkeyed to 1, queens hotkeyed to 2, use the base camera hotkey and placed it to Spacebar as opposed to Backspace which is usually what it is, upgrade buildings binded to 3 and armies 4 and onwards.

It would be undeniably easier and quicker to go 1SRRRRRRRRRR2VSpaceVSpace3A in a production cycle than it would be to go 1SRRRRRRRRRR2VSpaceVSpace3 (moves mouse to click Missile Upgrades.)

&gt; And there are a ton of progamers who aren't even close to having the APM of a ""Dragonforce solo."" Sjow, Incontrol, Goody to name 3. Sure, if you want to compete with Koreans you need high APM. 

Players like Axslav, iNcontroL, SjoW and Goody are undeniably good but apart from SjoW (whose TvT has been described as Code S level by a Korean player. I believe it may have been Bomber), I wouldn't really consider the three world class.

iNcontroL did very disappointingly in recently MLGs, Axslav is playing Protoss, a race that relies a lot on balling units together and a moving them and occasional forcefield or storm spam, or blink micro so low APM suits his race.

GoOdY plays a very unique style of Terran, namely almost pure mech where he just builds up huge hellion, tank and thor armies and does a really slow push of pure fucking doom towards his opponent, and out of all the foreign Terrans, he seems to be the only one who is brilliant at his style.

SjoW is an exception. He is one of those low APM players whose APM can rise in a serious situation, and he has a very smart strategic mind.

&gt; But in EU or NA? It's more about effective APM and skill rather than raw speed.

More and more major tournaments are opening their doors to Korean players. Look at the NASL, IPL, MLG etc, the NASL's Main Bracket got ROFLstomped by nearly all Koreans apart from Darkforce and Sen who made it a bit further.

And look at MLG, in Columbus, the top 3 finishers were all Korean, in Anaheim and Raleigh, the top 6 were Korean, and you need to be top 8 from what I can recall to recieve any prize money.

As for the IPL, I believe only 2 foreigners have actually qualified for the IPL3. The other 6 who made it through were *Koreans.*

And the NASL S2 qualifiers, well guess what. All of the foreigners either placed highly in the NASL S1 Open tournament and earned their seed that way or made the playoffs in Season 1. Everybody who actually legitimately won the NASL S2 Qualifier was *Korean.*

Thing is, SC2CON, a.k.a. KeSPA 2.0 ordered all Korean teams to pull out, then foreigners got invites.

What I'm saying is ""yes, effective APM and skill are very important"" but unless you want to go further than a few smaller scale regional tournaments and make a name for yourself, you need to play like the best, and the best are undeniably the huge name Korean players like PuMa, MC, Bomber, Mvp, NesTea, Losira, MMA, BoxeR etc.

I'm heeding a warning, I'm saying Koreans are better than the rest of us for a reason, and that's because of their hard work ethic and team environments. They live together and play together 10 - 12 hours a day. Of course they're going to be fucking good.

i guess i'm not technically a youth anymore, so the following may be off somehow.

When i was growing up in suburbia, we rode bikes/scooters/skateboards, talked about how bored we were and how there's nothing to do in this shitty town (i think this may be universal). Video games are good for bonding, exploring is always fun. A group of friends will occasionally invade local restaurants on weekends, usually fast food (McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Taco Bell...), and get up to mischief- joking loudly, staying for a long time, not ordering much food. I doubt servers enjoy it.

Rap, club rap mostly, gained a lot of traction in my state (Georgia) over the past 10-15 years. Even for people who don't love/like the genre, club rap is part of the shared cultural consciousness, they're the bulk of Top 40. You can usually quote a lyric and get a response. It's usually treated in a humorous manner.

Kids brag about drinking, whether they actually do or not. It's illegal to drink under 21, but popular. They have split opinions over weed, depending on whether they want to be seen as good kids or not. They obsess over sex. Older youth worry about their future and what their ""dream career"" is, because it's assumed that by the time you graduate high school you need to have it all figured out. Middle youth want to get their driver's license so they can be independent. This may be the same in Europe, too, I don't know. Kids usually don't pay for their first car. It's typically a hand-me-down vehicle as their parents buy their own new cars. Wealthier parents may buy their children a new car when the kid is 16 or 17.

Trashy US tv is mostly watched ironically by youth. I don't know if that's better or not. I'm also not sure just how ironic it is, but they're aware of what they're watching. It's popular because it's funny, for various reasons.

Most of the kids I know go to church cause their parents make them- when they're younger, that is. When they can drive, they usually stop going.

I don't think the historiography of the 19th century is nearly as well documented as the 20th or the time of Peter the great but in general, Geoffrey Hosking is probably the most respected name. Check out his books, 'Russia: People and Empire, 1552-1917' and 'Russia and the Russians.'

James BIllington's 'The Icon and the Axe' is well thought of but it is a huge book and a tough read.

Reinhard Wittram compares the two in 'Russia and Europe' - it has lots of pictures but i remember it being quite an elitist history, not much about general life.

True,"&gt;the only reason I think people are so obsessed with the semantics is to draw attention away from the fact that THEY'RE STILL EXPLOITING CHILDREN WHETHER IT'S EPHEBOPHILIA OR PEDOPHILIA.

But you can still talk about the fact that it exploits children without utilizing such loaded rhetoric similar to how people on Fox News call Obama a communist because some of his policies *kinda remind* them of communism despite the fact that he is still in no way a communist...they just like calling him a communist.  It's still possible to criticize him without doing that.

&gt;and honestly, who do you think is more vulnerable? A twelve year old girl whose body hasn't started changing, who hasn't yet had expectations of sexual beauty thrust upon her, or a fourteen year old whose hormones are just kicking in, who maybe doesn't understand or like what is happening to her, who is now culturally expected to be pretty and giving and no longer has that socially allowed shroud of innocence to protect her?

It's interesting how you use two ages *very close* to each other to support using the same word to describe being attracted to people with ages *very different* from each other.  Not only does the word ""ephebophile"" not describe either of those girls (the term for sexual attraction to people in early puberty is ""hebephilia""), but it doesn't even address the girls posted in jailbait.  Most of these girls *are* knowledgable in sexuality, *are* old enough to legally give consent in the majority of the world, including the vast majority of countries in europe as well as most states in the US, and *are* 16 or older.  These do not seem to be 14 or 12 year old girls.  Again, this is not me defending /r/jailbait, but rather me pointing out your change of direction; talking about the difference between a pre-teen and a barely-teen instead of talking about the difference between sexual attraction for  an 8 year old and for a 16 year old.

They're both vulnerable, as far as I'm concerned.  Every young adult trying to figure out her sexuality is vulnerable, and is harmed by those that post pictures for others to masturbate to without her permission.  Hell, even if she's 45 she's still vulnerable (but less so, since that is a lot less likely to severely stunt her social life and she is likely much more emotionally mature to handle it).

But that doesn't make a 16 year old an 8 year old.  And that, therefore, doesn't make an ephebophile a pedophile.

&gt;The whole ""I'm an ephebophile, not a pedophile"" thing is not an excuse that actually diminishes the severity of what these people are doing at all

But have you considered the severity of latching onto such an emotionally loaded word to describe someone by something they're not?  We latch on the word pedophile to describe those who like 16 year olds in much the same way many feminists use the word ""racist"" to describe those who disagree with affirmative action (something, by the way, I agree with).  It's an act of hurting, of offense, of gnarling your teeth instead of calmly elucidating.  It's to better bulster your own beliefs and the beliefs of your brothers and sisters while continuing to give reason for those that disagree with you to feel alienated, dehumanized, angry, and even *more*   defensive and supportive of their morality.

The only reason why ephebophilia doesn't have the same stigmatization is because so few people even know what it means, because of the insistence on ""pedophile"".",t5_2s4m9,1317502667,False,,1427673150,,t1_c2o3do8,ShitRedditSays,t1_c2o302d,,-5,0,0,0,sje46,-5,c2o3do8,t3_kxkip,False

The cheapest way really depends. I'd always check all three options online. Eurolines, Ryanair, Wizzair, etc. are all your friends.

As far as hostels go, use hostelworld and read reviews, look at the rating, pictures, location, etc. etc. This will give you an idea of what the place will be like. Most have safes. Be wary of pickpockets, by the way, especially in the bigger cities in Hungary probably. And Rome. Don't carry every single one of your belongings with you, because that's a pain.

Also, the fact that the original assertion is true is also irrelevant.  The same selection bias would be true in Europe as well.  The study essentially polls the more elderly and hence generally conservative portion of both populations, and even in that case more people within that classification believe in evolution in Europe than here, at least according to this study.  

Which may or may not be correct, but the fact that this selection bias exists does not in itself invalidate the study as long as they used the same methods in both populations.  

Now if they did phone surveys in America, and then surveyed young people on college campuses in Europe, the selection bias would certainly invalidate the study right off the bat.

True,"Some arguments I've heard are based around taking evidence from the dozens and dozens of perhaps flawed, likely unreliable, or certainly contradictory censuses taken throughout Europe and America at the time.

Some censuses simply say there weren't even 6 million jews in Europe at the time, holocaust deniers cite those censuses and insist that the figure is an exaggeration. Others would cite the censuses, whether documented or undocumented, of the number of Jewish immigrants to America during the '30s and '40s, and compare those figures to those of the missing (executed) numbers of Jews. Obviously people are prone to picking and choosing which evidence supports their cases and sticking to it whether or not it's reliable.

Obviously there's a spectrum of denial. On one hand, some people believe the entire thing was a hoax, generated by forged evidence and a Jewish conspiracy to advance themselves in the world, get billions in reparations, and score Israel by gaining the world's sympathy. Others would argue that while many people were certainly systematically executed by the Nazis, in the post-war horror, shock, frenzy, and rage, it's entirely likely that reports and estimates of casualties were exaggerated and the Jews exploited that for their own gain. Others would question and criticize why the discussion of the holocaust is monopolized by Jewish suffering, while we hear little of the same treatment for Romanies, leftists, the disabled, gay people, and the mentally ill, and those people are quick to be labeled holocaust deniers and the like.

It's correct to say both ways, but when you change the way you are pronouncing it, certain rules apply, ie: When you are putting it as a question, the prefix always comes first: Eu te amo?

I don't know if it's going to help much, like I said, the rules may or may not apply depending on the subject, on the situation you are using it.

You've got to realize that individuals will not accept making less money if the can legally avoid it. Same behavior as a corporation's board.

Absolutely, but if we, as a voting populace, find that we *want* to tax a group of individuals, but we don't because we *can't* do it without them responding in some kind of frightening way, it's time to ask ourselves when our democratic law-making system ended up in a hostage situation with the upper class holding the cards. If the *only* reason we're not taxing the rich is because they've got us outmaneuvered, it should be regarded as a problem that needs addressing.

&gt;What kind of system are you advocating? That's not exactly what I see happening with the income tax. I also believe that money is best spent in the private economy due to the wasteful inefficiencies in our government, and because gov. spending isn't real growth.

Ah, damn dude, I was only shooting to shed a bit of light on what I saw as a potentially falacious argument, I'm probably not really prepared to advocate and defend a particular economic system, but *since you asked,* I do think that money and power become easier to obtain with more money and power, and that as a matter of fairness, we should have legislation that tries to make that exponential effect a bit more linear. The logistics of how to implement that principal are regrettably complicated. Some European countries like Sweden and Denmark seem to have a good thing going with high tax rates and social services, so I guess I err on the side of socialism, though there are plenty of things I don't like about it, the potential for government waste with state run businesses or government corruption with state contracted businesses among them.

True,"I think companies don't want to hire because there isn't *demand* - it's not finance/tax/risk driven (that's why tax rate cuts didn't translate into full employment over the last 10 years ... the decision to hire or not hire isn't driven nearly as much by the *cost* of the employee as by the net profit resulting from the employee's activity, and net result is negative if you can't see what they make ... no matter how cheaply they make it or how low the tax rate is on the non-existent revenue.)

I don't know much about bank decision practices - I *suspect* they want to lend (after all, that's sort of important to making money) but don't know how to evaluate risks ... which I instinctively put down to the wild valuation swings and high-velocity money behaviours of the financial markets, and some uncertainty over evolving requirements for capitalization. And I suspect corporate lending is not needed when corporations are sitting on cash hoards and deciding not to invest, anyway. But I really am pretty ignorant about the bank practices, so if you say investment isn't happening because banks decline due to worry about healthcare costs, I can't gainsay you.

Regulations often (not always, by any means) *do* help business: they reduce uncertainty, they level playing fields, they increase efficiency of interoprability ... consider a simple regulation like, oh, train track gauge. Overall commerce benefits when standards like that are imposed - and the standards don't happen magically, and they aren't cost free, and they involve winners and losers. Or consider telephone systems. Or electrical systems - look at the business Japan is losing right now because they run 50 Hz power in the west, and 60 Hz in the east, and can't ship power to fill in for the disaster-struck areas. Or consider what happens to sales of, for example, lettuce or cantaloupes when people distrust the food ... that's the kind of damage which regulation limits. I agree with the US Chamber of Commerce that our models for cost/benefit analysis are too weak, but even *they* agree there are benefits there to be measured. (http://www.uschamber.com/issues/regulatory/cost-benefit-analysis-and-regulatory-accounting)

With respect to possible tax rates - the most I have heard is ""raise millionaire's taxes to something closer to average American effective tax rates"" - no specific numbers seem to have been floated by the Administration, and certainly no rates have been set into law, so your assertion of a top MTR of 40% in 2013 is, as best I can tell, pure speculation.

I'm a little startled at the idea of German markets being less regulated than American, but I agree the EU average effective tax rate on corporates is less than American effective tax rates (at least, the EU says so! See www.oecd.org/dataoecd/40/0/43214648.pdf). Granting those positions, doesn't the current EU financial mess and capital flight from EU to America show that low tax rates are *not* a panacea for business?

And let me say this about expatriation: good. Go! If they're purely money-driven and their decisions are pushed by accounting calculation, then you might be standing on American soil but you aren't truly a Citizen, anyway. I might miss the revenue from their local economic activity, but not enough to put up with the elitist bullshit mentality. I much much much prefer to be in a society with people who might agree or disagree with me, but will stand their ground and speak their mind in a civil way (like you!).

OK, now that it's just us 99% ... I *am*concerned about the debts we're piling up.

As a first step I'd love to see us stop wasting money and blood and lives in wars; as a second step I'd love to see us dramatically simplify the tax code (dump special treatment for income based on where it comes from, or how long you did something before you realized the income from it, or how much of income you had .... let you and the market account for the value of all those things, let the government just take some predictable proportion ... I'm getting finder of VAT schemes!).

True,"Sorry, but if you think slaves constructed every big ancient building you're sadly misinformed. People used to assume this, even in academia, but closer study in almost every case has shown that work forces were generally specialised, valuable, and well-treated. Building, masonry, architecture were the brain surgery and rocket science of those times, and angry, resentful slaves were unlikely to do a very good job.

But, there still were slaves in practically every ancient culture that we know of. They were mostly for household work, as servants, cleaners, cooks etcetera.

I find the information in the OP pretty interesting, because of the idea that America's early european ruling class thought it was just fine to literally work slaves to death and then just replace them with younger stock once they died.

Today we hear about an atrocity like that bridge over the river kwai - the Japanese worked hundreds of allied soldiers to death building a railway through dense jungle in burma (or was it thailand?

The power of free speech lay in its ability to spread ideas and information.

Hitler used speech to nearly wipe of Jews and almost take over Europe.  Bin Laden's power didn't lay in his ability to shoot, but in his ability to motivate people to carry out the largest terrorist attack in the history of the world.

True,"Using ideas such as US history, population density and local color, here are my thoughts on the schools and magic in America.

My first theory is that American Wizarding Society, while secret, is more in cohesion with Muggles. The first wizards to America likely left feeling the desire to be more open. A new land, freshly settled may have seemed alluring. Also, there are a few schools around the country, given its large size. They remain hidden as wizards, but are actively engaged in muggle society. Rather than a separate form of government, wizards run in a hidden department along side the US government, and even having a secret cabinet position under the President directly that only he knows about. Many wizards help to maintain the secrecy by actually being elected politicians. By muggle standards, it is unknown who has been a wizard, but they have been everywhere in politics from the House, to the Senate, Supreme Court and perhaps one or two Vice-Presidents, but never a President, have been wizards.

Salem is the oldest and first founded due to the first wizards who came to America. It still stands, and is likely the most widely recognized school in the America's. It teaches in a similar manner to Hogwarts, with its founders and first students likely having been taught there themselves. But over the years, it has taken a more international approach to teaching. The school's location may be why the ""witch trials"" were held there in the first place. It's student body is primarily composed of children of European descent, from the North East, covering Maine to Maryland, and westward to Minnesota and Iowa.

There is a school likely located in the deep south either in the Appalachians or plantation regions (Georgia or North Carolina are my prime speculations), founded by wizards who may have been sympathizers with the Confederacy where Salem likely supported the Union. Again, similar in style to Hogwarts and largely the same as it was when founded. It takes a more traditional and conservative approach to teaching magic. While hostile at first, this school and Salem now have a friendly rivalry. The student body consists of the southern states and includes much of Texas.

The native American's never originally had a joint school like the Europeans, they instead felt it was the duty of a tribe's shaman to pass on the knowledge to their students. Unlike Europeans, the natives have no secrecy of their magic, and the concept of a ""Muggle"" is foreign to them and magic users are revered and honored. European wizards, unlike muggles, held open arms to the natives and the shamanic magics are now taught in schools such as Salem (but not the one in the South). There are two schools now dedicated to this style of magic, one in North Dakota, and another in New Mexico. They operate under the same name/banner. European wizards are not excluded from these schools, but are not normally found there. The schools are small, as many still prefer the traditional master/pupil arrangement.

One more school, less secretive than the others, is located in the heart of the San Francisco Bay area. Of all the schools, it is perhaps the most diverse magic school in the world. Founded in the early 1900's it is also one of the youngest in the world. The school caters to many forms of magic, ranging from the European styles, to Native American, Asian, Middle Eastern, African, etc. The school caters to students from not only all over the US, but the world as well. It offers a special exchange program where students from other nations can come and study, and also expose American students to more unique and focused magic schools around the world.

I also imagine Hawaii has a setup more akin to what ever other Pacific island nations do for magic teaching.

EDIT: Made some adjustments to the text.

Also, here's a stab at some names.

* Salem Witches Institute (as per canon)
* Atlantic Academy of Magic (formerly Confederate Academy of Magic)
* Shamanic Magics School of America North/South
* Arcane Youth's University [Trying to be all 'modern']

True,"I have an issue with you saying that you ""believe"" rather than you ""think"" and acting as though you are an expert. You are assuming that migraines are the same as cluster headaches (no evidence). They are both usually intense unilateral headaches with autonomic accompaniments, but they are different. You refer to olfactory auras, so I have to point out that a cluster headache typically has no aura (atypical cases can have an aura). So your arguement is very flawed here.
Other differences include: 
Male predominance (cluster) vs female predominance (migraine), restlessness &amp; agitation (cluster) vs seeking rest and stillness (migraine), 45-90minute attack (cluster) vs 4-72hrs (migraine), marked periodicity of attacks (cluster), peak age of onset 25-40 (cluster) 20-30 (migraine). 
Regardless, I think that the idea you have is interesting too. Particularly with what I read about changes in sleep patterns and seasons often triggering cluster periods. So it's feasible that the sufferer may already be developing a headache when they notice the smell (no causation). However causation is still probable. Being in a cluster period makes the sufferer more likely to experience an attack. It makes sense that an attack could be triggered by a small rise in histamine due to perfume irritation. By that reasoning, perhaps during a remission period a perfume might not necessarily cause an attack. However there is no research, so it's all just ideas. You point out the difficulties of research. However you have no idea. There are so few sufferers of cluster headaches that a trial like this would be difficult to conduct on any decent scale, also you would never get a trial like this through an ethics committee- you cannot attempt to cause a cluster headache in a subject as a researcher. Furthermore, if a sufferer suspects something as a trigger I would not suggest they ignore it. These attacks are horrendous and avoiding possible triggers (within reason) like going to bars where there may be strong perfume is not going to ruin their QOL very much anyway. To raindogx- one study I read said that 80% or more of cluster headache sufferers had a history of smoking. I was wondering if you do? It was a European study and, well if you go to a bar in France the only person in it is the bartender as everyone is smoking in the smoking lounge. So I am dubious about this potential link. *edited to add- this thin link suggests smoking as a potential trigger for the intitial onset of cluster headaches in those genetically predisposed, so could be construed as another reason for those suffering cluster headaches to tell their children not to smoke.",t5_2qh1i,1317525126,False,,1427674419,,t1_c2o5xlt,AskReddit,t1_c2o4oh9,,1,0,0,0,ich_liebe_dich,1,c2o5xlt,t3_kxhw9,True

True,"The reason why you don't see Canada in that article is because it's titled UK cancer survial rate lowest in Europe. If you weren't aware Canada isn't on that continent. It's located north of us here in North America. But onto other things.

This article and yourself disparage England's government healthcare. It compares England to Norway, Sweden and Finland at one point, saying that if England's cancer survival rates were comparable 12% more English would survive cancer. But what you probably don't know is that Norway, Sweden and Finland all run some form of government funded healthcare for it's citizens. Really good healthcare too obviously because they have the highest survival rates for cancer in Europe. Also cancer survival rate is much more correlated with early diagnosis, once Europe makes it more likely that it's citizens are screened for cancer you'll see similar survival rates.

TL;DR This article doesn't show that government healthcare is inherently bad healthcare. Cancer survival rates go up when more people are screened which is what Europe needs to improve on, not the quality of cancer treatment. And last but not least, get a globe and find Canada and then realize it's not part of Europe(=",t5_2cneq,1317530614,False,,1427674693,,t1_c2o6ijl,politics,t1_c2o5wal,,1,0,0,0,runtotheabyss,1,c2o6ijl,t3_kxix0,False

True,"Now that you describe the multiplayer a bit, I do remember hearing some things about that. For some reason I dismissed it since it sounded a bit like Fable with the floating orbs. It sounds like I may have underestimated it based on what you are saying.

What you said about them not releasing it on the 360 in Japan is pretty interesting. It seems like since it is already done all you have to do is beat the cost of burning the discs. Obviously there must be something else going on though. The game does sound really fun, but unfortunately my 360 RRoD'd a while back and I never got around to repairing it. Hopefully the 360 sales will be good enough to encourage them to expand a bit on the American/European market. As long as that doesn't mean watering down the gameplay before I get to play it.

I double-checked my information on the Phyre Engine thing, and I may be getting some bad info off of a forum. I remember looking up what engine it was written in a week or so ago (to see how likely it was to be ported), and signs seemed to it being made on the Phyre Engine. Now that I am a bit more careful as opposed to just satisfying my own curiosity, I can't really find much about the technology that was used to develop it.

Apparently Phyre Engine is mainly a graphics engine, and it is doable (but challenging) to port to the 360. However, Phyre Engine is supposed to be compatible with the PC so it shouldn't be as hard to go that direction. The only thing I know for sure is that Demon's Souls used Phyre Engine and that Phyre Engine is supposed cross-platform with the PC.

True,"This wouldn't solve anything. Of the myriad problems plaguing the American electoral system, two of the biggest are the two-party system and the influence money has on policy making.
The two-party system is a product of the way elections are held. Because we elect individuals by district to the legislature, it is difficult for third/fourth/fifth parties to gain any foothold in national politics. For a counterexample, look at European-style elections that reward each party a number of seats based on how well they perform nationwide, meaning that a smaller percentage of votes in each district still grants them a place in national legislatures.  
  Then there's the involvement of money. The problem here is twofold. One, money controls the flow of information. That means that voters are see and hear what those with cash want them to. Even 100% turnout is pointless if only 2% of the population is capable of accessing the entire story. Then, after elections are held, elected officials are beholden to those that financially backed their campaigns. The way to fix this is to either limit the money that can be contributed by private interests, or to somehow make financial participation in campaigns compulsory for all or most citizens. The former is unlikely because the US Supreme Court has equated campaign contributions to free speech, which constructs a constitutional barrier for any serious attempt at campaign finance reform.  
  **TL;DR - Compulsory voting will not solve the actual problems facing American politics, among which are a system that discourages third-party movements and makes elected officials beholden to those with the cash to finance their campaigns.**

&gt;Right because living in a country which government doesn't respect &gt;property rights is so much better.

Property rights can be taken away with due process if it was proven that the owners used fraud to obtain it. i.e. Wall Street bankers, who lied about the contents of the securities that they were selling.

&gt;Living in a country where mass genocide can occur is fine too. Living in &gt;a country where civil wars can happen is great. 

None of those things happen in Europe, and europe is FAR, FAR better off than us, even with their gas prices being double what ours are. Let's compare ourselves to Europe from here on out, shall we?

&gt;Greed is one of the primary motivations. You are demanding more &gt;yourself because you're greedy. Barriers are in place to keep those &gt;who don't want it enough from getting it.

What about the people who do want it? What about the people who read books, who get 4.0 GPAs, who are exceedingly smart but can't get a job because the financial system crashed, and they don't have money for college? 

The barriers you speak of, such as anti-fraud barriers, admissions requirements for schools, etc, are there to keep the motivated in and the unmotivated out. But with 20% underemployment, we have to realize that some barriers need to be torn down.

&gt;Your solutions of government ""regulating"" the banks is what put us &gt;here in the first place. They did such a great job the first time around.

Not exactly. The financial derivatives that caused all this economic mayhem were regulated in 1933 by the Glass-Steagal Act. Those regulations were overturned in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act because the Republican congress, specifically Phil Gramm, wanted more economic freedom for the rich. 

[Here's a resource for you](http://losangeles.injuryboard.com/miscellaneous/the-subprime-mess-and-phil-gramm-an-experiment-in-deregulation.aspx).

&gt;You yourself is sitting at home on reddit in a cozy setting. You yourself &gt;is benefiting off the labor of 3rd world laborers. You bitch with no &gt;answer except to blame the rich as a scapegoat because it's easy. It's &gt;hypocrites like you that are the problem. You make noise that sounds &gt;good but in reality, no practical or realistic solution. In addition, you &gt;bring forth the very little knowledge you present and attempt to sound &gt;like an expert demanding things.

Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, has clearly stated that the stimulus package needed to be twice as big and with fewer tax cuts. He also stated that there's far too much evidence that this country is not a meritocracy, and that raising taxes on the rich will not hurt this country.

Warren Buffet famously pointed out that most CEOs pay fewer taxes than their secretaries, and that most companies pay a far, far lower tax rate than most would have you believe.

Many economists believe that a high Gini coefficient, which measures the amount of income inequality, is actually unhealthy for a nation.

There are plenty of experts out there that have specific proposals to fix this country. All we ask is that the right people listen.

&gt;Let me buy a plane ticket to any 3rd world country. I will gladly trade &gt;you for one of them who will come here and actually work hard instead &gt;of ""why not me?"" and ""where's my piece?"". You want to create more &gt;opportunity? Go start a business and hire some employees and produce &gt;something. You're not going to do it. People like you just bitch while &gt;others actually do.

Well, 1. people are trying to kick out illegal immigrants left and right.
2. I would LOVE to start a business, but BANKS AREN'T LENDING TO BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW! THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN A RECESSION!
3. I'm a hard worker. It's just that when an engineer works hard as a waiter at a restaurant, you have to question whether this society is working at peak efficiency.

&gt;(BTW, 20 years is a lot of time. Democratic party sold you out 15 &gt;years ago when they had NAFTA to ship your jobs overseas dummy. &gt;Both parties buttraping you and you still think one actually gives a shit &gt;about you.)

Free trade is good. Outsourcing labor is good if it's managed properly by the government. Both of them, in the long run, lead to a higher quality of life for each party, which is what we're all aiming for.

True,"Thanks for engaging in critical discussion! I'll try to address your points as best I can understand them.

&gt;As a Christian I'm actually looking forward to reclaiming the Earth during the Millennium Reign when the temple of God comes down with Messiah (Jesus) as ruler.

My issue with this statement is the assumption you bring to ancient Israeli culture from the New Testament. It's an issue that's at the very core of Christianity's understanding of the Old Testament: that God has this overarching plan that, even though the Jewish writers weren't aware of, is seeded with clues throughout the Old Testament, only to be fully revealed in the first century. 

&gt;Concerning the rest, such as the formation of the Bible... God used men to write His word. The Jews as custodians of the Oral Law did a fine job keeping that word. You are correct the rest developed over time. God choosing to speak to people in their time and day.

I think this thinking is highly naive and completely unsupported when you actually read the Old Testament within the context of the time and place it was composed. What's more, it is very clear that god could not have executed such a document, perfectly placing each word through scribes at different times, as there are exacerbating inconsistencies historically and theologically between the different books. The most glaring example of this is [Deuteronomy 23:3](http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-3.htm) which clearly forbids the Ammonites and Moabites from EVER entering the assembly of god's people. Some Palestinian tribes are allowed to join the nation of Israel if they follow the lifestyle of the Jewish people for three generations but for the Ammonites and Moabites Deuteronomy is explicit that even if they follow the law of god for 10 generations they still couldn't become part of the nation of Israel. The inconsistency is that when you get to the book of [Ruth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_(biblical_figure)), we have Moabites marrying and becoming apart of the assembly of Israel without any issue whatsoever. In fact Ruth marries Jewish men twice in the story so it doesn't appear to be uncommon at all. The real problem, outside of the apparent inconsistency between Deuteronomy and Ruth, is that Ruth is the great grandmother of King David, and conversely part of the lineage of Jesus. How then, does god forbid a clan of ancient Palestine from ever coming into fellowship with him, but then later stakes the lineage of Jesus on this very same group of people via Ruth? 

There are many other examples which one could pour over, and at the end of the day, like I've said elsewhere, you can always choose to ignore these issues in faith (although I would argue that's not what faith is but I'll save that for another discussion), but to me when I read these texts in their entirety I see less and less a god inspiring timeless wisdom and more and more people with agenda's that they bring god into. 

&gt;I would disagree with your focus on this point as well as the comparison to Platonic Dualism which as a Christian I don't agree with or find Christ advocating. The apostles and the early Church interpreted the earlier scriptures being illuminated with the appearance of Christ. Now that Christ had come, certain texts became clearer and easier to understand.

Some of my reply to this is covered by the above but I think you're getting too concerned with the dualism of platonic thought and not the most important part which is Metaphysics. While the influence of dualism is exceedingly apparent in Christianity simply by the fact that [Hell was not a concept that existed in Ancient Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell#Judaism), as is the fact that the concept of Christian Heaven is alien to them. Jewish teaching on the afterlife (and I may mangle this to some degree) is that people die, nothing happens, their bodies lay in wait, and then their bodies get resurrected. No soul, no heaven, no Hell. This is not only evidence of dualism but of Platonic metaphysics in the concept of the soul. The real crux of it all boils down to this though, Judaism in the Hellenistic world was starkly different in its monotheism. Platonic metaphysics and monotheism are, excuse the phrase, a match made in heaven. Platonic metaphysics is the idea that although you can draw a triangle, it is not the only type of triangle in the world and that the idea of a triangle super cedes any real triangle here in the physical realm. Conversely, there were many gods in western culture during the first centuries BCE/CE, and to everyone outside of Israel, their god was just another to throw on the pile. Christianity, in the colliding of these ideas, is the extension of the Judaic god from a god tied to a land and a people, to a metaphysical god which super cedes all. 

&gt;I want so bad to agree with this statement but just can't. Its as if you are calling the Nicaea council the root of today's Christianity.

Umm, how is it not? They are responsible for the canon of texts you consider sacred, they are most certainly the root of Western Christianity. Otherwise you would be more than likely be practicing gnostic christianity or maybe even modern day Ethiopian christianity. The real issue is that the christianity you would be practicing today would have had to be tied to political power, and as I've clearly outlined, Nicea and the canonization of the Bible you read were intertwined which causes me to be suspect. 

&gt;IMO. The Christian church at this time was just relieved of persecution. So you are saying that these Christians who believed there faith so strongly they would be tortured for it (and had been for hundreds of years at this point) have a political interest in Constantine keeping order in his empire? You lost me. Makes no sense to me at all.

Y decides to explore further North, settling down in what is now Europe and kicking out the native Neanderthals (sound familiar?), but only after mating with their women to produce a distinctly new subspecies of humans.

True,"Are you not familiar with any of Israel's history? 

The Zionist movement encouraged Jewish Europeans to emigrate to the areas now known as Israel or Palestine starting with the first Aliya in 1882 (IIRC). 

Following this, massive numbers of Jewish Europeans and Jewish Arabs then immigrated to the disputed area. After WW2 in particular many Jewish Europeans didn't want to stay in Europe any more (quelle surprise) and made their way to the place we like so much to discuss. 

One thing led to another and in 1948 Israel declared independence. 

The people who lived in the disputed land were, during this process evicted and usurped. These people are generally known as Palestinians but their name is not important. They lived in what is now Israel and the leaders of the immigrant communities had them kicked out and stole their land. 

When someone is the victim of a theft and they fight back, no one with even a rudimentary understanding of morality or ethics would label them the aggressor when they take action to remedy the injustice inflicted upon them. 

Ergo, the wars that Israel has been involved in since its inception, were wars of the invaded or their pals, compatriots or sympathisers against a foreign entity which inserted itself unjustly into the landscape. All ultimately provoked by the land thief's presence.

I'm kind of worried about your image of Europe. Sure, always mind your own safety while traveling, but this advice seems to be based on random, unfounded fear mongering. Which parts of Europe have you been?

&gt; ... - almost everyone in Europe speaks impeccable English.

No. Although it is true for many west European countries and the larger cities, there are still plenty of countries -- for example Hungary, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Italy, etc. -- where English really isn't that well spoken. But don't let it hold you back; most people are willing to make an effort, and books like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Point-Travellers-Language-Original-Dictionary/dp/3980880273) can ease your traveling every now and then.

&gt; Travel as light as you can, and take two credit/debit cards stored in separate locations - you can get cash from an ATM in almost every country.

This. Think twice about everything you put in your backpack. Is it inexpensive, easily bought, and you only expect to used it accidentally? Don't bother bringing it.


As for actually planning your travels: Why do you want to go to Europe? Are there particular countries, sights, events you want to visit? Are you mainly interested in culture or nature? Try to read a bit about the different countries, and for example focus on relevant sight-seeings, famous historical figures, festivals, etc. Concerning the latter, you might want to time your visits to coincide with a national festival (fun!), or the opposite (easier accommodation, quieter).

True,"The fiction is not that there aren't variations in the physical appearance of human beings, but that these variations are as a result of ""race"", particularly with regard to skin colour. In fact, studies have shown that there is a far greater degree of biological diversity between people in certain African countries than there is between Europeans and other Africans, meaning that skin colour as an indicator of human diversity is utterly irrelevant.

Biological diversity has far more to do with the environment that a particular tribe or society had to adapt to than the particular swathe of the globe they inhabit. A great example of this is the fiction that ""Africans"" are great distance runners, when in fact it is only one or two countries that produce great marathon runners, and those all come from tiny regions of those countries in which the environment has caused slight genetic divergence.

So, it can be seen that the premise of ""race"" simply doesn't stand up to scrutiny even when it comes to something as outwardly observable and measurable as physical appearance and ability. Why then would it come into play with something as infinitely more complex and nuanced like cognitive performance and personality? Short answer: it does not. There is no such thing as race.

One thing that I noticed consistently is the tendency of the liberals (""pseudoseculars"") is to label anyone who defends Hindus as a Hindutva type and make liberal accusations linking them to the Nazis. As someone who has actually read a lot about European history around then, I find equating, say, Modi, to Hitler is more than ridiculous - it is malicious. If you look for pogroms, the closest one is in Pakistan, where the Hindu minority has been almost wiped out. This figure is in the millions and ranks more with Milosevic and Hitler and not Modi. But pointing this out is likely to make the Indian liberal groups label me a Hindutva guy - I don't really care, but it tells me something about the self-styled liberals themselves. It is natural for me to assume, perhaps wrongly,  that you are one of them.

To your question on why we should measure ourselves by the standards of the neighborhood, there is no other objective way, IMO. Whether we like it or not, the three, or actually four countries have a shared history and geography, and until 1947, allowed unrestrained diffusion of people. Actually, even with all that, were it not for geography, I'd agree with you.

In any situation involving adversaries, the one with the lowest standards of engagment sets the standards in the long run especially if one of the groups regards it as an existential struggle. So, I see the Hindutva movement as a reaction, which is why I think the best way to get rid of it is to make India truly secular, which excludes inanities like minorities having first dibs on the national resources, as Manmohan Singh said.

It reflects extremely poorly on Riot as a company when people see the SC2 and CS tournaments going so well and LoL not even being played on its first scheduled day because of a gamebreaking technical issue. Oh Riot doesn't have technicians out there so it's not their fault? Guess what, they promoted the SHIT out of this event and put their name on the line for it and now their name has been dragged through the mud yet again by one of their competitive events.

 They SHOULD fucking have technicians out there a WEEK before this event to make sure that the beta chinese client will be operational and that the servers will be able to handle the minimal amount of stress that this tournament will cause (seriously 10 computers playing LoL is going to crash your server due to stress? Is that even supposed to be funny?). They deserve all the blame that is being put on them because over 20,000 people gave up their evenings to watch this event, some in the EU even stayed up all night to watch it because they were that excited about Riot's game, only to be disappointed by the company yet again.

With a few notable exceptions (such as the UK and India), the only ""blue"" states are the colonial states, and I bet if you look into them, you'll see that they're largely controlled by a single (non-native) ethnic group - as is the case for the US.

&gt; The only thing that would change this is a another Holocaust, which will not happen

I find this statement incredibly naive. If you told a 19th-century emancipated German Jew about the Shoah, he would *never* believe you.

And either way, a Holocaust is certainly *not* required to shift the tide back to the nation-state model. Just a simple shift in public opinion, perhaps followed by immigration reform, and that's it.

True,"&gt;Did you miss the bit about 'Founding Fathers', he is talking about the country and it's government, not the 'society'. This is pure deflection on your part.

That's fucking bullshit. You're a lying cunt. Look at his quote:

&gt;The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America, with churches serving as vital institutions **that would eclipse the state in importance.**

If they're eclipsing the state, that makes it a separate institution from the state, so he is NOT talking about the government.

&gt;&gt;He has no problem with the UN being merely a forum for talks.

&gt;Wrong again, he is against the UN because he wants US to declare its own wars and not ask the UN for permission.

How about you quote my entire excerpt instead of quoting the first half out of context:

&gt;He has no problem with the UN being merely a forum for talks. **What he has a problem with is countries invading and attacking other countries under UN authority.**

Paul is the most anti-war representative in Congress.

&gt;&gt;Because people who come into the country illegally shouldn't be rewarded with citizenship for their children.

&gt;So the Constituion is icky because you don't like some of its outcomes!

The constitution can be amended! Do you support amending the constitution to improve the laws. I'm guessing not. I'm guessing you're just making excuses for opposing this rational move, because you actually support more illegal immigration.

In any case, the 14th amendment actually states that any one born within the JURISDICTION of the US becomes a citizen. This exempted those born to foreign diplomats, as their parents were under the jurisdiction of a foreign nation while being on US soil, and under this legal reasoning, this would exempt those born to parents in the US illegally.

&gt;&gt;He's not for the gold standard.

&gt;Right, he just want metals to be legal tender!

Did you watch the clip I linked? He wants ANY currency to be legal to use:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50kXVg3lGgc#t=1m55s

He recently introduced the [""The Free Competition in Currency Act of 2011""](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1098:)

Read it for yourself. You can see that it does not discriminate on what currency should be legal to use. It states that ALL currencies should be legal.

&gt;&gt;human activity probably does play a role in stimulating the current fluctuations.The question is: how much? Rather than taking a “sky is falling” approach

&gt;Typical right wing strawman, seen it many many times. First trivialize the whole thing as 'probably' when there is tons of evidence and then accuse the other group of a 'chicken littles' because of their concern exceeds what right-wingers prefer.

So because he doesn't panic like you, it's a straw man? 

Unlike you, he realize that there's more than a few oil companies with a vested interest in what position politicians and the public take on global warming, and know there are companies that stand to make BILLIONS of dollars, in things such as carbon trading, if new spending programs and regulations are instated to 'combat global warming'.

Just because you jump on every PC band wagon that comes along to try to gain peer approval, and have total intolerance to any views that slightly deviate from popular opinion, doesn't mean every one else is as lacking of integrity and independent-mindedness as you.

&gt;&gt;His position on abortion is far more nuanced

&gt;It's not, its very straightforward.

No, it's highly nuanced, as the interview segment I linked showed. You're an intolerant hack though, so you're not willing to listen any view points from someone on the other ""side"".

&gt;""In Congress, I have authored legislation that seeks to define life as beginning at conception, H.R. 1094. I am also the prime sponsor of H.R. 300, which would negate the effect of Roe v Wade by removing the ability of federal courts to interfere with state legislation to protect life.""

Right, and he's also written:

http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul301.html

&gt;So while Roe v. Wade is invalid, a federal law banning abortion across all 50 states would be equally invalid.

Not that any of this matters for you. You filter out any thing that contradicts your ridiculous caricature of all GOPers, and only focus on the tidbits that fit your stereotype.

&gt;&gt;It reduces the amount of investable capital there is in the economy, thus reducing wage growth.

&gt;Total bullshit, look up actual wage growth and compare it to income tax rates, you would see a pretty contrary picture.

You fucking idiot, there is a very strong correlation between low taxes/spending and high economic growth.

http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/function.htm#VIII

The evidence presented in this paper provides an alternative explanation: Increases in the size of government have slowed economic growth. Our findings raise several questions for those who adhere to the view that the recent growth declines were inevitable. First, if the falling growth rates were merely a reflection of the secular decline of mature economies, why did the growth rates of the countries with the largest expansions in government decline the most? (See [Exhibit 6](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-6.gif).) Second, if size of government does not matter much, how does one explain the persistent negative relationship between size of government (and its change) and the growth of GDP for both high-income democracies and a diverse set of countries including both industrial nations and LDCs? (See Exhibits [4](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-4.gif), [5](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-5.gif), [7](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-7.gif), and [8](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-8.gif).) Why did the economies of Ireland, United Kingdom (in the 1980s), and more recently, New Zealand reverse course and achieve higher growth rates when government expenditures were reduced as a share of GDP? (See [Exhibit 9](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-9.gif).) If size of government is unimportant, why do all of the world's fast-growing economies have governments of modest size? (See [Exhibit 10](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-10.gif).) In contrast with the OECD nations, why is there no trend toward the expansion in the size of government among the rapid-growth economies?

&gt;While the rest of the world is booming, Europe lags behind. France, Germany and Italy are stagnating, and so do Denmark, Sweden and Finland. All gained less than 44% prosperity from 1984 to 2004.

&gt;""Big government"" is the main cause of Europe's weak performance. The oversized Public Sector lacks productivity and the growing bureaucracy is undoing the productivity gains of the Private Sector, eradicating all of its outstanding performance and productiveness.

Socialism doesn't work. You don't make a country prosperous through pansy welfare programs.

&gt; 'well its not in the contitution so fuck individual rights', go back to regressive states and lobby hardcore extremists to change their view but leave me alone!

He swore an oath to uphold the constitution, which means he must respect it, even when he disagrees with how a state is using its constitutional rights!

You prefer politicians to break their oath to the constitution when it's convenient for your agenda, not realizing the harm this causes to every one by reducing the authority of all constitutional protections.

When the constitution is ignored, as a result of people like you calling on politicians to break their oath to it, the result is the current situation of the federal government criminalizing marijuana, denying people Habeas Corpus, conducting warrantless wire-tapping, and engaging in decade long wars.

Paul's position is the constitutional one: that states are allowed to enact bad laws, like criminalizing sodomy or marijuana, and that the federal government should end its war on drugs and war on terror.

This is the only realistic chance a nation has. Giving all power over to the federal government will give you some things you want, like legalized sodomy, but it will also lead to things like the War on Drugs where states aren't able to legalize marijuana.

There's no way to have an all powerful federal government and guarantee it won't use its power to reduce liberty, because other people's ideas of what freedom and rights are will differ from yours. 

At least with 50 independent states, you will always have some that afford people freedom.

Israel is a classically multicultural immigrant society, whose state religious identification is Jewish. This is despite official tolerance of all religious faiths in the country. Nonetheless Israel does not describe itself as a multicultural state for strong ideological reasons. This makes it difficult to speak of diversity within the Jewish Israeli community.

Try and encourage an appreciation of difference abroad and it becomes that much more confounding.

*News dude:* In the United Kindom, Shariah tribunals act side by side with British law. The islamic councils are approved by the government but critics fear violations of human rights occur. Our team in London gained access to the inside of one of these islamic councils where terror convicts and illegal islamic organizations operate behind the curtains.

00:27 _Report starts_

00:33 _English_ 

00:41 *Voice over:* London. A pulsating, inclusive city in Europe. Here there's freedom of expression and freedom of religion. 

00:57 He calls this a court and he calls himself a judge. This is one of at least 85 functioning Sharia courts in the United Kingdom. There are probably many more and reports suggest the numbers are rapidly. 

01:17 He shows us examples of sentences he has given. There are religious marriages and divorces which are not binding according to British law. They may be inheritance settlements and family feuds where a decision demands that the parties agree. Many muslims wish to live by islamic rules. That is what the Sharia courts are meant to give advice for.

01:42 There are no formal requirements to the judge's qualifications but he has to know the Quran.

01:47 _English_

01:59 Most muslims don't even know that the Sharia courts exist.

02:03 _English_

02:11 But they exist, and the human rights organization ""One law for all"" is worried.

02:16 _English_

02:22 There are different kinds of Sharia councils or tribunals, often spoken of as courts. 

02:29 _English_

02:34 Freedom of religion is an important principle. The jews have for many years had their religious councils. The Sharia councils are not part of British law but are approved as long as they do not violate British law. But who checks that?

02:50 _English_

03:15 On a street corner in one of London's most diverse boroughs the NRK find the community around Anjem Choudary's Shariah court. Here, audience are mustered up for tonight's meeting. They shall be given help to find the meaning of life.

As the sun sets we tag along back to the basement that acts as a Sharia court. The community's Sharia judge has the following message for young, seeking muslims:

03:48 _English_

04:05 They are few and have little power but wish to enact geographic Sharia zones in the United Kingdom. Among the speakers to night is a convicted terrorist. 

04:18 _English_ 

04:35 The west is the enemy. Only God's law applies, we're told tonight. The next day the same location acts as a court and one of the speakers as judge. 

04:48 _English_

05:17 Anjem Choudary led the group ""Al Muhajiroun"" which was deemed illegal last year. Now he runs ""Muslims against crusades"". Since 1999, 24 people in his circles have been convicted of islam-inspired terrorism. That is the man who interprets Islams holy scriptures and tell people right from wrong.

05:39 _English_

06:28 When 1,000 British muslims were asked in a poll whether they wanted that United Kingdom should obey Sharia, 280 -- more than one in four -- answered 'yes.' But the majority does not want that.

06:45 _English_

07:00 The government did want to be interviewed by the NRK for this report, but says that it is out of the question to make the Sharia laws part of British law. 

07:10 _English_

07:35 *Newsdude:* Gry Blekastad Almås, how extreme are these councils -- or courts -- when you look at them as a whole?

*Newschick:* My impression is that the community we have described in this report is among the more extreme. There certainly are councils in many nuances, and there is absolutely reason to believe that there also are councils that act how they were supposed to: as councils for muslims who want to live my muslim rules in a western society; in the United Kingdom. 

*Newsdude:* But if a part of them operate within British law, how can they still be problematic?

*Newschick:* The problem is how they are understood by those who use these councils. Are they understood as councils? Then it's probably not a problem. But are they understood as rules that one has follow regardless of what British law says outside these courts then it may be problematic. For example, we know that marriages and divorces are ""performed"" [Couldn't think of a better word]. They are not valid according to British law; only within the confines of Islam. That may be problematic. The same applied to inheritance settlements, for instance. WE know that by islamic rules women shall inherit less than their brothers. And one has to ask oneself, is is ok that these courts agree that women return to their violent husbands, for instance, where this happens without the husbands facing British courts?

*Newsdude*: Can you try to quickly explain why the debate is almost non-existant?

*Newschick:* It as been striking during working on this case how we've tried to get people to state their opinions on this matter. We have tried the government at the ministry of justice; we've tried the opposition via spokesmen for politics regarding law and justice. We've also tried moderate muslims. But this indicates that this is such a difficult topic to talk about that we haven't been able to get any answers.",t5_2qh2p,1317577091,False,,1427676366,,t1_c2oa2c7,atheism,t3_kyhcf,,1,0,0,0,0sse,1,c2oa2c7,t3_kyhcf,False

True,"Lol. Western culture is succeeding because or infant mortality rates are on the decline, our life expectancy is on the incline, and we are developing technology that will help asure the survival of the human race once the planet can no longer sustain us. (as well as strength and power relative to other cultures, survival of the fittest, etc) 

Native Americans didn't have a successful culture. They were destroyed by the Alpha culture of Westernized Europe.

I'm sorry for offending you by saying ""you are so unbelievably ignorant.""

But, lets get down to brass tacks: You said ""You are arguing that they should be forced into our way of life, which is failing""

Then you flip-flopped your answer by saying ""To a degree, I don't believe in success or failure, or I don't believe in TOTAL success or TOTAL failure, I believe there is constantly a shifting balance between the two.""

**So which is it? Do believe westernized culture failing or succeeding? If so, why?**

I tend to think that a successful culture is one that can overcome the aggression of other cultures. (survival of the fittest) The only reason you are where you are is because of western culture. The only reason you live as long as you do is because of westernized medicine. The only way you can talk to me now is because of westernized technology. For proof that westernized culture is succeeding,go to a library. check out a book. Learn. Develop. Create. Live. Breath. Be Free. 

If you think western culture is failing, that also means that you think Democracy, Socialism, Capitalism, Liberty, and Technology are failing. 

Just about all cultures in the world today have been influenced by western culture in one way or another. (except for aborigines and the like, which have to fight to survive every day)

**I would like to know why you think western culture is failing?**

""I am concerned with how humans are given free food by nature and how they no longer have that option and have to buy food""

What? This doesn't even make sense. All food comes from nature. None of it is ""free"" Even when I go and pick berries from a forest, I still had to ""work"" for my food by finding and picking the berries. If I decide to milk a cow, and then trade the milk for berries, then I have just paid for the berries with milk. And they still came from nature. There is no such thing as ""free."" The only difference is that I have converted once type of work into another type of work via trade.

One of the reasons westernized culture is successful in feeding its people is because it has employed a very efficient system for trading goods and services. It's called currency. (And if you think currency is failing, idk what to tell you. )

The earth has enough food to feed Africans. (There is so much food in America, that they actually PAY farmers to NOT grow food) It's just that there is not enough food IN AFRICA for them to feed themselves.

Who told you that there was such a thing as ""free food?"" 

Also, how old are you?

True,"About my picture:  Ow, my pride!  I thought it was a decent picture!  :P   I'm sorry if you've had tough times on OKC yourself, but you shouldn't make such sweeping generalizations about me.  Nothing is a bigger turnoff for me than the idea of ""hunting for sex"" or whatever; I'm a relationship man through and through, and if I one day get sex out of it, then so much the better.  I guess I'm looking for something like what an old married couple have: a trusting bond, friendship, and intimacy, and if there's sex too, then that's just peachy.  If a lady's not gonna reply to me 'cause she shallow enough to judge me on my photo alone, then I'm glad she's not in my life.  

I do go out and try to do things IRL as well, but I've been doing this for... I dunno, six years now in university alone, and my success rate has been less than admirable (and that includes my stints in Europe and Japan.  *Japan*, for christ's sake, where I couldn't get a GF!  Lots of friends, but no GFs).  That's not to say that I'm some sort of social pariah or anything, it's more like ""god damn, do I *ever* have the knack for finding girls already in relationships or aren't really that attractive to me or only want to be friends with me!  Pretty awesome to know that I'm still a social enough guy to be around, though!""  I guess aiming for girls with quality is part of the problem because a lot of other guys are aiming there too.  

And it's cool to be friends with girls!  There's nothing I like better than knowing that I have people to talk to or trade class notes with or whatever.  But after a while, you start to think ""you know, as much as it's awesome to have all these friends, I need something more.""  And that's where the need for a GF comes in.  

So, after all these years of having a heck of a lot of time on my hands and being by myself, I thought ""Well, you can't be worse off than before in the GF department, so why not hoist a flag and see what happens?""  I'm not magically expecting a miracle, but still, the thought of having a girlfriend or SO in my life is too tempting not to at least TRY this kind of thing on top of what I do IRL.  I'm a good man, and I deserve the happiness of having a good relationship someday, and I am trying to achieve that.  Might not be soon (and it probably won't be), but goddamnit, I am going to *try!*

And as for ""lol OKC sucks"", if you have a better suggestion for a dating site, I'd like to hear it.  All the other ones I've looked at are call girls or ladies in their late 40s, and I don't swing that way.

True,"&gt; for whatever reason, possibly the same as I'm getting downvoted for

You're getting downvoted for making a wild claim that is counterintuitive and failing to back it up.

And speaking of backing it up, the article you linked to doesn't do a very good job of that. Off the top of my head, here are some of the things I took issue with:

* It begins by saying, more or less, that Europeans get more done than Americans, in less work hours. Then throughout the article, not a single country other than Germany is cited as an example to back up this claim. So the author picked what is one of, if not the most productive European country, with a notoriously high work ethic, and extrapolated that to all of Europe and attributed it to their work-life balance laws rather than, say, their work ethic. You then extrapolated that single example even further to argue that countries that are work-life balance friendly are more productive than those who aren't. Call me a cinic, but I'd like to see productivity for all the other European countries thrown into the mix before allowing for that kind of conclusion, especially considering the criticism that Germans have been leveling at some of their Eropean counterparts as being lazy.
* And speaking of numbers, not a single one was cited in this article to back up the claim that Germans produce a similar or superior output to that of Americans. The author makes the claim many times but does not provide a single source to support it. Tell me how productivity is being measured, show me what those productivity numbers are for America and Germany (and preferably some other countries as well), and a source I can turn to to verify your claim. As far as I know, this article is nothing more than the author's opinion, based on his anecdotal observation in a single company in Germany, that he is then extrapolating to all of Germany and Europe as a whole.

Then there's this brilliant piece of logic:
&gt; Geoghegan believes Germans understate their work hours, and Americans overstate work hours. Yet both countries are getting roughly the same amount of work done. This means that Germans are actually doing more, while working less. 

Umm, wrong. If Germans are understating their hours and Americans are overstating their hours, then Germans are in  reality **less** productive than they are stating and Americans are **more** productive than they are stating.

TL;DR: extrapolate a single example to all of Europe, provide no data to back up even that one example, and tie it together with an error in logic. Genius.

Edit: left out part of the quote from the article.

True,"the punch that knocked him out didn't land on the gloves. It caught the gloves but the majority of the contact area was directly across the ear, it was almost a open palm strike that was borderline a behind the ear shot. Those things knock your balance straight out of you.

Barker isn't even close to having the defence or technical prowess of Winky, I've seen a good collection of his other fights. Winky is slippery, has good counters, long arms and is unorthodox. Barker stands still in front on you with his hands hand and slightly tucked, not even close to Winky. If fighters that are never going amount to being top of the Brits or Europeans can hit him, then Sergio should have to problem at all. 

Sergio can put his punches together well, that's what you do against people who shell up like Barker. Abraham, Sturm, Winky, Clottey and so on. He just didn't and he had no reason not to do it, it's not as if Barker is a volume puncher or has any sort of power. I like Sergio a lot and going by how much Barker was slowing down (I do think he was hurt from the previous round) it was going to be a sure win if it went the distance. But it wasn't a 99-91 landslide and Sergio shouldn't have looked as flat at he did against Barker considering his P4P status.

True,"From wikipedia:

&gt; Human evolution is the phenotypic history of the genus Homo, **including the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species** and as a unique category of hominids (""great apes"") and mammals. The study of human evolution uses many scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, linguistics and genetics.[1]

&gt; The term ""human"" in the context of **human evolution refers to the genus Homo**, but studies of human evolution usually include other hominids, such as the Australopithecines, from which the genus Homo had diverged by about 2.3 to 2.4 million years ago in Africa.[2][3] Scientists have estimated that humans branched off from their common ancestor with chimpanzees about 5–7 million years ago. Several species and subspecies of Homo evolved and are now extinct, introgressed or extant. Examples include Homo erectus (which inhabited Asia, Africa, and Europe) and Neanderthals (either Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) (which inhabited Europe and Asia). Archaic Homo sapiens evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago.

&gt; The **dominant view among scientists concerning the origin of anatomically modern humans is the hypothesis known as ""Out of Africa""**, recent African origin of modern humans, ROAM, or recent African origin hypothesis,[4][5][6] which argues that Homo sapiens arose in Africa and migrated out of the continent around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, replacing populations of Homo erectus in Asia and Neanderthals in Europe.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Evolution

Like Wikipedia says, the popular hypothesis is ""Out of Africa"", but there is also some evidence that the West of Australia might also be the starting point. Although we have good ideas, no one really has precise knowledge of how our emergence occurred, and of what paths were taken when and where/etc.

True,"Attorney here; heavy small to mid-sized business background prior to starting my own general practice, and everything here OP is claiming is not adding up...at all. Lengthy discussion of proof below. 

The repeated refusal of OP to provide a relatively simple document of proof - such as a redacted tax return, which would reveal simple information such as income and liabilities - is even more suspicious. I do this often for some current clients involved in litigation. When I say it takes all of 5 minutes and reveals zero personal information, I'm not exaggerating.  

Here's one glaring example for those who may downvote me: He (she?) claims to not deduct any business expenses because it's too much effort? He's okay with paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra taxes because ""roads need to be built so why the fuck not.""?

I counseled dozens of businesses worth significantly more on tax issues, and which operated in some pretty tricky regulatory and tax waters. The “paperwork” burden involved, in the simplest terms, involved nothing more than stapling a copy of their annual corporate credit card statement cards to the back of their cover letter to their accountant. His attempt to rationalize the “burden” of claiming businesses expenses is more trouble than it’s worth is about as believable of someone saying the “burden” of winning $500,000 in the lottery is more trouble than it’s worth. Because that’s precisely what he’s saying. And it’s nonsense. It has nothing to do with not paying a fair share of the tax burden. It has everything to do with competing in the marketplace with businesses who *are* taking those deductions. No business would survive paying significantly more to Uncle Sam than his peers; I promise you. 

So he's claiming he pays 35% in corporate taxes (I've also never known a single business, no matter how socially-minded, to pay that high of a percentage in practice, particularly on gross income on which they are claiming no business expenses!), pays his 98 employees 20% above average, pays for employee medical expenses out of his own pocket, and does not claim charitable giving on his tax returns (at least to the degree he suggests he donates), AND does not claim business expenses that based on his after tax income and lines of work I estimate should total at LEAST $1 Million. 

My reaction as both an attorney and business owner: complete rubbish. The math does not add up. His businesses would fail in a matter of months.  Competition that offers good, but average, salaries and that exploit tax benefits would destroy him in a matter of months. 

Another glaring example: his claims about the legal structure of his companies are extraordinarily vague, and represent what I would call a teenager's understanding of how ""shell"" companies actually work. He's claimed to have both restaurants and the remainder of his companies held by the same ""shell,"" but in practice this is extremely uncommon for both regulatory and legal reasons. Why? To put it succinctly, there are very good reasons why people separate heavily regulated/high liability businesses, such as restaurants, from less regulated/low liability businesses, such as media. The liability concerns there are staggering, the structure so rudimentary and ill-conceived based on OP’s stated businesses, and so devoid of understanding the bad legal and financial ramifications that his claimed company structure alone gives him away. 

He also seems to suggest he’s in the US, based solely on describing himself as the 1% and how he’s an immigrant from Eastern Europe since the 1990’s. But his vernacular is entirely U.K., such as the spelling of “behaviour” and conversational use of the word “bastard,” a very common conversational U.K. term/very uncommon conversational U.S. term. A person in the states for 15+ years from Eastern Europe does not use U.K. vernacular. 

Also, he claims that he went to college in Eastern Europe and lived with his family to save on costs and is 28 years old. I’m not sure how he came here in the 1990’s then if I read his other comments correctly. 

His language is also suspiciously under-educated and juvenile for a person who claims to run a business of his size and lobs fairly poor business advice to the board here. I’ll try to edit this with some better examples if I get time. For instance, “Good karma breeds good karma” and “dude just keep an open mind. People are people” stinks of Reddit trolling; in real life no business owner pulling in millions a year would use that kind of vague platitude. Successful people (key word: “successful”) in business use facts, results, concrete information they can act on. Business people know karma has nothing to do with success; it’s doing your job/running your business better than the next guy.   

He further has some pretty specific knowledge of modern video games that is completely inconsistent with someone claiming to have busted his ass working at and forming companies since the age of 16. He claims to have a few restaurants, really? Has anyone here opened or owned a restaurant? Owners aren’t sitting on their laurels at 6 p.m. and taking off on Sundays, popping in when they’re feeling a bit nostalgic for the kitchen, and, for chrissakes, “partying” with the cooks on occasion. C’mon. And he apparently has enough time to play video games, clean his fairly large home himself, volunteer at “the local homeless shelter”, AND teach ESL classes? No, I’m sorry, this simply wouldn’t be possible based on the businesses he claims to run, and I don’t care how many managers he’s got. Show me a multi-million dollar CEO who’s leisure time includes video games, uses “lol” and “dude” with ease, casually claims his businesses don’t take tax deductions because “roads need to be built so why the fuck not,” and has time to volunteer 2+ days a week AND take off Sundays and only work the hours of 8-6, and I’ll show you a completely (terrible) liar. 

I can only assume upvotes and willingness of commenters to engage here are the result of probably college or high school readers that don’t have much experience in the business world. I can assure you OP does not exist, and I’d encourage you to thoroughly disregard any advice he’s given here. Much of it is dead wrong. 

Tl; dr You’ve been trolled, and not very well I might add. 

EDIT: OP has been furiously editing his original post and subsequent comments after I posted the above in some pretty poor attempts to cover his tracks. Honest posters wouldn't do that. Someone here to honestly discuss his business would not have made the above inconsistent comments in the first instance, and...ahem...definitely wouldn't have time or gumption to answer and edit posts in the considerable volume he has. Note what proven AMA'ers have done: short, concise posts. No or minimal editing of their OP even when challenged except to provide proof. Answer with specificity. And so on. OP has failed to do that in any way.

True,"Yes. Absolutely. Especially in the social circle that I hang out with. Most of the guys in my social group are either Gay/Bi or hardcore athletes. It's not as big of a deal in the GBLT community since everyone gets laid there it seems but for straight men who still follow the traditional notions of testosterone fueled gorilla fucking masculinity, it's huge.

There is this idea that women and gay men have the easiest time getting casual sex so it's not really a big deal if an average looking woman is able to hook up with X amount of guys in Y amount of time. I know a lot of the guys in my social circles actively seek these type of women/men out because it's easier so it's not really considered a skill for you guys to pick up men. One of the few guys friends I have who knows I'm bi has expressed to me many times how he wishes he was gay because men are easier. Whether this notion is misplaced or not, it is a common perception.

It is absolutely considered an achievement for an average looking guy to hook up with lots of women. Bedding a woman for us males is considered to be a learnable skill, not something inherent to your being - that is why there is a community dedicated to teaching men how to pick up women. Like any other skill that can be boiled down to numbers, the more women you sleep with the more highly you are looked upon.

True,"&gt; so people have more personal cash to decide if they want to give to a charity or not.

Disclaimer: I work in international development, we get substantial funding from DfID.  Needless to say however I do not speak for my employer with this post.

Can't post at length as it's nearly bedtime, but one thing I will throw out to add to the discussion is that DfID have extremely rigorous M&amp;E requirements attached to their grants, in a way that individual givers do not and probably never will.  

Institutional donors tend to be relative far along the curve in terms of intl development research in terms of what actually works, what doesn't ""go into the pockets of warlords"", what is most sustainable, accountable, etc and decide on how they allocate money accordingly.

Individual givers tend to be prompted to donate by photos of dying babies; they are more likely to be swayed to give cash by  disaster/emergency appeals than unglamorous longer-term work such as capacity building.  OK, this sounds hideously patronising I know, and I don't mean to imply _nobody_ who supports charities does so with an analytical head on, but speak to anyone who works in fundraising - the ""kids, cats and cancer"" stereotype exists for a reason, FR gets more results working on emotion than on data tables of 15-year impact assessments.

Also, institutional donors tend to commit big sums over, say, 5 years, which means you can budget and plan projects over a longer term; with IG, you can hope to minimise attrition, but you can't really guarantee your direct debits will still be there.  Institutional donors will have an overview of various agencies and projects and may work with or create joint bids / projects, so the ""left hand knows what the right is doing""; IG, less likely.  Can work out better in ROI terms too - you might have one or two people working on an EU bid for six months, coming back with 4 million euro, meanwhile you've got a dozen people in your IG team mustering a half a mil in that timeframe.

This is all a roundabout way of saying even if reduced govt aid budget but increased personal donations results in the overall sum of aid being exactly the same, you might end up with more inefficient, unsustainable work on the ground.

Of course I'm not suggesting it is all one sided, obviously one could argue along similar lines in the opposite direction, such as govt donors potentially allocating money based on who will reward their country with trade/contracts rather than who needs it the most.  Or the longer timeframes, more bureacracy and bigger sums meaning a ""bad donation"" (giving money to a charity that turns out to be useless) is a bigger deal and isn't corrected as quickly.  Also, IG income is more likely to be unrestricted funding, which is essential for agility.",t5_2qhqb,1317601227,False,,1427677877,,t1_c2od4pi,unitedkingdom,t3_kylsr,,15,0,0,0,stevekeiretsu,15,c2od4pi,t3_kylsr,True

True,"In the soviet union there are 2 main reasons, both very closely related. 

First, the development of capitalism by the time of the 1905 and 1917 revolutions was not advanced. There was some question among Russian radicals during the late 1800's whether Russia could skip the capitalistic phase and head right into socialism. This movement, these radicals (Narodniks) believed, would be led by the peasantry, who had been recently freed from serfdom. This idea, however, clashes with a basic fundamental principle of Marxism: the very capitalistic economy which necessitates, brings into existence and then oppresses a working class gives that class the tools to organize. It is important to remember that Marx applauds capitalism for its ability to bring Europe out of feudalism. The Peasantry weren't much interested anyway, their individualism made them weary of outsiders and they often regarded the Tsar as a friend, even a supernatural being.

So, by the turn of the century, most organizational power was being concentrated on building professional revolutionaries who would then organize the budding working class. In 1905, the revolution was moderately successful, establishing the soviets, which gave workers a outlet to have a say in how their factories (and, to a degree, the broader economy) would be run. However, Russia was still living under a Tsar, people were still being oppressed, and the working class was still relatively tiny. This and brings me to the second reason communism failed in Russia. The revolutionary moment came to a head in 1917, and a workers state was established, but they had to win a civil war to seal the deal. And who fought in this war? The most devoted workers, those that were willing to give their lives for socialism. And they did. The Red Army won, but not before half of the army was wiped out, the country was decimated, and there was little sense how to progress. The very workers who were set to take power were dead or unable to lead.

It fell on the earlier leaders of the movement to establish power, to try to run the workers state, even though there were few able-bodied workers left to run it. Lenin and Trotsky were the most popular leaders of the movement and thus became leaders (with several others) and power was concentrated within this small group. Regardless of what anyone will ever tell you, a certain degree of organizing is having the ability to plant ideas in people's heads. Lenin won debates by waiting people out and never giving up on his ideas, no matter how long into the night he needed to wait and no matter how much of a minority he was in. Trotsky developed theories on virtually every idea of the revolution and Russian communism down to a t. Stalin has been a rising star among the young professional revolutionaries of the earlier period, he knew how to organize people, those close to him and those far away. And Stalin needed only wait a few years to get the power that he wanted. Lenin died soon after the war, and Stalin's rise to power was swift, banishing Trotsky not too long after. This concentration of power led to the degeneration of the russian workers state (Trotsky's words).

Stalin used the image of Lenin to gain popular support, and by very precisely aligning his group with the majority or minority view (that would best serve his power grab), he was able to win the supporters that he needed to permanently concentrate and centralize government. Thus, the country descended into extreme centralization, with nearly no democracy. Democracy is socialism, this is why the USSR failed.

True,"Indian independence did not have as a part of it armed resistance, it is in fact one of the great models of the success of non-violent resistance. Vietnam is currently ranked 140th in the world in terms of personal liberties so again you're making my point. And the Philippines did not gain independence though a violent war with the US, the Treaty of Manila was not the result of violence but as the general trend worldwide of decolonization. Likewise, Africa did not get independence *because* of armed resistance and the continent has been hampered by armed resistance ever since. Additionally Africa is hardly a ""free"" area (with some exceptions obviously) so is hardly a good example. 

And the US? What movement in the US was advanced by violence in the last century and a half? Unions clashed with privately purchased goons and the occasional payed off police force at the end of the 19th century but what resolved the clashes was elections of trust-busters not the violence themselves. The Civil Rights movement didn't get its success from violence either so what modern American movement was advanced through violence?

As for armed resistance to an invading army, that is hardly the same as an armed uprising against your own government. Ireland is kind of half way between the two so I'll give you that, it's why I say *most times* not *every time* (though it has been pledged by acts of terrorism until quite recently). As for an armed resistance in WWII? That's wartime resistance not revolution. Throughout central Europe there may have been armed resistance to the Nazis but in the end it was the Red Army that pushed them out and ultimately enslaved half of Europe for decades until non-violent resistance collapsed the its power.

You see I don't claim that armed revolution always fails, I say it usually fails *at delivering a less authoritarian, more free society* once violence has subsided.

I don't even want to think about what would have happened if Nixon won the Presidency in 1961.  Keep in mind he was a strong supporter of the Bay of Pigs operation. He just happened to run and win the Presidency when the War against Communism was becoming unpopular and people wanted peace so he gave it to them, because all he cared about was power.  

It would be like Wolfowitz becoming President by promising to end the War on Terror, would he all of a sudden become this misunderstood victim?

You bring up the whole war on terror debacle we are in and the thing is it is very similar to the cold war fervor.

If you think that individuals should be able to decide for themselves, this would mean that people could choose their own moral values and laws as well. people simply don't do that already because there IS a state and there IS a society who show them moral values on a daily basis. they grow up into those conventions and mostly don't interfere with them because they got socialized in that way. but maybe we have the same opinion anyway, and it's just a matter of practice and theory. but i think that fair opportunities are not granted by being by oneself and if a state doesn't regulate certain things. (except if you have some rich farmland and proper weather to make a living) this would lead to ""eye for an eye, tooth for tooth"" fighting for limited goods. we do this already, but it could be much worse if there were no law. the difference maybe is: where do you draw the line between the power and influence of the states authority and the power of the individual? who decides?

True,"Sagan is a smart man, but he's falling into the typical rationalist trap of trying to shoehorn consistency onto a belief system that is fundamentally based on believing things without proof or cause. Modern mainstream Christianity has ignored large swaths of the Bible for hundreds of years now if not longer. The largest Christian sect, Catholicism, even has an established process for changing its views (related to doctrines of papal infallibility).

In fact, the Bible as we know it today was the result of a committee getting together and deciding more or less arbitrarily which of many scriptures would end up being ""canon"" and which would not (at the council of Nicaea).

Here's the problem: your logical trap of ""If you don't believe all of it you can't believe some of it"" is not a logical trap, because it's not true. Christians don't believe all of the bible, this is obvious. There may be some extreme fundamentalist sects that *purport* to take every word of the Bible literally, but even they don't really do that, as everyone knows.

This reminds me of that Douglas Adams quote, ""\`Oh dear,' says God, \`I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly disappears in a puff of logic."" It's funny because people's belief in God is not logical, is not related to rational consistency, and no amount of arguing about how silly or stupid some parts of the Bible is will ever change that.

&gt;Might sects and individuals now accept as authentic the parts of the bible they like, and reject those that are inconvenient or burdensome?

This is, in fact, exactly what all religion has been doing since the very beginning. Even before science came along and started poking holes in its stories, religion has adapted by adopting elements of other faiths in order to help it spread. Whether it's pagan holidays being recast as Christian ones in Europe, or Indian Buddhism adopting parts of Tibetan Animism in Tibet, Japanese Shinto in Japan, or whatever, it happens literally all the time.

True,"The Human Rights Act (HRA) is the local application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Cases for it are heard either in Strasbourg or in the UK.

Seeing as the UK has signed the ECHR, human rights cases which are applicable could be heard in the ECHR (European COURT of Human Rights). The HRA basically copy &amp; pastes it into local law, so cases can be heard in the UK, which is faster and cheaper.

The problem the Torys have with it is that the ECHR is one of many supranational *Euro* bodies that take precedence over the UK. It used to be said that the UK had the shortest constitution in the world; **'Parliament is Sovereign'** - that is to say Parliament is bound only by itself and reality. Parliament had the right to create Ex Post Facto laws (i.e. make previous actions presently illegally and chargeable), to change voting boundaries, to raise and create taxes and to delete Parliament from existence entirely, leaving the country without a government. Anything Parliament wanted to do was legal.

After WWII, the UK and other Euro nations found themselves signing up to different industrial organisation and trading blocs. Each one of these assumes power over Parliament. More or less all of new Acts in the UK are the local application of EU directives which Parliament can only superficially debate. The obligations set out in Lisbon et al basically ensure that these laws must be passed.

The salami slicing of Parliamentary Sovereignty aside, there are several technical issues with the Act/Convention which end up hitting the press such as Terrorists/Asylum Seekers being given Ferraris or whatever.  

tl;dr - The Torys dislike the HRA because it is perceived to take power from Parliament and give it to Europe, and other technical issues.",t5_2qhcv,1317640765,False,,1427679611,,t1_c2ogslg,ukpolitics,t3_kz8ny,,9,0,0,0,34Mbit,9,c2ogslg,t3_kz8ny,False

Essentially the euro becomes the deutche mark for southern europe, a hard currency which people keep their savings in.

The fundamental problem in the EU is that countries in the south are less competitive than those in the North and have no workable means of becoming more competitive other than austerity which doesn't actually work.

True,"Flying to Finland is easy, Finnair has direct flights from JFK and American Airlines flies direct from O'Hare. Other options include flying through big European hubs. From Helsinki onwards, Finnair has flights to Rovaniemi (the biggest city in Lapland), and Kittilä, Enontekiö and Ivalo all further north. The more north you go, the better chances you'll have of catching the Aurora, so you'd probably want to head to Enontekiö or Ivalo. Both are around 68 degrees north - approximately where the northern tip of Alaska is.

If you want to see the aurora, you definitely want to be in Lapland in the winter when it's dark (and snowy), as in the summer it's light all the time so spotting the aurora is harder. As for accomodation in Lapland, depending on your budget, what you want to do and adventurousness the options range from a tent in the wilderness to very nice hotels, with plenty of private cabins for hire in between. 

Best experience would probably be camping it out, but unless you're experienced camper in winter conditions, I wouldn't recommend it. I guess you could hire a guide to camp and hike with, but I'd imagine the prices would be pretty high. The cabins can be a good deal if you have the energy to find one beforehand, which might be a tad difficult. (look around [here](http://www.nettimokki.com/) or [here](http://www.lomarengas.fi/)) They range from very basic ones to mansions and are usually near a downhill ski center.

True,"First, I found [this particular post](/r/asktransgender/comments/jg96e/a_short_guide_to_buying_clothes/) (which is also linked in the FAQ) helpful.

Second, I went out to buy clothing and shoes this Saturday for the first time. I brought my sister and two (female) friends with me, though I didn't bother much to make it look as if I was only helping them. In any case, not being alone did help, though I suppose I might pull it off alone now too.

We went for shoes first, and I basically went through the store looking for whatever I found interesting - then checking whether they were available in big enough sizes. (Which of course most weren't.) We settled on two casual pairs. (I know almost nothing of the lingo yet.) Without any heels whatsoever, of course - I tried on a few higher ones but there's really no need to add any height to my 177 cm. While in the continental European shoe size system the sexes are supposed to use the same measurements, the (two pairs of) men's shoes that I currently possess are size 44 while the two pairs I purchased now interestingly are both size 42 - and yet they fit. Go figure.

I definitely got some weird stares from other customers while trying on shoes but I confidently returned the stares and didn't let them get to me. So you think I'm a man trying on women's shoes? Why the fuck should I care? No one bothered talking to me, and the clerks didn't even flinch (or at least they didn't show it) - at least my voice still outs me without a doubt, so I actually found that somewhat odd.

Later, we went to another store for some clothing, and I tried on various shirts and skirts and a few dresses. During collecting stuff, I got stares again (as I, again, wasn't even trying to pretend looking for my sister or friends) and I even heard two girls whisper behind me something along the lines of ""Is that a girl?"" - ""Got to be!"".

True,"San Jose is very nice.  Having lived there for several years myself I can tell you that the neighborhoods surrounding both Silver Creek and EVHS are very nice. You should check out Iguana's burritos.  There's one in Evergreen as well as in downtown SJ. Great burritos, and it's even been featured on Man vs. Food.

The local food trucks are great as well-California has a thriving hispanic culture, and if you're willing to risk a little Montezuma's revenge every once in a while, street tacos are incredible.

San Jose and neighboring Milpitas house some of the best Chinese and Vietnamese food in the US.  If you like asian cuisine you're in the right place. As a little known gem there is a restaurant called Layang Layang in Fremont. It's a Malaysian restaurant and was one of my favorites when I still lived in California. 

There's the usual movies and whatnot (since you're high school age, I'm assuming you're too young for clubs). Definitely check out the tech museum, although it's not good more than once or twice.  During the holiday season there is a 'christmas in the park' light show downtown. It's pretty much the same every year but there's GREAT carny food. 

To address some of the other things people have been saying, California has some of the most stringent gun laws in the US. You cannot buy a firearm unless you are 18 or over (federal law), and you cannot purchase a handgun unless you are over 21 (state by state). All handguns are registered, and almost nobody outside of law enforcement gets a concealed carry permit. Although it is technically your legal right to open carry a firearm so long as it is unloaded and the safety on, you will never see this in CA. 

San Jose and the surrounding Bay Area also comprise some of the most progressive parts of the US. However, I will say that the popular image of the US being a redneck-infested racist, homophobic hellhole is greatly exaggerated (and I live in a 'red' state).  Our tax code is shitty, but as a place to settle down the South Bay in CA is definitely up there on my list. I don't think you're going to have trouble with high school here, since you're coming from a european-modeled education system.

True,"No it hasn't. The basic definition of sovereignty is 

&gt;**Supreme authority over a territory**

We have not lost this to anyone. We can leave any of these international institutions on a whim. Whenever we want.

The fact that we have to obey EU laws when we are a member of it doesn't mean we have lost sovereignty. If David Cameron said it was official policy to bring British criminal law in line with, for example, the law of the state of Texas, would we have ceded sovereignty to texas? 

No, because we could stop that policy whenever we wanted. That wouldn't change if we passed an act of parliament to mandatorily incorporate texas criminal law either, as we could repeal the texan law whenever we want.

Now we turn to the European Communities Act, which incorporates the EU into domestic law (separate from treaties on europe, which we can just ignore). 

If parliament wanted to repeal the ECA, what would stop it? Nothing!

And once repealed, the EU would be almost gone. Technically speaking there would still be some vestiges, as 40 or so years of community law means that judges have incorporated elements of EU law into the common law. But that would literally take a single piece of legislation to brush away.


So in short, we have not ceded sovereignty at all. In practical terms we may obey another institution, but it is voluntarily, and we can stop. Compare this to a US state, which can never gain the government powers it ceded to the federal government back unless the federal government (and probably, all the other states) agree to allow it to.

True,"One more thing - I'm from Belgium originally (although I now live in Canada). When I was a teenager, there was a period of about 3 to 4 years when the ""Bende van Nijvel"" (i.e. the ""Gang of Nijvel"") used to commit random acts of violence. 5 or 6 masked me would enter a supermarket with automatic machine guns and randomly gun people down. 

The perpetrators were never caught - it remains one of the greatest unsolved ""mysteries"" of the past century in Belgium and the topic of countless books and theories. However, a couple of points: 

1) it is clear there was government involvement - the guns used in the attack were of a very specific type that only an elite part of the Belgium's ""Douane"" had access to. As an aside: the ""Douane"" no longer exists but during it's existence they had law enforcement responsibilities that dealt with serious crime: arms trafficking, terrorism, etc. However, unlike the police, they were part of the military, with military grades and military command structure. 

The attacks on  the supermarkets were done with, among other things, a specific type of FN weapon that had been manufactured specifically for the Douane's elite unite, the ""group Diane"". The role of this group was, ironically, anti-terrorism. The weapons had been 'stolen' from a depot in 1979; but there were numerous indications that the theft had been an inside job, committed by some of the very members of the anti-terrorism brigade.

2) The investigation into the Gang of Nijvel has been running for almost 30 years now. Throughout those 30 years, evidence has disappeared, some of the key suspects died in ""mysterious circumstances"" (Madani Bouhouce, a former member of the Douane and one of the key suspects in the whole thing died in a supposed ""chain saw accident"" while cutting wood on his property in France), the responsibility for the investigation was reassinged probably 50 or 60 times, chief investigators were fired, and so forth). The similarities with the level and type of obstructionism that investigators faced resembles that of the aftermath of the Peteano and Bologna attacks in Italy

3) More importantly, a guy named Lucien Dislaire testified to helping a joint operation of Belgium paracommando's and American Special Forces against a military camp in the south of the country. During that attack, one Belgian soldier was gravely wounded and a cache of weapons was stolen. Those same weapons were then used in a series of attacks claimed by a supposedly terrorist communist organization (the CCC, or Celles Combatant Communistes) and later recovered in a hideout belonging to the same group.

It is now a well known fact that the CCC was not communist at all, but in fact a neo-fascist paramilitary organization that aimed to turn public opinion against the left by staging terrorist attacks. And in Dislaire's testimony, we have a direct link between American and Belgian special forces and this supposedly ""communist"" group.

I understand all this shit sounds really incredible. The problem is that it IS actually backed up by pretty sound evidence as well as testimony by some of the people directly involved.

I don't doubt that certain terrorist attacks got attributed to Gladio that they had no hand in at all. But there is no doubt in my mind that the CIA did at one point run a program to discredit left-wing governments in Western Europe by staging terrorist attacks and that this was done in collaboration with similar minded people in the military of the very countries they were supposed to protect.",t5_2cneq,1317659589,False,,1427680454,,t1_c2oikhq,politics,t1_c2oi8q3,,1,0,0,0,Mordecus,1,c2oikhq,t3_kybxb,False

True,"&gt;Vaccines are unnecessary with a healthy immune system

Untrue.  I recently saw a cluster of measles infections at a hospital I worked at.  Other cases have been reported in the last 12 months.  Here are some articles

&gt;In USA during the 1980s, the number of measles cases was low but a big increase occurred in 1989 with almost 18 000 cases reported. Lack of a second dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine could have decreased the level of immunity among the school-age population, among whom most of the cases were reported. Subsequently, two rounds of vaccination were recommended. At the end of 2000, thanks to vaccination, the ongoing transmission of endemic measles was declared eliminated in the USA. However, this year from January 1 to May 20, 118 cases were reported in the USA. 46% of the cases were imported, most from countries in the WHO European region.

Quote from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21700236

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21881549

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21677008

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21666213  (this one is actually reports of healthy, immunized physicians catching measles from their patients!)

&gt;Vaccines are harmful to a healthy immune system

There's no evidence of this.

&gt;Vaccines are in and of themselves dangerous and part of a conspiracy by the medical establishment to make a profit

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19948578 Results from a survey on the financial situation of vaccines in primary care settings.  11% of respondents said that due to financial pressures, ""their practice had seriously considered whether to stop providing all vaccines to privately insured children in the previous year.""

&gt;Vaccines will eventually cause the downfall of man because they are not a 'natural' immune response and humans will eventually not be able to cope with viruses. 

Vaccines use the natural immune response.  That's why they are so effective, because our immune systems are absolutely incredible.  If someone has a defective immune system, it doesn't matter if they get infected 'naturally' or are immunized, they are not going to build immunity.

If they want to make genetic arguments about humans getting 'weaker' due to medical treatments, then they should take the initiative by not seeking medical care for any illnesses, including dental work.  Until then, they shouldn't put their child at risk.",t5_2qm4e,1317660470,False,,1427680500,,t1_c2oip2r,askscience,t3_kzh28,,14,0,0,0,craigdubyah,14,c2oip2r,t3_kzh28,False

True,"Ok, Im from Belgrade...
You didn't really write what are you into but here are some things I find interesting...

**food** : Be sure to try *pljeskavica* and *cevapi* both. Most of these ethnic fast food are quite good, but I really love *Mara* (address Novopazarska 14, Belgrade). As far as ethnic restaurants are concerned these are very good and popular: [Cubura](http://www.nadlanu.com/ostalo/adresar/restorani/Restoran-Cubura.d-8926.155.html), [Znak pitanja](http://www.nadlanu.com/ostalo/adresar/restorani/Restoran-Znak-Pitanja.d-2665.155.html) and [Stara Hercegovina](http://www.nadlanu.com/ostalo/adresar/restorani/Restoran-Stara-Hercegovina.d-2792.155.html). And I know these links are in Serbian - but you only need the map, right?
*Sis cevap* is also very famous. The best one is at Goce Delceva 27 (that's New Belgrade - over the bridge).
Also, try Bucko pizza with chicken, tuna or beef sauce over it (something that probably exists only in Belgrade). Very, very popular. Bucko works until 2am. Address: Francuska 18 and Beogradska 56.

**bars** Well, you didn't say what you're looking for, but *Black turtle pub* is a nice place. Try the house beer with blueberry or strawberry. Address: Ilije Garašanina 26 and Kosančićev Venac 30 and Gospodar Jovanova 56. Pub *Brod* is also cool, music: indie and post rock. Here you can drink very good draught beer called *Niksicko dark*. (You can find it in some other pubs as well). Address: Despota Stefana 36.
When it comes to *rakija*, our local schnaps, try honey rakija, peach rakija and pear rakija.

**clubs** When it comes to clubs, I can't really help you, depends on the music. Most of the clubs on barges on Sava and Danube river are now closed. This area [here](http://i.imgur.com/OjZ1e.png) is good for clubbing/bar-hopping during this period.  You can PM me about clubbing details.

**shopping** Don't do shopping in Belgrade. It's more expensive than in Europe and much more expensive than in US.

**sightseeing** As others already said, Kalemegdan fortress, Knez Mihajlova, Skadarlija. Also, Saint Sava temple, [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_Sava) and Nikola Tesla museum, which is small but nice, [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_Museum).

True,"No, the point is your braking weight distribution is heavy in the front, but I'd wager a guess that 30% of your stopping power is on the rear brake. So if you use both brakes at the same time you exponentially cut back on the amount of wear on just using the front brake alone.

Think of it like this: If you rely on the front brake all the time, you will need to replace it far more often than the rear brake. This much is easy to deduce, however if you use both brakes at the same time, you will need to replace them at around the same mileage, however at a much further spaced out intervals. 

Proper braking on a motorcycle includes the following:

* Knowing where you are going, how fast, and where you'd need to brake to slow or stop your bike

* Downshift to have the engines compression slow your bike

* Apply gentle brake pressure to **both** brakes

Without doing this, you may be putting yourself at risk of a crash in certain situation. Riding a motorcycle is all about practicing good habits so in the very likely event you are involved in an incident that you need these practices to be muscle memory and not a conscious choice; you'll have them.

edit: Also forgot to mention, if you are worried about costs to maintain your vehicle, the best thing you can do is learn how to perform the maintenance yourself. I'd be willing to bet that the 600euro was mainly spent on labor and over-market-price on parts.

True,"Step by step. (what i think will be the worst case scenario with a greek default )

One : Greek Defaults, tells its debtors that they will not get paid.    

Two: A lot of debtors have no problem with this, but greek banks who have huge exposure to greek debt suddenly have a balance sheet problem.   

Three: All the depositors in these greek banks see the banks failing and move their money from greek banks to banks in other countries (probably Germany).leading to a collapse of most Greek banks.    

Four: Now people who have lent money to Italy,Spain Portugal and Ireland see that they might not get their money back, so they stop lending to these countries. Now these countries have no recourse to the markets for their everyday expenses.( At the same time people with deposits in banks of these countries move their money to other banks(probably Germany), so a lot of banks in these countries will fail too )     

Five. Now the EU has one of its member states that has defaulted and four others about to default, while Germany can afford to keep bailing people out, smaller countries like Finaland and Holland probably have had enough. And about half of all banks in the EU one are now on the verge of collapse

Six: The actual collapse. smaller stable countries(holland and Finland ) will want to pull out of the EU, the 5 defaulting countries will probably nationalize the banks.=, this cannot be done under EU charter so they will have to take leave of the maschrets (sic) treaty.

Seven The euro collapses, governments in most countries stop paying for a lot of things people take for granted, like pensions and education etc etc. Though this should be a short term problem while countries get theri shit together, the unemployed youth and the struggling middle class will call for serious changes.

True,"&gt; Why are people so racist and jingoist and so many other -ists? 

Fear. And much of that fear is legitimate.

Many people aren't content letting others live the way they want. Many want to enforce their own standards on others. *Every* person can, therefore, justifiably fear that if a different culture becomes a majority in their local area, that culture's standards will be imposed on them. And this does in fact happen. For example, there was a submission recently on reddit about an 80% Jewish town in Canada which enforces strict Sabbath bylaws.

&gt; those who control the borders, [...] these issues to divide us in order to control and influence us.

I don't think this is correct. Border policy reflects public sentiment and security concerns, not the other way around.

To the extent border policy is manipulated for the benefit of a few, it is when it restricts trade and imposes tariffs; usually to protect local businesses that benefit from a local captive market, and can't, or don't want to, compete with abroad.

&gt; a truly global community that has abandoned all that bullshit baggage of hatred

It is more likely that a race of artificial intelligence, or a race of genetically modified super-humans, will evolve and transcend humanity, before the kind of progress you describe.

&gt; Maintaining the fiction of these borders is the biggest racket the planet has ever seen,

I don't think so. Notice how borders aren't a huge issue between populations that are relatively similar. See the US-Canada border as compared to the US-Mexico border; or better yet, the borders between EU states. In the EU case, the borders are nigh invisible, and are mainly administrative boundaries more so than to deter movement.

Where borders are highly controlled, this is because the bordering countries have different policies, and at least one country doesn't wish to suffer from what it sees as negative effects of the other country's failures.

The EU makes it possible to have invisible borders because the countries have agreed to be united under the same framework, following a compatible set of common policies.

The Swiss-EU border is highly permeable as well. Even though Switzerland is not part of the EU, the country's policies are sufficiently compatible with the EU that neither has much to fear from relatively open borders.

&gt; Why keep a slave, who you have to take care of, feed, house, and all that when you can just have a whole country of slaves to make all that plastic crap we crave. 

The people in the other country would disagree with you about being slaves.

If they didn't offer to work for cheaper, then there would be no reason for companies to build manufacturing there. The work would stay in Europe and the US. The third world country wouldn't benefit from foreign investment, business know-how, new technologies, and higher wages.

True,"&gt;I'm afraid I don't have much of an idea on what to ask him other than treading lightly and getting some beforehand idea from family on how sensitive he is about certain topics.

I don't have much to add, except that I agree with this.  My grandpa served as a medic in the European theater, and he didn't much talk about the combat side of things.  He did however, love to share his stories and photos of the ""lighter"" side of the war - that is, the non combat side of things such as when his unit was pulled off the line, training in England, etc.  He never mentioned anything combat related, and so we never asked.  He did give each side of our family a book that chronicled his division's (3rd Armored Division) role in the war, but he never actually talked about any particular combat experience.  (The book is *""Death Traps - The Survival of an American Armored Division in World War II""* by Belton Y. Cooper.)  Given how much he enjoyed talking about his friends, and his non combat experiences, and shied away from talking about combat, we figured he wasn't too keen on discussing it, and so never pushed the subject.  I would therefor suggest, as WillPhillips said, that you tread lightly, and tell your grandpa to make it clear what he is, and isn't willing, to discuss.

True,"&gt;Actually, I think you're an idiot.

I'd expect you to.  I'm making a lot of sense and you're an idiot.  Of course you think I'm an idiot, it makes perfect sense from your perspective.  Can we skip the obvious?

&gt;Jews being expelled from their countries without another place to go continues to this very day. 

Grounds for asylum in the EU.  Pick your developed country, most of which come with far more security than Israel, but don't confuse that for an argument against there being an Israel.  It isn't.  It's an explanation for why what you just said is wrong.

&gt;Without Israel, where would have the million of arab jews expelled from their countries have gone? 

Again that's an argument that belongs to the past, not the present.  It's also an argument that can be answered by the original Devil's Advocate argument I made earlier which opens Israel up for needless criticism.  It's just not smart thinking.

&gt;History shows that...

Which is exactly where it belongs with regards to certain countries.  In the history books.

&gt;Israel's security of the Jews has been immeasurably beneficial in the last few decades and will continue to be beneficial in the future.

Nonsense.  A small matter of a World War being fought where the  result of antisemtism taken to its ultimate conclusion had its ghoulish face exposed to world and people getting a really sharp shock wake up call is what did it for antisemtism.  Israel has been exceptionally good, up until recently, for the security of Israelis, not Jews (and I don't think recent governments have even done that).  Israel's getting some really bad press at the moment and that is not good for Jews.  It's bad.  It shouldn't be, but it is.  Antisemitism can never be justified but if we're being honest criticism of Israel from outside is fueling antisemtism and it's not always directed only at Israel.  Israel's good for Jewish people in Israel, not as good as San Francisco or Berlin, but good.  That's not the same thing as saying Israel has been good for Jewish security elsewhere.  Case point: look up at the 90ft banner somebody has just made!  Having said that, even in one of Europe's shittier countries the police have responded by saying they'll find the culprits and stadium ban their asses.  You can make up for a banner and stop it from happening again, you can't un-Grad somebody in the morgue. 

&gt; In fact, it'll only not be a valid argument when all the Jews are Israel or antisemetism is forever wiped off the earth

You really do seem to think that a Jewish family living in Israel is safer than a Jewish family living in San Francisco, which is really depressing because the disconnect involved is soooo bad.

The reason why the security argument is so wrong is because if you justify and think of Israel in those terms then there is only one rational conclusion.  Israel is a failure.  The rights allowing freedom from persecution in other more stable countries by far out strip the determination of Israel to survive in isolation.

When I say Israel should continue to exist because Israel currently exists that the only counter-argument is one that adopts either genocide or ethnic cleansing.  An untenable position.

When you argue that Israel should exist for security reasons it (a) doesn't stand up to any scrutiny given there are plenty of places where it is far more secure to be Jewish, and (b) gives those that would be prone to be antisemitic a further reason to attack Israel because if the mission of Israel is to provide security then it fails by its own definition when attacked.  

More importantly by continuously arguing why it should exist based on past persecutions and why it was set up you're directly undermining you're own argument that Israel is the safest place to be Jewish.  If it was so secure and not in the balance people with persecution complexes wouldn't be obsessed about reaffirming its right to exist!  Even you don't believe it's all that secure.",t5_2qhvo,1317670842,False,,1427681225,,t1_c2ok8fh,Israel,t1_c2ojq7z,,2,0,0,0,[deleted],2,c2ok8fh,t3_kzdip,True

True,"I'd love to see a porn shoot on a farm where the woman is blindfolded before the cumshot and they replace the guy with a horse and she can tell instantly somethings up and rips off her blindfold and screams ""what the fuck!!!"" at the horse dick as torrents of cum pour out both sides of her mouth, and as the guys laugh hysterically she slashes at one guy with her nails and leaves a deep cut in his arm then starts screaming and won't let anyone approach her even to give her a towel.

Wonder if you could trick a girl at one of those gloryhole sites into blowing a horse or she'd just go ""fuck you, that's a horse dick"" either give me an extra 300 bucks for this shoot or I'm gone.

While we're on the subject, what's up with the dearth of cumshots in horse porn? Pretty much the only reason I watch, the sex is terrible usually the horses are drugged and she just lazily sticks it in her pussy half flaccid and jerks it off, Medically I get why this is way too dangerous but it would still be awesome to see a woman get mounted and railed by a horse (maybe a 7 foot woman could handle it?), so many vids where the womans sucking the horse and there's 20 seconds left and it's like the end of a tv show where you know there's no way they're going to be able to wrap this up, and she just drops the dick and waves to the camera. Why else would you watch horse porn except for the facial???? It's not like they're gorgeous first rate European or Brazilian pornstars and you get off from the depravity of a woman with supermodel looks blowing a horse, with the sort of women in horse porn you can tell this isn't much of a fall from grace for them (think how 2g1c might actually have been kind of hot if it was Faye Regan and Lexi Belle they stayed upbeat and laughed throughout the whole shoot as if they had merely filled their asses with icecream and were now playing with it, actually that would still be gross but I do have a fantasy of a scene where two hot pornstars get very high, sit on the floor together and one takes a huge shit and they both crack up laughing together then the other woman farts and takes a huge shit and they laugh even harder and it keeps going on till the pile is so high they need to move and you think how the fuck is this medically possible??? And the video lasts 2 hours with no cuts and they both walk around a vast mansion while constantly farting and shitting and by the end they both must have shit a tonne each and are getting creative and doing musical duets and are beyond tears of laughter, maybe instead of shit it's skittles, actually have mass appeal then and could make for a hell of a commercial especially since the last few have been underwhelming). You'd have to be a sicko to enjoy horse porn without cumshots. I do kind of like the idea of a woman doing horse porn on the assurance there will be no cum but the horse gets so turned on that he blows his load and she stops and starts screaming at the director ""this wasn't part of the deal!"" and he shrugs apologetically and says ""animals are unpredictable.""",t5_2qh33,1317671326,False,,1427681257,,t1_c2okax5,funny,t1_c2ojwav,,255,0,0,0,mroglolblo,255,c2okax5,t3_kzh2p,True

jail has rules just like every other social institution.  I'm not referring to the jail's rules, but the unspoken and unwritten rules that govern day-to-day inmate interaction.  jail is not the silly ""only the strong survive"" or a ""kill or be killed"" situation of violent anarchy that you are suggesting.  if you were to apply inmate interaction rules to ""the outside world"" as you suggest, it would be more or less the same as in any other social setting that you care to pick.  people get along, they help each other here and there, they fight if they have a problem, they find ways to pass the time, they find ways to get ahead.  they talk about their family or their old lady or their house.

True,"Thanks!  It's so nice to have a civil discussion about religion on Reddit.  It's potentially a great forum to learn about different belief systems (including agnostic and atheist views), but too often discussions degenerate into name-calling.

There's always been a mystical or ""magical"" tradition within the Church, which the hierarchy tolerates, even when it does not officially approve them.  For instance, there is a long tradition of [stigmatics](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14294b.htm) (people who show up with wounds suffered by Christ on the cross) that the Church does not quite know what to do with.  

Part of this is because the Church has had to adapt to local belief systems.  The tradition of patron saints, for instance, can be seen as adaptation to the Roman and Mediterranean belief in multiple gods with highly specific roles.  More recently, the Church had to adapt to and reinterpret Asian traditions of ancestor worship.  No doubt there are other examples.  I think you mentioned that Father Suarez is in the Phillippeans?  Is there a native tradition of sacred healers?

Sometimes the Church does come down and abolish certain claims.  For instance, in pre-Reformation Europe, it was common for priests in rural areas to bless the fields before planting.  This was criticized (rightly) as a pagan custom and strongly discouraged in the Counter-Reformation, which were internal reforms the Church instituted in reaction to the criticisms levied by Protestants.  I found a [Google Book](http://books.google.com/books?id=GrLV1ZJ3w7cC&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=ao88TUycWW&amp;dq=reformation%20priests%20blessing%20fields&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) that describes some of these popular ""magical rituals"" of pre-Reformation Church.

You make a valid point though about having to comply with various regulations in order to trade within the EU.

I guess the obvious counter, playing devil's advocate, would be that we could concentrate on emerging markets which would be less onerous on UK business.

Personally the things I do object to are those that really are a loss of sovereignty, such as the European arrest warrant.

There's also irritating things such as landfill targets, CO2 emissions and smoking regulations that our government wants to out-do every other member state in but these would most likely be proposed/enacted regardless. Perhaps though without the threat of fines our politicians would be more willing to listen to public opinion. Saying that though, how do we really know what public opinion is. Everyone can find stats to support their prejudice...

Returning to shale gas, the way I see it is that it will not be exploited, leading to (even more) insane energy bills and black outs by which time it will be impossible for any party seeking power to stay within the EU.

If you think it's emotional know, you ain't seen nothing. The mad-cap energy policy that Chris Hulne is leading is economically illiterate and practically impossible without energy rationing, which he is proposing (referred to as behaviour modification if I recall correctly).

Whilst it's not impossible that in the next 9 years we are back at 58% of 1990 levels, does this seem like a sound, realistic policy and if so, at what benefit to global emissions?

Yes, that's correct, and if you would manage to find one it's unlikely that it would pay enough to live off. Also, you'd risk deportation from the EU, which would bar you from entry in any country that asks for such things in their visa application.

Even if you *would* have a TEFL certification, you'd still have to find a language school that would sponsor your visa, which means they'd have to demonstrate that they can't find a qualified applicant from within the EU.

The application period for the 2012 contingent should begin right about now, and you could stay in Germany or the Schengen Area for three months, which means you could fly on directly from here.

True,"Jews have lived in present day Palestine/Israel since the days of Moses.  Of course, so have the Arabs.  The Jewish population was decimated and the diaspora begun during the Roman suppression of Jewish rebellions against Roman rule - the last being the most brutal.

Starting in the late 1800's, Jewish folks were encouraged to return to the area to create a Jewish nation - Israel.  There was a great deal of immigration to Palestine.  Decades of Jewish immigrant population growth led to friction with the Arabs.  Though the Jews did certainly buy some land, much of it was considered 'vacant' and 'undeveloped' and was taken by Jewish settlers.

It was indeed almost exactly like the settlement of North America.  The Europeans didn't just arrive and begin taking land 'by force'.  Some land was purchased from the Indians; other land was considered open for settlement, as the Indians had no formal title to the land.  Settlers were encouraged to establish themselves in 'vacant' land. This ultimately resulted in some friction and violence; the U.S. government then had the obligation-cum-pretext of protecting settlers from Indian depredations.  Eventually it turned to all-out war; the First Nations collapsed in the late 1800's.

The analogy is about the most apt you'll ever see.  Of course, it's classic human behavior.  The average Jewish Israeli isn't culpable, any more than a European settler was who simply wanted a place to build a home and have a family.  The Indians in America and the Arabs in Israel/Palestine have been marginalized politically and legally.

The thing to understand is that this didn't all just happen post WW2.  Israel wasn't created out of thin air.  The motivations and politics are incredibly dense and paradoxical - byzantine, even.  The West knew that it was going to have a fight on it's hands with the Soviets, and figured Israel would be a good ally in the region. It was well known in the 1940s that there were great amounts of oil in the Middle East.  And I always wonder if some anti-semitic types thought they could just export their Jews to Israel.

My heart goes out to the Jewish and Palestinian peoples who just want to live a normal life and raise their families in peace. History isn't their fault.  But the future is their choice to make.  Both sides need to make concessions in order to achieve peace.  The only alternative is to fight until one side is utterly defeated.
