False,1317427261,t5_2qzb6,"It was the British Mandate of Palestine. It's a bit of a different story than most former colonies because of what happened in 1947.

During WW1, the Ottoman Empire occupied and controlled the area now known as Israel. After the breakup of the empire following the Allied victory, the League of Nations gave control of this area to the UK. This transferal of control is called a 'mandate', and it was left this way until Israel appeared and fought for control of the area under the financial and logistical support of the victors of the recently won WW1.

Really what happened is that the European victors felt horrible about what happened to the Jews and those in power began to support Zionism, or the belief that the Jewish people deserve their own homeland. So they decided that the best place for them to go would be the birthplace of Judaism. They fought a quick war and set themselves up. It's a shitty situation for the Palestinians, but you have to remember that this is how most borders are formed: people fight wars and the victors write the borders. Need I remind you about the American Indian? Didn't we do the same exact thing to the native people of America? Aboriginals ring a bell? This is what happens in history... The strong survive. As an Arab-American I really want to say that the Palestinians deserve their own homeland but honestly the only thing I can see them doing is fighting a war for independence. That is happening right now, but its been happening for so long that the Israelis are far far stronger militarily thanks to Allied (now US) aid. Also, both sides are xenophobic to the point where I think all they want is utter distruction of each other. 

It's really a tragic situation but I'm not sure a two state solution will ever work. With all of the countries that surround Israel being as xenophobic as Hamas, I really don't think Jews and Arabs can coexist in that region as long as their respective religions are fueling the xenophobia. Maybe the internet will help change the younger generation and they will find a peaceful solution... 

What really gets tricky when you say ""there was no recognized country"" is that we need to use better terminology. For all intents and purposes, the Nation of Palestine has existed for over 2,000 years. The nation-state ""British Mandate of Palestine"" existed for a brief 30 years or so. What I am trying to hammer home is that ""country"" is a poor term to use when we are discussing the Palestinian situation. 

Consider for a second that a nation is just a group of people (IE: Red Sox nation, nation of Islam), and a state is a soverign ""country"" that has a government. The term ""country"" is poor to use because it can be used to describe a state, a nation, or a nation-state. 

So to be clear, there WAS and IS a country called Palestine. There was a state in that area (the Mandate), and there most certainly is a nation of Palestinians. ",True,t1_c2nx389,,1427670119,,0,31,,IAmA,t1_c2nwxyf,True,t3_kwx69,c2nx389,31,hydrogenous,0,0

2) The a in atheism doesn't mean anti, it means absence of.  Atheism is not anti-faith or anti-religion, just like agnostic is not anti-knowledge.

3) Atheism does not worship science.  Most atheists understand science.  And the ones that don't, understand that people smarter than them do.  Big difference.

4) Atheism does not see nature as god.  That's Wicca.

5) People do not worship Richard Dawkins (well, there's probably some crazies out there).  There is a difference between messiah and famous person, otherwise, I guess all those famous Islamic scholars are messiahs since you follow their teachings.

6) Morals are relative to each person.  Most people raised a certain way retain the morals of their upbringing.  Since a lot of atheists are raised religious, the lessons of their childhood stays with them.  The difference is, the majority of atheists will question them, and if necessary, change them.

7) I have never turned to a book to justify my beliefs.  Most atheists don't.  Most will lay out why they believe what they believe.   A book may be referenced, but it is not holy in any way, shape, or form. 

8)  There is no ""right path"".  Every takes there own path. 

9)  What is wrong with quotes?  If someone else said something better than I could say it, I'll quote them.  Does that mean I worship them?  No.  It means I respect them and agree with their statements.

10)  Most atheists do not ""try to convert others"".  Most atheists try to explain to you how things works as shown through experimentation or logic without the use of some fantasy.  This is not a belief system.  This is the real world.

How so?

If the Europeans never came there, it would still be a part of the Ottoman empire. If the British destroyed the Ottoman empire but didn't acknowledge the right of the Jews to their own country, they would've never set up the mandate of Palestine in the first place, since its only purpose was to create a national home for the Jews. 

And even if everything until 1948 was exactly as it was, but the Arabs have won the war, there would *still* be no Palestine, because the plan was to divide the land between Jordan, Syria and Egypt - and indeed, the parts that were conquered by the Arabs in said war were annexed to the Arab countries. In fact, the idea that Palestine is just ""southern Syria"" or ""western Jordan"" was the leading ideology well after the war.

But the initial trigger came from Austria. Austria-Hungary had to appear strong. They were eaten by inner conflicts. They thought that they'd fell apart if they'd show any weakness to Serbia. The Russians had a similar dilemma. After they lost the war against Japan in 1905 the peasants they had so badly treated started to demand changes. So they were fully committed to help Serbia and mobilised their troops. That of course triggered the German Schliefenplan. Sure if the Germans had said ""no"" to Austria history might have been different. But I doubt it. Europe was changing. Nationalism and socialism/communism was on the rise.

But like last time, such a meltdown would not just damage France and Germany, because financial institutions around the world would again be suddenly unwilling to lend elsewhere, not knowing the liabilities of other organizations, and not trusting them to be solvent. That reduces the all-round availability of credit both to other banks and to heavily indebted nations, causing a cascade which would probably knock over Ireland, which is on the edge at the moment. And British banks have absolutely massive liabilities in Ireland (on the order of 100 billion quid). Britain does not have the resources to do 2008 again, not without really damaging ourselves for a generation.

False,1317429453,t5_2qhos,"Can you ascertain that all the people you met are native Mandarin speakers or speakers whose mother tongue is Mandarin, and not any other Chinese languages? 

You've already gotten many people attesting that they have found Mandarin speakers to have no problem distinguishing English Rs and Ls, so what you observe seems like something highly unusual and unlikely, but let's say it does occur.

So here are a couple of possibilities:

* One. What you say is really true, that the Chinese people you meet are all native Mandarin speakers AND they all mix up Rs and Ls no matter if its English, Dutch, or German in all situations.

* Two. The Chinese people you meet did not all have Mandarin as their first language, but some other Chinese language that does not distinguish R and L to begin with, and that's what causes them to turn all Rs into Ls no matter what. For these speakers, the spelling can potentially contribute to the problem, because whenever they see ""r"", even if in real native speech of the foreign language it can be trilled or uvular depending on context, they'll just produce L.

* Three. There are other more complicated reasons contributing to the phenomena, that may involve anything from what other language these Chinese speakers might have learned before, influence of the established overseas Chinese community that they may be involved in (I do know most established Chinese communities in Europe tend to be from the south of China as well)  

* Four. Less likely, but definitely probable: Some of them have dealt with too many new foreign languages at the same time (let's say at least two at the same time, English and Dutch). They mix the two languages because it's psychologically too taxing to consciously deal with all the different new sounds all the time and switching back and forth between 3 systems, so for ""simplicity"" and ""laziness"" they just put all the Rs and Ls together no matter the context and produce them all as Ls.

* Five. Also less likely, but not improbable: Actually, the Mandarin speakers do differentiate Rs and Ls in English if they spoke it exclusively in an English-only environment, but in a multilingual environment where they have to switch back and forth between languages with different Rs, it is just easier to not bother, especially if they are not fluent enough in English to begin with.

* Six. A combo of some of the above or other reasons or scenarios I can't think of right now.

Grievances:  
  
-The ratings agencies have abandoned their mandate to do due diligence on the ratings they assign, and have thereby undermined the ability of individual investors, and the market at large, to make sound decisions.  
  
-The large banks have moved off the partnership model which incentivized the long term health of the bank and have failed to adopt a new model that similarly incentivizes the banks actions. They have instead instituted models that provide warped incentives for high-risk behavior through awarding large bonuses for short term success.  
  
-They have leveraged themselves far beyond any sane level.  
  
-They have intentionally deceived investors and sold them assets known to be worthless as a matter of policy. Consequently they have engaged in unsound investment strategies, backed by the knowledge that they can sell their mistakes to unwitting investors should they go bad, before their worthlessness is publicly known.  
  
-They have embraced a vision of Wall Street that derives most of its profit not from the efficient allocation of capital and the attendant growth in the wider economy, but from the zero sum trading games exemplified by the Credit Default Swaps which were essentially pure bets.  
  
-They have taken taxpayer bailouts designed to ease credit markets and have refused to use them for their stated purpose of lending to businesses to allow new investment and growth.  
  
-They have bought and sold influence in Washginton with greater fervor than they have bought and sold investments, and have rewritten the laws that govern their businesses to the disadvantage of everyone in the country but themselves.  
  
-They have abandoned their responsibility to manage risk, both for their clients and for the sake of the stability of the wider system. They have at times allowed entire departments in their organizations to operate with no internal oversight.  
  
-They have engaged in, or encouraged, predatory lending practices, knowing that they could pass the losses from eventual default onto investors.  
  
-They have engaged in regulatory capture and evasion by either deceiving regulators, or buying them off entirely.  
  
-They have conspired to mask the extent of soverign debt outside our borders, for the express purpose of deceiving the European citizenry and profiting off of the economic turmoil of America's allies.  
  
  
Demands:  
  
-Robust oversight of all financial activities, both internal and through strong federal regulation  
  
-Reasonable leverage caps and fractional reserve requirements  
  
-Prosecution of any and all individuals who engage in fraudulent activity, especially activity designed to deny information to the market or act on privileged access to information  
  
-Robust laws requiring the documentation of all activities and internal decision making, and strong prosecution of any institution that fails to deliver such documents upon subpoena, for any reason  
  
-Changes to compensation strucutre, especially at the executive level, that would reward long term stability and solvency over short term gains.  
  
-Fines for any legal violation of an amount significantly in excess of the profit derived from such violation.

False,1317430991,t5_2qm4e,"&gt;Why are RF frequencies used to generate artificial plasmas? Why is is that RF frequencies are particularly good at doing so?

RF frequencies are used for nonthermal plasmas when they are configured as capacitively coupled (CCP) and inductively coupled (ICP) plasmas. The basic idea is that electrons will respond to the changes in the electric field and be able to reach high energies (~3-10 eV, 10,000s K) however the ions and gas will stay near room temperature because their mass is too large to respond to the electric field. [Basic idea, the x-axis can be treated as mass instead of frequency]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harmonic_oscillator_gain.svg) The reason RF is so suitable is: 1) there is a limited range of frequencies where this behavior is possible 2) RF power supplies were cheap and available. Interesting tidbit: RF (13.56 MHz) is dominate in US and Europe while VHF (70 MHz) is dominate in Japan and Australia do to the differing availability of cheap power supplies when these systems where first developed.

Since this might be a little confusing in the context of sputtering. I should elaborate on why sputtering works even though ions and the gas are low (near room) temperature while in the plasma you would not expect them to sputter your target. This is due to the plasma sheath, which is basically a region near any surface (in this case your target) that due to the nature of the plasma a large electric field will exist. This means that ions that get near this sheath become accelerated to high energies (very high velocities) into the surface and can basically knock-off (sputter) atoms on the surface.  

&gt;How does 'self-ionizing plasma' sustain itself? My understanding is that a plasma is struck, the power supply/gas supply is turned off, and the plasma continues to exist. What prevents the plasma from extinguishing itself?

Your understanding is incorrect. Likely both the power supply and gas supply remain on. A self-ionizing plasma just describes the ionization mechanism.

&gt;On all the plasma chambers I see a 'ctune' and 'cload'. I figure the c stands for capacitor, but what do these values actually indicate?

The impedance of the power supply must be match with the impedance of the chamber and plasma. In commercial applications this is generally done automatically, however the principle remains the same as a [Ham radio.](http://tymkrs.tumblr.com/post/5219965187/25-standing-wave-ratios-ham-lesson-o-de-day)

The basic idea is that a plasma and chamber have some impedance, in order to couple power to the plasma the power supplies impedance must be matched. In order to do this adjustable capacitors and inductors are used. Key words for google: RF matching network. There are basically two types used in RF plasmas T-type and Pi matching networks, depending on the frequency and mode of coupling (CCP vs ICP). These deal with the configuration of the adjustable capacitors and inductive.

&gt;We also have other chambers that dope the wafers with boron by generating a plasma with boron triflouride or diborane. How, if at all, is generating a plasma for a compound different than generating one for a diatomic or noble gas?

False,1317430999,t5_2sokd,"I would make the distinction between historical anti-semitism and now. The Palestinians are Semites too you know, so the term would be specifically used in this context with the Jewish people. 

Most Europeans, (as far as I know - as I am one, live here, and so do my friends) don't give a hoot about Jewish people in that they wish them well at best and at worst it doesn't figure in their day to day life. The fringe elements (white nationalists, etc.) do make a lot of noise because it's quite un-PC / outright scandalous to make racist comments, obviously, so I think this kind of shitty opinion about Jewish people in general is disproportionate to the amount of publicity it gets. Empty vessels make the most noise and all. Joe Soap on the streets just wants people to get along without conflict. 

As for our governments and politics, their actions and comments revolving around Israel in Europe - there are a multitude of different things at play here. Who is friends with who, what you can do to help realistically etc. But the overall message is that international laws are broken, and a peaceful resolution needs to be found ASAP with compromises made on both sides, ala Northern Ireland. This leads to a lot of frustration here if you have followed peace talks over the years in Israel / Palestine that a peace can't be brokered. Now the common opinion of Europeans following the politics of Israel / Palestine is that the Israelis have a bigger burden to do things right as they are the big modern power and a democracy which should adhere to certain civilised principles in dealing with the Palestine question, not a ""he hit me so i'll hit him back"" mentality. It's easy to say that as an outsider who isn't living in the reality of the situation. But as one who has lived through very similar circumstances, it's enough to say its time for reconciliation, to get past old wounds for a better future for everyone involved. I'm not going to get into who is right or wrong on individual matters but from a PR perspective, or diplomatically, the feeling is that Israel is doing itself no favours. Whichever side of the equation is looked at everyone in the region is there to stay and obtuse ideology is not going to resolve anything 

Where there is a conflict is the actions of the Israeli government, specifically. The beef is not with Jewish people, this can't be stated enough. Most people here know that although Israel is the proclaimed Jewish state, that the actions of their government is not the collective will of the Jewish or Israeli people, its more complicated than that. Such is life.

So the hatred that you feel on here, is actually more of a frustration with the stalemate in talks for a peaceful resolution more than anything. The point I made about empty vessels, you are seeing that in microcosm here. Joe Soap European won't defend Israel in these forums (as it sees it as up to the Israeli government to find a resolution and they feel like they are not helping themselves) as much as it wont attack them either, anyone who is saying anything different has an axe to grind, and I mean this with all due respect, same goes for the Israeli people posting on here. Of course they are going to go on the defensive if they see someone criticising them, but its not a critique of them as a people or as Jewish people, or even as individuals but as a state that can't work things out.

I hope I didn't step on anyone's toes here, and I don't want to get into a prolonged debate about points I made. (Although i'm open to correction) I know this is a very complicated issue, but i'm just trying to get the average European's point across, be it grossly misinformed or otherwise.

Peace and love.

\#|Question|Answer
:---|:---|:---
1|How did what happened to him affect him later in life?|He says that it gave him a greater appreciation for life. He is happy to be alive and cherishes it every day.
2|Does he live in America, or somewhere in Europe?|He lives in New York City- Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. He moved here in 1991.
3|And because it isn't asked enough: ""How are you doing today, sir?""|He recently was diagnosed with colon cancer , earlier the year. Miraculously after surgery it is believed that he is now cancer free. Other than that he is the most optimistic, happy and loving person you will ever meet. Being around him my whole life, has made me realize that any problem I ever have is truly meaningless.
4|Did he ever encounter any kindness from any of the Nazi Germans holding him in captivity, or any signs that they were capable of compassion or sympathy?|Most of the soldiers in the ghetto were not technically Nazi's, they were Romanian soldiers. But he never encountered any acts of kindness from any of the Nazi's or the Romanian soldiers.
5|what single memory of this experience stands out more than anything, all these years later?|21st of March 1944, the Soviet army marching into the ghetto to liberate the Jews.
6|There are stories how as soon as the Russians came in, a lot of them just started to rape a lot of the Jewish prisoners and committed atrocities even worse than the Nazis. Is this true, or is it just anti-commie propaganda?|This did not happen where he was.
7|What was the closest he came to dying, or was there a time when he was sure he was next?|After he was transported on the trains to the ghetto, they shoved 400-500 jews into a pig pen. They locked them into this room for 8 days with no food or water. He went in and out of consciousness and his legs developed Thrombophlebitis. He was certain that he was going to die in that pig pen.
8|Besides Jews, how many other people were imprisoned with him (i.e. homosexuals, handicapped people, etc)?|In his ghetto, it was only jews and ukranians that had lived in the ghetto prior to the evacuation.
9|This is more of a question for you and meant with no disrespect: After surviving such a horrific ordeal at the hands of an enemy, have you ever felt that your grandfather now carries a bit of prejiduce against Romanians/Germans forever.|I don't think he has any hatred towards them. I just came back from a trip to Germany and was discussing with him how nice and friendly the Germans are as a people. As far as forgiving, he says he will never forgive and never forget. The town he grew up in (Vishnitsa) had 5,000 Jews before the war. Today 0.
10|What did they do to keep morale up in the camp? How did they get things (if they could) like tobacco etc?|Those who were pessimists died quickly. His father was a huge optimist and worked as a carpenter building tables in the ghetto. He was able to get paid with pieces of bread that he shared with the family. The Jews were allowed to take anything they could carry with them into the ghetto, but after 4 years there was almost nothing left. Especially no tobacco.
11|Were his religious views affected because of the Holocaust?|He was Jew then and he is a Jew now.
12|How do you feel about Holocaust deniers?|These are bad people, fascists!
13|If you could take one piece of modern day equipment back to the Ghetto, what would it be?|Light and a newspaper, so he would know what was going on. They had no idea what was happening and what would happen to them. They were in the dark.
14|What determined who would be killed before someone else?|The Romanian soldiers guarding the ghetto did not just randomly murder the Jews. They would kill someone if they broke the rules, such as not wearing a star of David or leaving camp grounds.
15|Was there anything that he did to increase his chances of surviving?|He was young, 12 - 13 years old, and his father was a great carpenter who was able to work for food and support the family. But then in 1943 Nazi's came and took his father away to another part of Ukraine to help build a bridge. His older brother ended up taking his fathers place as a carpenter and brought home food for the family while his father was gone.
16|What did he do to pass the time?|He says he was never bored.. He was always hungry. There was no radio, newspapers, toys, books, all he did was lay around starving for food.
17|Does he still keep in touch with anyone else from the surviving 15,000?|All the other people he knew that survived the holocaust have passed away.
18|How does he feel about the state of Israel now and the conflict with the Palestinians?|He is a big supporter of Israel and is happy that the world has Israel. He hopes that conflicts end and that Palistine and Israel will just stay on the land they have now in peace.
19|I read that when rumors spread of concentration camps and Jewish people being put onto trains, that a lot Jews in Eastern Europe chose not to believe that such a thing was currently happening further West. Did you hear anything about what was happening before the German army arrived? Also - what was life like living in that ghetto?|He heard these rumors, and believed them. He was in constant fear of the Nazi's coming to kill them.
20|After the liberation, what did your grandfather do? What was it like in post-war Ukraine? Did he experience any further antisemitism?|After liberation he waited 6 to 8 months for his home town (Chernovtsi) to be liberated so that he can return to his house with his family. He was 16 years old and went to school at night and worked as a carpenter during the day. There was antisemitism after the war in Ukraine, but it was no longer public.
21|Did you ever encounter any Canadian soldiers through your journey? What was it like realizing you were one of the few that made it out alive?|He never encountered any Canadian soldiers and was surprised by that question. He says he thanks god everyday that he is alive.
22|Has he ever gone to visit Hebrew schools or secular schools to talk about this with the next generation? I'd suggest you have him at least document some of his stories to video. One day there will be no survivors left and their voices need to live on.|Yes, he did the school talks and has had a video of his survival story done. My stepfather is into Jewish history/genealogy and has documented everything.
23|Did he ever conspire (I realize he was young) or know of any efforts to take up arms in the ghetto?|He was too young, and does not know of anyone taking up arms in the ghetto.
24|How was the social hierarchy in the ghetto? Were there ""snithces""?|He says there was no hierarchy like this, where he was.
25|Did your grandfather have any contact with any of the well know Nazi? Mengele for instance.|Luckily no.
26|How did you mentally get through it? What did you tell yourself?|He says he prayed everyday to both god and his mom that he could survive to live just one day as a free Jew.
27|Did you ever lose faith in humanity?|He never lost faith in humanity, he always hoped that the Americans and Soviets would win the war.
28|I was wondering, how is your Grandfather's faith affected by the Holocaust? Does he believe in God after the Holocaust?|Yes, he believes in god and still considers himself Jewish. But he is secular, (does not do sabbath, but does go to the synogog on holy holidays.)
29|Did anyone really close to him,like family or close friends, die there?|Almost everyone
30|What do you think about the Holodomor?|It was not where he lived. But he read about it.
31|What was the worst thing you saw when you were in the camps?|The worst thing he saw was when they first got to the ghetto, thousands of people were just laying in the snow freezing and dying of hunger, unable to go anywhere for warmth.
32|How has your grandfather coped with raising a healthy family despite all the pain and suffering in his past?|He says he was raised well by his family and continues the same traditions. The world has bad people and good people, he does not let the bad people affect his view of the good in this world.
33|How were people chosen for transport to Transnistria?|They took all the Jews from Chernovtsy to Transnistria.
34|Where did your grandfather's family go after liberation?|After liberation they lived in Chernovtsi until 1991 and then immigrated to America.
35|Where does he live now?|My grandfather now lives in Brighton Beach Brooklyn.
36|After the war, was he tempted to seek out the bastards that did that to him and take justice into his own hands, or did he just want to get as far away as possible, to put it behind him?|No, he was just happy to be alive and home. He let the war crimes courts take care of them.
37|Were any laughs had at least once and a while? People trying to make others feel better or boost spirits?|He said there were no laughs for four years all they wanted was freedom.
38|What movie most accurately depicts how you remember the ghetto?|The Pianist. [edit] Schindlers List is good too
39|Does it annoy you when people nonchalantly compare anyone they disagree with to Hitler and the Holocaust?|There is no one worse than Hitler, there is no one that even comes close.
40|How does he feel about Israel? ... does he have opinions about Palestine/Palestinians?|He feels that Israel has the right to be there and it would be great for Palestine and Israel to sit down and finally have actual substantive peace talks.
41|Did he, his family or the community know what was happening or going to happen to them when the Germans arrived in 1941. Like did they just think it was part of the war?|They panicked, worrying, that they were being taken to be killed.
42|How did the local population treat the Jews before the war?|Prior to the war, people where he lived treated Jews fine.
43|Did your grandfather ever return to his hometown?|He did return to his hometown and was happy to find his home and all his possessions safe.
44|Did he recover any of his families property?|His family was very lucky.
45|What has helped your grandfather the most in coming to terms with what happened to him?|He feels that it is very important to share the stories of the Holocaust to future generations, to make sure that this NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.
46|What was his life like immediately following exiting the ghetto? What happened next?|When returning form the Ghetto, his family was very lucky because all the Jewish homes were destroyed except for his house.

i just checked those out here's what i found

* J-Crew

Seems to be online only, with a flat rate of £9.95 shopping fee. (not sure if you get this refunded if you're unhappy with the product or not. I rarely, if ever, shop online at brand sites.) 

* Uniqlo 

Has stores at the following locations 
&gt;Westfield Stratford city, Bluewater Shopping Centre Kent, Westfield London White city, Wandsworth, Regent street [Closed for refurbishment], Wimbledon, 170 Oxford Street, 311 Oxford Street - London Flagship Store, Selfridges (at the following locations), Kingston, Kensington, Croydon, Bromley.

which isn't ideal as most of these stores seem to be in London or selected selfridges, but they do have online options with a shipping fee of £3.95 as standard.

* Naked and Famous

i *think* only available at Selfridges, and the Selfridges store that is in London specifically, though i could be wrong as their website was confusing, had no prices, and i got this info from [here](http://blog.denimgeek.com/archives/502) (not sure of price for online either, or if it's yet available)

* LEC

only 2 stores in the whole of the UK (outlet stores) they also have one in Europe though. Online only again it seems. Has a shipping rate of £3.95

* Banana Republic

£4.00 shipping rate, only stores are located in London, though they have one up north in The Trafford Centre in Manchester.


Edit: thanks for pointing out those brands are available though, honestly had no clue.

False,1317432393,t5_2qh1i,"Five hundred years ago, 1511. To answer it now, should take a look at what was going on then. The world from the POV of 1511: 

Explorers were big, as the era was considered the ""Age of Discovery"": 


* Portuguese Noble &amp; Explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral 'discovered' Brazil and claimed it for Portugal, 11 years ago. 

* Portuguese Explorer Vasco De Gama made the first Europe to India round trip by sea, 12  years ago. 

* Spanish/Italian Explorer Christopher Columbus 'discovered' the new world, forever changing the course of human history, 19 years ago.   

Art and artists we instantly recognize were alive and making their works, but few had seen or heard of them in 1511: 

* Michaelangelo's iconic *David* statue, completed 7 years ago. 

* Da Vinci's iconic *Mona Lisa* painting, completed 5 years ago.  

* Dutch artist Hieronmous Bosch was in old age. 

In major leaders within Western Civilization that were remembered in some way more than the rest, most of whom for unifying their land, or fighting off or expelling non-Christian inhabitants or invaders.

* Spanish rulers Ferdinand and Isabella completed the expulsion of non-christians and unification of Spain, 19 years ago. This was seen by Western Civilization as an unquestionably good thing until very recently.  

* Vlad III Dracula, defender of his territory against the Ottoman/Muslim invasion, died 35 years ago. 

In technology, 

* Johannes Guttenburg published his famous print Bible, 55 years ago. By 1511, books were increasingly present. Yet he was only mentioned as the inventor of typography in 1507, and the first image of him and the posthumous fame that would follow were still more than 50 years away, in 1567.

In noteworthy figures who were the equivalent of terrorists in their time, but held in much higher esteem later: 

* Founders of Protestantism: Jan Hus was put to death 96 years ago, and the other founder, Martin Luther became a Catholic priest 2 years ago and was studying for his Doctorate in Theology. 

* Joan of Arc, put to death 80 years ago. Her fame began decades after her death, when a Pope declared her innocent. 


The important mental frame to consider in this, is how do we define our era, and to know that what accomplishments we deem great, may not be seen so in the future. And accomplishments that are interesting but minor may become huge many decades from now. And considering how these self-definitions change, some high-profile people hated by those in power and many others in our era may have a legacy quite the opposite (Julian Assange comes to mind). In terms of works of art/writing/music, only what survives all the disasters of time can be remembered. The works we know that were around in 1511 survived (and by extension, the memory of their creators) only because of an improbable passing of those works from person to person, each of whom kept it safe and conveyed its importance to others that it would be preserved after them. What art/film/music/writing/etc of our time will pass this test, impossible to say. 

tl;dr - Julian Assange. ",True,t1_c2nxn24,,1427670377,,0,55,,AskReddit,t3_kwvfn,False,t3_kwvfn,c2nxn24,55,slapchopsuey,0,0
False,1317432446,t5_2sokd,"Well, this starts before. Up till Napoleon made himself Emperor of France, Germany was a lot of small states in a very loose alliance.

Napoleon smashed it, but then lost to the Russian Winter. For the next 60+ years the larger German states fought to be king of the Germans. Prussia won the Majority, but couldn't beat Austria. Between the two they had most of Eastern Europe. 

France was scared of a united Germany being too strong so they fought. Germany had a more experienced army so won the war. Lots of Germans immigrated at this time to the US as they didn't like the Prussians. Germany also took part of France, and the french did not like this. 

France was very offended, and long term felt there would be another war. They made friends with the British, and the new German Empire tried to do the things the other European nations were doing like form colonies. Mostly they took places noone else got to yet. France and the UK sign a lot of treaties incase of war.

40ish years go by. Tensions rise up as there are jealousies and belief another war was going to happen. The Balkans were the obvious place as the Austrians took them from the Russians and Turks. The Balkan people fractured into 3 major factions, each being friendly to either the Russians, Turks or Austrians. So lots of tension. 

The Emperor of Austria is having problems with heirs. So the Arch-duke Ferdinand is likely going to be Emperor soon. He's visiting the Balkans and killed. Austria doesn't like the investigation and leans on the locals who complain to Russia. Things get worse as everyone is being a jerk and idiot ending in the Austrians going to war with Russia, which brings in the Germans. Which brings in the French against them. During the early stages the Germans attack via Belgium, which brings in the British who pledged to protect Belgium. 

Alot of people die as tactic sucks compared to the rate of weapons development. Much of the war is spent in stalemate. Ultimately the British, French and Russians are able to get in more supplies and trade to help them out while Germany and Austria are cut off. America eventually enters which will tip the stalemate. The Germans try one last major offensive and it fails. 5 long years of war killed insane amounts of men. 

Germany and Austria more or less collapse at the war's end, along with Russia and eastern europe. Both the Austrian and Prussian control of eastern europe ends. The germans freed communist leader Lenin to go stir up trouble in Russia. He ends up helping to start the communist revolution which is ongoing at the end of the war. Many new nations pop up in eastern Europe at the end of the war, such as the first free Poland since before Napolean's conquest.

The winners have a complex and insane treaty that's suppose to help, including freeing those nations in the east and redistributing the colonies around the world, including giving some german pacific islands to Japan. The treaty includes the league of nations as a group to help prevent future conflicts. But the key thing is germany is considered the bad guy and must pay for their actions. 

Germany, in the post war collapse lead to fighting and violence and attempted communists running the nation. Eventually they get a democratic government. They have huge problems paying the bill to the winners, and it leads to inflation so bad that between being paid and paying your bills the money might be worthless. Germans become unhappy. 

Russia in the mean time finally has the civil war end with Stalin running things. He proceeds to make the rest of the government his, and kills or sends to prisons in Siberia anyone he doesn't like.

The winner's have a pretty good time until 1929. Then the stock market crashes and people do stupid things trying to fix the economy, such as putting taxes on foreign goods to help local makers of the goods. This stops trade and makes things much worse. So people are mad, and scared and angry. 

The germans are mad enough to listen to a crazy man who promises to solve their problems and make them strong again and get revenge on the winners of the last war. This is Hitler, and he blames the problems on the Jews. Many germans vote him in as he promises strength. 

Hitler's political party, the Nazi's, are thugs and attack the jews, making more and more laws against them. Many Jews escaped as soon as they could, but most did not. Hitler spent his time planning a new military and how to conquer the rest of the winners. What he really wants to do is beat the Russians and make all of the east into his puppet. However he's able to make friends with the Russians at first.

* Take for example the [opium wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_wars), where China was devastated.
* The fact that China's larger northern capital Peking (which becomes Beijing later) was partialled up into several different ""Districts"" if you will, each completely owned, even by Chinese law, by large imperialistic countries. This influence effectively made the last emporer of China, essentially a young man (ruled from 14yrs through 20 yrs, I think) was a puppet.

Can you point to any winter where the Arctic did **NOT** freeze over?

The shelf was of glacial freshwater ice at the openings of the channels that lead to the Arctic Ocean. However Sea Ice refreezes each year. Nominal amount of ice varies only in certain areas such as off the coast of Newfoundland, Kamchatka and Northwestern Europe. The rest of the Arctic is pretty much land bound and once it freezes there ...there is no more expansion. This leads to a changed meltback over time, but the amount is buffered by the geographical characteristics and the state change from ice to water which maintains a near constant temperature 2 meters above the water in Summer.

Someone already mentioned fossil fuels and the world's been somewhat preparing for that...but what happens when we run out of fresh water?  People depend on fossil fuels for convenience, but they depend on water for survival; shit will most definitely get real when the demand for water outweighs the supply.  And then there's the economic situation we’re going through.  Bad economies spark wars, it's a trend throughout history.  If this continues for much longer or gets much worse, it's not long before we see people turning to extremist politicians (nationalist and xenophobic parties are already gaining ground in Europe.)

False,1317445270,t5_2qh1i,"I really like Romney. After months of Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann being the faces of the GOP, I'm happy to have someone smart (top 5% Harvard business school, top third Harvard Law) as a frontrunner in the primaries.

**On Social Security**: He also appeals to all the moderate viewpoints I have. He recognizes that social security is a working system, but needs to be tweaked due to there being proportionately more old people and old people living longer. He also recognizes that it's fiscally unacceptable that other government agencies have been squandering the social security budget surplus.

**On Healthcare**: Romney recognizes that rising health costs have gotten out of hand, and that new things need to be tried out at the state level. Everyone calls him out for supporting Romneycare but being against Obamacare, but I think it makes perfect sense to attempt something on a state level that would be wrong on a national level (For example, I might support changes to tort liability for medical malpractice in some states, but if we did the same to all states we'd hardly be able to have each state learn from each other). I don't think Romney is imaginative enough to come up with a strong healthcare plan, but I would prefer his ideas at the federal level to PPACA.

**On the economy**: Look, I like Obama. But so far he's been worse than Jimmy Carter for the economy. His economic proposals have been uniformly rejected, even by Democrats. His jobs plan has some good ideas, but lots of bad ones as well, and it's coming much too late.

Romney has significant experience both in government policy and in business. He is well experienced at creating meaningful jobs – not simply unproductive government jobs, but real jobs that do something. I know that at Bain he often shed jobs from businesses – and I like that. Sometimes to make a business successful, you have to shed the jobs that aren't actually being productive. I feel like that sort of experience is very relevant to our current situation. We need someone who can lower unemployment, not being the statistic is scary, but because we're going to have to compete with Europe, China, and India for jobs – and to do that, we need productive jobs, and not jobs for jobs' sake.

**On social issues**: I'm a social conservative. That doesn't make me friends with many people, but I see abortion as categorically wrong from a deontological perspective. Killing an innocent human being is wrong, a fetus is a human life, so how is killing a fetus not wrong? It doesn't help that the supreme court cases that legislated this on the federal level were very shoddy reasoning. I see gay marriage as a moot point. The GLBTQ community wants recognition and acceptance, not a change in how red tape works. 

**What I think of other candidates besides Romney**

**Rick Perry**: Perry has as good an experience section of the resume as it gets, but his education section worries me. There was a time when smart people were the voice of the Republican party – Bill Buckley, et al. Perry's far too anti-science to be the face of the GOP. Perry's done some great things in Texas, but the US is not Texas, and frankly, I don't think Perry is smart enough for the job.

**Michelle Bachmann**: The media has been unfair to her. She's a unique voice for an important section of the country, but she's anti-science and has no experience.

**Ron Paul**: He's a man of integrity, and I strongly support his isolationist views on foreign policy. He's smart and candid, but he's no president. His vision of America is far too radical – abolishing the Fed, etc. I like him, and I think we do need radical changes so confront our current unemployment rut, but I think putting a guy like Paul in charge would mean too much changes that I'm not comfortable with.

**The rest**: Gingrich has very legitimate experience and did wonderful things with Clinton as speaker of the house. It' a pity he doesn't have more support. Herman Cain has an interesting perspective, and is a great speaker, but he has no business running for president with no relevant experience. Huntsman is fantastic, has done wonderful things in Utah, and if he had more support, he'd be at the top of my list. Unfortunately, he's a bad campaigner. Gary Johnson doesn't add much that Ron Paul doesn't add.

I think most people outside of America that make $30k a year or more own their own home or apartment, don't make any car payments, and save a few grand a year.

He's been going to college for two years+ and went to Europe for vacation a month ago. It happened to him and his older sister when he was really young around 8 years old and because of it he thinks his sexual orientation is different now then what it would've been. He coped with it by laughing all the time and joking around. He is the most amiable dude I know and anybody would like him.

I have similar views. I think it's ridiculous how someone who is 18 can be stamped with pedophilia when their girlfriend/boyfriend is only a year or two younger and have that over them for the rest of their life. People like to view pedophiles as one category ""baby rapers"" but that's not true their are different levels to it and I know it's hard for you not to be biased from what you've gone through.

I was never trying to justify actions of people who sexually abuse children. No. Their are people who do it and those who like the idea but won't act on it (wanting to or not) and those are two different things. I know everyone has their own disturbing thoughts but most of those are never acted on or spoken about. 

I don't think it's so black and white. I don't agree with you on him viewing the material being harmful to the child in it (The actual event that happened IS obviously, but someone watching it won't change what has already happened). He's not paying for it and maybe by watching it he is indirectly giving demand for such things, but then again it's not like one person not viewing it will stop the whole industry. And if that helps him funnel away from actually abusing anyone maybe it's best. What would be even better would be finding psychiatric help to lessen it, but it'll probably never go away completely and they'll probably just be masking it. I don't know I'm not an expert on this.

Ever since a Progress freighter collided with Mir, Russia and the US have been paranoid about collisions.

Before the european ATV docked at the space station, it had it's docking system and software fully audited by the Russian and American space agencies.  AND it was monitored by a Russian Kurs docking system also onboard.

Japan's HTV and (soon) SpaceX's Dragon don't even get to dock; they're berthed.  That is, they fly near the station, the CanadArm2 grapples them, and places them on a port.

That's the sort of thing that would be a tad humiliating for China.

And so what China launched this week is a docking target.  Not only will it help debug and gain experience with docking for their future space station, but also with docking at ISS.

&gt; But the Czar of Russia caught the stench of the plot and completely torpedoed it. The enraged Nathan Rothschild, then the head of the dynasty, vowed that some day he or his descendants would destroy the Czar and his entire family, and his descendants did accomplish that very threat in 1917.

&gt; In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln discovered that the Tsar of Russia (by then, Alexander II) was also having problems with the Rothschilds; as he was refusing their continual attempts to set up a central bank in Russia. The Tsar then gave President Lincoln some unexpected help: he issued orders that if either England or France actively intervened in the American Civil War, and help the South, Russia would consider such action a declaration of war, and would take the side of President Lincoln. To show that he wasn't messing about, he sent part of his Pacific Fleet to port in San Francisco and another part to New York.

""Money that does not do anything"".  It may appear this way, but this is not true, this money is INVESTED. -INVESTMENTS ARE IMPORTANT- 

But let me get this straight if a poor man has devoted his life to investing in Ford Mustangs, and he has 20 of them.  A poorer man (who already has a car, just not a nice one) has some sort of a moral claim to one of these Ford Mustangs? 

That is what is scaring businesses away as we speak.  

The federal government is the largest waster of capital in the world.  $300,000 spent per job created in the last stimulus?  Have you see all the new pavement Obama's workers have put down?  Yeah me neither, it had to be all torn up to replace the pipes underneath the roads.  How about the TSA, anybody want to donate to those college drop outs?  

The federal government doesn't invest in infrastructure, in fact our federal government doesn't do much of anything with our taxes except redistribute it, pocket it, and spend it on wars.  

Look in 2009 the minimum wage was bumped up by $0.70/hour, from $6.55 to $7.25, anybody who's marginal benefit to a company is greater than $6.55/hour and less than $7.25 an hour is now out of work and unemployable.  Something is better than nothing (protesting)...

Unemployment benefits were extended and widened to ease the ""recession""...sounds good on paper, but it only hurts the people it tries to help in the end...

Obamacare.  How the hell does an employer know what to hire you for if he doesn't know what your health insurance will cost them.  They don't know if it will be repealed, if the Republicans will take office and veto it, etc etc etc.  They'd rather wait to hire, than hire and decrease pay and have to ""lay blame and excuses"" on upset workers who will not understand.

The Federal Reserve.  Will they TARP, will they not TARP, will they EASE will they not EASE, will we see the TWIST, will we not see the TWIST.   As a large business all of this is important, and it seems that every year we get more unprecedented action from the Federal Reserve aimed to ""shock"" the stock market into rebounding, sure it's bullish for the stock market and it makes people feel good, but it's bad for long-term economic/financial planning.  There's no certainty, stability, etc.

These are just a few of the main reasons, that when you couple it with everything else, and then throw a recession on top of it, and Sovereign debt worries, and troubles in Europe, there just isn't going to be a lot of hiring.  

That's just how it is.

Because they were captured. If they'd been fighting with the German army in Europe the USAF would have bombed them regardless of their citizenship. Which is sort of the point.

It's also worth pointing out that a military tribunal is not a trial in the civilian sense - the rules of evidence favour the prosecution. Basically if you were caught out of uniform and behind enemy lines in WWII the assumption was that you would be executed. 

In fact downed RAF aircrews would wear their uniform under civilian clothes in an attempt to avoid this. Everyone knew that fighting out of uniform meant no POW status. And no POW status usually meant if you were caught you certainly be executed.

E.g. 

http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837937,00.html

&gt; The question is even more relevant now, since more than 5,500 suspected Communists were captured during the Tet offensive. In previous modern wars, the rare soldier caught out of uniform could expect to be shot as a spy; the Geneva Convention of 1949 in effect denies prisoner-of-war status to spies. It allows soldiers captured out of uniform to qualify for P.W. privileges if they 1) carried arms ""openly"" or 2) fought ""in accordance with the laws and customs of war."" But in Viet Nam, what is a uniform? The Viet Cong dress in the black pajamas of the country peasantry or in ordinary street clothing, like Loan's victim, and wear red armbands or other identifying badges only in combat. And what, in Viet Nam, are the laws and customs of war?

The US reserves the right to execute people even post 1949

1. Take a German class in Germany if you can. Do everything you can to practice speaking. Speaking German in real-world situations is harder than in a classroom.

2. What is your citizenship? If you're Canadian, the immigration process shouldn't be an issue. You can enter without a visa, but you will need to get a residence permit within the first three months of your stay. The residence permit doubles as a work permit-- you will need to have work authorization added to it when you apply. 

3. Your lack of money will be an issue. At least for my study permit, I need to prove I have 700 euros a month for study or around 8,000 euros in the bank. I'm sure a similar rule applies for those looking for work, but double-check. 

4. Continuing with the lack of funds, no permanent residence = no residence permit. You need a permanent residence with a contract signed by your landlord. Keep in mind most apartments (and WGs too, I believe) make you put down a deposit of 1-3 month's rent.

4. Berlin has an unemployment rate of 17.5% and you will not have easy access to the job market. You will probably need a job offer letter to get permission to work, and the company may have to prove that they can't hire an EU national to do the job.

False,1317458788,t5_2qh13,"A typical piece in which pseudo-logic brings you to the conclusion with which the author began. 

There are three chief issues that are in play. 

First and foremost is the basic question of how to get economic activity going again. The situation is uncontroversial: that investors and companies are sitting on heaps of cash, but are not using it to invest because they are uncertain of the future. Acting as they do on behalf of other people, this is understandable and is the fulfilment of their basic job. However, the result which this creates is more uncertainty. If the economy were to grow, both calls on the state would fall and income to the state rise, and this would solve most of the problem. A tax on cash holdings by companies might, therefore, be an interesting policy. (It would exclude the sums required for banks to hold against illiquidity, of course.)

Second, there has been vast over-borrowing by states and individuals. Consumer debt is a tottering, huge mountain that, if a mass default were to be triggered by very poor economic conditions, would not be open to any feasible corrective measure except purposely-triggered hyperinflation. That is one major reason why states are taking the slow route to economic correction, rather than accepting severe pain today. The upshot is that, by pure mathematics of the situation, we will see very slow growth for a decade or more. There are no policy levers available except low interest rates: people and nations have to pay back what they owe, or declare bankruptcy. 

State debt is slightly different. The third feature that is holding things back are first, the over-valuation of the dollar as a reserve currency and second and more acutely the issue, the innate instability of the Euro. If the countries that cannot achieve the disciplines necessary to stay in a common currency were to leave it, then their effective devaluation would relieve much of their stress. Yes, there would be negative effects on nations which held their debt. It would almost certainly be cheaper for all to accept this as a once-off cost than to continue to throw money at a situation that has no exit strategy. 

The Euro has proven a hugely expensive experiment and needs rapidly to be trimmed back. For Germany, with an artificialloy low exchange rate, it has been a tax on the general population in favour of exporting industry. In less organised countries, it is now a trap, worsened by the amount they were able to borrow within th Eurozone on effective guarantee by other, fitter states. 

Turning to wealth: the top two percent pay around 30% of tax in both the US and UK, and probably more in continental Europe. In the UK, only two million of thirty million households pay more to the state than they receive in subsidy from it. The rich support the entire welfare state right now.

I tried to be a bit auto-didactic before I headed over there: played with some language learning software (there is no Rosetta Stone ""Finnish"" unfortunately) as well as having bought some books, and boning up on grammar and the finer points of the language. I then had a semester of intense Finnish courses from my university, but it became a bit too much with my regular course load, so it fell a bit by the way side. Somewhat unconventional, but Finnish is super complicated so I'm content with my skills for the time being; something to build upon if nothing else.

My German worked out much better though! I had always had some interest in the language I guess, and it clicked with me. I didn't ever conventionally study it either really, not in a classroom until university at least, where I then just hopped into some intermediate courses taught there, joined up on the ""minor"" program, and away I went. I then began having courses simply taught in German (literature, history, politics, etc) and that made things click a lot more. This past  semester I went to Berlin on an exchange. I can now definitely say that I am fluent. Dreaming in German is cool. 

So, it's hard to measure just how long it took to reach this point, but I would say after I just immersed myself in German as much as I could (albeit in a non-German speaking country) through my coursework, it took about a year for me to really be fully comfortable with the language. I would say start-finish, someone could achieve a reasonable level of proficiency in German in probably 2-3 years if the person were living in a German-speaking country and diligent. However, for Finnish it would definitely take quite a bit longer, probably more like 5-6 years to really pick up on most of the subtleties and to get a good grasp on the intricacies of the language.

That was very, very real, and it was not what one would call a good thing.

Secondly, the Cold War was not quite as simple as you make it out to be, strategically. There were plenty of complexities, plenty of conflicts, and plenty of proxy fighting. Chinese and Russian troops, for example, fought along side North Korean forces in the Korean war, though they avoided wearing the uniform for deniability.

Thirdly, it's easy to forget the consequences of Communist rule on the citizens of the countries affected. One hundred million civilians died from purges, massacres, pogroms, gulags, genocide, and starvation under Stalin and Mao. The scale of the human tragedy involved is almost impossible to reconcile mentally. North Korea is an ongoing poster child for the evils of hard-line Communist governments.

It's hard to chalk any of that up to societal progress or to the betterment of mankind. We escaped the annihilation of human civilization, but we also brought ourselves to the brink of it.

Glasgow is a great place to visit and we are known for our friendliness to tourists especially Americans as they are here all the time! Compared to Edinburgh we have less dedicated tourist sites but that means it is also much less of a tourist trap, just like many European second cities compared to their capitals. There is still plenty to see and do with world famous architecture and nightlife.

In the past Glasgow used to be a pretty violent place but over the last 15 years a lot of effort has been made to clean up the city. When I was a kid you heard about someone getting stabbed nearly every time Celtic and Rangers met; these days it is an EXTREMLEY rare occurrence and yes you would even be safe walking around on a match day. Current efforts have moved beyond violence and the Scottish parliament is working multilaterally to stamp out all forms of sectarianism including online hate speech and even what songs the fans can sing at these games.

Gang violence which once blighted the city is now a shadow of its former self. During the recent riots which took place in England David Cameron praised Glasgow’s police force for their work in reducing gang violence and stated that English cities should attempt to emulate these efforts.

Now if you want to see some Scottish gang violence you should check out the films *Small Faces* and *NEDS*, yes these films do a decent job of depicting Glasgow gang culture but just remember these are set 40 years ago now.


**Where to stay**
The three main areas of the city that you’d want to stay in are the west end, city centre or south side. South side is more of a residential area so there is less to do there but you are never far on a train or bus and it is the cheapest of the three. Stay there if you are on a tight budget.

The city centre is the busiest of the three as you are in the main area of Glasgow and can get to the two main train stations, the bus station or underground very easily however if you are driving you may not be able to get parking unless it is included with your hotel.

My personal recommendation would be the west end, this is the student/trendy area of Glasgow and it is a great place to see day or night. The benefit to staying here is you can get the underground (sometimes called the clockwork orange due to its colour) into the city centre to get to anywhere you want to see but then you can come back to some great trendy bars/restaurants at night. You are also only about 40 minutes from Loch Lomond if you fancy a day trip and the weather holds out. Remember to ask where you are staying about the nearest free parking for west end as many streets are pay only but you can normally find something free nearby.

**What to do**
Glasgow is famed for its sense of humour and many top comedians state Glasgow as both one of the hardest audiences but one of the best. Many comedians even film their live dvds in Glasgow due to the great responses, check out Stewart Lee and Jimmy Carr who are both English. So I would recommend trying a comedy club while you are here, there is a Jongleurs comedy club located in the city centre and the Stand comedy club in the west end (I would recommend the Stand) while more established comedians play at bigger venues.

The Glasgow music scene is going strong and you will find even small pubs tend to put on band nights often while there are bigger gigs on somewhere every night with the biggest venues being SECC, Barrowlands, 02 Accademy and 02 ABC. I’ll just mention the Arches nightclub as being consistently voted one of the top 20 clubs in the world but I know you said you weren’t really looking for that kind of thing. 

There are multiple museums scattered around the city including the newly built Riverside transport museum with Kelvingrove in the west end, gallery of modern art (GOMA) in the city centre and the Burrell Collection in the southside being amongst the most highly regarded but there are others to find if that is your thing.

If you appreciate architecture then you will find a lot to look at in Glasgow. I’d recommend checking out Alexander “Greek” Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. CRM is one of our local heroes, you can take a tour in the art school he designed or you should checkout the lighthouse building he also designed which is now an art gallery promoting architecture.

You mentioned Princes Square and it’s a very nice place to visit but also one of the most expensive so just be prepared. Merchant city in the city centre has some really nice bars and restaurants and generally Byres road and the roads off that (west end) have many pubs and restaurants for you to explore. I know a lot of Americans enjoy visiting the Oran Mor pub in the west end and the Bothy restaurant is a good Scottish experience too about 5 minutes from there.

All in all I’ve written a lot but there is still even more to explore in Glasgow than I’ve covered here so I hope you come and visit.

Now, instead of fighting the enemy head on, we're caught in a question of whether or not it's right to kill one of them depending on where they are.  We're getting drawn into a war that takes us into many countries - some as full out wars and some as specific actions (like the attack on Bin Laden in Pakistan or this one).  

Interestingly, we're kind of now fighting the way Israel was forced to years ago - taking out the bad guys in assassinations wherever in the world they could do it.  And it was always a situation that got Israel bad press.  

I wish we would just come out and say radicalized, violence-promoting islamic groups are at war with us and we will fight them with violence and seek their destruction as they seek ours.

False,1317465398,t5_2qh1s,"I disagree. I think they are pretty much spot on. The Euro experiment formed in the late 90s, and everything was fine, all the member nations had low and stable debt loads. What emerged thereafter was that nations that consistently ran a current account balance deficit developed debt problems. The PIIGS can be ranked in terms of the %GDP they ran as current account balance deficits from 2000-2007. Now, normally a nation with a current account balance deficit does a few things. They lower the central bank overnight rate, and their current depreciates. These two actions weaken their currency, and act to mitigate the current account balance debt load. If not, the currency will continue to depreciate (witness the almighty buck). 

However, in these countries, the actions of the central bank were dominated by the stronger large Euro nations. The overnight rate was kept aggressively high to target 2% CPI  (not even core-CPI) in Germany. And because the current account balance of the entire Eurozone was pretty close to flat, the Euro did not weaken - it strengthened. So those debts, well, they got out of control.

And the PIIGs nations did not get their current account balance under control, perhaps because the dynamics of the situation were different. Normally the central bank helps autocorrect such problems, and currency depreciation takes care of the rest. The only alternative now was austerity, which is a program guaranteed to reduce GDP in the future. Cutting spending and raising taxes will only push the PIIGS closer to default.

So maybe default is an option? However, the Euro nations are linked by a net of shared debt. Who holds a lot of Greek debt? Well, the Germans, French, and Portuguese do. When they default, the Germans will bail out Deutschebank, the French will bail out SocGen and BNP Paribas and Credite Agricole, but what if Portugal is expected to bail out the Greek debt load carried by its nation? The CDS on Portuguese bonds already indicates a high likelihood of failure (higher than Lehman Bros before failute). So suppose Portugal goes next. Well, as it happens, Spain holds an immense amount of Portuguese debt. And Spain is a LOT bigger. Who holds a lot of Spanish debt? Germany could go under. For another leg of the PIIGS net, Irish debt is held by Great Britain (who is not in the EMU and can depreciate its currency). However, the credit default swap on RBS is pretty dern high and its assets, in total, are equal to the GDP of Great Britain. 

The Euro nations are adamantly opposed to a collective pool of debt sharing in which the Greek, Portuguese, and Irish debt is paid for by other nations. Instead, they are tracking a road in which these nations default, and each member nation has to develop a plan for its banks. There is no tragedy of the commons problem here. Pretty soon there will be no here here. 

The big lesson from the Euro experiment, which still may end in failure, is that current account balances must be dealt with explicitly and aggressively if you share a currency with other nations. Otherwise the debt load will become unsustainable. If people do not migrate from nations with poor current account balances to nations with good ones, the whole thing will go under. This migration issue is how the United States can survive while its states have varying account balances. The economy sucks in one state, so people move. In Europe, not enough people move.

Both of these groups had a deal amongst eachother: if anybody messes with a country of our team, the entire team will stick together and protect eachother. The Triple Entente later changed their name to **""the Allies""** because lots of other countries (like the USA) had joined up with them.
 
Now the problem was the little wildcard called Serbia. Serbia wasn't in any of the teams, but they were buddies with Russia (who was in the Allied team). Now, some people (terrorists) in Serbia really hated Austria-Hungary, so one day they went to an Austrian parade and threw bombs at the Austrian emperor's car, and shot at him with guns. The Austrian emperor was killed along with his wife.
 
Austria-Hungary was of course incredibly pissed, and wanted to punish Serbia by invading them. Serbia immediately called their buddy (Russia) for help, and Russia called the rest of the Allied team. Austria-Hungary knew they couldn't win alone, so they called the rest of their team. Both teams then fought a huge great war that lasted 4 years... And the Central Powers lost.
 
After the war was over, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire were disintegrated, destroyed. They didn't exist anymore. The only country from the Central Powers team left standing was Germany, so Germany had to pay for ALL the damage. Of course, Germany was extremely angry because of how unfair that was. Then Hitler appeared and became the Führer of Germany, because he promised to lead Germany in a new great war and get revenge on the Allies. He also said that the reason Germany lost WW1 was somehow the jews' fault.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbp6umQT58A

The FED gets the money from our gov't. Our gov't gets the money from borrowing from banks through T-bonds at interest creating national debt. Our Gov't then turns around and let the FED lend that same money back to the bank at a lower interest than the Gov't gets paid through T-bonds thus losing money. The bank then turns around and is allowed to loan x10 the amount. **Most importantly Bank's have the choice of where to invest in and they choose profit over people causing bubbles and depressions, recessions. Let's not forget the banks making record profits trading during these economic swings.** **This is why we are protesting.** Oh and guess who is working hard to pay bank back those T-bonds fund we borrowed? The people.  

To answer how will we have money without FED? The FED is just a printing press and we don't need them. America did fine without them in the past when they were established along with IRS against the constitution. FED is simply borrowing money from banks at interest. You were just told they are banks bank without knowing how the system works. It's time people actually learn how money is made and get educated on how FED system works.
 
What we really need is to have money supply that cannot be manipulated by anyone. That way other future bubbles and following recession depression can be avoided. Gold is going up because no one can inflate the quantity of gold and duplicate thus reducing it's purchasing power over time. The value of the Dollar, however, has been going down in purchasing power ever since the establishment of FED due to inflation. They keep printing more money and all it does is devalue the dollar that are already in circulation in the economy and inject that value back to banks to decided where the money goes again. We all know how that turned out. 

This is why we need a currency like bitcoin where there isn't one single central authority that can inflate it or determine where the money will be distributed to. It's completely people owned and operated both open source and decentralized peer to peer protocol. 

For more info about bitcoin go here. http://www.weusecoins.com/

We can only create a stable environment for continuous economic growth if we stop the banks from doing this repeatedly. And they have done this in history. Just research past depressions. All we need to do is follow what our founding fathers did to escape the bankers in Europe. Don't assume for a second that banks don't like the big swings in economy because it's the best opportunity for banks to make money and they want to create panic in economy like today. Just like they make money from wars. 
.
.

tl;dr: Bank loans Gov't money via T-bonds and like at high interest. Gov't gives FED the same money or ""national debt iou money"" back to banks at lower interest. Through fractioinal banking bank now is allowed to loan x10 the money they invested originally in T-bonds at higher interest than they are paying our beloved country.

-----

This event began as a protest to safeguard the rights of free speech, as a response to murders, attacks and threats by Islamic extremists to those who dared to exercise that right.

• November 2004:

Because he had made a documentary on the abuse of women in Muslim countries, Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh was killed. His throat was cut and a knife was plunged into his chest.

• September 2005:

Cartoonist Kurt Westergaard published editorial cartoons depicting Mohammed in Jyllands-Posten, a Danish newspaper. This led to Islamic protests across the Muslim world, some of which escalated into violence with instances of firing on crowds of protestors (resulting in a total of more than 100 reported deaths), including setting fire to the Danish Embassies in Syria, Lebanon and Iran, storming European buildings, and burning the Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, French and German flags in Gaza City.

Since the drawing of the cartoon, Westergaard has received several death threats and murder attempts. As a result, he is under constant police protection.

• July 2007:

Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks published a depiction of Mohammed in Nerikes Allehanda, a Swedish newspaper. In response, some of its employees were forced to use bodyguards after receiving death threats. Vilks himself also received several death threats.

• February 2008:

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) announced the arrest of three Muslims — two Tunisians and one Moroccan-born Dane — who were charged with planning to murder Westergaard. After the plot was foiled, the Danish secret service was made responsible for protecting Westergaard. He was placed under police surveillance when travelling to and from work. His house was fitted with steel doors, a panic room, reinforced glass in the windows and surveillance cameras.

• January 2010:

A 28-year-old Somali Muslim intruder armed with an axe and knife entered Westergaard's house and was subsequently shot and wounded by police. Westergaard was unharmed due to security precautions in his house. He fled to a panic room when he saw the intruder standing in the hallway wielding an axe.

• April 14, 2010:

South Park's 200th episode aired, which contained a likeness of Mohammed. Radical Muslim websites issued threats on the lives of South Park's co-creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. In episode 201 (the second part of this two-part story), all images of Mohammed were obscured by ""censored"" bars, and all audio of the prophet was muted. This was done by Comedy Central in response to the backlash from Muslims.

• April 20, 2010:

In response to South Park's censorship, U.S. cartoonist Molly Norris draws a cartoon in which various objects claim to be Mohammed. In the image, Norris declares May 20th to be ""Everybody Draw Muhammad Day"", saying that if enough people draw pictures of Muhammad, Islamic terrorists would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. The idea gained large support on Facebook. However, as the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others taking up the cause. Facebook had an ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day"" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants.

False,1317472651,t5_2sh0b,"Im not an engineering student in USA, so I can't really give precise advise, but I can still share of my experience of being one in Europe

Having a social life and studying engineering is hard, as you spend very many of your wake hours at school. I was an idioit when I started high school, and didn't take any math- or scienceclasses, and Im paying for that now. I expect to spend about 60 hours a week at school, and since August I've only had one day off, a sunday a couple of weeks ago.

I can give one advise, which to me is good advise. *Try to be as social at possible at school*. You spend your whole day together with the same class, or at least parts of it. Be friends with your classmates, and when schoolwork is done for the day, do something fun together. We go out drinking a couple of times during the week, play paintball, and other social events. 

My social life with my friends from before I started in college is hard to maintain, as Im usually at school to the evening, and also in the weekends. But the worst part is, that I dont have anything to speak about than school when I meet my other friends, since basicly the only thing I do is math and mechanics.

But there are good parts as well! I really enjoy studying engineering, have fun times at school, and every wednesday is like sacred to me.. That's the night during the week I take completly off, and go out drinking with the other students. Fridays works too! Especially that wednesday is important, and I think you will need breaks like that to get through a hard major like engineering. Engineering is very rewarding, fun study, good pay, and at least in my country, 80% of constructional engineering students have a job before they are finished with their studies.

To compare: I went to Cologne (general area) when I was 16, and more recently visited the USVI (St. Croix), Montreal, and visited the Scottish Highlands, London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Budapest before arriving in Istanbul. 

Besides the sights of Istanbul (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, the history is for obvious reasons, amazing, and there is good nightlife in Taksim), Turkey offers mountains, and beautiful beaches, and more ruins than you can shake a stick at. Look into Pamukkale, Cappadocia (cave churches, fairy towers, it looks amazing), and Ephesus. Greece is also just next door. 

If you are looking for something different, consider Turkey. It is a shame how little publicized it is in the US tourist industry, because there are so many amazing things here. The people are very friendly, and the food amazing. And, it will be cheaper than the rest of Europe: 1 lira is between $.53 and $.54. Airfare might be more expensive. The weather is also good, coming from a fellow Texan. :) And be prepared for required social interaction.

3. As I lived all my life in Poland - some figures:

-- Average salary - $16 000 / year ($11 500 after tax)

-- Average housing price - $1000 / m^2. That is $50 000 for reasonable flat to live in + $200 / month for water, electricity, garbage etc

-- Food cost is the same as in the USA or more - http://www.dailyfinance.com/photos/food-price-comparison-around-the-world/3656018/ (look at prices in Germany which are more or less the same)

-- Cars are a little bit more expensive, but you can skip that and use public transport. Monthly ticket usually around $35 / month

-- you get free education. Gindergarten is not free, about $35 / month. You still have to pay for all the books used in school.

-- Health care is somewhat free - doctor visit is free, medication is not, except the one administered in hospital. You sometimes have to wait months to see a specialist

So, knowing that:
-- Admit that Poland, country from eastern Europe that just 22 years ago was poor as fuck, is doing better than US and move there. Getting a 20k/year job as a native speaker of English (to work at language school/teach people at home) will be very easy.

I feel like I'm doing your homework for you, but I like your topic so I decided to come back and add some more. 

The following is from first few pages of an EU report on the abundance of documented abuses by Microsoft. It's thirty three pages. Link at the bottom. 

In the early 1980s, Microsoft purchased an early version of a standard disk operating system (“DOS”) that became known as MS-DOS.12 At the time, a number of rival operating systems offered features, such as the ability to run multiple programs at the same time, that Microsoft’s operating systems would not offer until years later. At the time, operating systems were just beginning to move from a command-based interface to a graphical user interface. Microsoft developed a graphical user interface known as Windows. Early versions of Windows did not actually “run” the computer – rather, they were a shell surrounding the underlying DOS program, which in turn ran the computer. Initially, Windows embraced the DOS standard, which meant that Windows would run on top of any DOS, including DR-DOS, Microsoft’s principal rival in the DOS market.

This initial interoperability came to be known as part of Microsoft’s now-classic“embrace, extend, and extinguish” strategy, which Microsoft has subsequently and successfully employed in many other product areas. This strategy has three phases: First, Microsoft “embraces” a competing product by developing software or implementing standards that are compatible with the competing product. Microsoft then “extends” its own offering by creating features or standards that are interoperable only with Microsoft’s proprietary technologies. Finally, when Microsoft’s proprietary software or standards have achieved widespread adoption, Microsoft “extinguishes” its competitors by dropping any remaining pretense of compatibility.

In the case of DR-DOS, Microsoft’s initial decision to make Windows interoperable helped promote rapid adoption of the Windows shell. At the same time, however, it meant that many consumers chose the superior DR-DOS over MS-DOS. In an email to then-Vice President Steve Ballmer, Microsoft founder and then-CEO Bill Gates wrote:

“Our DOS gold mine is shrinking and our costs are soaring—primarily due to low prices, IBM share, and DR-DOS…. I believe people underestimate the impact that DR-DOS has had on us in terms of pricing.”

Microsoft “extended” Windows by making changes so that Windows would no longer interoperate with DR-DOS smoothly. For example, Microsoft designed Windows to display an ominous error message when used in conjunction with the DR-DOS software. Microsoft also disseminated false information about DR-DOS “so people [would] make judgments against it without knowing details or fa[c]ts.” By 1994, Microsoft had effectively extinguished DR-DOS as a threat to Microsoft’s own operating system.

everyone knows WWII was the axis v. allies. but it was really a three-front war, soviets v. axis v. allies. the entire reason we launched d-day (which was a very risky and very uncertain plan) was because the soviets had started to push back and would end up marching on berlin before the allies. and, as we all know with war, the winner makes the rules. and the danger at the time was all of europe (and eventually the USA) would become part of the soviet union.

(off topic, it's actually kind of funny to think how close germany came to winning WWII. if hitler had left the soviets alone, this would be a very different world)

we fought the war not so we wouldn't speak german, but so we wouldn't speak russian.

so the soldiers and marines at the time were not just fighting for america, but for freedom as we know it, world wide. i would highly recommend reading more about WWII, it's an incredibly interesting topic and much of what was taught in high school missed important points.

While it was plain the land was already inhabited by ""Indians"" (their word), the mindset of the time was that land was only really settled when it was being cultivated, and as the Indians were unorganized in this way, the land wasn't really theirs and was up for grabs. Yes, I realize many Native American tribes actually did cultivate the land. Likely early colonialists did too, but through a combination of greed, racism, and tunnel vision, Indians were simply not true Scotsmen, so they were driven off systematically. As such, I doubt colonialists would think of themselves as ""immigrants"" so much as settlers in an ""empty"" land.

Further, as is said elsewhere in this thread, early Americans' welcome to new outsiders was largely dependent on origin. It can be seen time and again that in early American history the noble freedoms the country was founded on was meant for specific groups of white people. Scots-irish and German newcomers (some Pennsylvania Dutch and similar groups weren't ""white"" but counted as being grandfathered in, essentially) were heavily discriminated against. God help you if you were black or Indian. Hell, the only reason we didn't absorb the entirety of Mexico after the war in 1849 was because people wouldn't be able to tolerate giving ""mixed blood"" Mexicans (their words again) the right to vote.

I realize I'm going beyond your interest in the Founders specifically but their mindset, as far as I've learned, is fairly representative of the country's during the first few decades. The language talked of safeguarding freedom for all, but the worldviews of the time were radically different from now, and it was implied that freedom was only for certain sets of people. They weren't devoid of logic obviously, and knew that specific groups of people couldn't just be arbitrarily targeted for second-citizen status (without broad consensus or precedent, at least, see black people and Indians again), but people often did whatever they could to encourage such conditions when they desired.

But with regards to immigration from those select groups, I assume it was fairly open.

False,1317478258,t5_2qh7l,"I parse your question as follows: why did it take so long for societies with written records, reason and magic mushrooms to intersect?

1. You don't know they didn't.  There were many societies that believed in writing and reason for whom we don't have all of their written records, which is important.  Without written records Europe forgot about the great philosophers and reason, falling into the dark ages.  It wasn't until written records from Ancient Greece were rediscovered that reason took hold and ushered in the Age of Enlightenment.

2. All three may have coincided and been promptly dismissed by an established order.  For example, there are accounts of ""new world"" explorers hearing about these visionary mushrooms in native American societies, but writing off the effects as simple superstitions held by primitive peoples.  It wasn't until some white person finally ate some that the rest of the Western world took notice.

3. More ridiculous things have happened.  Why did it take so fucking long for greater Europe to figure out America existed?  There's evidence Basque and Nordic people knew about the Americas, and periodically visited, hundreds of years prior to Columbus.  It's unfathomable that this idea wouldn't catch on like a bolt of lightning immediately, but maybe nobody was willing to listen until some respectable white guy just like them had the experience.

4. And even if someone discovers something amazing, most of their kind still don't listen. Have you ever tried to explain how fucking awesome the psychedelic experience is to someone who hasn't had one?  They simply don't get it.  They can't get it.  It's futile.  If I could somehow undo my psychedelic experiences but still remember their significance, I would make it #1 priority to get them back.  I think anyone would, and yet it's impossible to communicate the significance.  People who do listen don't have any sense of urgency about the topic because, basically, they think you're full of shit, or deranged. I knew that's how I regarded people who tried to convince me until I finally tried them for myself.  How could I have been so wrong?  It happens.

Everyone told me it was scabies or bed bugs or heat rash or blahblahblah. I painted myself with stupid scabies paint every few weeks, paranoid that I'd missed a spot and they'd returned. I got a new mattress, I barely slept.

Finally I went the leading dermatologist in my city and he told me I had extreme hives resulting from a virus or cold or something that sparked it. I took one antihistamine a day and it never helped for weeks, months, even. I kept taking them. Finally after about 3 months, taking one in the morning would last until the afternoon. Then after a few more weeks I could take one and it would last 24 hours. Months later I took them once every few days, you can see where I'm going with this.

That was 4 years ago and every now and then I get a little white fluid filled pin bump on my hands or thigh and I know to pop an antihistamine and they go away.

Pronunciation:  Brit.	 /dɒg/ , U.S. /dɔg/ , /dɑg/
Forms:  ... (Show More)
Etymology:  Origin unknown.
The word belongs to a set of words of uncertain or phonologically problematic etymology with a stem-final geminated g in Old English which is not due to West Germanic consonant gemination and therefore does not undergo assibilation. These words form both a morphological and a semantic group, as they are usually Old English weak masculine nouns and denote animals; compare frog n.1, hog n.1, pig n.1, stag n.1, Old English sugga (see haysugge n.), Old English wicga (see earwig n.), and perhaps teg n. It has been suggested that these words show expressive gemination, perhaps due to their being originally hypocoristic forms. (For discussion see R. M. Hogg ‘Two Geminate Consonants in Old English’ in J. Anderson Lang. Form &amp; Ling. Variation (1982    ) 187–202.) For some of the words, substratal influence has also been considered (compare pig n.1). Because attestation of these words in Old English is generally rare and confined to glossaries and onomastic evidence (as in the case of dog n.1), if they are attested at all, and also because there is often a better-attested synonym (in this case, hound n.1), it seems likely that the words were stylistically marked in Old English, i.e. considered non-literary or informal.
 
The word is attested twice as a place-name element (in the genitive plural) in a 14th-cent. copy of an Anglo-Saxon charter of 941 granting land at Buckland Newton, Dorset (doggene berwe is probably to be identified with Dogbury Hill, an ancient hill fort):
a1400  (OE)    Bounds (Sawyer 474) in W. de G. Birch Cartularium Saxonicum (1887) II. 500   Endelang stremes on doggene ford þanen up on doggene berwe.
It is also perhaps attested (in the compound doggiþorn ) in a late 12th-cent. copy of another charter purportedly recording a grant of land in Gloucestershire made a959, although it is unclear whether the form here represents this word or its derivative doggy adj.:
c1175  (OE)    Bounds (Sawyer 664) in W. de G. Birch Cartularium Saxonicum (1893) III. 113   Of pislege on doggiþorn, of þam þorne to eadingham.
Compare also the following place names: Dogeflod , Surrey (1257; formerly Dogflood, now lost), Doggeworth , Devon (1281; now Dogsworthy), etc.
 
Also early as an element in bynames and surnames; compare: Syward Dogheafd (a1195), Richard Doggetall' (1201), Robertus Doggefel (1201), Robertus Doggisheued (1204), etc. Compare also Roger le Doge (1296).
 
The word occurs in a number of other European languages, considerably later than in English, and in many cases with the identifying attribute ‘English’. All of these instances probably show borrowing either directly or indirectly &lt; English. Compare Dutch dog (16th cent.; in early modern Dutch also dogge ), German Dogge (16th cent. as dock , docke ; 17th cent. as dogg , dogge ), Swedish dogg (17th cent.), Danish dogge , dog (a1700); French dogue (15th cent. in Middle French denoting a type of hunting dog; 14th cent. as an insult used to a Frenchman by an Englishman), Spanish dogo (1644), Portuguese dogue (1789; 1727 as †dogo ), Italian dogo (19th cent.; a1712 in the diminutive doghetto ). In all of these languages the word is applied more narrowly to particular varieties of dogs, usually mastiffs. This probably reflects the types of dogs which were imported from or associated with Britain, and probably has no bearing on the early meaning of the word in English.
 
The etymology of the English word is unknown. No likely cognates have been identified with a meaning at all close to that of the English word, and all attempted etymological explanations are extremely speculative. A word of this phonological shape is hard to explain as a regular development from a Germanic base, but nonetheless a number of attempts have been made. One attempt sees a connection with the Germanic base of dow v.1, assuming an original meaning such as ‘useful or faithful animal’, but this has not met with general acceptance. In this connection an Old English personal name Dycga is sometimes compared as a possible formal parallel from the same base, but it is quite possible that the personal name has no connection with dog n.1 Another attempted etymology takes the word ultimately from the Indo-European base probably meaning ‘run’ which is probably reflected by Sanskrit dhav- (see prothetely n.), but this poses a number of formal difficulties. Another suggestion is that the word shows a development from an Indo-European base meaning ‘to be or become unconscious’, but this involves a very large number of unattested stages in the semantic development (assuming a development ‘bundle’ &gt; ‘cuddly bundle’ &gt; ‘pet’ &gt; ‘dog’), and also involves a very uncertain original base form.
 
The β. forms (which are first attested in the second half of the 15th cent.) and the ζ. forms (which first appear only in the 19th cent., but are now characteristic of many regional varieties) apparently both show the same tendency to lengthen short ŏ before a velar, but at different times and consequently with different results (compare E. J. Dobson Eng. Pronunc. 1500–1700 (ed. 2, 1968    ) II. §53 note 2). The γ. forms, apparently reflecting a pronunciation with an affricate, are unexplained; it is possible that some of the Middle English spellings could reflect a similar pronunciation. The δ. forms show the development of a diphthong from an original velar glide (see A. J. Aitken &amp; C. Macafee Older Scots Vowels (2002    ) §16.4); Ling. Atlas Scotl. (1986    ) III. 345 records pronunciations reflecting such forms from northern and north-eastern Scotland. The ε. forms (very common in Scots, especially in central Scotland) probably reflect sporadic raising of short ŏ to ŭ before g and (in most cases) subsequent unrounding to /ʌ/ ; the raising probably occurred in late Middle English (compare the 15th-cent. form frugge at frog n.1 and adj.), and is apparently evidenced in both dog and frog in the speech of Isaac Newton (who was born in south Lincolnshire) in the second half of the 17th cent. (see E. J. Dobson Eng. Pronunc. 1500–1700 (ed. 2, 1968    ) I. 249); J. Wright Eng. Dial. Gram. (1905    ) 407 records pronunciations with /ʊ/ (or a sound close to it) from Lancashire and Derbyshire, and with /ʌ/ from Lancashire, Derbyshire, and Devon; Ling. Atlas Eng. (1978    ) (Ph40) records pronunciations with /ʊ/ in two discrete pockets: one in the north-west midlands (including south Lancashire and Cheshire) and the other in the east midlands (centred on east Leicestershire, Rutland, and north Northamptonshire), and pronunciations with /ʌ/ in two further discrete pockets: one centred on Bedfordshire and the other on Devon.

The whole libertarian thing came in because he was basically accusing Washington of bailing out the banks on the taxpayers dime (something that's happening in overdrive now in all these ""social democracies"" in Europe now).

Anyhow the whole thing got hijacked by more conventional Republicans  and any non-totalitarian agenda get's slammed by the media and politicians who are owned by various monopolistic special interest.

And yet the reality in peoples minds is so easy to manipulate that the very people who wanted something done about Wall Street began attacking it, as far as I can tell because it didn't have some sort of socialist agenda embedded in it.

And in the end I think this is the greatest flaw in the whole ""Occupy Wall Street"" thing -- it has the social justice movement embedded in it (probably by design) which really obscures the original issue (corruption on Wall Street) and drives away a lot of potential supporters who have money and influence (and want honest free markets, not socialism).

Ok, I'm speaking about the whole AJ entity. It's Arabic speaking branch uses one set of terms, buzzwords and lingo, while its English channel uses another entirely different one, and yes, i am accounting for the obvious difference in languages. You can't honestly think that Al Jazeera is the one news network without an agenda. Do you? They have an interest in perpetuating an image of Israel popular in the Arab World. That's their bread and butter. 

&gt;The OP is lost in translation.

Can you verify this? Though, even if he is, it doesn't change my point. Al Jazeera double-speaks, saying one set of things in English and then something else in Arabic. It makes sense, they have two different audiences. 

&gt;his is a refusal to submit to your pro-zionist narrative so that you no longer feel you are a victim. Sorry about that.

LOL. I have no interest in portraying Israel as a victim. She's a big girl now. And i am a Zionist, but not every Zionist is a propaganda spewing bot who aims to smear Arabs, their character and their institutions. I just think that that the AJ's have different goals. 

O, btw, when i said Anglo, i mean't Anglophonic, English speaking, not White Americans and Europeans. 

Look, here's two articles that include words from the networks representatives:
http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/02/qa_with_al_jazeera_englishs_ay.html

Here's the important bit from the first one.

&gt;**What’s the difference between Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera Arabic?**
We’re speaking to two very different audiences. Al Jazeera English speaks to the international English-speaking audience. Al Jazeera Arabic speaks to the Arab world. The perspectives are very different because the viewers are very different. Viewers who know Egypt’s history and know a lot of the key players in the region and know the narrative of the event are going to be much more aware of the most nuanced pieces of information. Whereas for English-language viewers who might not know a lot about Egypt’s politics, you have to put it in a proper context with the mindset that you’re speaking to people from India to Indonesia to China to the United States.

&gt;**Do you have separate editorial hierarchies?**
We have two entirely independent editorial staffs. When I report, I report to my bosses and my editors in Doha. There’s a great amount of synergy and cooperation, and we share resources and information, though we don’t take our editorial guidelines from Al Jazeera Arabic and they don’t take theirs from Al Jazeera English. At the end of the day, we don’t share the same editorial policies. What we do share is the editorial code of ethics and the same editorial vision as the network.

Ain't it a little more likely that it was a translation error instead of setting the story in a foreign nation with all of the culture, the names etc. being middle eastern?

The other reason i could see would be that if it were a chinese fable and it spread down to the middle east and they changed the culture parts and names etc. afterwards. However it makes no sense in my eyes that they would have this set in China.

When the story was created the creators would have had no term for china, it probably was 'eastern city', or 'nation far off to the east' or something similar except we tend to like to apply our own knowledge to things.

CCPs, good topic. In my particular environment, the HACCP system we work with is reviewed regularly with various members of the sites teams (a cross functional and multi hierarchical review!).

We put a lot of emphasis on training, and the importance of CCPs and ultimately what that means to the end consumer. With any HACCP based system, there needs to be defined procedures and documentation, part of which ensures that the monitoring of CCPs is done regularly. All personnel are trained and accountable for their own CCPs, and understand the implications if any fail. 

Internal Audits are carried out by myself, my boss (also within the QA team) and trained members of the other departments. :)

EDIT: It's written in EU legislation (not sure about US) that all food manufacturers should adopt a food safety system based on HACCP principles. This is what I'm talking about here. HACCP = Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.

It's essentially a system of highlighting areas of a food manufacturing process that could introduce, or fail to eliminate, a food safety risk, and looks at microbiological, chemical, physical and allergenic risks. A CCP, (critical control point) is a step in the system specifically designed to reduce a risk, i.e. pasteurisation of milk, etc. 

A good system will ensure the appropriate risks have been identified through audits and system reviews, and have formal procedures and monitoring systems in place to ensure that control is not breached. (i.e., lots of paperwork proving that milk is pasteurised properly).

With zero rates for at least 2 more years, deposits are not really doing much for the bank. That is why you keep coming across articles about various banks charging to hold your money (ex: recently Bank of New York Mellon started charging a fee if you have too much money in your account). If fact, if you have been following the banking sector, regulators are asking the banks to take more deposits at a loss, and banks are asking for relief on insurance premiums and leverage ratios in return for holding this unprofitable money. With the Euro crisis, money have moved here to the US and the big banks have been flooded with deposits.

They are fine if you take your money elsewhere to another bank that doesn't want it. When they want more depositors again, they will easy draw people back with some perks (everybody here says they won't ever bank with Bank of America again, but they will come back if there are perks and they realize all other banks suck too).

Holding your money isn't free. There is a cost to it. If the bank can make money by lending it out, they might give you free services for your deposits.

With regards to the latter part, I do think there is a genuine need to limit certain risky activities. Raw milk for example. Across all the dairy farms across Europe, the UK, or just the US, it would be very hard to apply exacting standards to all the farmers. Farm equipment, age of the kit, size of the farm, etc, all play a part in the risk. I feel that it would be unwise to give *the population* the choice of taking that risk because the population, at large (in general, assumption here...) are not informed enough.

Catholicism has lost practically all of its voice, impact or influential powers over the past few years given the amount of shit uncovered regarding sexual abuse etc..The people, even the most religious of so have lost all trust and I think its for the good. 

In terms of LGBT rights etc, Ireland is very much a progressive country. For instance the gay civil partnership bill was passed a few weeks ago, in fact a close friend of mine got married to his BF last week. 

Also, Ireland is very socially and culturally diverse particularly in the larger cities such as Dublin. With the celtic tiger boom in previous years, a lot of Europeans moved here and brought with them some mindsets from their home countries: work ethics and sexual open-mindedness for instance. Ireland had really no choice but to move with the times and as such socially evolved in to a very metropolitan place (again, I'm talking about Dublin here mainly)

I see this all the time as I have friends who claim they were ""poor"" when in reality they had a pretty stable middle class suburban life. The problem is that the US is still the largest economy in the world by far (All the EU as an conglomeration of states is now leading in GDP). However, as the world becomes more global Americans are starting to realize that our government simply doesn't manage the wealth as efficiently, or as generously as other nations do. As someone who grew up between the US and Europe I've seen a lot of these differences first hand.

A few examples:

Americans students are burdened with tremendous debt which is unparalleled with the rest of the world. 

American ""news"" media has lost the fairness doctrine which has allowed for propaganda outlets.

Americans rarely benefit from the sale of natural resources on PUBLIC land. (eg. Americans are sold the idea that opening ANWAR to oil drilling will somehow benefit everyone with more gas, when in reality it will benefit the corporations who take our natural resources and sell them at a profit) You can see how countries like Norway dealt with large oil reserves and distributed them to everyone for further reference.

Obviously healthcare. No other industrialized country (let alone the last superpower) on the planet has such expensive healthcare, and so many uninsured.

Job protection. American jobs are frequently sent overseas with support of both the Republican and Democratic parties. NAFTA, GATT, FTAA, etc. etc. 

Campaign finance. Campaigns are financed as much by individual corporations (hey they're people right?) as much as citizens which creates an environment where politicians are more afraid of corporations than citizens.  


Now I'm not saying everything in Europe is all roses. But hey, at least we call ""campaign contributions"" what they should really be called. Bribes. They are the 1%, and we all know it. The top 1% has much more say in what happens politically than the bottom 99%. Sure we may have opinons, but we don't have money. And money is the grease which oils both political parties int he US.

People have constructed their worldview out of years of experience. Then comes along evidence that their worldview is incorrect.

People do 2 things: Either accept the new evidence and change their worldview, or reject the new evidence and cling to old ways. 

Note that the vast majority of holocaust deniers have a particular agenda: antisemitism. For whatever reason, the holocaust further legitimizes Israel's claims to the Middle East, given the knowledge that the Jews were killed by the millions and had to flee their previous homes in Europe. Where else were the Jews to go? 

Anyways, many antisemites are people who were negatively impacted by the arrival of the Jews to the Middle East. Property was taken. Wars were started. Religiously significant cities were seized. 

Many people have legitimate grievances against Israel, but unfortunately such grievances have turned into hate. And the more you hate a particular group, the less you want to sympathize with their plight. 

And what better way to dehumanize your enemies than to call them complete liars, who lie about the deaths of their family and friends, and who have lied to get the UN to give them a state in the Middle East?

To lie about the holocaust, it requires a vast conspiracy with the participation of the majority of all Jews in the world, as well as co-conspirators of the Western powers (and Russia) that found the death camps - involving millions of Russian and Western soldiers.

A huge portion of our military budget goes to personnel, legacy costs (health care, pensions) and field support. Only 1 out of 5 soldiers is actually in a combat role, remember.

But you can't think of the defense budget on a year-to-year basis. You have to think of it in terms of the next decade or two. We toppled the Taliban in next to no time at all and were occupying the country the next week because we have an enormous fleet of airplanes, naval groups, munitions, supply lines, logistics, command and control systems and, of course, personnel deployed around the world. No other country even comes close to matching our strategic depth or tactical reach. The Navy's 5th Fleet alone keeps global shipping prices low by ensuring that there's little to no piracy in the Malacca Strait, and that piracy off the Horn of Africa is manageable. NATO, and thus most of Europe's defensive posture, relies wholly on the U.S. Our nuclear umbrella extends to our allies in Asia too, and keeps would-be nuclear rivals in check.

It's easy to support cutting defense, and actually I totally agree with other folks here who say it should be reduced, as there is huge amounts of waste and redundancy in it. We still have a largely Cold War-era military. But if a resurgent Russia wanted to invade, say, the Ukraine, or China wanted to make a move on Taiwan or Japan, or the Taliban managed to get a hold of political power in Pakistan (let alone their nuclear sites), who do you think the world would turn to?

Now, governments do this as well, and their intent varies wildly -- the North Korean government has slightly different goals than the Danish one, but the main difference is that everyone has the power to vote out those who abuse their power.  You can vote for companies as well, but knowing who to vote for and even who (or what) you're voting for requires a huge amount of work.

The goal of messaging is To Make The Crowd Bigger.  That means appealing directly to those who have lost a) their jobs  b) their homes  c) their standards of living.

OWS is standing in front of Wall Street, not Washington.  Focus on the economic and political power of banks so as to show that the pain the victims feel is due exclusuvely to the private interests that have manipulted the society, the tax code, the law and the economy to this point.  

Talk about ANYTHING else and you are getting in the way of goal #1: which is to Make The Crowd Bigger.

Then there's the problem that what you say is not only irrelevant to the goal, it's far from clearly the right thing to call for.  Reason: no modern economy can go without a central bank.  You may have noticed that every other western democracy and a good deal of other large economies have a central bank.   But unlike the US central bank, a good number of European central banks are nationalized.  As such, that's why I call for the de-privatization of the US central bank instead of its abolishment, because an abolishment is completely unprecedented *as well as having zero apparent connection to the pain people feel right now*.

The problem is that no companies want to open businesses in the bad neighborhoods, so the poorer class has no chance to rise above it. Because they're poor they end up falling into drug dealing and gangs, which in turn makes it even less likely for businesses to move in. Our taxes pay for their welfare and unemployment, which then allows them to continue in their lives despite not working, and it all sort of snowballs from there.

But it hasn't been that long since MLK and black rights, only one generation really, so things are still starting their progression. It's a pretty cool situation from a sociology viewpoint but really shitty to be around personally. It sucks for them and the handouts they're getting from the higher income people (AKA white people for the most part) only makes it worse. In order to truly rise above, their has to be a cultural shift on both ends. A (black) politician once said ""the most dangerous weapon in America is a nigger with a library card"", which is totally true. I have no doubt that us whites are gonna get what's coming to us in the upcoming fifty or hundred years.

ninja edit - the true rising power in America, due to population and *really hard work*, is the Hispanics. They come here and work their asses off to afford to live in decent neighborhoods. They create jobs for themselves (scrapping metal, mowing lawns, opening restaurants) and are slowly increasing their income, more are beginning to afford college educations, and because their population is rising so swiftly, their voting base is also rising as the newborn generation has instant citizenship and voting rights. I really think they're going to be a major force in America soon, and they're not looking for handouts from the government. There's a lot of racist pressure to keep them down in the lower classes, but there's really nothing anyone can do about that. It's what makes America great--you can overcome anything if you work hard.

It's gonna be interesting to see what happens with that.


Anyway, that picture is gorgeous. One of the perks of Chicago is the architecture. After going to Europe and seeing the cities there, then coming back to Chicago it was like seeing it for the first time. If you take the L (like a metro/subway except above ground) you'll be weaving between huge buildings, surrounded on all sides by just these towering skyscrapers. It's so incredibly different from anywhere else I've ever been that it's breathtaking once you really realize that.

I really hope to see the East someday, maybe teaching English there if I get the chance. One of my friends just got back from a month touring SE Asia like Laos, Viet Nam, Cambodia (which I really want to see) and a few other places. She said it was amazing.

6. Georgetown is simply one of MANY pockets of places that can indulge your sweet tooth and brain. You've seen some of our favorite shops on tv, and many more are still to be discovered if this is your first time visiting.

7. We're not NY, LA, Chicago, Boston, or San Diego. And we like it that way. In many respects we're all those places. Many of us started somewhere else and naturally gravitated here. See #3.

Players like Axslav, iNcontroL, SjoW and Goody are undeniably good but apart from SjoW (whose TvT has been described as Code S level by a Korean player. I believe it may have been Bomber), I wouldn't really consider the three world class.

iNcontroL did very disappointingly in recently MLGs, Axslav is playing Protoss, a race that relies a lot on balling units together and a moving them and occasional forcefield or storm spam, or blink micro so low APM suits his race.

GoOdY plays a very unique style of Terran, namely almost pure mech where he just builds up huge hellion, tank and thor armies and does a really slow push of pure fucking doom towards his opponent, and out of all the foreign Terrans, he seems to be the only one who is brilliant at his style.

SjoW is an exception. He is one of those low APM players whose APM can rise in a serious situation, and he has a very smart strategic mind.

&gt; But in EU or NA? It's more about effective APM and skill rather than raw speed.

More and more major tournaments are opening their doors to Korean players. Look at the NASL, IPL, MLG etc, the NASL's Main Bracket got ROFLstomped by nearly all Koreans apart from Darkforce and Sen who made it a bit further.

And look at MLG, in Columbus, the top 3 finishers were all Korean, in Anaheim and Raleigh, the top 6 were Korean, and you need to be top 8 from what I can recall to recieve any prize money.

As for the IPL, I believe only 2 foreigners have actually qualified for the IPL3. The other 6 who made it through were *Koreans.*

Rap, club rap mostly, gained a lot of traction in my state (Georgia) over the past 10-15 years. Even for people who don't love/like the genre, club rap is part of the shared cultural consciousness, they're the bulk of Top 40. You can usually quote a lyric and get a response. It's usually treated in a humorous manner.

Kids brag about drinking, whether they actually do or not. It's illegal to drink under 21, but popular. They have split opinions over weed, depending on whether they want to be seen as good kids or not. They obsess over sex. Older youth worry about their future and what their ""dream career"" is, because it's assumed that by the time you graduate high school you need to have it all figured out. Middle youth want to get their driver's license so they can be independent. This may be the same in Europe, too, I don't know. Kids usually don't pay for their first car. It's typically a hand-me-down vehicle as their parents buy their own new cars. Wealthier parents may buy their children a new car when the kid is 16 or 17.

Trashy US tv is mostly watched ironically by youth. I don't know if that's better or not. I'm also not sure just how ironic it is, but they're aware of what they're watching. It's popular because it's funny, for various reasons.

Most of the kids I know go to church cause their parents make them- when they're younger, that is. When they can drive, they usually stop going.

I don't think you understand what socialism means, if you mean socialist democracy, then yeah, you are wrong and need to turn off whatever talking head pundit that has you so grossly misinformed. 

Let us compare a socialist democracy to the USA shall we.

Norway has a higher GDP per capita than the USA by about $10K last year, according to the [OECD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita). It also has the highest standard of living [in the world.](http://www.marketingcharts.com/topics/europe/un-norway-has-best-standard-of-living-niger-worst-10652/) The US is in 13th position.

The [$685 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States)
 that the USA sunk into its military last year, which it could not afford to spend, was on wars that don't keep the US safe, it makes you a target. You are not under attack and spending this kind of money on ""defence"" is just a waste since you should have learned from Iraq first time round and Vietnam before again, that invading countries isn't to keep America safe, its to insure oil and influence. Anyone who told you otherwise needs to stop shovelling that shit down your throat.

Lastly, if we're such morons - Why is the US (this includes all your Presidents, Repub. or Demo., since WW2) spending this massive amount needlessly, on us, while we spend our tax revenues on free or subsidised education, health care and social welfare programmes? Could it be that no one is realistically going to attack us and we don't need to build a large army? That's what the smart money is on. 

By the way, the sub prime mortgage vehicles which has Europe in so much debt currently were created by the US financial sector. Just so you know.

False,1317496052,t5_2qqjc,"&gt;Evolution is the incredibly simple idea that small mutations gradually build up over time through the process of natural selection.

Wrong, you are talking about neodarwinism, which is one theory of evolution (there are others, such as lamarckism, etc.)

And in neodarwinism, you have two theories, gradualists such as Dawkins (regular small increment of genetic mutations) and saltationists such as Jay Gould (massive mutations in rapid succession - hence below paleological time - followed by long period of stability).

It's tiring to see that on Reddit people equate Dawkins with evolution while Dawkins is the proponent of one version of one theory of evolution.

And respecting people because of their acceptance of scientific theories is silly. It only makes sense to Americans because there evolution is a politically loaded item which pits political opponents. In Europe, it's like saying you don't trust people who don't believe in the superstring theory. WTF?

False,1317496851,t5_2s7cl,"Hey, we are both due around xmas :)

I'll answer these questions with my firstborn in mind. We didn't cloth diaper and don't plan on starting now, so this might change some things.

1) One backpack was everytime packed with a couple of diapers, some wet wipes, some tissues, one set of clothing changes (he didn't spit often, if he did, we would've upped this), some cloth wipes, a second pacifier (the first one being on a cord on his clothing which he wore). Maybe we packed more (hell, less than two years ago, and I don't remember everything...). We discontinued the set of clothes really early (I think when realising he outgrew the 1-3month clothing therein) due to more space for other stuff (variable, a towel for swimming/baby massage, or a college block or just about anything) and switched sometimes to me carrying 1-3 diapers and some tissues (and some small toys) in every of my handbags (I still do this, and I don't see me stopping to pack extra tissues for the next 10 years or so). So a backpack is fine too, but it's highly recommended to have the essential baby-items pre-packed at every time. It's easiest with a separate backpack just for baby ;)

2) We used a bassinet. We let him sleep at night in our bed (and plan on doing this with #2 also, but daytime napping was in a bassinet, so it was easier to bring him with us despite him sleeping. I don't think a bassinet is necesary tough. Maybe some means to make his crip smaller (our big boy uses most nights maximal 1/2 of his toddler-bed (which has the same dimensions as the crip), so a newborn is widely lost in one) are ok (look into suffocation risk!). We got our bassinet second-hand for less than 50€. These are so small that only young babies fit in it and therefore only gently used.

3) Look statistics up, look if it is possible to carry it with baby sleeping in it (hell, I hated that, baby carrying within ones body or with a sling or pure hands is so much easier). Only essential advice: try fitting the carseat in your car before you hit 35 weeks or so. We stood in cold november outside the hospital and didn't know how to secure the car seat - newborn beside us... Also check how to adjust the straps!

4) We used nothing special. I nursed lying down at night, sitting on the couch or at dinner table at day. It's important that you find 2-4 positions comfortable for you to nurse. Baby will adjust itself to a creaky glider chair or barking dog or any normal noise in your house (at least I hope it, since I can't tell my older child to not throw any tantrum while baby is asleep)

5) Nothing, we didn't buy many expensive things... so either we used it or didn't think much about wasted money

5) what hand-me-downs we didn't use: bibs... instead we (still, when the food is somewhat messy) use a large cloth wipe (80x80cm I think) for feeding/eating (got tons of these as hand-me-downs also). YMMV, especially if your baby is a spitter

6) Not bought - gotten gifted: a snow overall in size 68 (for babys 68cm from head to toes, european sizing) for babys first winter (will reuse from birth to spring again): just let baby in his indoor-clothing and put on the snow overall and we are good to go. At first his feet are in the butt area of the overall, but baby don't can move coordinated, so it doesn't bother him.

6) bought: the avent hand milk pump. Unfortunately my son didn't like breastmilk in any other form than directly from the source (so had a couple of bottles of formula in daycare), but I liked it for the few times I used it. The 'bottles' coming with it were very good for cooking his puree and each one used countless times

6) most expensive think we bought: a sling (didymos baby carrier), very useful for going with baby to events, less useful for going shopping (then the space in the stroller is better there). In combination with a cheap (50€ new) pregnancy winter mantel (I almost regretted buing it a good month before my due date due to not seeing it used much) it was invaluable: baby in indoor-clothes, baby in sling, winter mantel around us, cap on babys and my head, good to go (not when asking my mother, but baby didn't take damage from this care)

Other suggestion: don't use trousers as long as possible. Use feeted trousers (don't know how they are named in english). Babys learn to undress socks really quickly and do this all the time, so you want to avoid the possibility of them getting cold feet by not using socks ;)",True,t1_c2o2pga,,1427672834,Mom [preschooler &amp; toddler],0,2,,BabyBumps,t3_kxjov,False,t3_kxjov,c2o2pga,2,starly,0,0

It's interesting how you use two ages *very close* to each other to support using the same word to describe being attracted to people with ages *very different* from each other.

Most of these girls *are* knowledgable in sexuality, *are* old enough to legally give consent in the majority of the world, including the vast majority of countries in europe as well as most states in the US, and *are* 16 or older.  These do not seem to be 14 or 12 year old girls.  Again, this is not me defending /r/jailbait, but rather me pointing out your change of direction; talking about the difference between a pre-teen and a barely-teen instead of talking about the difference between sexual attraction for  an 8 year old and for a 16 year old.

They're both vulnerable, as far as I'm concerned.  Every young adult trying to figure out her sexuality is vulnerable, and is harmed by those that post pictures for others to masturbate to without her permission.  Hell, even if she's 45 she's still vulnerable (but less so, since that is a lot less likely to severely stunt her social life and she is likely much more emotionally mature to handle it).

But that doesn't make a 16 year old an 8 year old.  And that, therefore, doesn't make an ephebophile a pedophile.

&gt;The whole ""I'm an ephebophile, not a pedophile"" thing is not an excuse that actually diminishes the severity of what these people are doing at all

But have you considered the severity of latching onto such an emotionally loaded word to describe someone by something they're not?  We latch on the word pedophile to describe those who like 16 year olds in much the same way many feminists use the word ""racist"" to describe those who disagree with affirmative action (something, by the way, I agree with).  It's an act of hurting, of offense, of gnarling your teeth instead of calmly elucidating.  It's to better bulster your own beliefs and the beliefs of your brothers and sisters while continuing to give reason for those that disagree with you to feel alienated, dehumanized, angry, and even *more*   defensive and supportive of their morality.

The only reason why ephebophilia doesn't have the same stigmatization is because so few people even know what it means, because of the insistence on ""pedophile"".",True,t1_c2o3do8,,1427673150,,0,-5,,ShitRedditSays,t1_c2o302d,False,t3_kxkip,c2o3do8,-5,sje46,0,0

Your entire argument is predicated on the fact that socially invented words and laws have implicit value. That ""ephebophile"" is something automatically better than ""pedophile"" because it's an older age group. I'm trying to point out that what these people refer to themselves as *doesn't matter*, what matters is r/jailbait's practice of exploiting pictures of vulnerable people without their knowledge or consent.

So all your arguments--that ephebophiles, hebephiles (jesus christ), pedophiles are *intrinsically different* because we say they are--is fundamentally flawed. The act of exploiting young girls or boys is wrong no matter what group society sorts them into.

And now we get to the main point which is that I pretty much fundamentally disagree with this:

&gt;Most of these girls are knowledgable in sexuality, are old enough to legally give consent in the majority of the world, including the vast majority of countries in europe as well as most states in the US, and are 16 or older.

How the fuck do you know that?

I realize society is imperfect, and society would probably fall apart if we actually had to judge individuals based on their own merits and potentials and capacity for responsibility. Things simply aren't that nuanced. So we make arbitrary deadlines, we write arbitrary laws based on our best judgments, and we do the best we can without upsetting the natural order of things *too much*.

I'm basically saying I think the ""well the age of consent is 16 so it's not bad because it's legal"" defense is absolute bullshit. You have no idea what the context of all of these pictures is, that these girls ARE posting them with full knowledge of the consequences and impact of their sexuality, that they're even sexual in nature at all. Just because something is LEGAL doesn't mean it's still not DISGUSTING. I could probably write a huge rant about how 18 is considered the ""legal age"" not because it's when most people are actually mentally, emotionally, and physically mature enough to handle being an adult, but because of social and cultural factors that are implicit in society, and maybe just because old-white-man dominated society can't bear the thought of not being able to enjoy barely legal porn. WHO KNOWS.

If you really believe that the social and cultural mores are based on what is BEST for everyone, then you're being pretty naive. You can't use what society has deemed most acceptable as a defense that it's intrinsically right or beneficial. It's a faulty premise in itself.

So yeah, I'm still free to be grossed out when old men fap to pictures of 18-year old girls, and I'm free to be really grossed out when old men fap to pictures of under-18 year old girls who don't even know that they're being consumed and objectified in this way.

An important thing to remember when studying prophecy is the day-year principle. Moses and the children of Israel were in the desert for forty years. 

&gt;Numbers 14:34  After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, **each day for a year**, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. 

&gt;Ezekiel 4:6  And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: **I have appointed thee each day for a year.** 

One prophetic day means one literal year. This time prophecy is one of the most important prophecies God has given to us to understand. It was so important that He did not tell us just once, 

&gt;Daniel 12:7  And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a **time, times, and an half**; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. 

(Hebrew H4150 conventional 'time' = a Jewish 360 day year. Some translations simply put 3 and a half years.) (360 +720 +180 = 1,260 years)

&gt;Daniel 7:25  And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until **a time and times and the dividing of time.** (360 + 720 + 180 = 1,260 years)

&gt;Revelation 11:2  But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot **forty and two months.** (42 months x 30 days = 1,260 years)

&gt;Revelation 11:3  And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy **a thousand two hundred and threescore days**, clothed in sackcloth. (1,260 years)

&gt;Revelation 12:14  And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for **a time, and times, and half a time**, from the face of the serpent. (360 + 720 + 180 = 1,260 years)

&gt;Revelation 12:6  And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there **a thousand two hundred and threescore days**. (1,260 years) 

&gt;Revelation 13:5  And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue **forty and two months**. (1,260 years)

Also, the fact that the original assertion is true is also irrelevant.  The same selection bias would be true in Europe as well.  The study essentially polls the more elderly and hence generally conservative portion of both populations, and even in that case more people within that classification believe in evolution in Europe than here, at least according to this study.  

Which may or may not be correct, but the fact that this selection bias exists does not in itself invalidate the study as long as they used the same methods in both populations.  

Now if they did phone surveys in America, and then surveyed young people on college campuses in Europe, the selection bias would certainly invalidate the study right off the bat.

*If* you can, it's groovy to pull into the lane to your right sometimes if there are a lot of people trying to join on a sliproad. But check your mirrors and blind spot first, and don't do this if it will cause problems for everyone behind you.

When overtaken by HGV's or anything with a trailer, it's nice to flash your lights to let 'em know they can pull back in front of you. But *don't* do this until the back end of their trailer is safely in front of you. The idea is not (just) to be friendly, but to give them practical help regarding the length of their trailer and where it is in relation to your car.

Doubt you'll be in a hurry to do this - but if you drive in Europe, some of the conventions are not the same. E.g. throughout the UK, flashing the headlights means ""I'm giving way to you, go ahead"", whereas in Italy it means ""Fuck you arsehole, I'm coming through!"" Figuring out that one was exciting...

Oh yeah: (on single-carriageway roads) if someone behind you is indicating to overtake, *for the love of god* don't slam on the brakes in an attempt to be helpful.

Obviously people are prone to picking and choosing which evidence supports their cases and sticking to it whether or not it's reliable.

Obviously there's a spectrum of denial. On one hand, some people believe the entire thing was a hoax, generated by forged evidence and a Jewish conspiracy to advance themselves in the world, get billions in reparations, and score Israel by gaining the world's sympathy. Others would argue that while many people were certainly systematically executed by the Nazis, in the post-war horror, shock, frenzy, and rage, it's entirely likely that reports and estimates of casualties were exaggerated and the Jews exploited that for their own gain. Others would question and criticize why the discussion of the holocaust is monopolized by Jewish suffering, while we hear little of the same treatment for Romanies, leftists, the disabled, gay people, and the mentally ill, and those people are quick to be labeled holocaust deniers and the like.

In 1863, when Lincoln needed just a bit more money to win the war, and seeing him in this vulnerable state, and knowing that the president could not get the congressional authority to issue more greenbacks, the money changers proposed the passing of the National Bank Act. The act went through. From this point on the entire US money supply would be created out of debt by bankers buying US government bonds and issuing them from reserves for bank notes. 

Right after the Civil War there was considerable talk about reviving Lincoln's brief experiment with the Constitutional monetary system.  Even after his death, the idea that America might print its own debt free money set off warning bells throughout the entire European banking community.  Consequently, on April 12th in 1866, the American congress passed the Contraction Act, allowing the treasury to call in and retire some of Lincoln's greenbacks.  At the same time, to give the American public the false impression that they would be better off under the gold standard, bankers used the control they had to cause economic instability and panic the people.  They then spread the word through the media they largely controlled that the lack of a single gold standard was the cause of the hardship which ensued, while all this time using the Contraction Act to lower the amount of money in circulation.  It went from $1.8 billion in circulation in 1866 allowing $50.46 per person, to $0.4 billion only twenty years later leaving only $6.67 per person.  To make things worse, in 1872 the Bank of England sent Ernest Seyd, with lots of money to bribe the American congress into demonetizing silver.  Ernest drafted the legislation himself, which came into law with the passing of the Coinage Act, effectively stopping the minting of silver that year.  Within three years, with 30% of the work force unemployed, the American people began to harken back to the days of silver backed money and the greenbacks.  In 1877 riots broke out all over the country. The bank's response was to do nothing except to campaign against the idea that greenbacks should be reissued.  

William Jennings Bryan was the Democratic candidate for president in 1896.  “What we need is an Andrew Jackson to stand, as Jackson stood, against the encroachments of organized wealth.” … “We say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin and issue money is a function of government.  We believe it.  We believe that it is a part of sovereignty, and can no more with safety be delegated to private individuals than we could afford to delegate to private individuals the power to make penal statutes or levy taxes.” … “Those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank, and that the Government ought to go out of the banking business.  I stand with Jefferson rather than with them, and tell them, as he did, that the issue of money is a function of government, and that the banks ought to go out of the governing business.” - William Jennings Bryan 1896 

After bank engineered crash of 1907, the Federal Reserve Act was passed.

¶ Impose a financial transactions tax. This would be a modest tax on financial trades, modeled on the suggestions of James Tobin, an American economist who won a Nobel Prize. The aim is in part to dampen speculative trading that creates dangerous volatility. Europe is moving toward a financial transactions tax, but the Obama administration is resisting — a reflection of its deference to Wall Street.

¶ Close the “carried interest” and “founders’ stock” loopholes, which may be the most unconscionable tax breaks in America. They allow our wealthiest citizens to pay very low tax rates by pretending that their labor compensation is a capital gain.

¶ Protect big banks from themselves. This means moving ahead with Basel III capital requirements and adopting the Volcker Rule to limit banks’ ability to engage in risky and speculative investments. Another sensible proposal, embraced by President Obama and a number of international experts, is the bank tax.

It's correct to say both ways, but when you change the way you are pronouncing it, certain rules apply, ie: When you are putting it as a question, the prefix always comes first: Eu te amo?
When it's an exclamation: Eu amo-te!
I don't know if it's going to help much, like I said, the rules may or may not apply depending on the subject, on the situation you are using it.
The common way to say it is indeed Eu amo-te.

Posso te fazer uma pergunta?
Sera que pode me ajudar?

We need to construct our worldview using a process of reasoning.

Germany decided it was going to be radically different and started dressing in more red and black. It's standing in the bar with Italy, watching two Spanish twins fight each other in a drunken rage. Germany is cheering on the younger twin, while Russia is cheering on the older, a little down the bar.

The younger Spanish twin knocks out the older, and Russia carries him outside. On the other side of the bar, Japan is punching China for things unrelated to the first bar fight. Germany and Italy go over to pat Japan on the back for taking over China's entire table, before returning to Europe.

Meanwhile, Germany and Italy are having a few good pints together. Germany reaches over and drinks Austria's pint, say that it was his to begin with. A few other countries look up at this but just go back to what they're doing.

It's not long before Germany reaches over and drinks the top off of Czechoslovakia's pint, while France and Britain look up at him and shake their heads. They don't get up, however, when Germany pretty much drinks Czechoslovakia's pint and tells him that he's paying for Germany's bar tab.

Russia gets up and taps Germany's shoulder, and they go into the back room and talk, saying they won't hit each other after the first bar fight. They walk back out and Germany raises his fist at Poland, the new guy chilling at the bar, a few times. The rest of the countries look, saying that he shouldn't do it.

Eventually, Germany punches Poland, and knocks him flat on the ground.

It was after this that France and Britain stood up and said they were going to punch Germany soon. They told the bar to stop giving Germany beer, and the bar agreed. 

While Poland is trying to push itself up from Germany's foot, Russia strolls by and kicks in the face quietly, like it never happened. It did, however, manage to knock Germany's foot back a little, so now Russia and Germany have their feet on Poland.

Germany, pretty drunk already, punches Denmark and Norway, knocking them both out. Germany worked out over the past year.

Germany, with the help of Italy and all the other places he'd punched, launches across a table at France, Belgium and The Netherlands, knocking over all their pints and violently beating their face in. France put up the most resistance, but they just didn't have the strength.

While sitting on France, Germany started throwing ice from everyones mixed drinks at Britain, seeing what he would do. Britain wasn't doing too much other than throwing some ice back from across a short gap in a booth.

Across the bar, the United States is giving China some help as Japan sits at their table, drinking all their sake. He's also shelling out cash to Britain so that Britain can buy more drinks and throw the ice at Germany, trying to keep his head cool.

While Russia was stealing the wallets of the smaller guys on the other side of the bar, Germany had other guys sit on France and walked up behind Africa, kicking him in the kneecaps. Germany then proceeded to stand on Africa's back, parading around his pint and cheering.

Britain, deciding enough was enough, walked over to Germany and stood on top of Africa, beginning to punch one another. Britain wasn't exhausted from fighting and took a good swing, punching Germany off of Africa, and Germany stumbling drunk, walked over to the other side of the bar as his friends sat on top of France and the rest of mainland Europe.

Swilling his pint and stumbling, Germany pushed Russia over, who had grown a lot larger than the last time they had seen each other. Russia turned around, cracking his knuckles to find Germany. Germany drunkenly declared that it was going to knock Russia over, and they began to swing wildly at each other, none of them getting an advantage over one another.

Unfortunately, Russia wasn't really stretched for the fight and Germany got Russia on his knees and stood on his shoulders, waving his empty pint glass around. In the corner of the bar, Japan was punching China in the face as China just kind of laid there, taking it.

As Germany was cheering, Japan looked for something more lively to punch. It got up and walked up to America, remembering that it had given China money, and there were no more tables to take over in the back corner. It crept up on America and stabbed a knife into its shoulder, but the US was crafty and turned around, hitting Japan with a barstool.

Germany grabbed Russia and dragged him into the back room, where it was cold and where Russia liked to think. It started beating Russia, but the country just held up some tables and took it, feeling pretty hungry and thirsty. Unfortunately, the cold of the back room was not like the cold of the bar, and Germany got the sniffles and a cold, unable to focus on fighting.

Germany was getting kind of tired from the fight, and Russia stood up and rammed the table into Germany, throwing him through a wall and back into the bar. Italy decided it wasn't on the right side this time, and made friends with America, who was beginning to punch friends of Germany and Japan at the same time with two hands.

America, keeping Japan at bay, launches over the table and knocks off the German friends who were sitting on France in a huge effort, and began to punch them in the face while Britain held them down. After beating up his thin friends, America turned to Germany, who was laying across the bar and in kind of bad shape, while Russia climbs out of the hole in the wall.

America, England, France and Russia all grab different limbs of Germany and start punching its face in. Russia grabbed the top half because he got there early, while the rest got the legs. Eventually, Germany cried Uncle and quit.

The countries all then proceeded to stand on Germany and look Russia in the face. Japan was still throwing its fists at America, who simply just pulled out a pistol and shot Japan twice in the chest. Japan collapsed, and the four countries looked from the Allies to the Soviet Union.

The business plan is basically: stir up some hornets nest, get page views, and accompanying ad impressions, and get paid.  Bonus: the drama probably created all sorts of incoming links and helps your google rank.  

It basically amounts to monetizing trolling.  Soon we'll have an entire trolling industry!  Declining media empires bet everything on these trolling ""innovations,"" in a desperate bid to stay relevant!  College interns gain ""valuable"" (unpaid) ""work experience"" by writing up troll posts in Big Troll's dim cubicles, while the monies and lulz are concentrated in the hands of an ever-smaller few!  Speculative money flows in from wall street bankers, who are thrilled to finally find a growth industry!  Econo-bronies warn that there is a long-term structural imbalance, and that both the trolling/tolerance and the rage/love ratios are at completely unsustainable levels!  The entire world speeds headfirst into another great derp-pression, as trolling-backed securities collapse, and corporate butthurt insurance rates skyrocket in anticipation of the inevitable shitstorm!  US, China, and Europe trade mutual accusations over who is responsible and who is the maddest bro, and soon tensions escalate into all out war!  

And then the truly unthinkable happens: government researchers succeed in building the DramaBomb!  A weapon that induces such rage that it can devistate an entire city.  Those ""lucky ones"" in the immediate-kill-radius will have massive brain aneurysms and die quickly.  Those in the intermediate range will lose all capability for higher-order thought, and they will rage at everything in sight, often killing friends and family before meeting their own violent ends.  Those in the longer ranges will be stunned by the massive amounts of drama, and will be often be reduced to Bawwing and/or QQing for days or weeks.  The entire world as we know it is completely destroyed.  Somewhere, there are rumors of survivors: perhaps the Amish were spared?  Or perhaps some isolated Amazon tribes, untouched by the millenia, will continue in their traditional ways?  But in the end, the residual meta-drama will change climate patterns, threaten crops, and result in waves of previously-unknown diseases even among these isolated survivors.

For example, they imagine that the government is this stalwart watchman of their safety, when that's exactly the opposite of the truth.  People are out for their own self-interest, and this includes politicians and bureaucrats, therefore, they can be bought and sold just as easily as any CEO or industrialist.

When you think about it -- really think about it, with an open mind -- the CEO and industrialist have more of an impetus to protect the customer than the bureaucrat and the politician.  If the CEO or industrialist fucks their customer over, their customers forsake them and they lose money.  When the bureaucrat or politician fucks their customer over, they're protected.  The bureaucrat has government unions to shield him, and the politician has the benefit of incumbency, the diffusion of the political process (many politicians vote on each measure, so the accountability upon each of them is diffused), and the finger-pointing endemic to the political process.

Kraft would lose a lot more if tomorrow it came out that there was rat poison in Cheez Whiz than the FDA would lose for allowing that Cheez Whiz to get on the market.

Therefore, Kraft has a greater incentive to keep the rat poison out of the Cheez Whiz, which makes the FDA redundant at best, obstructionist at worst.

As for the dreaded employer/employee relationship, employees can always go somewhere else.  There's varying quality among employees, and therefore good employees will be treated well or they'll simply go somewhere else.  In a world without arbitrary employee protections -- which shield people from what the reality of what the labour market is, a market wherein people sell labour instead of some other product -- employers will be able to grab up skilled employees, and will not be reluctant to hire people because there won't be massive costs associated with it, and there won't be potential fall out when and if they decide to stop buying that person's labour.

Consider how much fear wrongful dismissal suits can induce in an employer even absent a union.  If you stop shopping at a supermarket -- i.e. stop buying the food the grocer is providing -- the grocer can't sue you, people would dismiss that idea as ridiculous, and yet when your employer stops employing you -- i.e. stops buying the labour you're providing -- people are up in arms.  Wrongful dismissal suits can actually serve to deincentivize the hiring and use of labour, since if you hire an employee who seems good, and yet isn't everything you'd hoped for, getting rid of him can be difficult, since you may incur legal costs in doing so -- it adds to the cost of buying labour without passing those costs through to the person supplying the labour.

The issue with Somalia is not the ""freedom"" or lack thereof there, it's the fact that it's in Africa.  The whole continent has been ravaged by centuries of tribalism and colonialism.  Consider how long it took Europe to go from tribalism etc. to an advanced civilization, and they were jump started by the Romans.

The so-called ""wishful thinking"" about medicine and the medicine market isn't wishful thinking if you look at market forces objectively.  Look at the electronics and computer market.  Great deal of freedom there, quality goes up constantly, prices plummet, accessibility goes up.  In the 1980s computers were very inaccessible, 30 years later they're a standard household item, and not only that but most households have **multiple** computers.  That's what a free market does.  How does medical accessibility size up to that?

Some would argue that accessibility to medicine has actually gone **down** in the past ~50 years, because costs have been rising.

One is a market where the government intervenes, regulates, et cetera vigorously, one is a market the government is largely uninvolved in.  One is cheap and of high quality, accessible to everyone, the other is an unmitigated disaster.

The most shit i got for my race on my travels was in the Southern European countries such as in Spain and Italy - when in groups they will go right up to your face and try to provoke you with ""ching chongs"", my then gf was harassed by catcalls and the like in Barcelona which was unpleasant.

Northern Europe such as Germany, the low countries, austria, hungary, switzerland and the like are very pleasant. Indeed, on the trains in germany and austria random strangers kept striking up conversations with me.

In Madrid and Paris, gypsies and other groups will target orientals as they are seen as easy targets. Especially on the buses and metros.

You won't get much trouble in England save for deprived areas of cities and towns, you'll get the usual drunken abuse but that's a given anywhere. There used to be a large problem with racism but that died down in the mid 90's a lot.

In parts of Asia which has beef with China (almost all her neighbours) you surprisingly won't actually get much trouble at all save the usual touts and con artists trying to rip you off when they realise you're from a rich western country. 

There are large Chinese populations all over SE Asia.

Staying on Asia, people will randomly come up to you and talk to you in the native language til you open your mouth. Learning a few phrases goes a long way to making friends. The majority of people are very friendly.

It's that way because the standards before uni are so low.  The test, by the way, was not to weed out the people who had problems, but to offer them extra classes to get up to speed which of course, is not free.

As I've already said, I have actually defended our system, which would seem to prove that I'm not ""extremely biased"". The fact is that you do not live outside the US and you're influenced by the few people that you've met. I've lived in Europe for 12 years; really, they aren't that impressed with our system. The way I see it we have some really amazing schools producing professionals and academics of the highest standards. We also have a LOT of sub-par schools that charge to much for what they're offering.

The EU countries, on the other hand, seem to be pretty good, without a  huge difference in quality between the very best and the very worst. And it's free or close to it in most cases.  You have a lot of foreign people coming to the US, true. Having taught the language in some huge multinational companies, I think it's fair to say that most of those people are probably studying business or something related. Having international experience and a good knowledge of the English language is a HUGE advantage for them. Plus, it's culturally somewhat normal to travel for an education simply for the learning experience this would entail.

Believing that a US degree is accepted anywhere would be a mistake. I have an American co-worker for example that has a Masters in Sociology or something like that. She earns less that my German co-worker with a 3 year education as a kindergarten teacher simply because Germany demands that to work with children, one must have this certificate. 

&gt;I actually have friends who are professors in Germany, Italy, and Spain. They constantly talk about how the U.S. higher education model is the standard to live up to.

You've got to realize that individuals will not accept making less money if the can legally avoid it. Same behavior as a corporation's board.

Absolutely, but if we, as a voting populace, find that we *want* to tax a group of individuals, but we don't because we *can't* do it without them responding in some kind of frightening way, it's time to ask ourselves when our democratic law-making system ended up in a hostage situation with the upper class holding the cards. If the *only* reason we're not taxing the rich is because they've got us outmaneuvered, it should be regarded as a problem that needs addressing.

&gt;What kind of system are you advocating? That's not exactly what I see happening with the income tax. I also believe that money is best spent in the private economy due to the wasteful inefficiencies in our government, and because gov. spending isn't real growth.

Ah, damn dude, I was only shooting to shed a bit of light on what I saw as a potentially falacious argument, I'm probably not really prepared to advocate and defend a particular economic system, but *since you asked,* I do think that money and power become easier to obtain with more money and power, and that as a matter of fairness, we should have legislation that tries to make that exponential effect a bit more linear. The logistics of how to implement that principal are regrettably complicated. Some European countries like Sweden and Denmark seem to have a good thing going with high tax rates and social services, so I guess I err on the side of socialism, though there are plenty of things I don't like about it, the potential for government waste with state run businesses or government corruption with state contracted businesses among them.

As to moving here from a rich western nation to study, it can become quite expensive yes. Since a few years back universities cost for foreign citizens and it's, from what i've heard, only easy to aquire full scholarships if you come from a country of need. We do have student-exchange programs in pretty much all our universites, but i have no experience or knowledge of those.

Moving here to work is another story, we don't have any laws of minimum wage but we have very powerful unions so not getting a decent wage for your work is never a problem. The standard tax for your income is 30%, VAT is a bit more expensive than most countries though, especially if you like ""bad"" things like tobacco, alcohol and gasoline.

The political system is quite simple. We vote on three different levels; municipal, [län](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A4n) and state(as in the whole country).

Besides the eight parties we have in our riksdag we have two other ""large"" parties with other political influences.

1st is the ""pirate party"" which have aquired a seat in EU. They are, i guess, internet-centric neoliberalists.
2nd is ""Feminstic initiative"" which fights for all forms of equality.

The main point ill start off with is that the op lists alot of things ron paul is for and against that he disagrees with and some in my opinion are valid things to  disagree on especially the controversial ones however here is why ron caught my eye. Though yes he openly states what he is for and against when it comes to his personal views he has also made it clear that his views or anyone elses for that matter should not be pushed on anyone else. He has stated many times that he doesn want federal involvment in state law making in anyway, so in that respect his personal beliefs really dont matter eg he has said he believes marriage is between a man and a women, but he doesn care if gays marry its up to the state to decide, so his beliefs aside he wont push those beliefs on anyone so why should it matter?

Secondly the op says that ron paul wants a laize fair style federal goverment. . . . yes thank god finally you should be saying, what this means is peoples voices could now be heard, you get to elect people to your state that make the rules for your state none of this oh great bush is in the whole countries fucked, now its oh that guys president good he can focus on the important stuff rather that fucking up my state where no one voted for the guy, how can allowing the people more of voice be a bad thing?

Thirdly look at what the other presidents have done recently, presidents that won their elections by claiming to do this and change that and bomb these guys or not bomb those guys etc, when did the us become the world police? I agree i think the us should be out of the un or at least lose there veto, i dont think anyone should have a veto in the un but thats beside the point, i dont think you americans understand how belittling your actions in the un make you look to the rest of the world, your veto on a palestinian state for example, from our eyes israel has you by the balls and you look very weak, not to mention all the other shit thats happened in the un. Paul wants you out of there out of all your bases around the world and out of wars cause its economically stupid, he is the only president ive ever heard tell the truth and because of that i think he deserves a chance, like look at your last 2 presidents, think of all the cuts youve had to pay for war!?!? like wtf seriously, you realise how prosperous you guys would be if you took ron pauls economic advice?

In closing i think i should summarise by saying, yes this is a man with some views i dont agree with aswell as some i do but good god he cant do any worse than the last 2? Not only that but a person who has views as a politician, especially an american politician and especially a republican, who doesn want to shove it down my throat or force me with laws to believe it or to not have my own opinion is cool by me, his economic policys are smart and are correct and he wants the federal goverment to do the job is was set up to do not do the states job and make it 100 times worse with a country long string of red tape thats my thoughts anyway",True,t1_c2o4suz,,1427673819,,0,36,,politics,t3_kxuyz,True,t3_kxuyz,c2o4suz,36,samacora,0,0

So in that 26% we are counting people who were born in Sweden but have parents from Norway.  Norway seems to be a little more diverse with a significant Pakistani contingent.  That is nothing compared to the non-assimilated populations in US cities.  I can't find numbers but New York city only has 35% non-hispanic whites, and some of those are immigrants, so let's assume 25% are American-born non-hispanic whites.  They aren't comparable.

He is quite ignorant of history and he imagines(although this was a common enough mistake then and even today) that Christianity is a European/Western legacy.

It's not perfect yet but way better, there are quite a few online-shops out there where you can get most things and some supermarkets have something too by now.it Depends where you live, i don't know about america but i northern europe it's quite common.
 
If you have to travel pack enough food, you will never know if you can find something.
 If you eat out remember: never trust the sauce.

If you get invted somewhere: eat before you go there, nothing is worse then to sit hungry in front of a cake while everybody else is eating

Also, if you can't already, learn to cook
Clean your shit up, if you share a kitchen with someone make sure you cook seperate or only gluten free and . Even use your own butter.
If you live alone: throw everything away that could be contaminated or give it to somebody else if you don't want to waste it.

Food that you will eat for the rest of your live:
potatos, rice, corn
meat meat meat fish

alcohol? get some wine, whisky and vodka
the gluten free beer is... okay, but expansive

I don't know much about bank decision practices - I *suspect* they want to lend (after all, that's sort of important to making money) but don't know how to evaluate risks ... which I instinctively put down to the wild valuation swings and high-velocity money behaviours of the financial markets, and some uncertainty over evolving requirements for capitalization. And I suspect corporate lending is not needed when corporations are sitting on cash hoards and deciding not to invest, anyway. But I really am pretty ignorant about the bank practices, so if you say investment isn't happening because banks decline due to worry about healthcare costs, I can't gainsay you.

Regulations often (not always, by any means) *do* help business: they reduce uncertainty, they level playing fields, they increase efficiency of interoprability ... consider a simple regulation like, oh, train track gauge. Overall commerce benefits when standards like that are imposed - and the standards don't happen magically, and they aren't cost free, and they involve winners and losers. Or consider telephone systems. Or electrical systems - look at the business Japan is losing right now because they run 50 Hz power in the west, and 60 Hz in the east, and can't ship power to fill in for the disaster-struck areas. Or consider what happens to sales of, for example, lettuce or cantaloupes when people distrust the food ... that's the kind of damage which regulation limits.

(http://www.uschamber.com/issues/regulatory/cost-benefit-analysis-and-regulatory-accounting)

With respect to possible tax rates - the most I have heard is ""raise millionaire's taxes to something closer to average American effective tax rates"" - no specific numbers seem to have been floated by the Administration, and certainly no rates have been set into law, so your assertion of a top MTR of 40% in 2013 is, as best I can tell, pure speculation.

False,1317519762,t5_2s6e6," I don't really understand what you mean by ""obtain A2 for a C2V molecule"".  Do you mean figure out how many A2 modes there are?  Figure out what the A2 vibrational mode looks like?  Something else?

I'll try to explain how to do XeF4 though.  

XeF4 is square planar and belongs to point group D4h.  So you need a D4h character table, e.g. this one: http://www.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Flick/chem341/d4h1.jpg
(actually the page I just pulled that from looks like it could e useful to you, http://www.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Flick/chem341/vibexample.html)

The basic procedure is to figure out what reducible representation an imaginary set of Cartesian axes assigned to each atom transforms as.  There's different ways to approach this, obviously this is the one I use.

Imagine that each atom, including the central Xe, has a set of x,y,z axes assigned to it.  For the fluorines, the z-axis points in towards Xe, the x axis is in the plane of the molecule, and the y axis is perpendicular to the plane (the assignment here is largely arbitrary).  For the Xe, put the x and y axes in the plane of the molecule lined up with the bonds and the z-axis perpendicular to it.  

You now have to go through the D4h character table and figure out what character this reducible representation has under each symmetry operation based on how many of the axes or unchanged or flipped.  Basically, if the whole atom moves under the operation, it contributes zero; if the atom stays in place, then it contributes 1 for each axis that is unchanged and -1 for each axis that flips direction.  

Example:

For the identity operation E, obviously every atom stays in place and everything is unchanged.  So the character is 15, 3 from each of 5 atoms.

For the C4 rotation, all of the fluorine atoms move so contribute nothing.  For the central Xe atom, the z-axis is unchanged so contributes +1.  The x and y axes also ""move"" (into each other) so contribute nothing.  Total character: +1

For the C2 rotation (along the z-axis, perpendicular to the molecule plane), the fluorine atoms again contribute nothing.  For the Xe atom, the z-axis is again unchanged and contributes +1.  The x-axis ends up reversed into -x, and the same for the y-axis; they each contribute -1.  Total: -1

The C'2 axis, which is the twofold rotation axis which is collinear with the Xe-F bonds: two of the fluorines move and don't contribute.  For the two fluorines which are on the rotation axis: the z-axis is unchanged (+2), and the x and y axes are flipped (-4).  For the xenon, the z and x axis are flipped (-2) but the y axis is unchanged (+1).  Total character: -3

Hopefully that's enough to get the picture.

You eventually end up with a reducible representation that looks like (hopefully this formats okay):

E    2C4     C2     2C2'    2C2''    i      2S4    sigma(h)    2sigma(v)    2sigma(d)

15   1         -1      3          -1     -3       -1        5                3                 1

This represents every way in which the component atoms of the molecule can move in space.

You have to decompose that into irreducible representations;  basically, find which irreducible representations (the rows of the character table) literally *add up* to the reducible representation.  I'm going to assume you've been taught a formula/method for that; if not I can go over that too, let me know.

It ends up decomposing into: A1g + A2g + B1g + B2g + Eg + 2A2u + B2u + 3Eu

These all represent motions of the molecule, but not all represent vibrations; some represent *translations* or *rotations*.  You need to get rid of those.  Fortunately, character tables come with something very useful for this, which is the columns on the far right which tell you which irreducible representations the translations and rotations belong to.  Look for the symbols Rz, Rx, and Ry;  those are the rotations and in this case they correspond to A2g and Eg.  Then look for x, y, and z; those are the translations, in this case A2u and Eu.

Subtract those out, and you left with the vibrational modes:  A1g + B1g + B2g + A2u + B2u + 2Eu.

You can double check at this point by counting up how many vibrational modes you have.  You may remember that non-linear molecules have 3N-6 vibrational modes, where N is the number of atoms.  In this case that's 9.  Now if you count up the number of modes you have from the irreducible representation, remembering that E modes count as 2 and A and B modes count as 1 (you can see this by looking under the identity operation in the character table), you see that that works out correctly.

Next you need to know the ""selection rules"" which determine which vibrational modes are active in either IR or raman spectroscopy.

The selection rule for IR is:  the vibrational mode has to belong to an irreducible representation that transforms as either the x, y, or z axes.  Again, look at the character table to see which those are.  In this case, they are A2u (transforms as z) and Eu (transforms as x,y together which is fine).

The selection rule for Raman is: the vibrational modes has to belong to an irreducible representation that transforms as a *quadratic* function of x, y, and z.  The character table has these too.   In this case the active modes are A1g (z2 *and* x2+y2), B1g (x2-y2), and B2g (xy).

False,1317520215,t5_2qh53,"Good points. You're slightly more optimistic about of transition from fossil fuels. The truth is we have solutions now to get away from petroleum based vehicles today, but the economic of it is scary to think about. 

Gas is cheap and easy. It has a high ratio of energy for its volume and weight. Our infrastructure has been built with gas vehicles in mind with our homes and fuel stations. The oil companies will milk every penny out of the ground and bribe every politician along the way to prevent us to go to alternative energy based transportation. 

The electric car on the other hand (with the current technology) is expensive requiring precious materials with the batteries and computer systems, expensive to repair (replacing batteries), and has limited range. I suspect the transition car will be a petro/electric hybrid to extend the range. A brand new electric grid will need to be made to accommodate the new demand for ultra high voltage power and all fueling stations will have to be rebuilt from the ground up. The main source of electric will not come from renewable power but coal (again based on economics due to its low cost and high energy storage). Innovation on alternative vehicles will come when the market for them really starts (post oil).

The US will do OK in the transition but rest of the world will be fucked. The total rebuilding of our global infrastructure will need to be rebuilt from the ground up again. The Middle East will be totally fucked and see their economy crumble but this time no help from the West. Russia and China will be OK but Europe will suffer big time. This will send ripples through the global economy in a way that makes the current bank crisis look minor.

The transition from old petro infrastructure will come too late for many countries and there will be a severe recession if not a depression. We will not see the transition until (the price to drive a petro car a mile * price of mpg of gas) &gt; (the price to drive an electric car a mile * price of mpg of electric). By that time we'll easily have 10 gallon gas and there will be total chaos in the 3rd world. The industrial countries will be too busy building a new infrastructure to squash the violence. Foreign aid will be all but nonexistent for possible decades. 

That's my doomsday scenario and there is historical example of how dynamic transformations have growth periods. The good news is it shouldn't be a World War but it could span new economic cold wars. Also the chief energy source will be nuclear and coal. The US has a crap load of coal and the resources to setup nuclear.

False,1317525017,t5_2qiqi,"Using ideas such as US history, population density and local color, here are my thoughts on the schools and magic in America.

My first theory is that American Wizarding Society, while secret, is more in cohesion with Muggles. The first wizards to America likely left feeling the desire to be more open. A new land, freshly settled may have seemed alluring. Also, there are a few schools around the country, given its large size. They remain hidden as wizards, but are actively engaged in muggle society. Rather than a separate form of government, wizards run in a hidden department along side the US government, and even having a secret cabinet position under the President directly that only he knows about. Many wizards help to maintain the secrecy by actually being elected politicians. By muggle standards, it is unknown who has been a wizard, but they have been everywhere in politics from the House, to the Senate, Supreme Court and perhaps one or two Vice-Presidents, but never a President, have been wizards.

Salem is the oldest and first founded due to the first wizards who came to America. It still stands, and is likely the most widely recognized school in the America's. It teaches in a similar manner to Hogwarts, with its founders and first students likely having been taught there themselves. But over the years, it has taken a more international approach to teaching. The school's location may be why the ""witch trials"" were held there in the first place. It's student body is primarily composed of children of European descent, from the North East, covering Maine to Maryland, and westward to Minnesota and Iowa.

There is a school likely located in the deep south either in the Appalachians or plantation regions (Georgia or North Carolina are my prime speculations), founded by wizards who may have been sympathizers with the Confederacy where Salem likely supported the Union. Again, similar in style to Hogwarts and largely the same as it was when founded. It takes a more traditional and conservative approach to teaching magic. While hostile at first, this school and Salem now have a friendly rivalry. The student body consists of the southern states and includes much of Texas.

The native American's never originally had a joint school like the Europeans, they instead felt it was the duty of a tribe's shaman to pass on the knowledge to their students. Unlike Europeans, the natives have no secrecy of their magic, and the concept of a ""Muggle"" is foreign to them and magic users are revered and honored. European wizards, unlike muggles, held open arms to the natives and the shamanic magics are now taught in schools such as Salem (but not the one in the South). There are two schools now dedicated to this style of magic, one in North Dakota, and another in New Mexico. They operate under the same name/banner. European wizards are not excluded from these schools, but are not normally found there. The schools are small, as many still prefer the traditional master/pupil arrangement.

One more school, less secretive than the others, is located in the heart of the San Francisco Bay area. Of all the schools, it is perhaps the most diverse magic school in the world. Founded in the early 1900's it is also one of the youngest in the world. The school caters to many forms of magic, ranging from the European styles, to Native American, Asian, Middle Eastern, African, etc. The school caters to students from not only all over the US, but the world as well. It offers a special exchange program where students from other nations can come and study, and also expose American students to more unique and focused magic schools around the world.

I also imagine Hawaii has a setup more akin to what ever other Pacific island nations do for magic teaching.

Also, here's a stab at some names.

False,1317525126,t5_2qh1i,"I have an issue with you saying that you ""believe"" rather than you ""think"" and acting as though you are an expert. You are assuming that migraines are the same as cluster headaches (no evidence). They are both usually intense unilateral headaches with autonomic accompaniments, but they are different. You refer to olfactory auras, so I have to point out that a cluster headache typically has no aura (atypical cases can have an aura). So your arguement is very flawed here.
Other differences include: 
Male predominance (cluster) vs female predominance (migraine), restlessness &amp; agitation (cluster) vs seeking rest and stillness (migraine), 45-90minute attack (cluster) vs 4-72hrs (migraine), marked periodicity of attacks (cluster), peak age of onset 25-40 (cluster) 20-30 (migraine). 
Regardless, I think that the idea you have is interesting too. Particularly with what I read about changes in sleep patterns and seasons often triggering cluster periods. So it's feasible that the sufferer may already be developing a headache when they notice the smell (no causation). However causation is still probable. Being in a cluster period makes the sufferer more likely to experience an attack. It makes sense that an attack could be triggered by a small rise in histamine due to perfume irritation. By that reasoning, perhaps during a remission period a perfume might not necessarily cause an attack. However there is no research, so it's all just ideas. You point out the difficulties of research. However you have no idea. There are so few sufferers of cluster headaches that a trial like this would be difficult to conduct on any decent scale, also you would never get a trial like this through an ethics committee- you cannot attempt to cause a cluster headache in a subject as a researcher. Furthermore, if a sufferer suspects something as a trigger I would not suggest they ignore it. These attacks are horrendous and avoiding possible triggers (within reason) like going to bars where there may be strong perfume is not going to ruin their QOL very much anyway. To raindogx- one study I read said that 80% or more of cluster headache sufferers had a history of smoking. I was wondering if you do?

&gt;The name Canada originated around 1535 from the Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata meaning ""village"", ""settlement"", or ""land""; another contemporary translation was ""cluster of dwellings"". Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian, which was spoken by the inhabitants of Stadacona and the neighbouring region near present-day Quebec City in the 16th century, was closely related to other Iroquoian languages, such as Oneida and Mohawk. In modern Mohawk, for example, the word kaná:ta' means ""town"". Jacques Cartier transcribed the word as ""canada"" and was first to use the word to refer not only to the village of Stadacona but also to the neighbouring region and to the Saint Lawrence River, which he called rivière de Canada. By 1545, European books and maps began referring to this region as Canada.

&gt;The name California is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by Black Amazons and ruled by Queen Calafia. The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Exploits of Esplandian, written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo. The kingdom of Queen Calafia, according to Montalvo, was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts, and rich in gold.

&gt;&gt;Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California, very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them, and they lived in the manner of Amazons. They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue. The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks.

&gt; Do you think less invention is better? I assume more invention is good, since the biggest difference between our quality of life and those before us is the result of invention.

I agree with you, actually. All things being equal, more inventions=better.  The point I was trying to make though is that it's possible that the system has been coopted/hijacked/corrupted to the point where inventions defeat their purpose - i.e. the benefit they confer to the rest of society is more than offset by the ill effects of further concentration of wealth in the hands of the rich. 

&gt; ...so incentivizing widespread invention will likely result in us (and those after us) having better quality of life.

Sure, but this is precisely the question where we differ - are our IP laws really about incentivizing invention? Or are they more about conferring a systematic, unnatural advantage to established companies and big businesses?

&gt; Employment is cyclical

I would say we are looking at steady worsening underlying trend (a low-frequency signal) disguised by transient up and down changes (e.g. convolved with high-frequency ""noise"").

&gt; a lot of Europe (which has a lot lower inequality ratio) has seen unemployment much higher than the US for decades

I don't think you can compare different economies like this. I.e. there are lots of things about Europe's economy that are different from ours. I am not arguing that wealth inequality is the only way one can end up with an economy seizing up and wide-spread unemployment. All I'm arguing is that looking at the US economy specifically, our role prior to the crash was that of consumer of last resort - and the global economy tanked because our middle class just stopped being able to buy crap in the quantities needed to keep everyone employed. And that's at the root of it a wealth-distribution problem. I.e. more and more of our ""middle class"" can no longer afford to live up to the ""middle class"" lifestyle standard set by society.

&gt; What mechanism besides patents would protect us and cause us to innovate

So we would have to come up with some other system. I don't believe it's impossible - after all, innovation and inventions precede the establishment of IP laws. Besides, IP laws encourage companies to spend money on R&amp;D and obtaining patents. I don't know that the majority of the economic benefits accrue to the people who actually do the inventing. So perhaps something that preserves that incentive for the actual inventors and innovators, but strips away the benefits that accrue to the corporations and companies?

&gt; The majority of rich people are first generation, and there are studies (I think a recent one was by the St. Louis Fed?) showing significant turnover.

That's definitely better than having no turnover (which would be like having a hereditary ruling class) but nevertheless it doesn't address the problem of skewed wealth distribution and the widening gulf between the super-rich and the rest of society. So even if the system is really something like a lottery where the odds of winning are increasingly smaller, but the rewards of winning are increasingly larger - the point is, even if the system is perfectly fair from a pure randomness point of view, is it possible that with such a skewed distribution of wealth the system is unworkable? Don't we have to worry about the whole thing collapsing, if that's where we are headed?

&gt; Secondly, you think investors are ""other people"". Investors include pensions, 401Ks, state employee pensions, union pensions.

I don't have that simplistic a view of it. Yes, collectively a million middle class people could be said to be the ""investors"" who own a billion dollars worth of stock. But a guy who owns $1,000 is just not going to benefit from higher corporate profitability as a guy who owns $1,000,0000,000. And we have to look at the relative effects of how each guy benefits, and loses. E.g. suppose one ""investor"" is a guy who works for the company, earns $100,000 a year, and owns $1000 of stock. Another ""investor"" is a guy who owns $1,000,000,000 but does not draw a salary. Suppose workers' wages are cut 10% and that causes a 30% spike in the company's value, due to higher profitability. That worker lost $10,000 in income a year, and saw his wealth increase by $300. Whereas the large investor gained by $300,000,000.

So just because ""small investors"" also benefit from corporations doing better, that does not mean there are other things going on that more than wipe out that benefit, saddling them with a net loss.

Ultimately, because there is stuff like that going on, is why our middle class has been under pressure and yielding ground, despite higher corporate profits and stock prices.

&gt; What does this mean? Who funds it? With what money? For what incentive? Without any details this is like me wishing people would make me interest free loans ""for the betterment of society"" without explaining why someone would do that. More deails please.

Constructing something workable is much, much harder than pointing out the fatal flaws of an existing system.  How would it be funded? Well, could be government, or a non-government 3rd party agency. Rather than the corporation who employs the inventor being in charge of determining how much to charge for licensing, how much of the rewards (a bonus, e.g.) should go to the inventor - some outside agency figures out how much positive externalities the invention created, and can ""tax"" businesses who benefit from this new invention.

Anyhow. My point is not so much that I have a system that I think will work better - I'm merely pointing out that our current system is really flawed, and that the point of it might not be ""encourage innovation and inventions"" (which is what our propaganda system tells us) but rather ""concentrate more wealth, power, and control at the hands of Big Businesses and their wealthy investors.""",True,t1_c2o67zv,,1427674555,,0,1,,politics,t1_c2nnpfr,False,t3_kr8lj,c2o67zv,1,poli_ticks,0,0

The two-party system is a product of the way elections are held. Because we elect individuals by district to the legislature, it is difficult for third/fourth/fifth parties to gain any foothold in national politics. For a counterexample, look at European-style elections that reward each party a number of seats based on how well they perform nationwide, meaning that a smaller percentage of votes in each district still grants them a place in national legislatures.  
  Then there's the involvement of money. The problem here is twofold. One, money controls the flow of information. That means that voters are see and hear what those with cash want them to. Even 100% turnout is pointless if only 2% of the population is capable of accessing the entire story. Then, after elections are held, elected officials are beholden to those that financially backed their campaigns. The way to fix this is to either limit the money that can be contributed by private interests, or to somehow make financial participation in campaigns compulsory for all or most citizens. The former is unlikely because the US Supreme Court has equated campaign contributions to free speech, which constructs a constitutional barrier for any serious attempt at campaign finance reform.

You're also making a wild presumption that the Universe started out of nothing. Science has only been able [to peel pack as far as 10^-43 seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Big_Bang) after everything kicked off. That's ten tredecillionths of a second. You know how short a period of time that is? If the universe is 13.7 billion years old, which is the current best guess, then we have a really good picture of what happened during 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999992% of that.

As to what happened before that interval of time so brief you can barely call it an interval at all? It's still anyone's guess. It could be that the universe collapses in upon itself every so often to be reborn over and over again endlessly. Maybe there is no beginning or end, but a constant cycle. If you've read even a bit about quantum mechanics you will quickly realize the universe can be a very strange place indeed. Maybe the universe came from itself, just an earlier version. Maybe it goes away just like it came into being. You probably want to find a book on [cosmology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology) to get a better idea of what's going on out there.

Don't forget the [anthropic principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle) which simply states that if the universe did not support life, we would not be here asking questions about it. Think about the impossibility of your own existence. How likely is it that your DNA came together in that precise pattern? One in a number that's so large it takes an entire DVD to hold it, that's how unlikely it is.

As to how God could possibly prove his existence, I say it's paradoxically impossible. If some being revealed themselves to you in all their fantastical glory, how do you know you're not being duped? European explorers were famous for presenting themselves as gods to less advanced people, and if they were equipped with detailed charts on the stars and the timing of eclipses, which were coincidentally essential for navigation, they could even appear to blot out the sun with their will. They had weapons that could kill people without touching them, and would kill others who displeased them with horrible diseases.

I think we're not equipped to distinguish between a true deity and a clever, technologically advanced impostor, so we will never know *for sure* if there is even one god with any degree of confidence until such a time as we are, arguably, gods ourselves.

&gt;Greed is one of the primary motivations. You are demanding more &gt;yourself because you're greedy. Barriers are in place to keep those &gt;who don't want it enough from getting it.

What about the people who do want it? What about the people who read books, who get 4.0 GPAs, who are exceedingly smart but can't get a job because the financial system crashed, and they don't have money for college? 

The barriers you speak of, such as anti-fraud barriers, admissions requirements for schools, etc, are there to keep the motivated in and the unmotivated out. But with 20% underemployment, we have to realize that some barriers need to be torn down.

&gt;Your solutions of government ""regulating"" the banks is what put us &gt;here in the first place. They did such a great job the first time around.

&gt;You yourself is sitting at home on reddit in a cozy setting. You yourself &gt;is benefiting off the labor of 3rd world laborers. You bitch with no &gt;answer except to blame the rich as a scapegoat because it's easy. It's &gt;hypocrites like you that are the problem. You make noise that sounds &gt;good but in reality, no practical or realistic solution. In addition, you &gt;bring forth the very little knowledge you present and attempt to sound &gt;like an expert demanding things.

Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, has clearly stated that the stimulus package needed to be twice as big and with fewer tax cuts. He also stated that there's far too much evidence that this country is not a meritocracy, and that raising taxes on the rich will not hurt this country.

Warren Buffet famously pointed out that most CEOs pay fewer taxes than their secretaries, and that most companies pay a far, far lower tax rate than most would have you believe.

Many economists believe that a high Gini coefficient, which measures the amount of income inequality, is actually unhealthy for a nation.

There are plenty of experts out there that have specific proposals to fix this country. All we ask is that the right people listen.

&gt;Let me buy a plane ticket to any 3rd world country. I will gladly trade &gt;you for one of them who will come here and actually work hard instead &gt;of ""why not me?"" and ""where's my piece?"". You want to create more &gt;opportunity? Go start a business and hire some employees and produce &gt;something. You're not going to do it. People like you just bitch while &gt;others actually do.

Well, 1. people are trying to kick out illegal immigrants left and right.
2. I would LOVE to start a business, but BANKS AREN'T LENDING TO BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW! THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN A RECESSION!
3. I'm a hard worker. It's just that when an engineer works hard as a waiter at a restaurant, you have to question whether this society is working at peak efficiency.

&gt;(BTW, 20 years is a lot of time. Democratic party sold you out 15 &gt;years ago when they had NAFTA to ship your jobs overseas dummy. &gt;Both parties buttraping you and you still think one actually gives a shit &gt;about you.)

Free trade is good. Outsourcing labor is good if it's managed properly by the government. Both of them, in the long run, lead to a higher quality of life for each party, which is what we're all aiming for.

False,1317534866,t5_2qh33,"Thank you. You just opened my eyes to absolutely nothing. The point is that the constitution didn't give anybody more rights than another; and that today many laws have been incanted to give more rights to immigrants than citizens, at least in California. How did you not get that? Shall I walk you through it again? Maybe after you read this you would like to tell me that Columbus became the catalyst to European colonization of the Americas before the Constitution was written.

It's an unpopular point because to many US citizens think with their emotions. Whatever makes them feel better about themselves becomes the PC opinion, all other opinions are cold hearted.

What I am getting at here is that the cartoon is depicting the guy as a redneck retard. I don't care much for the hetero/christian part; people should be free to make their own choices. Obviously this comic is poking at the ideals of the conservative type that I am ashamed of.

On the other hand immigrants are a tax on this country's financial systems. The US hardly exports anything; so little money is coming in compared to what is going out; which is already a problem. Next when limited resources and services are spread even thinner over a larger population then everything begins to decline at an increasing rate.

What I am saying is that immigrants are taken care of with taxpayer's money in California and they don't contribute. I understand the feel good ""moral"" ideal to take care of everybody, because oh my god they are people. It really is great. Currently it is not realistic, because of the tendency of most people to take the path of least resistance, to do what is easiest. Which leads to a general decline. I know many hard working people fall on hard times and need some help. We could really help them out a whole lot more if we didn't throw money at people without a track record for good behavior in this country or proof of good behavior in their last residence.

The constitution didn't provide provisions for people that didn't prove themselves, nor for those that didn't perform. They got left out in the dust.

The way I see it is that this is natures way, natural selection. The best reproduce. The commonality would be to point out that people don't start out on equal footing. That's true; and this is a case of those that aren't the best reproducing. Naturally the offspring will have a harder time. However once in awhile the exceptional offspring beat the odds and join the ranks of the best. Just as often the offspring of the best can be worthless and waste all they were given. Survival of the fittest, obviously.

I know you want to mis-construe what I am saying by correlating best with the wealthy and the others as poor. This is not what I am saying.

What I think most don't consider is that you can break this further up into the fitness of the family, the fitness of the tribe, the fitness of a state, the fitness of a country. If any of these systems invite weakness in its fitness goes down. 

This country's fitness has been declining since a certain movement occurred. This movement lead to a shift of, everybody should feel good about everything and nobody should be made to feel bad; everybody should be taken care of(emotional path of least resistance). If you raise somebody or something like it is weak, then it will grow up weak(it doesn't feel good to discipline a child; however not doing it is a disservice to the child.). This has lead to an era of not making the hard decisions that need to be made(path of least resistance); an era of decline and weakening of all that used to make this country strong. An era of allowing in weakness because it feels better to be nice than to be smart(path of least resistance). I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader to determine which movement I am talking about. (I do want to say that I am definitely NOT talking about the movement driven by MLK)


It doesn't feel good to keep people out of the country, but inviting in weakness will only erode and destroy this country from the inside.",True,t1_c2o6xaz,,1427674886,,0,-1,,funny,t1_c2o661h,False,t3_kxq5m,c2o6xaz,-1,[deleted],0,0

* Property rights can be taken away with due process if it was proven that the owners used fraud to obtain it. i.e. Wall Street bankers, who lied about the contents of the securities that they were selling.

Having *due process* taking away property rights means there must be a court of law in order to take away property, life and liberty away from you. Just can't do it by force like in a 3rd world, idiot! That is the point of property rights. Even banks can't foreclosure without property paperwork and cases that don't get in serious shit. People don't get to keep it by default. Where you're going, guys with AKs can just come take from you. Good luck there.

* None of those things happen in Europe, and europe is FAR, FAR better off than us, even with their gas prices being double what ours are. Let's compare ourselves to Europe from here on out, shall we?

None of those things happen in Europe which is great but you are the one that brought up 3rd world countries. I didn't know you consider a continent a 3rd world country now. So no, let's not talk about Europe since you it's irrelevant to the original point. I don't want you to start talking about the moon next.

* What about the people who do want it? What about the people who read books, who get 4.0 GPAs, who are exceedingly smart but can't get a job because the financial system crashed, and they don't have money for college?

* The barriers you speak of, such as anti-fraud barriers, admissions requirements for schools, etc, are there to keep the motivated in and the unmotivated out. But with 20% underemployment, we have to realize that some barriers need to be torn down. 

Being smart or being scholastically able has nothing to do with about getting rich or being successful. You bring down the barriers, then quality suffers. There's a reason why high school diplomas have no clout now; too easy to get and everyone has one. Not everyone should or can be a doctor or engineer, nor should we dumb it down so they could.

* Not exactly. The financial derivatives that caused all this economic mayhem were regulated in 1933 by the Glass-Steagal Act. Those regulations were overturned in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act because the Republican congress, specifically Phil Gramm, wanted more economic freedom for the rich.

Yeah that totally stopped the savings and loans crisis in the 80s. There will never be a perfect government regulation that stops everything. Stop looking for a solution where there is none. Government is partially responsible for this mess in the first place.

* Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, has clearly stated that the stimulus package needed to be twice as big and with fewer tax cuts. He also stated that there's far too much evidence that this country is not a meritocracy, and that raising taxes on the rich will not hurt this country.
Warren Buffet famously pointed out that most CEOs pay fewer taxes than their secretaries, and that most companies pay a far, far lower tax rate than most would have you believe.

So how does this refute about you scapegoating and having no solutions again? You bring in *ONE* Keynesian economist who propose a theory to have government spending fill the gap in the economy and it fixes it? You know how many people refute Krugman? Plus borrowing more is the solution which is what we been doing for decades. Did it work? You're just borrowing from the future selfishly so you don't have to feel the pain of now. 

Yeah, Buffet pays less because he has more deductions. He made more jobs than the average joe working one job too. You know those people that work for him pays taxes too? Without him employing all those people, you wouldn't even have his secretary getting the pleasure of even being able to pay income tax. What he wants to do with his money is up to him and not for you to decide through taxation of the government.

In terms of income inequality. It sucks but bitching on reddit, borrowing more and scapegoating the rich will not do a thing.

1.Come to California, we have tons of immigrants working here and some even starting businesses once they become legit. 2.

False,1317539556,t5_2ryd5,"Thanks for engaging in critical discussion! I'll try to address your points as best I can understand them.

&gt;As a Christian I'm actually looking forward to reclaiming the Earth during the Millennium Reign when the temple of God comes down with Messiah (Jesus) as ruler.

My issue with this statement is the assumption you bring to ancient Israeli culture from the New Testament. It's an issue that's at the very core of Christianity's understanding of the Old Testament: that God has this overarching plan that, even though the Jewish writers weren't aware of, is seeded with clues throughout the Old Testament, only to be fully revealed in the first century. 

&gt;Concerning the rest, such as the formation of the Bible... God used men to write His word. The Jews as custodians of the Oral Law did a fine job keeping that word. You are correct the rest developed over time. God choosing to speak to people in their time and day.

I think this thinking is highly naive and completely unsupported when you actually read the Old Testament within the context of the time and place it was composed. What's more, it is very clear that god could not have executed such a document, perfectly placing each word through scribes at different times, as there are exacerbating inconsistencies historically and theologically between the different books. The most glaring example of this is [Deuteronomy 23:3](http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-3.htm) which clearly forbids the Ammonites and Moabites from EVER entering the assembly of god's people. Some Palestinian tribes are allowed to join the nation of Israel if they follow the lifestyle of the Jewish people for three generations but for the Ammonites and Moabites Deuteronomy is explicit that even if they follow the law of god for 10 generations they still couldn't become part of the nation of Israel. The inconsistency is that when you get to the book of [Ruth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_(biblical_figure)), we have Moabites marrying and becoming apart of the assembly of Israel without any issue whatsoever. In fact Ruth marries Jewish men twice in the story so it doesn't appear to be uncommon at all. The real problem, outside of the apparent inconsistency between Deuteronomy and Ruth, is that Ruth is the great grandmother of King David, and conversely part of the lineage of Jesus. How then, does god forbid a clan of ancient Palestine from ever coming into fellowship with him, but then later stakes the lineage of Jesus on this very same group of people via Ruth? 

There are many other examples which one could pour over, and at the end of the day, like I've said elsewhere, you can always choose to ignore these issues in faith (although I would argue that's not what faith is but I'll save that for another discussion), but to me when I read these texts in their entirety I see less and less a god inspiring timeless wisdom and more and more people with agenda's that they bring god into. 

&gt;I would disagree with your focus on this point as well as the comparison to Platonic Dualism which as a Christian I don't agree with or find Christ advocating. The apostles and the early Church interpreted the earlier scriptures being illuminated with the appearance of Christ. Now that Christ had come, certain texts became clearer and easier to understand.

Some of my reply to this is covered by the above but I think you're getting too concerned with the dualism of platonic thought and not the most important part which is Metaphysics. While the influence of dualism is exceedingly apparent in Christianity simply by the fact that [Hell was not a concept that existed in Ancient Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell#Judaism), as is the fact that the concept of Christian Heaven is alien to them. Jewish teaching on the afterlife (and I may mangle this to some degree) is that people die, nothing happens, their bodies lay in wait, and then their bodies get resurrected. No soul, no heaven, no Hell. This is not only evidence of dualism but of Platonic metaphysics in the concept of the soul. The real crux of it all boils down to this though, Judaism in the Hellenistic world was starkly different in its monotheism. Platonic metaphysics and monotheism are, excuse the phrase, a match made in heaven. Platonic metaphysics is the idea that although you can draw a triangle, it is not the only type of triangle in the world and that the idea of a triangle super cedes any real triangle here in the physical realm. Conversely, there were many gods in western culture during the first centuries BCE/CE, and to everyone outside of Israel, their god was just another to throw on the pile. Christianity, in the colliding of these ideas, is the extension of the Judaic god from a god tied to a land and a people, to a metaphysical god which super cedes all. 

&gt;I want so bad to agree with this statement but just can't. Its as if you are calling the Nicaea council the root of today's Christianity.

Umm, how is it not? They are responsible for the canon of texts you consider sacred, they are most certainly the root of Western Christianity. Otherwise you would be more than likely be practicing gnostic christianity or maybe even modern day Ethiopian christianity. The real issue is that the christianity you would be practicing today would have had to be tied to political power, and as I've clearly outlined, Nicea and the canonization of the Bible you read were intertwined which causes me to be suspect. 

&gt;IMO. The Christian church at this time was just relieved of persecution. So you are saying that these Christians who believed there faith so strongly they would be tortured for it (and had been for hundreds of years at this point) have a political interest in Constantine keeping order in his empire? You lost me. Makes no sense to me at all.

Actually they do, and sense you just state this as fact, and not have any reason or rational behind it, I would like to point out that the gold standard is one of the only ways for a currency to hold it's value. Which is one reason why the EU and US are having inflation problems. It has been consistently 2.5 to 3%. During the gold standard, it was 0.2%. The monetary system does need to be reformed instead of currency based on debt. The last president that tried to do this was JFK and everyone seems to think he was the last great president.

&gt; ""Paul believes that prayer in public schools should not be prohibited at the federal or state level""

How is it constitutional for the federal government to ban any prayer in school. The seperation of church and state was intended to keep the federal government from endorsing a single religion, not stop it. Praying in a public place is not an endorsement.

&gt; ""Paul believes the internet should be free, and believes in the concepts of net neutrality, but that those concepts should be enforced by the free market and not by government regulation.""

BECAUSE ITS MORE EFFICIENT. Use your brain on this one. The government does not need to run efficiently because it has no competition or quotas to meet. Which is why the welfare system is so jacked up. For every $1 earned for welfare $0.08 is received by the welfare recipient. And you believe that a governmental agency should be in control of the Internet to make sure its free and neutral? That statement in itself is almost contradictory.

&gt; ""Generally speaking, any regulation is bad in this guy's eyes. Government stays out of everything. Laissez faire to the extreme. It's practically anarchy.""

This is one of the most overly dramatic, vague and generalizing statements I have seen here. Some government regulations are bad. For whatever reason democrats believe EVERYTHING should be regulated while republicans think there should be no regulations. Both are generalizing comments which are fallacies and should not even merit a response. Just because some deregulation is viewed to be better by one individual does not mean that he wants anarchy.

&gt; ""And then there's the income tax thing""

I do believe you have no idea what his plan would be. His tax plan would be a head tax. And judging by your understanding of the economy so far I will give you a macroeconomics 101 lesson. A head tax is the tax with the least amount of dead-weight (the percentage of money that all taxes have that is not received by anyone, not the government, supplier, or consumer). A head tax by definition is a tax on everyone at the same percentage. Top 1% pay what everyone else pays. The bottom 50% actually pay taxes. Everyone is equal.

&gt; ""He doesn't believe the Constitution gives you a right to privacy.""

I have yet to hear him say this and it would be ludacris for anyone to actually believe that. Its the 14th amendment for God sake.

&gt;""Paul believes young Americans should be able to opt out of Social Security if they would not like to pay the associated taxes, in order to protect the system. Why is this a good idea?""

Because we shouldn't be forced to spend our money on a program with such little return. That money could be used for investments or beefing up your 401k (which is nothing but investments). The amount of money received per month for a lifetime of work is absolutely insulting comparatively.

You forget that he is also the only candidate that has a plan laid out for getting out of these 3 wars.

Even after seeing these issues in the Bible and even admitting the Bible was not a perfect document stemmed by the divine hand of god, I could still maintain faith in two ways. Primarily it was in making my faith more existential and using the bible as a guide to understanding humanity and not looking to it as an exact list of laws to follow. It took a lot more time, probably about 6 months, for the implications of this understanding to make me question a very important and core tenant: Jesus. There is something to this fear Christian's have that if you give an inch in your devotion to the Bible as the infallible word of god it will undermine everything, or more succinctly, if you don't believe one part of it why believe any of it. However people can rationalize problems and fallacies much more complex than that (mid-century Germany?). 

When you really look to understand the history of Jesus, though, that's a whole different level of undermining christian faith. Albert Schweitzer is kind of attributed with dropping this bombshell, even though he was a Christian,  and that's really what ultimately got me to discard the religion. When you stop and really look at the gospels 3 of them are just (and I'm kind of loosely paraphrasing here) copies of 1 document (known as the Q text) which undermines any kind of sacred synchronicity between them. However the 4 gospels in the canon of the bible are not the only gospels in existence and as you look at all the different gospels that exist in the Mediterranean gnostic tradition as well as north african gospels it's clear Christianity as we know it today wasn't the only kind and jesus as we read him in our bibles wasn't the only descriptions around. Some of the gospels, like [the gospel of thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas], could date back far earlier than the gospels in the canon, meaning historically they should have more validity over our understanding of Jesus. 

Once I began to see Jesus as an edited character by the church and not some real person (real in the sense that the depiction of him was actually who he was) it was clear to me this whole business was an evolved belief system planned by people with personal agenda's that marred whatever truth they may or may not have had a grasping of, just like it has continued to change to accomodate political agendas of individuals throughout European and American history.

&gt; So for those who want to channel their amorphous frustration into practical demands, here are several specific suggestions:

&gt; Impose a financial transactions tax. This would be a modest tax on financial trades, modeled on the suggestions of James Tobin, an American economist who won a Nobel Prize. The aim is in part to dampen speculative trading that creates dangerous volatility. Europe is moving toward a financial transactions tax, but the Obama administration is resisting — a reflection of its deference to Wall Street.

&gt; Close the “carried interest” and “founders’ stock” loopholes, which may be the most unconscionable tax breaks in America. They allow our wealthiest citizens to pay very low tax rates by pretending that their labor compensation is a capital gain.

&gt; Protect big banks from themselves. This means moving ahead with Basel III capital requirements and adopting the Volcker Rule to limit banks’ ability to engage in risky and speculative investments. Another sensible proposal, embraced by President Obama and a number of international experts, is the bank tax. This could be based on an institution’s size and leverage, so that bankers could pay for their cleanups — the finance equivalent of a pollution tax.

**TLDR - Practical Demands OWS Should Make: 1) impose tax on financial trades; 2) eliminate “carried interest” and “founders’ stock” tax loopholes; 3) adopt Basel III capital requirements, and; 4) implement the [Volcker Rule](http://economlist.blogspot.com/2011/10/volcker-rule.html).**",True,t1_c2o7i2f,,1427675159,,0,7,,politics,t3_kxyuu,True,t3_kxyuu,c2o7i2f,7,sprileet,0,0

Y decides to explore further North, settling down in what is now Europe and kicking out the native Neanderthals (sound familiar?), but only after mating with their women to produce a distinctly new subspecies of humans.

The Zionist movement encouraged Jewish Europeans to emigrate to the areas now known as Israel or Palestine starting with the first Aliya in 1882 (IIRC). 

Following this, massive numbers of Jewish Europeans and Jewish Arabs then immigrated to the disputed area. After WW2 in particular many Jewish Europeans didn't want to stay in Europe any more (quelle surprise) and made their way to the place we like so much to discuss. 

One thing led to another and in 1948 Israel declared independence. 

The people who lived in the disputed land were, during this process evicted and usurped. These people are generally known as Palestinians but their name is not important. They lived in what is now Israel and the leaders of the immigrant communities had them kicked out and stole their land. 

When someone is the victim of a theft and they fight back, no one with even a rudimentary understanding of morality or ethics would label them the aggressor when they take action to remedy the injustice inflicted upon them. 

Ergo, the wars that Israel has been involved in since its inception, were wars of the invaded or their pals, compatriots or sympathisers against a foreign entity which inserted itself unjustly into the landscape. All ultimately provoked by the land thief's presence.

Germany is a famous nation-state (it only exists as a result of a nationalist endeavor), and it has a law that allows people of German descent to claim German citizenship - just like Israel and its law of return. The same goes for Greece, Hungary, Japan and so on. 

It *doesn't* mean that the minorities are automatically discriminated against, just like having a state religion (as is the case in most Scandinavian countries, the UK and Greece) doesn't mean an oppressive theocracy. Note that Israel has many laws protecting national minorities as well, a principle that was spelled out in its declaration of independence.

How retarded does this sound?

Way back in 1991 the Canadian government recognised that there was a crisis with cod stocks - a key species both for humans and the ecology of the Atlantic  - and imposed a total moratorium on cod fishing that exists to this day. The moratorium effectively wiped out a way of life for thousands of Canadian Atlantic fishermen, particularly in Newfoundland. 

In the meantime European nations, including Britain, have continued to fish cod and this has created the situation we're in now where we're seeing the near collapse of a species. 

Meanwhile, Newfoundland fisherman, who were fucking broke ass before the moratorium and are now among the poorest people in Canada (and have virtually no other means of support) go seal hunting every year to make a few bucks. I never said that was a good thing or related at all to fish stocks. But seals, while more cute and marketable than cod, are not endangered. Seals also rely on fish stocks to survive btw - so if we continue to fish out the ocean, they're fucked too. 

So what happens?

Every year hundreds of thousands of pounds are raised in the UK and outraged celebrities protest the Newfoundland seal hunt, but totally ignore their own government's unwillingness to step up and make the same sacrifices on cod fishing (along with restrictions on other fishing) that Canada has been making since 1991. 

There are many bad things in this world and lots to be said and debated about how we exploit nature for our own ends. But if you think the seal hunt in Newfoundland is a bigger, more important issue than the disappearance of cod, then you may be ... differently abled.

I still find it difficult to get used to different views on land-ownership in other countries, even when i'm at a close country like Denmark. Anyways, here it is:

""Ancient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm. Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years[1] and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right. A possible explanation as to why the right has survived mainly in these four countries is that feudalism and serfdom were not established there. Another factor is the survival of large areas of unenclosed forest. Elsewhere in Europe land was gradually enclosed for private use and enjoyment, with commoners' rights (for instance, rights to gather fuel or graze animals) largely eliminated.
Today these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking wildflowers, mushrooms and berries. However — with the rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage wildlife or crops.
Access rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden fires are allowed with proper safety precautions). Making noise is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a tent in the forest for one night is allowed, but not the use of a caravan. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as houses, gardens) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permit.""",True,t1_c2o82h1,,1427675426,,0,12,,todayilearned,t3_ky5ez,False,t3_ky5ez,c2o82h1,12,TheFlyingWalrus,0,0

&gt; ... - almost everyone in Europe speaks impeccable English.

No. Although it is true for many west European countries and the larger cities, there are still plenty of countries -- for example Hungary, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Italy, etc. -- where English really isn't that well spoken. But don't let it hold you back; most people are willing to make an effort, and books like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Point-Travellers-Language-Original-Dictionary/dp/3980880273) can ease your traveling every now and then.

&gt; Travel as light as you can, and take two credit/debit cards stored in separate locations - you can get cash from an ATM in almost every country.

This. Think twice about everything you put in your backpack. Is it inexpensive, easily bought, and you only expect to used it accidentally? Don't bother bringing it.


As for actually planning your travels: Why do you want to go to Europe? Are there particular countries, sights, events you want to visit? Are you mainly interested in culture or nature?

Well I'm not a really hardcore traveler, but I have been around the world five times on my own, and when I was a boy I spent quite a lot of time as a busker (violin) in various European countries.  I just think it's best to err on the side of caution, especially if traveling alone.  A backpacker meandering around in the middle of the night in a strange city is a pretty easy target for even the most amateur criminal.

Apologies if I am overcrediting the citizens of these countries for their language skills - but I was staying in Bulgaria recently and only met one person who didn't speak English - I guess I was in Sofia, and capital cities are usually quite cosmopolitan anyway - perhaps it would have been more difficult if I were in some isolated village - but why would I do that?

False,1317556471,t5_2qhvo,"&gt;  that most nations are born in 'sin', as ethno-colonial projects

I disagree with that. While I don't think ethno-states are an optimal solution, I don't think nationalism, by itself, is a ""sin"". It just flies against the modern American perception of what a society should be like, like many other things - like national ID cards, state religion or socialism. There are certainly modern, free nation-states, that are in many ways kinder to their minorities than nominally multicultural societies like the US or Australia.

I also disagree that the trend is towards multi-culturalism. Certainly, the European left-wing argues for that position, but there's recently a massive push against it from the right. You also can't ignore the influence by decidedly non-multicultural movements like political Islam -  both as a radicalizing force on the European right-wing, and as a anti-multicultural force within Europe's Muslim communities.

As it stands today, democratic multiculturalism is an extermely untested political philosophy. I'd go as far as saying that there's no true ""multicultural"" society today. Even the nominally-multicultural US is an English speaking, culturally European Christian state, and the main focus in its immigration policies during its existence was assimilation into the predominant culture rather than true multiculturalism.  

Personally, I think a global multicultural society is a great idea *once it has been proven and adopted by everyone*, but so far, it's just not the case. Germany in the Age of Enlightenment was a *great* place for Jews, if you catch my drift.

I guess you are trying to say, that Obama is a big spender, which would qualify him as a social democrat here, no? Now I am not well informed what your government has increased spending money on (I'm guessing the biggest bulk goes to the military, medicaid and medicare and social securityand I don't think Obama has either raised or cut spending on those substantially), but I am sure, that his public stance on welfare programms, social issues (maternity leave, gay marriage), his general stance on health care (I know this is difficult to compare, because our general sytem and ultimate goal of public health care is so fundamentaly different from yours in general (I know there are a lot of peole in the states, who would appreciate a european style of health care too), so he has to play with what he has at his hands)  would put him more in the category of the FDP (check out a short summary of their goals from the 2009 federal election http://www.deutschlandprogramm.de/files/1219/Wahl_engl.pdf) rather than the FDP. Now what I believe is possible, that in his heart he would like a more social democratic approach in the US, but due to the climate of US politics and the big donations he seems to receive from corporate America he can't go through on that

Maybe for comparison, here is a quick summary yof the social democrats from wikipedia:

Party platform

The SPD was established as a socialist party in 1875. However, the SPD underwent a major shift in policies reflected in the differences between the Heidelberg Program of 1925, which ""called for the transformation of the capitalist system of private ownership of the means of production to social ownership"",[2] and the Godesberg Program of 1959, which aimed to broaden its voter base and move its political position toward the centre.[3] After World War II, under the leadership of Kurt Schumacher, the SPD re-established itself as a socialist party, representing the interests of the working class and the trade unions. With the Godesberg Program of 1959, however, the party evolved from a socialist working-class party to a social-democratic party.

""The current party platform of the SPD espouses the goal of social democracy, which is seen as a vision of a societal arrangement in which freedom and social justice are paramount. According to the party platform, freedom, justice, and social solidarity, form the basis of social democracy. The coordinated social market economy should be strengthened, and its output should be distributed fairly. The party sees that economic system as necessary in order to ensure the affluence of the entire population. The SPD also tries to protect the society's disadvantaged with a welfare state. Concurrently, it advocates a sustainable fiscal policy that doesn't place a burden on future generations while eradicating budget deficits. In social policy, the SPD stands for civil and political rights in an open society. In foreign policy, the SPD aims at ensuring global peace by balancing global interests with democratic means. Thus, European integration is one of the main priorities of the SPD.""

Now the FDP sounds like it has a lot of republican rhetoric in it, but the only tax breaks they got after the election, was lowering one of the taxes of hotels from 18% to 9%, they received a huge backlash for that in the process. They are pushing for middle class tax cuts atm, which sounds like something obama would want to. the majority of germans are opposed to these tax breaks though, even though a lot of the middle class would benefit from them, because there is a fear of government taking on to much debt in these troubling times in europe. 
This comparison to Europe or a specific party is hard to make though, especially since in our multi-party system even opposed parties havee common ground they can agree on, so Obama might as well have something in common with almost any party here, but I think judging by his policies he would fit in best with the FDP",True,t1_c2o88b5,,1427675501,,0,2,,fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,t1_c2o86ee,True,t3_kxx9k,c2o88b5,2,[deleted],0,0

False,1317558364,t5_2qh0u,"The fiction is not that there aren't variations in the physical appearance of human beings, but that these variations are as a result of ""race"", particularly with regard to skin colour. In fact, studies have shown that there is a far greater degree of biological diversity between people in certain African countries than there is between Europeans and other Africans, meaning that skin colour as an indicator of human diversity is utterly irrelevant.

Biological diversity has far more to do with the environment that a particular tribe or society had to adapt to than the particular swathe of the globe they inhabit. A great example of this is the fiction that ""Africans"" are great distance runners, when in fact it is only one or two countries that produce great marathon runners, and those all come from tiny regions of those countries in which the environment has caused slight genetic divergence.

So, it can be seen that the premise of ""race"" simply doesn't stand up to scrutiny even when it comes to something as outwardly observable and measurable as physical appearance and ability. Why then would it come into play with something as infinitely more complex and nuanced like cognitive performance and personality? Short answer: it does not. There is no such thing as race.

As I said, the European right wing isn't the only anti-multicultural force. Political Islam is a similar force, that, unlike the European far-right, has literally billions of followers around the world, and millions in Europe itself. 

Personally, I feel that if the dominant political debate was democracy vs. monarchy, and then it was capitalism vs. communism, today's political debate is multiculturalism vs. nation states. 

As I said, I hope multiculturalism will win, but then again, if I was in 1917, I would hope communism to win too.  On the day when multiculturalism will prevail, there would be no need for *any country*, including Israel. But until it does, and most countries, including Israel's very non-multicultural neighbors  (unless you count the war-torn Lebanon, a veritable  cautionary tale against multiculturalism) fully adopt the multicultural philosophy instead of striving for cultural supremacy, Israel should be remain a nation-state.

TL;DR I think multiculturalism is a beautiful utopic idea, but Israel should be the *last* country to become multicultural (Jews being the most persecuted and hated ethnic group of all times), not the first.

False,1317559024,t5_6,"There are a few problems with this.

It used to be that if you wanted to learn a trade, you apprenticed yourself to a tradesman who would pay for your living while you learned. You would emerge with a trade, no debt, and the supply of people in that trade will tend to be coupled with demand for that trade. Anyone who wanted to move up, whatever their background, could find a living, and even have the opportunity to go into business for themselves.

Now you are expected to finance your own education, leaving you with debt that you have to pay back. You are incentified to find a ""safe,"" probably unfulfilling job because it's the safest way to pay down your debt (got a business idea? Too bad, you've got student loans to pay off and pursuing it means a chance of defaulting on your loans if you fail). Because everyone chooses their major, fulfilling fields are filled with people, driving wages down, and worse, there's no filter to keep people without a talent for the field from wasting their money. I know a colorblind guy who got a design degree. I work in audio production and see far too many people getting degrees for a field with very very few job opportunities.

To solve this, in my opinion, postsecondary education should be made free like it is in many european countries, and there should be more oversight over how selective trade degree programs are in order to couple the supply of candidates to the actual job market.

My other problem is that a huge chunk of jobs simply don't require postsecondary education, but a college degree is put on the requirements as an HR screen to narrow the candidate pool. You're not even going to college to learn anything, you're only going in order to get a piece of paper that says you're allowed to get a non minimum wage job!

Another problem is that many people don't grow up in environments which prepare them for college or really any life above poverty. Those people are screwed from the beginning.

What the whole 99% phenomenon is about, however, is the fact that a very small chunk of our population is allocated wealth not because they are personally exceptional, but rather because they had opportunities not available to anyone else. Paris Hilton is rich because she was born to the right family. Bill Gates is rich because he happened to have access to some of the first computers.

One thing that I noticed consistently is the tendency of the liberals (""pseudoseculars"") is to label anyone who defends Hindus as a Hindutva type and make liberal accusations linking them to the Nazis. As someone who has actually read a lot about European history around then, I find equating, say, Modi, to Hitler is more than ridiculous - it is malicious. If you look for pogroms, the closest one is in Pakistan, where the Hindu minority has been almost wiped out. This figure is in the millions and ranks more with Milosevic and Hitler and not Modi. But pointing this out is likely to make the Indian liberal groups label me a Hindutva guy - I don't really care, but it tells me something about the self-styled liberals themselves. It is natural for me to assume, perhaps wrongly,  that you are one of them.

To your question on why we should measure ourselves by the standards of the neighborhood, there is no other objective way, IMO. Whether we like it or not, the three, or actually four countries have a shared history and geography, and until 1947, allowed unrestrained diffusion of people. Actually, even with all that, were it not for geography, I'd agree with you.

In any situation involving adversaries, the one with the lowest standards of engagment sets the standards in the long run especially if one of the groups regards it as an existential struggle. So, I see the Hindutva movement as a reaction, which is why I think the best way to get rid of it is to make India truly secular, which excludes inanities like minorities having first dibs on the national resources, as Manmohan Singh said.

I'm a half-Cantonese, half-English American who's traveled to 36 different countries on 4 continents. In general, in Europe and North America, if I said I was American, people would just take it at face value. In Africa and Asia, I would get a lot of ""but you don't *look* like an American."" I've always found that to be really offensive, but you really can't go around being offended all the time, so I found ways to deal with it. My favorite way to deal with it in Africa would be to say ""Well, what does an American look like?"" They would usually say ""Well, Americans are white, right?"" - ""Well, what about our president?"" - ""...touché."" It was usually good for a laugh.

The thing is, in almost every country I've been, with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti, people tend to assume I'm local before anything due to my ambiguous ethnicity. I actually got a lot *less* negative attention in Russia than many of the white travelers because I looked like I fit in better than they did - I tended to dress more in the Russian style, and could easily be mistaken for someone from eastern Russia or one of the 'stans.

Sometimes, while traveling, I would get people saying ""Konichiwa!"" or ""Ni hau!"" or ""Anyong Haseo!"" to me on the street, but that was as far as it would go as far as trying to speak an Asian language with me. 

By the way, African-Americans stand out like sore thumbs in both Africa and Haiti, and Asian-Americans stand out equally strongly all over Asia. I think it's something to do with style of dress and style of interaction, but I can spot an American from across the road easily, and locals seem to be able to quickly figure out that someone clearly isn't 'from around here'.

And personally, I've *never* presented myself as anything but American, because I don't consider myself culturally Chinese nor English (more Californian or San Franciscan than any of the above, actually!) If you consider yourself Chinese, it's totally reasonable to present yourself as Chinese, but if you don't, I think it's a terrible thing to present yourself as such to try to avoid the 'American' treatment.

Now a real story time: my friend owns a big piece of land in the middle of nowhere, near one big lake. Area is surrounded by a line of trees (to stop cars from entering and ruining the soil, as there were lots of saplings planted) and there are gates at the only entrance. Now the area itself is just a plain field, then a steep slope covered in thick trees and then a little beach with benches and a table. We parked cars up at the top, unpacked, etc. We were several families with dogs (all German shepherds, 4 in total) and dogs immediately ran down the slope to the water. We then heard screams. WTF IS THAT was the first though, as there were no cars in the parking area and no signs of life whatsoever. We all ran down, saw three inflatable boats, some backpacks, three tents, table full of food and three young (20-something) girls standing on the table, screaming, while dogs were checking out the food supplies. So at first it looked a bit strange, three hot girls (Northern Europe, after all) traveling alone with so much stuff (all boats were quite spacious, enough to hold three people) without any guys, it just looked somehow unnatural. Also, why would anyone take a separate tent for each of them?

So, we took away the dogs, introduced each other, they got down off the tables, we all sat down and asked why are they traveling alone, after all there are some bad people sometimes. The answer came 20 minutes later. 

Now get this: they each were traveling with their boyfriends. However, when the guys saw the dogs coming, they just grabbed skewers and chicken wings off the grill and ran away into the forest, leaving the girls alone.

With a few notable exceptions (such as the UK and India), the only ""blue"" states are the colonial states, and I bet if you look into them, you'll see that they're largely controlled by a single (non-native) ethnic group - as is the case for the US.

&gt; The only thing that would change this is a another Holocaust, which will not happen

I find this statement incredibly naive. If you told a 19th-century emancipated German Jew about the Shoah, he would *never* believe you. It could only happen if we return to the Middle Ages, he'd say, and that would never ever happen in a modern country like Germany! Many kept this attitude right until they were shipped to Dachau.

And either way, a Holocaust is certainly *not* required to shift the tide back to the nation-state model. Just a simple shift in public opinion, perhaps followed by immigration reform, and that's it. 

&gt; Jewish critics of European pluralism make the kinds of arguments you do to justify not living in a formally secular, binational state in Israel/Palestine.

Whatever you might think about Europe, when we're talking about Israel/Palestine, we're talking about the *Middle East* - a fiercely nationalistic collection of ethno-religious states, that happen to hate Israel and Israelis more than anything else in the world. If Israel becomes a binational state it would either become an Arab state with a hated Jewish minority, or (much more likely) it will turn into another war-torn Lebanon/Iraq/Yugoslavia.",True,t1_c2o97r2,,1427675965,,0,3,,Israel,t1_c2o91uv,True,t3_ky6g6,c2o97r2,3,nidarus,0,0

 * Hitchhiking - only in some countries, only for some routes, not recommended for girls traveling alone
 * [Car pooling](http://www.mitfahrzentrale.de/index.php?landnr=D&amp;lang=GB)

&gt;&gt;He has no problem with the UN being merely a forum for talks.

&gt;Wrong again, he is against the UN because he wants US to declare its own wars and not ask the UN for permission.

How about you quote my entire excerpt instead of quoting the first half out of context:

&gt;He has no problem with the UN being merely a forum for talks. **What he has a problem with is countries invading and attacking other countries under UN authority.**

Paul is the most anti-war representative in Congress.

&gt;&gt;Because people who come into the country illegally shouldn't be rewarded with citizenship for their children.

&gt;So the Constituion is icky because you don't like some of its outcomes!

The constitution can be amended! Do you support amending the constitution to improve the laws. I'm guessing not. I'm guessing you're just making excuses for opposing this rational move, because you actually support more illegal immigration.

In any case, the 14th amendment actually states that any one born within the JURISDICTION of the US becomes a citizen. This exempted those born to foreign diplomats, as their parents were under the jurisdiction of a foreign nation while being on US soil, and under this legal reasoning, this would exempt those born to parents in the US illegally.

&gt;&gt;He's not for the gold standard.

&gt;Right, he just want metals to be legal tender!

Did you watch the clip I linked? He wants ANY currency to be legal to use:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50kXVg3lGgc#t=1m55s

He recently introduced the [""The Free Competition in Currency Act of 2011""](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1098:)

Read it for yourself. You can see that it does not discriminate on what currency should be legal to use. It states that ALL currencies should be legal.

&gt;&gt;human activity probably does play a role in stimulating the current fluctuations.The question is: how much? Rather than taking a “sky is falling” approach

&gt;Typical right wing strawman, seen it many many times. First trivialize the whole thing as 'probably' when there is tons of evidence and then accuse the other group of a 'chicken littles' because of their concern exceeds what right-wingers prefer.

So because he doesn't panic like you, it's a straw man? 

Unlike you, he realize that there's more than a few oil companies with a vested interest in what position politicians and the public take on global warming, and know there are companies that stand to make BILLIONS of dollars, in things such as carbon trading, if new spending programs and regulations are instated to 'combat global warming'.

Just because you jump on every PC band wagon that comes along to try to gain peer approval, and have total intolerance to any views that slightly deviate from popular opinion, doesn't mean every one else is as lacking of integrity and independent-mindedness as you.

&gt;&gt;His position on abortion is far more nuanced

&gt;It's not, its very straightforward.

No, it's highly nuanced, as the interview segment I linked showed. You're an intolerant hack though, so you're not willing to listen any view points from someone on the other ""side"".

&gt;""In Congress, I have authored legislation that seeks to define life as beginning at conception, H.R. 1094. I am also the prime sponsor of H.R. 300, which would negate the effect of Roe v Wade by removing the ability of federal courts to interfere with state legislation to protect life.""

Right, and he's also written:

http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul301.html

&gt;So while Roe v. Wade is invalid, a federal law banning abortion across all 50 states would be equally invalid.

Not that any of this matters for you. You filter out any thing that contradicts your ridiculous caricature of all GOPers, and only focus on the tidbits that fit your stereotype.

&gt;&gt;It reduces the amount of investable capital there is in the economy, thus reducing wage growth.

&gt;Total bullshit, look up actual wage growth and compare it to income tax rates, you would see a pretty contrary picture.

You fucking idiot, there is a very strong correlation between low taxes/spending and high economic growth.

http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/function.htm#VIII

The evidence presented in this paper provides an alternative explanation: Increases in the size of government have slowed economic growth. Our findings raise several questions for those who adhere to the view that the recent growth declines were inevitable. First, if the falling growth rates were merely a reflection of the secular decline of mature economies, why did the growth rates of the countries with the largest expansions in government decline the most? (See [Exhibit 6](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-6.gif).) Second, if size of government does not matter much, how does one explain the persistent negative relationship between size of government (and its change) and the growth of GDP for both high-income democracies and a diverse set of countries including both industrial nations and LDCs? (See Exhibits [4](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-4.gif), [5](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-5.gif), [7](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-7.gif), and [8](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-8.gif).) Why did the economies of Ireland, United Kingdom (in the 1980s), and more recently, New Zealand reverse course and achieve higher growth rates when government expenditures were reduced as a share of GDP? (See [Exhibit 9](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-9.gif).) If size of government is unimportant, why do all of the world's fast-growing economies have governments of modest size? (See [Exhibit 10](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/exh-10.gif).) In contrast with the OECD nations, why is there no trend toward the expansion in the size of government among the rapid-growth economies?

&gt;While the rest of the world is booming, Europe lags behind. France, Germany and Italy are stagnating, and so do Denmark, Sweden and Finland. All gained less than 44% prosperity from 1984 to 2004.

&gt;""Big government"" is the main cause of Europe's weak performance. The oversized Public Sector lacks productivity and the growing bureaucracy is undoing the productivity gains of the Private Sector, eradicating all of its outstanding performance and productiveness.

Socialism doesn't work. You don't make a country prosperous through pansy welfare programs.

&gt; 'well its not in the contitution so fuck individual rights', go back to regressive states and lobby hardcore extremists to change their view but leave me alone!

He swore an oath to uphold the constitution, which means he must respect it, even when he disagrees with how a state is using its constitutional rights!

You prefer politicians to break their oath to the constitution when it's convenient for your agenda, not realizing the harm this causes to every one by reducing the authority of all constitutional protections.

When the constitution is ignored, as a result of people like you calling on politicians to break their oath to it, the result is the current situation of the federal government criminalizing marijuana, denying people Habeas Corpus, conducting warrantless wire-tapping, and engaging in decade long wars.

Paul's position is the constitutional one: that states are allowed to enact bad laws, like criminalizing sodomy or marijuana, and that the federal government should end its war on drugs and war on terror.

This is the only realistic chance a nation has. Giving all power over to the federal government will give you some things you want, like legalized sodomy, but it will also lead to things like the War on Drugs where states aren't able to legalize marijuana.

There's no way to have an all powerful federal government and guarantee it won't use its power to reduce liberty, because other people's ideas of what freedom and rights are will differ from yours. 

At least with 50 independent states, you will always have some that afford people freedom.

False,1317571771,t5_6,"Thanks for the compliment! I will definitely be playing as much as possible if I study in Australia. At my old college I ran the open mic on campus, it was awesome. I'd kill (not literally) to do that again. One of the best experiences of my life, even though it only lasted a few short months.

It's good to know I can abuse my American accent to get girls. That coupled with the ability to sing... yeah, I'm gonna be rolling in women. Just kidding, of course. I'd feel terribly shallow if I did that, though I do know several people who use their music as a tool... but it's disgusting to me.

When I went to Europe it was winter, early December to mid January. I traveled alone so I spent Christmas and New Years all by myself, which was really really sad, but a good experience overall. Almost everyone I met was Australian, though I also met some English people, a lot of Brazilians, and a bunch of other people from random places. I only ran into two other Americans, one was a study abroad student about to finish up and go home and the other was a marine on leave from Afghanistan. He was a really cool guy, though I think everyone was a bit afraid of him because he was huge, ripped, and covered in tattoos.

In my conversations with Australians it seems like it's almost a rite of passage to go to Europe after graduating from university. In America it's rare for people to travel, let alone for long periods of time or by themselves, but a lot of the people I met were doing just that. It helps that you have a higher income in Australia than is typical here for people that age and, at the moment at least, a great conversion rate into USD/Euros. I wish more Americans would travel abroad, it really makes you appreciate what we have here. When I was in Amsterdam, alone and really homesick, I saw this giant American flag flying over the embassy and almost cried. I'd never been patriotic until that moment, and after coming home I was much more in love with America than I ever was before. Anyone can set foot on American soil and be American, there's no lineage or ethnicity to keep them out like in other countries. You're just part of it as soon as you start working. Once you're a citizen, you're equal to everyone else from the poorest to the richest of our population. Granted, the system is corrupt in a lot of ways, but it's based on something that doesn't exist anywhere else.

I think Australia is becoming similar with so many immigrants coming in, though I don't exactly know how your government works. Still, the influx of Chinese and SE Asians is crazy to see, plus the boost your economy is getting because of it is absurd. I have a feeling lot of really cool stuff will be coming out of Australia, y'all are just getting started. You're even younger than America, and we're pretty young.

Anyway, I'm 23, still in college even though I should have been finished two years ago if I'd done things properly. Right now I'm looking for a school that will offer me enough money to afford it (most schools are 20-30k USD a year around here) and a study abroad program in Australia. I found one that offers me a good program in Aus but is expensive... yet still close enough to me that I can just take the train there... Ugh, decisions, decisions. I also still gotta decide which uni to go to in Australia, which is tricky because I know nothing about it, and then even trickier is finding a place to live... I'm sure I'll work it all out! I have a friend who goes to Newcastle and said she could help me out, but at the same time I don't really know if that's the best school for me.

If your parents live in Singapore, how did you end up coming back to Australia? What's your educational goal like right now?

(This is a great conversation by the way)

False,1317572794,t5_2qio8,"With dps'ing, gearing has a large importance but most of your performance is dependant on the fight itself. But at least 50% of tanking is preparation: gearing and prior knowledge of the fight.

Firstly, make sure your gear is up to scratch. Look up how you should be gearing your bear, especially how you gem and reforge. I've got a bear tank myself(http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/argent-dawn/Gennson/advanced) and have gone with agi and dodge, which is what Elitiskjerks recommended. (there are other ways to gear, like going for more mastery/crit for more absorbs, or chucking some stam gems/trinkets in). It might be worth linking your armory as we might be able to give some pointers.

After that, you should look the boss strategies so you know what to expect, and you said that you've already done that. I'm personally of fan of boss videos by omfgcata: http://www.youtube.com/user/OMFGcata#g/c/2204DFCEB9EDEF59 he explains the fights and how to deal with them in a nice manner.

Finally, the only thing you can do is jump into it. Try out BH as your first raid boss, and multi-tank fight. It's pretty simple for the tanks, just a tank switch every 20 seconds or so. When you're not tanking the boss don't do more than melee the boss to make sure that you don't overaggro, I'd recommend slowly building up lacerate so you can put a fresh pulverize up just before you take the boss back.
There is one fancy thing that you can do to help out on the occu'thar fight. If Eyes of Occu'thar spawn while the other tank has the boss, you can switch to cat form and pounce onto the stack of eyes and do a few swipes to help with the aoe. Then run back into position to take the boss back. Perhaps only try this when you're a bit more comfortable with tanking though.

False,1317574255,t5_6,"&gt;""The fastest wage growth in history"" is incredibly misleading. It had a lot to do with people actually making a wage as opposed to growing and killing everything they need themselves,

It had nothing to do with that. It wasn't a shift from hunter-gatherer to industrial society. There were wages before the Gilded Age, and they were much higher by the end of the Gilded Age. It was because capital, which means equipment used in production, was produced rapidly in that era.

&gt; and even more to do with the obscene profits had by a tiny portion of the population.

Wages for UNSKILLED labor doubled in that era. It wasn't just concentrated at the top.

Industrialists getting wealthy is GOOD. It's not a zero sum game. The more capital there is, the more every one benefits.

&gt; Then as now, it did not trickle down.

More socialist talking points. Wages doubled in that era for unskilled labor, yet you lie and claim it didn't trickle down.


&gt;Of course compared to TODAY, the absolute standard of living was horrible, but that can hardly be blamed on too much laissez faire.
Compared to the agrarian lifestyle from fifty years prior it was horrible.

No it wasn't you ignorant moron. Life expectancy improved dramatically during the Gilded Age.

&gt;The fact that more labor is needed to perform a job does not make said labor any less valuable. It also does not follow that, because we are more productive now by virtue of modern technology that our wages will be higher.

Yes it does.

&gt; Recent history has disproved that notion.

There has been no great increase in productivity in the recent past. It's just government manipulated numbers and asset price inflation artificially increasing GDP numbers. Real productivity has languished under the crushing weight of government management of the economy at the expense of the market.

&gt;The thing about living in Hong Kong, though, is that their cost of living is astronomically high while their median income is less than half that of Connecticut and only two-thirds of that in the United States in general. 

Yet their purchasing power parity GDP has increased faster than any other country in the world over the last 50 years, and they currently have higher life expectancy than every Western nation with a population of 0.1 million.

Wages continue to rise rapidly in Hong Kong, while they're stagnant in the pansy socialism loving West.

&gt;So what you see there is an obscenely wealthy upper class and a general populace composed of low-income wage slaves. Gilded Age indeed.

More ignorant talking points that are contradicted by the statistics on Hong Kong's socioeconomic indicators.

&gt;Singapore is in a similar situation with huge economic growth and an impoverished people.

Singapore's supposedly impoverished people are seeing rapid wage growth, a very wealthy and large middle class, and a higher life expectancy than every major European nation.

And this is a nation that only 60 years ago was a third world nation.

Free markets work to increase prosperity. Socialism destroys prosperity.

&gt;&gt;Many successful people today are moving to Singapore because taxes are low there, and the government isn't running a massive deficit.

&gt;People are moving to Singapore for jobs.

Taxes are a necessary part of a vibrant city. Look at cities and states with little to no taxes and see how well they're doing? I recall a road trip through NJ, Penn, and the like and though the low taxes was great for my little shopping trip, the city was in ruins and not a place I'd like to live.

I understand the fear of overtaxation as well as the problems associated with heavy socialist policies. Just look at most of Europe and you can see the problems they are facing. But many countries have struck a balance between the American Model and the more Socialist Model of places like France, Greece, etc. Canada, for one is doing great. So is Germany. Many Nordic countries aren't doing too poorly either. I would argue the overall quality of life in those countries is above the average quality of life in the US -- which I personally believe is because of the high level of taxation.

The rich fail to realize taxation is a good thing, especially for the rest. There's nothing more dangerous to the rich than poor disenfranchised people with nothing to lose. Taxation tips the balance a little bit to help those in need, and without that, the rich can expect a populace that will eventually just have enough.

I contacted Ari Goldberger from Esqwire.com and he did a no win no fee defence of my position and negotiation of any sale. (I got $15,000 dollars for something I paid $20 for and it was just as easy for me to register a new domain....happy days). There are three things that the big corporation needs to prove to accuse you properly of domain name squatting and they have to prove ALL THREE. In your case you are sorted if you can prove that you have been using the domain name for a legitimate reason (which you say you have been doing for some time anyway) so your position should be easy to defend. The big corp just tries (as they did with me) to bully me off my property with lots of legal bullshit and accusations that had no foundation. They also had someone contact me from somewhere in Norway or Denmark first, pretending to be a single person entity just looking to buy that domain for a $100 as I ""obviously"" wasn't using it.

Anyway....the main advice is STOP ALL COMMUNICATION with them as they know infinitely more about this area than you and you could wind up falling for a nicely laid trap. Instead, get your self an internet lawyer who will take a fee to negotiate the sale...if I remember the fee was about 30%. If you really just want to keep the domain name then you'll properly have to spend a few hundred dollars with a lawyer defending your rights but if you are using it for business then it's worth it. The lawyer (from the way you describe it) should have a pretty easy job to do. I don't know the exact contents of these types of legal interactions but I know a very good non-legal way of paraphrasing you particular stance would be: ""Fuck Off and don't bother me again.....you have no rights to my property.""

It's a wonderful city in the winter and summer, in the autumm and spring it doesn't have the same magic touch to it. During the summer, you can for example go to the central parts and have a dive in the water. In the winter, it's like a winter wonderland, I have a bias towards this, since I love christmas. It's a great city if you like to spend your time outdoors with many parks and even forests close to the city centre.

Since it's the capital of Sweden it's popular for tourists aswell as musical performers, there are many bars and other venues of entertainment, one of these are sports, Stockholm has a wide variety of sportsteams so if you like Football it's a good place to be, or any of the more local sports. If you're into drinking and going to clubs I'd say that Swedish taxes are rather high, and we have an monopoly on alcohol so spirits and beer can be rather expensive and limited opening hours on both the liqour-store and the nightclubs/bars.

You can get around the city without a car, and biking has seen an upswing in recent years, the subways, trains, busses and trams all go for about 80£ a month and it's possible to go around the city at night with busses and the subway (the subway 24/7 on weekends)

Lingustically speaking, the English and Swedish language are related, and syntactically simililar. The grammar is much more simple than any Romance language and German; However it can be rather hard to learn, since most people will speak English with you. But you can go on evening courses to learn the language (svenska för invandrare) if you're interested.

If you're planning to go to the univeristy of Stockholm, where I'm currently studying, we are about 50 000 people strong, with many exchange students from all over the world, and many activites where you can get to know people. The student union even has a mentor program where exchange students apply to have someone from Stockholm showing them around the city.

Did you write that with a condescending smirk? I bet you did.

Peace in Europe was established by the US-Soviet occupation of Germany, followed by the establishment of NATO to resist the *actual* imperialist (read: annexing) tendencies of the Soviet Union thereafter. Or did you not notice that the USSR annexed Eastern Europe while the US had a hands-off approach with Western Europe, fostering national sovereignty and regional peace? When did US tanks crush a European political movement? Both of these, along with the massive injection of US capital into Europe via the Marshall Plan, allowed European countries to recollect themselves after the massive and idiotic self-inflicted wounds of World Wars I and II. The US maintained a military presence in Europe at the request of European leaders, who, after -- and I can't emphasize this enough -- the *massive fucking boondoggle* of World War II could barely feed their people, let alone assure their security.

All of this allowed for the blossoming of great political institutions like the EEC and the EU; French (and thus other Western European) support for both was garnered via populist Gaullist anti-Americanism (itself predicated upon maintaining *actual French imperialism* around the world). So, the US served (and still serves) as a very important bugbear in that sense. Whether we're your friend or the Great Satan, we seem to be doing you good!

To your assumptions that I am somehow brainwashed or suckling at the teat of state propaganda, I say: get over yourself.

The US would close any European military installation at the request of a national government; to do otherwise would instigate an international crisis. The thing is, that hasn't happened yet. Why? Hint: it's not because the US is mean.

*News dude:* In the United Kindom, Shariah tribunals act side by side with British law. The islamic councils are approved by the government but critics fear violations of human rights occur. Our team in London gained access to the inside of one of these islamic councils where terror convicts and illegal islamic organizations operate behind the curtains.

00:27 _Report starts_

00:33 _English_ 

00:41 *Voice over:* London. A pulsating, inclusive city in Europe. Here there's freedom of expression and freedom of religion. 

00:57 He calls this a court and he calls himself a judge. This is one of at least 85 functioning Sharia courts in the United Kingdom. There are probably many more and reports suggest the numbers are rapidly. 

01:17 He shows us examples of sentences he has given. There are religious marriages and divorces which are not binding according to British law. They may be inheritance settlements and family feuds where a decision demands that the parties agree. Many muslims wish to live by islamic rules. That is what the Sharia courts are meant to give advice for.

01:42 There are no formal requirements to the judge's qualifications but he has to know the Quran.

01:47 _English_

01:59 Most muslims don't even know that the Sharia courts exist.

02:03 _English_

02:11 But they exist, and the human rights organization ""One law for all"" is worried.

02:16 _English_

02:22 There are different kinds of Sharia councils or tribunals, often spoken of as courts. 

02:29 _English_

02:34 Freedom of religion is an important principle. The jews have for many years had their religious councils. The Sharia councils are not part of British law but are approved as long as they do not violate British law. But who checks that?

02:50 _English_

03:15 On a street corner in one of London's most diverse boroughs the NRK find the community around Anjem Choudary's Shariah court. Here, audience are mustered up for tonight's meeting. They shall be given help to find the meaning of life.

As the sun sets we tag along back to the basement that acts as a Sharia court. The community's Sharia judge has the following message for young, seeking muslims:

03:48 _English_

04:05 They are few and have little power but wish to enact geographic Sharia zones in the United Kingdom. Among the speakers to night is a convicted terrorist. 

04:18 _English_ 

04:35 The west is the enemy. Only God's law applies, we're told tonight. The next day the same location acts as a court and one of the speakers as judge. 

04:48 _English_

05:17 Anjem Choudary led the group ""Al Muhajiroun"" which was deemed illegal last year. Now he runs ""Muslims against crusades"". Since 1999, 24 people in his circles have been convicted of islam-inspired terrorism. That is the man who interprets Islams holy scriptures and tell people right from wrong.

05:39 _English_

06:28 When 1,000 British muslims were asked in a poll whether they wanted that United Kingdom should obey Sharia, 280 -- more than one in four -- answered 'yes.' But the majority does not want that.

06:45 _English_

07:00 The government did want to be interviewed by the NRK for this report, but says that it is out of the question to make the Sharia laws part of British law. 

07:10 _English_

07:35 *Newsdude:* Gry Blekastad Almås, how extreme are these councils -- or courts -- when you look at them as a whole?

*Newschick:* My impression is that the community we have described in this report is among the more extreme. There certainly are councils in many nuances, and there is absolutely reason to believe that there also are councils that act how they were supposed to: as councils for muslims who want to live my muslim rules in a western society; in the United Kingdom. 

*Newsdude:* But if a part of them operate within British law, how can they still be problematic?

*Newschick:* The problem is how they are understood by those who use these councils. Are they understood as councils? Then it's probably not a problem. But are they understood as rules that one has follow regardless of what British law says outside these courts then it may be problematic. For example, we know that marriages and divorces are ""performed"" [Couldn't think of a better word]. They are not valid according to British law; only within the confines of Islam. That may be problematic. The same applied to inheritance settlements, for instance. WE know that by islamic rules women shall inherit less than their brothers. And one has to ask oneself, is is ok that these courts agree that women return to their violent husbands, for instance, where this happens without the husbands facing British courts?

*Newsdude*: Can you try to quickly explain why the debate is almost non-existant?

*Newschick:* It as been striking during working on this case how we've tried to get people to state their opinions on this matter. We have tried the government at the ministry of justice; we've tried the opposition via spokesmen for politics regarding law and justice. We've also tried moderate muslims.

As for destinations in St. Petersburg (I'm currently studying here), the one place I'd recommend is called Пивная Карта (pEEvnaya kArta).  Most of the week it's a beer store where you can get a lot of stuff from Europe that is unavailable most everywhere else in Russia (grimbergen, spitfire ale), but on Friday, they open a room upstairs that functions as a bar ... Actually, there's this other place called Dicken's, which is a british style beer garden - might be worth checking out, but it's not exactly Russian per se.  Lastly, you should definitely try Kvass.  It's like... well, semi-beer of sorts.  Fermented, but only slightly alcoholic.  

One important thing to keep in mind is that it's a LOT cheaper (we're talking just over a dollar for a decent beer) to buy in stores rather than restaurants.  The only thing is, it's illegal to drink in public, which IS enforced if you look foreign.  

The only other thing to remember is that разливное (razlEEvnayeh) means draft/on tap!

False,1317577539,t5_2qqjc,"&gt;Compared to what's happening in the rest of Europe and America, Scandinavia is doing fantastically.

That depends on what you measure. Growthwise and financially speaking, you're mistaken. Scandinavia is by no measure to be counted among Spain, Greece or Portugal, but ""doing fantastically"" is streching it quite a bit. The baltic countries, however... :)

Regarding healtcare, that wasn't my point, so please forgive me my inaccuracy. I have nothing against universal healthcare, and you don't need a Scandinavian welfare model to have that, by the way.

My critique was aimed at the huge percentages of the workforces in the nordic countries, that are living off state pensions. 

Not working is heavily subsidized - the difference in net income between social pensions and a lower class salary is virtually nonexistant. Without incentive to work, fewer will work - and that's what you're seeing right now across all of Scandinavia. The amount of people not working, being fed via tax payer money, has been rising steadily since the 1970s. In Denmark, the number of people earning and paying taxes in the private sector, was outnumbered by pensioneers and state employees in 2010: half of the workforce is now supporting the other half, and the percentage of private sector employed is countinously dwindling, as the majority votes for more and more benefits from the public sector. There are important differences between the nordic countries, but this effect was what I meant in my original post.

Setting a scene isn't the easiest thing to do since trees have such a wide range of smells, but I think the folks that describe a forest are on the right track, definately a lot of 'brightness' 'alive' 'natural' and 'green' apects to the colour scene. 

 I guess I imagine the differences as changes in weather and growth within that 'forest'; live, growing trees have a very fresh bright aroma that you could think of like a wild open mountain meadow with tall grasses on a breezy spring day with the sun shining brightly, mildly pungent stuff is more of a 'stillness' like a pool of light in a forest glade of evergreens, and the strongest pungent stuff is like taking shelter in a swampier, jungle like forest on a gloomy rainy day when the air feels so thick and heavy you can almost taste it.  

 If there's a woman in the scene she's wandering through the forest with you, sometimes pressing close, sometimes running away and hiding behind the trees laughing and smiling the whole time.  She's a natural looking American blonde with green eyes in faded blue jeans and a loose half unbuttoned flannel shirt for sativas, for heavier indicas, picture a gorgeous brunette with deep dark eyes, European features with thick natural eyebrows and a sultry, sexy look in her dark eyes, dressed in a loose summer dress and walking barefoot.   

Sorry about the bum nose.. hope that helps fill the gap somehow.

EDIT: There's also a citrus-y overtone to a lot of trees, dunno how to reflect that, but maybe the brunette is feeding you an orange and the blonde has a picnic basket with lemon merangue pie?

Western culture is succeeding because or infant mortality rates are on the decline, our life expectancy is on the incline, and we are developing technology that will help asure the survival of the human race once the planet can no longer sustain us. (as well as strength and power relative to other cultures, survival of the fittest, etc) 

Native Americans didn't have a successful culture. They were destroyed by the Alpha culture of Westernized Europe.

I'm sorry for offending you by saying ""you are so unbelievably ignorant.""

But, lets get down to brass tacks: You said ""You are arguing that they should be forced into our way of life, which is failing""

Then you flip-flopped your answer by saying ""To a degree, I don't believe in success or failure, or I don't believe in TOTAL success or TOTAL failure, I believe there is constantly a shifting balance between the two.""

**So which is it? Do believe westernized culture failing or succeeding? If so, why?**

I tend to think that a successful culture is one that can overcome the aggression of other cultures. (survival of the fittest) The only reason you are where you are is because of western culture. The only reason you live as long as you do is because of westernized medicine. The only way you can talk to me now is because of westernized technology. For proof that westernized culture is succeeding,go to a library. check out a book. Learn. Develop. Create. Live. Breath. Be Free. 

If you think western culture is failing, that also means that you think Democracy, Socialism, Capitalism, Liberty, and Technology are failing. 

Just about all cultures in the world today have been influenced by western culture in one way or another. (except for aborigines and the like, which have to fight to survive every day)

**I would like to know why you think western culture is failing?**

""I am concerned with how humans are given free food by nature and how they no longer have that option and have to buy food""

What? This doesn't even make sense. All food comes from nature. None of it is ""free"" Even when I go and pick berries from a forest, I still had to ""work"" for my food by finding and picking the berries. If I decide to milk a cow, and then trade the milk for berries, then I have just paid for the berries with milk. And they still came from nature. There is no such thing as ""free."" The only difference is that I have converted once type of work into another type of work via trade.

One of the reasons westernized culture is successful in feeding its people is because it has employed a very efficient system for trading goods and services. It's called currency. (And if you think currency is failing, idk what to tell you. )

The earth has enough food to feed Africans. (There is so much food in America, that they actually PAY farmers to NOT grow food) It's just that there is not enough food IN AFRICA for them to feed themselves.

Who told you that there was such a thing as ""free food?""

UMP and Sarkosy are highly criticized, for not holding the promises at the last elections, for being a pro-corporate government, for leaning towards extreme-right on the questions of immigration/security and what have you. It is currently highly fragmented on in the inside due to the recent Karachi affair, which might or might not involve Sarkosy in a corrupted campain scheme involving weapon sales. 

Extreme Right is stronger than ever but will never win that presidential race, they hold strong on a solid 20% of the population, but the other %80 would rather be fucked in the ass by an elephant than be under their governance. So no worries there, it makes a lot of noise, but it's rather harmless. Their platform is to go with the flavour of the month.

On the left side and the PS, the arrest of DSK in May shuffled the deck, and Francois Hollande came out ahead. This guy is the ex-husband of Segolene Royal, famous herself for losing the 2007 presidential race against Sarkosy, he was one of our laughing stock, and he suddenly blossomed into a serious candidate (and lost god knows how many pounds in the process), he rides all the polls, talk about come back on life. He is closely followed by Martine Aubry for the left primaries though, and a 3rd runner up appeared in the name of Arnaud Montebourg, with a speech oriented towards deglobalization.

Things are just getting started, we are rather certain Hollande will represent the left, but for the right side, it's very unclear, even though they all insist on Sarkosy, it doesn't seem sustainable as he is beaten by everyone and their grandmother in the polls. Wait and see.

I thought it was a decent picture!  :P   I'm sorry if you've had tough times on OKC yourself, but you shouldn't make such sweeping generalizations about me.  Nothing is a bigger turnoff for me than the idea of ""hunting for sex"" or whatever; I'm a relationship man through and through, and if I one day get sex out of it, then so much the better.  I guess I'm looking for something like what an old married couple have: a trusting bond, friendship, and intimacy, and if there's sex too, then that's just peachy.  If a lady's not gonna reply to me 'cause she shallow enough to judge me on my photo alone, then I'm glad she's not in my life.  

I do go out and try to do things IRL as well, but I've been doing this for... I dunno, six years now in university alone, and my success rate has been less than admirable (and that includes my stints in Europe and Japan.  *Japan*, for christ's sake, where I couldn't get a GF!  Lots of friends, but no GFs).  That's not to say that I'm some sort of social pariah or anything, it's more like ""god damn, do I *ever* have the knack for finding girls already in relationships or aren't really that attractive to me or only want to be friends with me!  Pretty awesome to know that I'm still a social enough guy to be around, though!""  I guess aiming for girls with quality is part of the problem because a lot of other guys are aiming there too.  

And it's cool to be friends with girls!  There's nothing I like better than knowing that I have people to talk to or trade class notes with or whatever.  But after a while, you start to think ""you know, as much as it's awesome to have all these friends, I need something more.""  And that's where the need for a GF comes in.  

So, after all these years of having a heck of a lot of time on my hands and being by myself, I thought ""Well, you can't be worse off than before in the GF department, so why not hoist a flag and see what happens?""  I'm not magically expecting a miracle, but still, the thought of having a girlfriend or SO in my life is too tempting not to at least TRY this kind of thing on top of what I do IRL.  I'm a good man, and I deserve the happiness of having a good relationship someday, and I am trying to achieve that.  Might not be soon (and it probably won't be), but goddamnit, I am going to *try!*

yes.  yes it did turn out that way.  you are full of shit, and you are a cowardly liar.  look inward to see if I'm not wrong.  you do you, and stop worrying about how you line up with everyone else.  because if you invest all of your energy into getting FREE SHIT while spending none of it on improving your personal lot in life, soon you will desperately realize that it is too late for the latter, and you will begin to get violent about the former, having put all your eggs in the wrong fucking basket.

False,1317582328,t5_2ryd5,"&gt;My issue with this statement is the assumption you bring to ancient Israeli culture from the New Testament. It's an issue that's at the very core of Christianity's understanding of the Old Testament: that God has this overarching plan that, even though the Jewish writers weren't aware of, is seeded with clues throughout the Old Testament, only to be fully revealed in the first century.

I'm glad you agree on that point.  Moving on... 

&gt;more, it is very clear that god could not have executed such a document

I would disagree entirely.  How is it clear?  Maybe its clear to you because you list an example of Deut. 23:3.  I don't find the problem in this at all.  Don't take my word for it though, let me quote John Gill's commentary: 

&gt;for the Jews restrain this to men, because it is, as Aben Ezra observes, an Ammonite, not an Ammonitess, a Moabite, not a Moabitess; they allow that females of those nations might be married to Israelites, that is, provided they were proselytesses, as Ruth was.  

He uses this as his source: Misn. Yebamot, c. 8. sect. 3.  

I don't find that these ""issues"" are being ignored at all, except if you don't look them up and then you are choosing to point a finger at the Bible without all the facts.  I would even count this example of yours less of man's agenda and a perfect example of God's agenda for Christ.  

Going back to Platonic Dualism I will requote myself: 

&gt;Platonism compromises God's aseity (self-existence) and undermines the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo by positing beings which are self-existent and uncreated by God. It implies a sort of metaphysical pluralism according to which God is not the ground of being for everything other than Himself.

Now let me reemphasize again.  I disagree entirely with the Platonic Dualism and Platonic Metaphysics because God is the source of everything.  There is no idea that exists before God.  There is no idea that God is not the source of.  

Now concerning Jews and Hell.  I would disagree with you.  [See Gehenna](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=115&amp;letter=G&amp;search=hell#344).  I will quote a line or two from this link

&gt;It is assumed in general that sinners go to hell immediately after their death.

Then a few lines down: 

&gt;They are cast into Gehenna to a depth commensurate with their sinfulness. They say: ""Lord of the world, Thou hast done well; Paradise for the pious, Gehenna for the wicked"" ('Er. 19a).

Also you claim ""no soul"" but claim ""Platonic Dualism"".  I don't think you understand what this means at all.  One of the four tenants of Platonic Dualism is [the indestructibility of the soul](http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/pom/pom_platonism.htm).  So you see where I'm confused at your claims?  

Now onto the Nicaea Council and the canon of the Bible.  You claim: 

&gt;They are responsible for the canon of texts you consider sacred

I disagree.  They didn't discuss the canon at all. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea#The_Biblical_Canon) 

Now onto the church under Constantine.  

&gt;The rest of Christian history is heavily marred by politics through the rest of european history to this day, I don't see why it should be separated under Constantine.

This is like saying all carrots today are orange and therefore all carrots have only ever been orange.  That is not an absolute.  What do we know?  The church was willing to defy government and rebel to spread the gospel for centuries.  Now you say that one call from Constantine and they are bedfellows?  Not likely.  After seeing their families, homes, and bodies destroyed by the government now they are going to assist the government in keeping things under control?  Seems far fetched to me.  

TL:DR  If you don't look up scripture and try to understand it then you are ignoring it.  There is nothing metaphysical without God therefore Platonic in the metaphysical sense is wrong.  The Jewish people had a concept of Hell and an afterlife with a soul.  The Nicaea council had nothing to do with the canon of the Bible.

False,1317584064,t5_2qi58,"I begrudgingly fall into the Wenger out brigade, but I can justify it as far as I'm concerned. 

I first heard the Wenger out grumblings about two/three years ago and I dismissed it as nonsense. I saw it as the natural dip brought on by the stadium move and all the resulting financial upheaval. At that point I was willing to give the manager all my support as I truly believed he was the best man for the job (the job being steering a team through a rough patch with limited resources) until we started seeing returns on the investment.

Fast forward and there are some concerning patterns and behaviour traits that means my confidence in the manager isn't what it was. First, Wenger seems stubborn to a fault. Now in a man trying to stick to certain principles, that's fair enough, but when it's about tactics and a stark inability to come up with a plan B it's dangerous to the team. The 8-2 result against United was the most extreme manifestation of this. At some point you stop attacking and keep the result respectable, but we didn't do that. Instead we went for broke in suicidal fashion. No top manager in Europe would have been that short sighted.

Then there's his myopia when it comes to players he buys or brings through. After 2-3 years of not performing there's a point a player moves on. At Arsenal we give then pay rises! Denilson was getting way too much money. Bendtner was getting way too much money. When it came to finally selling them no one wanted these ""top"" Premiership and Champions League experienced players because their wage demand were too high for the level every other team in Europe thought they actually were at. They're still officially Arsenal players today because we couldn't sell them. Same with Almunia. Now either the other managers in Europe and even South America are dumber than Wenger and he knows something they don't, or we were paying over the odds for below average footballers.

Add that to the numerous transfer targets we have lost out on not due to high wage demands but Wenger's haggling over derisory sums. Sometimes we're losing out on players due to an extra £2-3m only to panic buy below par replacements at the last minute.

At this point the things I'm disappointed with the manager about go beyond the excuses about the stadium or miserly board members. Unlike those that decided to call for his head years ago just because they were hungry for silverware and couldn't appreciate the real problems, it's actual failings of the manager that is concerning me now.",True,t1_c2oaxp6,,1427676777,,0,3,,soccer,t1_c2oatct,False,t3_kyh0i,c2oaxp6,3,[deleted],0,0

The NFL is following this same path. NFL does London games and tries to generate interest in football. NFL owners hope Europeans start demanding NFL games on TV. NFL then collects TV money at 99% margins. 

Once again, NFL won't be putting a team in London any time soon. They will wait for Europe to be paying NFL customers before trying to fill stadiums.

Figure out your budget.

Try to make contact with people from different countries or ask advice from forums and sites long before you leave.

reddit is a great place to start to ask all the different regions of Europe about their varied and crazy cultures. [I made this for you](http://en.reddit.com/r/italy+france+germany+Netherlands+spain+poland+sweden+norway+unitedkingdom)

Once you have a starting point and an end point, combine that with a budget and figure out if you want to buy a car here or a motorbike or whether sticking with trains and coaches will be fine. There a a load of different train and coach companies all over Europe. Also remember a lot of Euro motorways / autobahns have tolls (not trolls). Budget for tolls.

The car option will give you tons more opportunity to discover whatever you want.

Use the internet relentlessly beforehand to find sites, [restaurants](http://www.fine-dining-guide.com/Michelin/10Michelin3Star.html), theme parks: [Efteling in The Netherlands](http://www.efteling.com) [Tivoli Gardens in Denmark](http://www.tivoli.dk/composite-3351.htm), places to drink, things to see and so much culture and variation.

To copy a [similar post](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/jo55u/best_way_to_get_around_eurpoe/c2duzt3?context=3), there is so much variation in Europe.

Oh, and if you're in the UK, hit me up. Me and our reddit friends will show you around the South West bit of the UK famous for surfing, caves, vibrant art &amp; music and of course cider.

I'm going to respond to a couple of your points below but if you don't feel like getting into a debate on economics thats ok. Just ignore what I have to say on the subject and we can move on. More on topic, what about Jesus's teachings goes beyond personal initiative to government action to create a just world?

&gt; First of all, taxing the wealthy doesn't make it impossible to create a fortune.

No disagreement with that. People can still become wealthy in a progressively taxed society. My point was that in Capitalism, people don't become wealthy unless they can offer something to the rest of society. You may not like it that CEO's make a lot more than your average worker but they offer something to private companies looking to stay competitive. Somebody at the top to organize and run a company efficiently can make or brake said company. If a company wanted to spend more money on getting a good CEO or keeping the ones they have there isn't anything morally wrong with that.

&gt; Which brings me to my second point: ""trickle-down"" economics don't work.

I think there is certainly a point where you can't cut taxes any lower and I'm not in favor of a flat tax but tax cuts for the wealthy can spur economic growth. Tax cuts under Reagan and Bush both brought the country out of economic recessions and towards positive growth. Growth isn't limited to just the wealthy but median familiy income from all classes have increased. Is the income gap that big of a problem if everybody is seeing significant increase in income?

&gt; All I'm saying is that the system right now already resembles feudalism

That's a curious analogy since class status in wealth in a feudal society is static and cemented by titles of nobility. I'm not arguing that the wealthy should stay wealthy based on prestige. They should have to work their way to success like the rest of us (granted they have a lot of advantages). In American Capitalism, you don't become wealthy (or stay that way) unless you can offer something to the rest of society. Furthermore, classes in America are fluid in that people can move upward or down depending on a variety of factors. In order for the poor or middle class to move up in standing they don't necessarily need the government's assistance in doing so (although government certainly can do somethings to help).

&gt; Why wouldn't an actual welfare state at least eliminate poverty, or at least, say, starvation?

If you can find a state out there that has completely eliminated poverty, I would like to see it. Even Scandinavian countries have poverty albeit at lower rates than the rest of Europe and the US. In America, government spending to fight poverty at it's highest (during LBJ's Great Society) didn't put a dent in the poverty rate even though it did accomplish some good things. Despite this, I think there should be some social programs to help the poor but poverty isn't a problem that goes away by throwing money at it. Furthermore, why extend the welfare programs to cover those who otherwise could afford to provide for themselves?

&gt; No, but it does suggest a certain amount of ignorance...

Like I said before, I'm in favor of gay marriage. Conservatives seem to believe that changing our definition of marriage will cause the downfall of society but like you pointed out marriage in Western culture has changed several times without this downfall happening. Furthermore, I don't think that allowing gay marriages to happen tarnishes heterosexual marriage.

&gt; Every single person I've met who was against gay marriage was either a homophobe, arguing from religious grounds, or was profoundly ignorant about either history or sexuality

I'm starting to lose track a little bit on where we disagree on this. When I said above that you can be against gay marriage without being anti-gay, that's what I meant (people arguing for their concept of tradition or religion). Are their positions ignorant or wrong? Yes. But, the comment that started this whole thread wasn't trying to understand why they believe what they do but just to settle for calling all of them anti-gay. That's what I was criticizing.

You're getting downvoted for making a wild claim that is counterintuitive and failing to back it up.

And speaking of backing it up, the article you linked to doesn't do a very good job of that. Off the top of my head, here are some of the things I took issue with:

* It begins by saying, more or less, that Europeans get more done than Americans, in less work hours. Then throughout the article, not a single country other than Germany is cited as an example to back up this claim. So the author picked what is one of, if not the most productive European country, with a notoriously high work ethic, and extrapolated that to all of Europe and attributed it to their work-life balance laws rather than, say, their work ethic. You then extrapolated that single example even further to argue that countries that are work-life balance friendly are more productive than those who aren't. Call me a cinic, but I'd like to see productivity for all the other European countries thrown into the mix before allowing for that kind of conclusion, especially considering the criticism that Germans have been leveling at some of their Eropean counterparts as being lazy.
* And speaking of numbers, not a single one was cited in this article to back up the claim that Germans produce a similar or superior output to that of Americans. The author makes the claim many times but does not provide a single source to support it. Tell me how productivity is being measured, show me what those productivity numbers are for America and Germany (and preferably some other countries as well), and a source I can turn to to verify your claim. As far as I know, this article is nothing more than the author's opinion, based on his anecdotal observation in a single company in Germany, that he is then extrapolating to all of Germany and Europe as a whole.

Then there's this brilliant piece of logic:
&gt; Geoghegan believes Germans understate their work hours, and Americans overstate work hours. Yet both countries are getting roughly the same amount of work done. This means that Germans are actually doing more, while working less. 

Umm, wrong. If Germans are understating their hours and Americans are overstating their hours, then Germans are in  reality **less** productive than they are stating and Americans are **more** productive than they are stating.

TL;DR: extrapolate a single example to all of Europe, provide no data to back up even that one example, and tie it together with an error in logic. Genius.

Edit: left out part of the quote from the article.

As for Greek people not paying their taxes, that is a drop in the ocean... When you see that your Governments are blatantly stealing from you, you of course don't want to pay taxes. But even if every last cent of the taxes was been payed, the problem would not be solved.

A minor example that comes to mind is structured bonds. A Greek pension fund lends money to Goldman Sachs with interest rate of 1% Goldman Sachs then lends that same money to Greek Government with an interest rate of 21% (this is from the top of my head, numbers might be far off)

You can get St. Peter's (from the UK), which is good. There is a local brewery, but their beers are hard to find, and I never got to try them myself. The Tinkoff brewpub isn't bad, though. Also, I note that RateBeer has added [about 20 places](http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/Country/Cities/st-petersburg/169.htm) since we were there.

My advice is: forget the local beer and go to Ket Café (Stremyannaya ul.22). It serves Georgian food. I promise you'll never forget the experience. Georgian food is unbelievable, and this is a really great place. Make sure to also order Georgian wine. Georgia has about 500 grape varietals which only grow there...

In Moscow, the Durdin brewpubs are quite good. The main one has good live eastern european jazz, good food, and really highly respectable beer. Make sure to try the kvass. In fact, try as much kvass as you can. Russian beer type made from rye bread. The best ones are excellent, and you can get some highly respectable ones from tanks trucks on the street for about 0.5-1 rubles pr 0.5l. The Pyatiy Okean brewpub is also not bad. Beyond that there doesn't seem to be much. Also note [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/kiq9h/anyone_know_of_good_beer_places_in_moscow_or/).

In Helsinki things are rather different. There's lots of great pubs, and a huge variety of beer. The brewpubs are more variable, though. I've been served both infected beer and beer with severe yeast problems.  Panimoravintola Bruuveri (city center) and Suomenlinnan Panimo (out in historic naval base), both served me beer unfit for human consumption.

A favourite place is St. Urho's Pub, near Parliament. It's not at all fashionable. Most of the waiters are men in their 50s and 60s. The food is pizza and similar. But the athmosphere of the place is great. Half the patrons are musicians from the nearby concert hall. They serve Fuller's from cask, great German classics, top Czech stuff, good Finnish craft beer, US craft, etc etc. Really easy to get into conversations, too.

Oluthuone Kaisla is for more serious beer nerding. The beer menu is bigger and more specialized, but the place itself isn't that nice.  Belge Bar and Bistro is through-and-through Belgian, and a really great place to eat, drink, and relax. Also, Zetor, on the main street, is a seriously weird place, but worth a stop. After all, you probably haven't seen that many tractor bars.

In Helsinki, if you ever see ""sahti"", make sure to order it. It's the traditional Finnish homebrew beer, and about as common as black unicorns. (The Nøgne Ø and Dogfish Head beers of similar names have nothing to do with the Finnish beer style.) Sometimes served at St. Urho's, nearly always on tap at Zetor. The taste is very, very different from normal beer (no hops, baker's yeast, etc), but something you must try.

Barker isn't even close to having the defence or technical prowess of Winky, I've seen a good collection of his other fights. Winky is slippery, has good counters, long arms and is unorthodox. Barker stands still in front on you with his hands hand and slightly tucked, not even close to Winky. If fighters that are never going amount to being top of the Brits or Europeans can hit him, then Sergio should have to problem at all. 

Sergio can put his punches together well, that's what you do against people who shell up like Barker. Abraham, Sturm, Winky, Clottey and so on. He just didn't and he had no reason not to do it, it's not as if Barker is a volume puncher or has any sort of power.

You're lumping them all together, acting as if the problem will be solved when their so called ""culture"" is gone. 10% of the population in some of these Eastern European countries is Roma. They're not all thiefs and prostitutes.

I'm hearing the same arguments about Muslim immigrants, some of them steal, too, some of them kill their sisters because they had sex without being married, or they burn cars in London and Paris. Do I generalize that all of them are assholes? I do not.

What we do need for every minority that is poorly integrated into society is proper law enforcement and a European wide strategy to tackle income and education inequalities. And we need social workers. Lots of social workers. Educated Roma, educated Muslims, people you can look up to. And we have to stop giving EU money to the corrupt leadership of Roma organizations or corrupt officials in these countries who just use it for themselves. And there are many more things to do, the list is long and it will take years or decades.

This is not an easy problem and it's definitely not solved by simply declaring ""They keep stealing, so they had it coming."" This vigilante bullshit has to stop in order to solve this problem. Governments have to stop proclaiming that all Roma are thugs and have to start apprehending the Roma that actually are thugs! A woman in Italy is killed by a Roma and suddenly they're all guilty? What kind of bullshit is this?

Just because *some* or even *many* Roma resort to stealing, prostitution and whatnot doesn't mean they are not an oppressed minority. People who didn't steal are oppressed, they don't get health care and have to live in shitty conditions in some part of a town with walls around it. That is ethnic oppression.

I read comments like this one from CruftRemover and think to myself: ""Where will this this attitude lead us?"" Nowhere. Simply nowhere. I don't think anyone isn't acknowleding that there are many bad apples among the Roma population. We all know this. But what do we do from here on out?

I can not and never will buy into such a simple minded belief like this one because it's futile to do so. You do not gain anything from it. These Eastern European countries HAVE to deal with the problem and they won't be able to deal with it like the Nazis did. They HAVE to integrate or at least coexist with these people. That is virtually impossible with your mindest.

&gt;*Above all, empathy is needed. That is something that is widely lacking among the political elite in eastern Europe, at least when it comes to the Roma. In 1993, after three Roma in the Romanian village of Hadareni were lynched with the involvement of the police, the government, in its official explanation, expressed understanding for the ""anger of the villagers.""*

&gt;*And in February 2009, when right-wing extremists in the Hungarian village of Tatárszentgyörgy set the house of a Roma family on fire and shot the father and his young son as they fled from the flames, no member of the Hungarian government called on people to unite to stop the violence.*

[\[source\]](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,788868,00.html)

These two events are pogroms. They are pogroms even if ""they had it coming"". I have empathy for the people killed and their loved ones even if ""they had it coming"". I will speak out for them even if ""they had it coming"".

Maybe it's because I'm German but I won't accept that a whole group is ostracized, even if 9 out of 10 are guilty of a crime. There is still one person who did not do anything and he is punished without a cause.

&gt;Only in late 1979 did the West German Federal Parliament identify the Nazi persecution of Roma as being racially motivated, creating eligibility for most Roma to apply for compensation for their suffering and loss under the Nazi regime. By this time, many of those who became eligible had already died.

[source](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005219)

It took my government 34 years to acknowledge that this group of people was slaughtered because they were part of the group. I don't know what their attitude before 1979 was, but I guess it was something like ""They had it coming.""

Assume you're right and they are socialistic in the sense that they oppose all forms of capitalism (You'd have to look around a lot to find one nowadays.

In a capitalistic society, what socialistic choice do you have for maintaining a pension fund?

Your point is wrong, and frankly I'm afraid to say, purposefully disingenuous.  Unions in general do not oppose some form of market economy.

&gt; Human evolution is the phenotypic history of the genus Homo, **including the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species** and as a unique category of hominids (""great apes"") and mammals. The study of human evolution uses many scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, linguistics and genetics.[1]

&gt; The term ""human"" in the context of **human evolution refers to the genus Homo**, but studies of human evolution usually include other hominids, such as the Australopithecines, from which the genus Homo had diverged by about 2.3 to 2.4 million years ago in Africa.[2][3] Scientists have estimated that humans branched off from their common ancestor with chimpanzees about 5–7 million years ago. Several species and subspecies of Homo evolved and are now extinct, introgressed or extant. Examples include Homo erectus (which inhabited Asia, Africa, and Europe) and Neanderthals (either Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) (which inhabited Europe and Asia). Archaic Homo sapiens evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago.

&gt; The **dominant view among scientists concerning the origin of anatomically modern humans is the hypothesis known as ""Out of Africa""**, recent African origin of modern humans, ROAM, or recent African origin hypothesis,[4][5][6] which argues that Homo sapiens arose in Africa and migrated out of the continent around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, replacing populations of Homo erectus in Asia and Neanderthals in Europe.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Evolution

Like Wikipedia says, the popular hypothesis is ""Out of Africa"", but there is also some evidence that the West of Australia might also be the starting point. Although we have good ideas, no one really has precise knowledge of how our emergence occurred, and of what paths were taken when and where/etc.

I counseled dozens of businesses worth significantly more on tax issues, and which operated in some pretty tricky regulatory and tax waters. The “paperwork” burden involved, in the simplest terms, involved nothing more than stapling a copy of their annual corporate credit card statement cards to the back of their cover letter to their accountant. His attempt to rationalize the “burden” of claiming businesses expenses is more trouble than it’s worth is about as believable of someone saying the “burden” of winning $500,000 in the lottery is more trouble than it’s worth.

It has everything to do with competing in the marketplace with businesses who *are* taking those deductions. No business would survive paying significantly more to Uncle Sam than his peers; I promise you. 

So he's claiming he pays 35% in corporate taxes (I've also never known a single business, no matter how socially-minded, to pay that high of a percentage in practice, particularly on gross income on which they are claiming no business expenses!), pays his 98 employees 20% above average, pays for employee medical expenses out of his own pocket, and does not claim charitable giving on his tax returns (at least to the degree he suggests he donates), AND does not claim business expenses that based on his after tax income and lines of work I estimate should total at LEAST $1 Million. 

My reaction as both an attorney and business owner: complete rubbish. The math does not add up. His businesses would fail in a matter of months.  Competition that offers good, but average, salaries and that exploit tax benefits would destroy him in a matter of months. 

Another glaring example: his claims about the legal structure of his companies are extraordinarily vague, and represent what I would call a teenager's understanding of how ""shell"" companies actually work. He's claimed to have both restaurants and the remainder of his companies held by the same ""shell,"" but in practice this is extremely uncommon for both regulatory and legal reasons. Why? To put it succinctly, there are very good reasons why people separate heavily regulated/high liability businesses, such as restaurants, from less regulated/low liability businesses, such as media. The liability concerns there are staggering, the structure so rudimentary and ill-conceived based on OP’s stated businesses, and so devoid of understanding the bad legal and financial ramifications that his claimed company structure alone gives him away. 

He also seems to suggest he’s in the US, based solely on describing himself as the 1% and how he’s an immigrant from Eastern Europe since the 1990’s. But his vernacular is entirely U.K., such as the spelling of “behaviour” and conversational use of the word “bastard,” a very common conversational U.K. term/very uncommon conversational U.S. term. A person in the states for 15+ years from Eastern Europe does not use U.K. vernacular. 

Also, he claims that he went to college in Eastern Europe and lived with his family to save on costs and is 28 years old. I’m not sure how he came here in the 1990’s then if I read his other comments correctly. 

His language is also suspiciously under-educated and juvenile for a person who claims to run a business of his size and lobs fairly poor business advice to the board here. I’ll try to edit this with some better examples if I get time. For instance, “Good karma breeds good karma” and “dude just keep an open mind. People are people” stinks of Reddit trolling; in real life no business owner pulling in millions a year would use that kind of vague platitude. Successful people (key word: “successful”) in business use facts, results, concrete information they can act on. Business people know karma has nothing to do with success; it’s doing your job/running your business better than the next guy.   

He further has some pretty specific knowledge of modern video games that is completely inconsistent with someone claiming to have busted his ass working at and forming companies since the age of 16. He claims to have a few restaurants, really? Has anyone here opened or owned a restaurant? Owners aren’t sitting on their laurels at 6 p.m. and taking off on Sundays, popping in when they’re feeling a bit nostalgic for the kitchen, and, for chrissakes, “partying” with the cooks on occasion. C’mon. And he apparently has enough time to play video games, clean his fairly large home himself, volunteer at “the local homeless shelter”, AND teach ESL classes? No, I’m sorry, this simply wouldn’t be possible based on the businesses he claims to run, and I don’t care how many managers he’s got. Show me a multi-million dollar CEO who’s leisure time includes video games, uses “lol” and “dude” with ease, casually claims his businesses don’t take tax deductions because “roads need to be built so why the fuck not,” and has time to volunteer 2+ days a week AND take off Sundays and only work the hours of 8-6, and I’ll show you a completely (terrible) liar. 

I can only assume upvotes and willingness of commenters to engage here are the result of probably college or high school readers that don’t have much experience in the business world. I can assure you OP does not exist, and I’d encourage you to thoroughly disregard any advice he’s given here. Much of it is dead wrong. 

Tl; dr You’ve been trolled, and not very well I might add. 

EDIT: OP has been furiously editing his original post and subsequent comments after I posted the above in some pretty poor attempts to cover his tracks. Honest posters wouldn't do that. Someone here to honestly discuss his business would not have made the above inconsistent comments in the first instance, and...ahem...definitely wouldn't have time or gumption to answer and edit posts in the considerable volume he has. Note what proven AMA'ers have done: short, concise posts. No or minimal editing of their OP even when challenged except to provide proof. Answer with specificity. And so on. OP has failed to do that in any way.

There are Enlightenment advocates in all sorts of cultures around the world; and there are anti-Enlightenment forces in Western culture too. Fascism was anti-Enlightenment; so are the Protestant Religious Right, conservative Catholicism, militant Islam, and ultra-Orthodox Judaism ... but so is critical theory, the leftist academic movement that grew out of Marxist economics and Freudian psychoanalysis.

Secularism, the rule of law, market economics, the development of reason, and the development of scientific knowledge about both the world and humanity itself — these are explicitly universal ideas, not merely Western ones. They are not tied to Christian religion, white ethnicity, or European languages. However, they have also been systematically politically suppressed in many, many places — both within the West and elsewhere — by religious conservatism, nationalism, and the like. The fact that they have so much following in the West today is probably more because of the rapid technological and economic success of science in the past few hundred years, rather than to any deeper tendency toward Enlightenment ideas among Western people.

And Enlightenment ideas have also at times been mistaken for something they are not: a cure-all for cultural bias and bigotry.

However, as a farmers son with early years in the 70's I have the view that farming has changed for the worse. In Wales UK as a child we named all our cows, eg Vanessa, Vera, Violet (grand Mother &gt;&gt; daughter... etc). We knew each cow and its personality in our small herd of around 30..

Then everything changed.

* Bulk tanks came in (thankfully instead of churns) and its refrigiration.

* The ""Milk Marketing Board"" imposed a Quota and also quality, ie must be not so fatty and don't produce more than N litres per week. Part of Eu Rules to counter over milk production. My dad had to pull the plug and let milk down the drain.. he HATED doing that ans would prefer to give away.. But cant cos its not pasturised. 

Its now a new different game..
You don't bother with small farms and a diverse set of milk, there are cows ""branded"" almost at birth, nowadays a ""RFID tag"" to make it less painful for cow, but also to give it the correct feed digitally..

I've forgotten what REAL fresh milk tastes like, On the farm our town cousins would not the drink the milk cos it ""tasted strange"", as I did when in town drinking mandatoraly pasteurised milk.

Now approaching mid century age..I think that..
The local milk round should be re-instated with fresh local milk. and bottles. I've fed up of going to the supermarket and using the same cream reduced, pasteurised, filtered, non organic, diluted blank white coloured stuff in plastic containers which I cant return.

The only way I can see that done is to remove Goverment Regulation and the EU subsidies from the equation, and put it back in the hands of the source (eg Farmers Mutual). as it was for thousands of years; organic farming and taking advantage of the land and diversity should be the norm.. and leads to a good tasty product..

SINCE THAT TIME, Mr. iamacontrarian is correct in that the RMB had been pegged consistently TO THE US DOLLAR, and even appreciating in value slowly. China is 'manipulating' its currency by following closely US currency fluctuations.

The banks receive new access to credit in exactly the way the article lays out. Well, it's a little complicated to understand -- as it practically happens in the inter-bank lending market in Canada, rather than through a discount window like in the US.  

Yes, HSBC is the most prominent Schedule II bank. However, the regulations still have shades of economic nationalism, requiring the subsidiary -- and it must be a fully incorporated subsidiary, with local directorship - to have Canadian citizens as directors, and to maintain potentially unnecessary duplication of bureaucracy with the foreign parent. None of this has anything to do with deposit safety, in my opinion.

Such regulations are most certainly designed to create an uneven playing field for foreign banks. It is not merely that foreign banks do not want to comply with Canadian regulatory compliance in the same way Schedule I banks do. That's just simply not the case.

In the last century and a half violent rebellion has almost never led to a more free society. But some of the greatest expansions of liberty in the 20th century were won through non-violent movements! Central and Eastern Europe gained their independence through non-violent protest. India and Pakistan gained it's freedom through non-violent protest, leading to a trend of decolonization throughout the world. The Civil Rights Movement in the US did not succeed through the tactics of Maclom X that the author advocates for, but the tactics of non-violence of people like Martin Luther King.

Does non-violence mean you win? Of course it doesn't, look at Iran over the last few years. But Egypt also participated in non-violent resistance and they succeeded.

Disclaimer: I work in international development, we get substantial funding from DfID.  Needless to say however I do not speak for my employer with this post.

Can't post at length as it's nearly bedtime, but one thing I will throw out to add to the discussion is that DfID have extremely rigorous M&amp;E requirements attached to their grants, in a way that individual givers do not and probably never will.  

Institutional donors tend to be relative far along the curve in terms of intl development research in terms of what actually works, what doesn't ""go into the pockets of warlords"", what is most sustainable, accountable, etc and decide on how they allocate money accordingly.

Individual givers tend to be prompted to donate by photos of dying babies; they are more likely to be swayed to give cash by  disaster/emergency appeals than unglamorous longer-term work such as capacity building.  OK, this sounds hideously patronising I know, and I don't mean to imply _nobody_ who supports charities does so with an analytical head on, but speak to anyone who works in fundraising - the ""kids, cats and cancer"" stereotype exists for a reason, FR gets more results working on emotion than on data tables of 15-year impact assessments.

Also, institutional donors tend to commit big sums over, say, 5 years, which means you can budget and plan projects over a longer term; with IG, you can hope to minimise attrition, but you can't really guarantee your direct debits will still be there.  Institutional donors will have an overview of various agencies and projects and may work with or create joint bids / projects, so the ""left hand knows what the right is doing""; IG, less likely.  Can work out better in ROI terms too - you might have one or two people working on an EU bid for six months, coming back with 4 million euro, meanwhile you've got a dozen people in your IG team mustering a half a mil in that timeframe.

This is all a roundabout way of saying even if reduced govt aid budget but increased personal donations results in the overall sum of aid being exactly the same, you might end up with more inefficient, unsustainable work on the ground.

Of course I'm not suggesting it is all one sided, obviously one could argue along similar lines in the opposite direction, such as govt donors potentially allocating money based on who will reward their country with trade/contracts rather than who needs it the most.  Or the longer timeframes, more bureacracy and bigger sums meaning a ""bad donation"" (giving money to a charity that turns out to be useless) is a bigger deal and isn't corrected as quickly.

I wouldn't be surprised if one day we wake up and find out some random country was fudging balance sheets like Italy, and that they are completely insolvent.  That could get bad.

For now, though the problems abroad are helping the USD gain back some strength.  I think the 2012 elections will be key, lots of the Republicans seem dedicated to reducing the debt, and a few of them I know will bring the troops home.  As long as we get our debt under control, we'll be okay.  

We need to figure out a way to get off of the Fed-banking-cartel's fiat currency and get back to sound money, that is the #1 solution to all the problems we face.  China won't like that though so we'll have to figure out a way to full-faith back outstanding Treasuries.

By proposing something that doesn't quite meet the targets, they can test if Germany in particular will ""go nuclear"". If they don't, Greece can push back austerity measures, bit by bit. If they do, then Greece can find extra cuts to make the required level, and look better with their electorate for trying.

The EU will have to call its bluff, so expect a loud and obvious statement from someone saying the Oct tranche of bailout is impossible without adherence to the stated conditions. Probably Slovenia.

In the long run I can't see any way default can be avoided.

False,1317605762,t5_2cneq,"Pretty simple actually, there are some very smart people who blog about this stuff, check out [Ecconomists view](http://economistsview.typepad.com/)

* As for solutions, the sales tax dmk200 mentions is technically called a [Tobin tax](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2011/08/17/merkel-and-sarkozy-are-right-about-a-tobin-tax/) and is one of the least distortionary taxes and would handily eliminate (essentially useless) high frequency trading sending the profits they now make to the government instead.

* More serious regulation would help, especially for insider trading which ~~is part of what~~ can make hedge funds obscenely profitable.  Tighter regulations are great, but even just enforcing the ones we have would be a huge start.  Perhaps double or triple the pay of SEC investigators but require that they can't work in the industry they regulate for 5-10 years after working in the SEC.  This would kill a lot of incentive to go light on banks or traders to ensure a profitable retirement position.  Hell, a lot of government regulators could benefit from this common sense rule.

* To big to fail banks are also simple (if you can get it past the banking lobby).  Banks assets should be capped at 2-4% of national GDP.  At the height of the crisis the largest were 10-20% making them WAY to big to fail.  Some European bank's assets **exceed** the GDP of their respective countries making them basically ""too big to save"" (see Ireland).  We can't and shouldn't let banks continue to grow to that size; and they absolutely will if we let them since large banks have a natural government subsidy as they are known to be too-big-to-fail and can out-compete smaller banks by getting cheaper capital due to this implicit (explicit in 2008) backstop.

* Derivatives should be put on an open market (rather than over-the-counter) so they can be regulated and evaluated for how they cause systematic risks.  This was suggested in the recent banking reform but was defeated by the banking lobby because no one wants to learn about and push the details of these things (or read thousand word comments regarding them).  Additionally, banks shouldn't be able to speculate with their cash reserves on derivatives.  This was the ""Volcker Rule"" and might not be dead yet but there isn't much of a push against the industry which vehemently opposes it.  This would basically be a modern day Glass Stegal, and re-implementing that would help as well.

* Oh, and the rating agencies have massive conflicts of interest since the customers who they rate also pay them giving them an incentive to give easy ratings to their biggest customers.  There are ways of [handling this conflict of interest as well](http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1886880,00.html), but as with all of these, they haven't gotten ~~much~~ enough attention.

These are all there, and it would be tough to get even ONE of these proposals through the current congress (thanks tea-party!) but some might be possible within the SEC's current authority.

These are the kinds of things that ""OcupyWallStreet"" could really help if they learned about them and pushed for as a group rather than against 'capitalism' or 'greed'.  In fact, most of these suggestions have been considered or at least brought up in congress which probably gets a B+ for considering options but a C- for implementation just due to political realities and people not understanding issues enough to know what to push for against massive lobbying by the financial industry.  As such, any sane proposal for wide scale reform needs to start by significantly reducing the economic, political and even cultural clout/power of the banking sector - making it much more safe and boring while preserving its essential features.  Also it would help if money in general were removed from politics to a much greater extent, but that's a whole 'nother essay.
