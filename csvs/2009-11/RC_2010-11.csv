Morocco is a liberalized autocracy. No different from countries like Jordan, Kuwait etc... A quick look at all Arab states will reveal that all of those countries are ruled by outdated authoritarian regimes backed by Western countries. It doesnt matter how bad you think Democracy is, it cant be worse than these kinds of governments. Morocco is blessed with a political and cultural stability, one of the fastest growing economies in Africa, a multi-party political system and a significantly more liberal society than most arab countries, all which constitute a good environmental for any young democracy. Sure, a complete political reform will be required but the outcomes will definitely be worth it.

,"First, the guy asked you to name some... He didn't ask for thousands, he asked for some.  Of which you provided zero.

The original blanket statement was ""American and Canadian culture are pretty similar"".  Guess what, culture within Canada isn't very similar in some cases.  The point is that the original statement tries to say something but it's actually so vague to the point of being wrong.  

&gt; Canada and the US have were colonized at approximately the same time by the same people (predominantly the English in both cases).

From this statement alone, I can see you know little about Canadian history.  

&gt; They are both predominantly white and speak the same language which enables people from both countries to communicate easily and thus have friends in both countries.

You could say the same thing about Austria and Germany, but there are striking differences between the two countries.  The same could also be said about Australia and New Zealand.  All countries in South America (with the exception of Brazil) speak the same language... are they all the same culturally?  Yeah, culture is nebulous.  Which leads back to the original points about the cultures being similar.  Sure, there are similarities, but saying that they are ""similar"" implies that there are more similarities than there differences.  If you can't even define culture, speaking in absolute terms like these is meaningless.

As a Canadian that has worked in Canada, the US, Europe and New Zealand, I can say that there are striking differences between Canada and the US.  So much so that I would argue they are very difference culturally.  I would also argue that I see more similarities between Canada and New Zealand than I see between Canada and the US.

,"I think that the MLS has a few players who can play for mid-table EPL teams and hold a first team place (like Landon Donovan, Thierry Henry now that he's old). But then there are a few players who get paid a 5-figure salary per year and would be Championship-level at best. So the quality is not spread out in the first XI, let alone the squad depth that will be necessary to survive an entire season.


Pre-season friendlies upsets of Championship teams beating Premier League teams is not uncommon. Also other teams from other upcoming leagues beating top-flight European teams in pre-season friendlies is not unheard of, for e.g. Tokyo Verdy beat Real Madrid [3-0 in 2005](http://china.org.cn/english/sports/136163.htm), when it was 17th out of 18th position in the J-League. You have European teams earning a nice paycheque to play in a friendly, looking to avoid pre-season injuries having travelled for more than 10 hours on a plane.

After the coming defence cuts in Scotland (i.e. RAF Kinloss being closed), Scotland will have a smaller military presence than Ireland, which only spends 0.6% GDP. A good deal? I think not. We also wouldn't need to spend billions on foreign wars and Trident. And we don't rely on being British to pay for education, healthcare etc. Even with all the important economic levers being controlled by Westminster, we have a budget surplus, compared to the UK as a whole running a massive deficit.

2. Just the other day there were newspaper reports showing that Ireland, Norway, Iceland etc. still have a much better quality of life than the UK. Of course, in a world economic downturn, it helps that Norway has had an oil fund since 1995, which is now worth &gt;Â£500bn.

Um what? The USA alone has had 326 citizens as recipients of a Nobel Prize since 1906. That's 329 out of [840 Nobel Prize awards. 817 of these awards went to unique individuals (i.e. one person not receiving multiple awards and also not an award going to an organization)](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/nobelprize_facts.html).

In any case your claims have been shown to be wrong with one small sample size.

&gt;Following me? Ok, I'll continue. For centuries the middle east and followers of Islam were the leaders in philosophy and science. They had the largest libraries, the most liberal scientific ideas, and the greatest scientific culture. It literally took until after the middle ages in Europe for another society to rival the advances that the Middle East had before jesus walked the land.

Which is a pretty egregious error to make when trying to state how poorly educated other people are.  In fact Greek thought was a driving force in Christianity in it's spread through the Mediterranean via the Roman Empire, sustained in the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire (Which lasted until AD 1453). They never experienced 'The Dark Ages' which was a phenomenon localized to a power vacuum and feudalism in the west.

This same Greek thought was pervasive further east and south and was assimilated by Muslims (which originated between AD 610-632) as they began conquering foreign lands. This can be linked with the later sacking of Constantinople in 1453 by the Ottomans.

,"Thank you for the well-referenced argument. It's interesting to see that all of the sources so far acknowledge the view that humans are 85% similar, and that most of the 15% variation is from within populations. The main point of your sources seems to be that race contributes more than people say it does, but I'm still making my way through your references, but I have a few questions. 

----

Actually, I first want to respond to your statement that we're in America's 15th decade of racial strife. Are you saying there was no racial strife before the civil war? We had blacks in fucking slavery. I'd say that humans have been living with racial strife as long as we've had the concept of races (the beginning?). The key difference is that it's usually been between countries, and that now we have less people dying because of it.

----

How do you feel about Brown vs Board of Ed, then? Was the Supreme Court wrong in their conclusion that separate things are inherently unequal, or do you think it's the right conclusion, and races should be kept separate anyways?

What about studies like [this one](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385.long), that find that diverse groups outperform homogeneous groups? Flawed study? There's something different about small groups vs society to explain the difference? If diverse groups really do come up with better solutions, how can that be harnessed while keeping cultures isolated from each other (or do you think it's better to keep cultures pure than to solve their problems better)?

Also, how can races be primarily biologically-based if different cultures identify different races? In the USA, nobody will self-identify as a Moor. In some European countries on the other hand...

-----

OK, I've read the first 5, and so far no race/genetics or culture/genetics correlation. BiDil was interesting (though you could have found a source published after its FDA approval), until I found this in Wikipedia ""the study data used to approve the medication only included self described African American participants and no other racial groups. BiDil could potentially be beneficial to all patients suffering from heart failure"". What that tells me is they haven't done any research to determine if it gives greater benefits to non-African Americans. I mean, if you gave penicillin to only self-described African Americans, you would find it's an effective antibiotic for them, but it wouldn't let you conclude that it works only on African Americans.

Maybe some researchers are onto things when looking at expression of genes instead, but it looks to me like they only found differences between Americans, Europeans, and Asians, not whites/blacks/asians.

----

OK, 6th source says that they found genetic markers that correlate with the ""popular conception of continental-based races - principally Africans, East Asians, American Indians and Caucasians (a group that includes Europeans, Middle Easterners, and people of the Indian subcontinent)"" and the response the article quotes is ""why not just skip directly to genetic differences when trying to cure diseases?"" and then the counter is ""we can't sequence everybody, so race is a good enough proxy"". Still has nothing to do with cultures or diversity, though.

EDIT: ok, read the amerika one and &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;...if you do an experiment and follow the scientific method, it is science. Being right or wrong has nothing to do with how scientific it is. Was Newton unscientific because his formulation of mechanics doesn't match up with reality?

* Sadly, aid budgets across the world have steadily been declining since the 90s (and most of what remains has been converted from aid to loans) and nowadays most aid is done for the benefit of the donors and not the receiving populations. One of the biggest problem is that aid efficiency is often measured on a quantitative basis rather than a qualitative basis. Donors want MORE bang for their buck and they equate that with MORE schools and more wells rather than BETTER schools and wells. In some instances (food for newborns) this can cost lives (malnourished newborns whom are feed crappy food void of nutriments).

* Furthermore lots of private donors have agendas and seek to promote certain types of initiatives. For example the biggest private donor in the world, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (fact no 3 I'd guess for most people) was at first really big on technological initiatives (this has somewhat changed). However installing computer labs in third world cities that don't have a good electrical grid, internet infrastructure or local and continued tech support proved to be quite infective and a lot of money and time was wasted on similar projects. Today the BMGF is much more broad in it's goals and learned that, as with life, everything is connected : you cannot solve development problems one problem at a time.

* Finally, simply trowing money at problems does not work in most cases. 
The same BMGF as an other example offered double salary to the medical staff of a country if they worked on preventative AIDS vaccination. The end result was that the entire medical infrastructure of the country collapsed within a couple of years as doctors and nurses jumped on the BMGF project initially, abandoning where they were working on and, later, having now experience with a prestigious western NGO left the country to work in Europe and America. Neighboring countries suffered a similar shortage and other infections and sicknesses grew more rampant because of inadequate vaccination. Today that country is trying to rebuilt it's medical infrastructure to a level equal to what it once was 10 years ago....

Irrelevant to a conversation of the ethics of eating meat. 

&gt; meat eating (and also cooking, which was probably invented to cook meat) was what allowed the human digestive tract to shorten, freeing up our bodies to devote energy and blood to our brains, meat eating allowed us to become fully human. so I find eating meat to be reasonably integral to the survival of the human race.

You have a fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to human evolution and physiology. Eating meat did not *allow* our GI tract to shorten, it was the other way around. Mutations occurred that made the eating of meat more feasible. At the time that this occurred, meat provided a calorically and nutritionally dense food source that plants and fungi gathered through scavenging could not provide. This gave us the necessary energy that allowed our brains, over time, to grow in size and complexity. (Whether or not the brain developed much later than hunting or at the same time, I'm not qualified to say. Although I believe it's still a matter of debate among anthropologists). 

&gt; wild animals are never going to be allowed sufficient habitat. 

That's bullshit. This is only true if people continue to think as narrowly as you do. There is no reason for humanity to find better ways to live on this planet without overconsuming everything including land space. (I personally believe we are living in a time where the necessary changes are beginning to take place. Whether it takes decades or centuries is impossible to say.)

&gt; the idea that we can turn loose domesticated animals and have them survive in the wild is preposterous. it simply does not work.

Where the fuck did I say that? I think that would be a terrible idea. I'm completely against invasive species. That's the thing; for many of the larger mammals, it would work. It *has* worked. When the Europeans first came to America, they brought their pigs with them. They also let them roam relatively freely within their settlements. Of course, they escaped, and, within years of their arrival, they were decimating the local ecosystem while being completely unchallenged. 

&gt; I do wish that the wild lands of the world could be truly wild, but the best we can do is a well managed commons.

I'm not sure if we think of the same things when you say ""a well managed commons"". If we leave them alone with enough room and access to migratory routes and water and food, why shouldn't they be ""truly wild"". 

&gt; as to ethics: it is ethical to keep farm animals for my own purposes, to hunt, and to fish, to farm, and to shape the landscape for my own purposes and the purposes of other humans. I have the right to live as a human being. this is because human beings are the ones who confer rights. animals have rights insofar as we give them rights. 

This section is the most revealing. Why do you assume you have the ""right"" to keep animals? Why do you assume you have the right to shape the landscape or ""confer rights""? Why do you assume that, while you have the right to ""live as a human being"", animals don't have a right to live as they would? How can you explain the logic that lead you to this conclusion?

When we invaded, we put the remainder of these warlords (the Northern Alliance) in power. Most were not members of the dominant Pashtun ethnic group, and therefore untrusted by the people (a situation not helped by their massive corruption). 

If we were to leave now, the Taliban shadow government would take over in some areas, and not in others. There would be more civil war. But the Afghans have a couple of wonderful things going for them now: Tribal elders have had a relatively peaceful decade (what a way to describe an international occupation!) to re-establish their authority, and they have been exposed to some of the best (and worst) parts of American and European and Australian cultures (among others) by some of the best young men and women the world has to offer.

,"I would associate the decline of the church largely to the loss of power of the Roman Empire in germania and western Europe, which was due to a large number of complicated factors, including over extension of the Empire's resources, migration of 'barbarian' peoples into the empire, the conflict between Pagan Roman religion and Christianity (Fun fact, the Visigoths that sacked Rome were Arian Christians, followers of a creed that had been declared heretical at the council of Nicea), and many, many other things. The Roman Empire was extremely important to pre-medieval Europe, introducing all kinds of culture and technology. When the financial and military support of the Empire withdrew much of that culture and technology went with it. 

Also, I would like to note that up until... hmm, probably the 1500s or 1600s many, many powerful political figures were members were both Clergy and princes. Many Bishops and other church figures held land, raised armies, went to war, and participated in the councils of kings. They fought with secular lords and also with each other. 

I would not say that the Church caused any decline in Europe, on the grounds that in many way there is no Europe without the Church and their is no Church without Europe. Catholicism was the culture of Europe from around 500 to around 1700. The Church was as important and basic a component of culture at that time as the Internet is now. Priests were often the only people with a semblance of education, the only people able to write and receive letters. While some theologians certainly advocated a radical and oppressive form of Christianity, others provided council to their leaders that served to limit the gross abuses of Feudalism. 

In the end it's far too complicated to say that the Christian Church was a good thing or a bad thing. It spurred Europe to destructive wars with the Muslims to the south and the pagan Slavs in the east. It provided the foundations for rational inquiry on which Science was founded. It founded and promulgated the Inquisition, which was both a machine of torture and oppression and an instrument of social and political justice. The church preserved knowledge from the time of Rome and suppressed new knowledge. The church contributed and obstructed philosophy. 

If Catholicism hadn't become the dominant religion in Europe I don't know that things would have changed very much. Certainly a Europe that followed the Mithras cult or kept to Roman or Germanic Paganism would be different, but I don't think humanity would necessarily have made more social or technical progress. The Romans could be as brutal and sadistic as any Inquistor, and the Vikings were notorious for being savage in battle. The Muslims put whole cities to the sword, and the Mongols carved a swath across the entire world. If Roman Catholicism hadn't risen to become the dominant cultural framework of Europe then it seems likely to me that one of those four groups, the Muslims, the Norsemen, the Romans, or the Mongols, would have shaped the face of Europe.

WW1 led to WW2 which fueled the US rise to power.  Racism wouldn't have been viewed with such contempt by normal people as it wouldn't have been a demonized feature of ""the enemy"".  Without our rise to power and the tensions that brought, many technological advances would have come about more slowly (no extreme competition and fear of annihilation encouraging innovation).

I'd say, in 2010, our level of technology would probably be equivalent to what we had in the mid to late 1930's...maybe 1940's.  There would be less variety of style as our manufacturing methods wouldn't be efficient enough to allow for inexpensive smaller runs (DIY counter-culture styles wouldn't be so quickly adopted by mainstream outlets such as hot-topic for this reason).  If we had computers at all, they would more closely resemble ENIAC and we wouldn't have anything like the internet (not even ARPANET as we wouldn't have had such a need).  We wouldn't have microwave ovens, since they came about through defense research as well...and that would have significantly reduced the spread of fast food joints (which rely heavily on microwave ovens)...which would majorly impact our current obesity epidemic.

Religion would still be SUPER popular...I imagine non-religious would represent a fraction of a percent, as opposed to it's current peak at 1/6 of the population.

He claimed the devil had appeared in the form of a black cat. Cats became the official symbol of heresy (or religious beliefs not advocated by the church). Anyone who showed any compassion or feeling for a cat came under the church's suspicion. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, Europe's cat population had been severely depleted.

&gt;**You get on well with Jose Mourinho, so does it surprise you to see him stir up so much controversy?**

&gt;Thatâs the way he is and youâve got to accept it. There are two Mourinhos: the man and the coach. We have to take the positive side of this and use him to motivate us. He feels good in the thick of controversy - heâs comfortable with it. We want to win by playing good football and he just wants to win any which way. Sometimes we Barcelona players need extra motivational factors to really perform, and Mourinho gives us one. The fact that they (Real Madrid) went looking for him, that they paid a release clause, that he used to work for BarÃ§a and knows us all and wants to get one over us, in that sense, Mourinhoâs presence works in our favour.

&gt;**Turning back to yourself, you must be pretty happy with your lot after winning everything at club level with Barcelona and being a reigning European and world champion with Spain...**

&gt;Let me say one thing: I depend on my team-mates. My football and my passing would be worthless without my teamâs help. Thatâs something which is very clear to me. Sometimes I start thinking and I look at Madrid for example, who have truly great players, but Iâd struggle with them.

,"If heroin was legalized, controlled by governments to be sure it is sanitary, of a standardized strength everywhere and new syringes were freely available, it would be much less dangerous than it is now. In fact it would be far less dangerous than aspirin which kills six to sixteen thousand people each year, depending on who you believe, in the US alone. There are roughly six thousand heroin ODs in the US per year but over a hundred thousand die each year from prescription drugs that were prescribed to *them.*

Humans have been using drugs, including opium, for thousands of years and they are unlikely to stop until something better comes along, like direct brain stimulation. Our ridiculous drug laws are killing users and keeping drug cartels in business. Since the US occupation of Afghanistan production of opiumâthe drug that is refined into heroinâhas increased by a few hundred percent. Who is profiting from that increased production? Think hard. Cheap Afghan heroin is easily available over most of Asia, Europe and other places. In the meantime US pressure has made heroin very hard to obtain in places like Thailand. Can you connect the dots?

I am *not* recommending heroin use but I'm trying to be realistic. That is, a certain number of people are going to use it whether it is legal or not. Making it legal will result in fewer deaths.

However, seemingly few transcend to becoming problem drug users (0.44%), well below the average (0.52%) of the same compared countries.[22]

&gt;The reported number of deaths linked to the use of drugs in the Netherlands, as a proportion of the entire population, is together with Poland, France, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic the lowest of the EU.[23] The Dutch government is able to support approximately 90% of help-seeking addicts with detoxification programs. Treatment demand is rising.[24]

Taken from wikipedia, seems that while more people try hard drugs, less people get addicted to them in the Netherlands. I don't see much of a problem with this - you may disagree. I'm all for experimentation.

However, from your first post you seemed overly critical of marijuana legislation, not ebcause of the drug itself but because of the regulations that may be put up around the drug. Regarding this, I'm sure it won't be too lenient - this can be taken from the fact that polticians don't want to look too relaxed on the drug infront of the older voting population (their main demographic).

&gt;Actually all Western parents coerce and indoctrinate their children into wearing/adopting Western clothes. They don't allow them to run around naked all the time. If they did, their children would be taken away from them by the state.

Okay, now I get it: you're a troll. You're purposefully saying absurd things to annoy me. In any case I'm going to respond to this last comment.

Not every place is like the United States. In Europe, child nudity is more acceptable than adult nudity. When I walk to my university, I go through a gypsy part of town. It's not uncommon to see kids coming out of the house naked.

If you haven't noticed, western cultures are usually very accepting of different cultures, but some despise the fact that some foreigners don't have the same freedoms they have.

&gt;Yes, you do. In most Western states a person cannot walk around in public with any attire that displays his/her genitalia for example. There are laws governing public decency.

Yes they can. Maybe not in the USA, but here being naked isn't considered indecent. Performing sexual acts in public is. In Barcelona, for example, public nudity is a recognized right.

,"I think my biggest contention is this idea that the rich deserve to get exponentially richer because they got rich in the first place. You definitely have self made people but often you will find that money begets money. A person who makes millions a year can still lose a million dollar investment and see no decline in their living standard, there's really no risk there that has any kind of solvent impact on the way in which that person will live after a failed investment. It's essentially advocating a system where we are all simply pawns in their game, where our jobs and our livelyhoods are at the risk of their bad investments and their failure hurts everyone else more than them. If the system were really as you said then the wealthy must in someway feel the impact of their failure, losing 1 million dollars when you have 9 million more you made that year doesn't do that.

To me, the biggest way to reign this in is education that values merit over money. Currently a rich family can afford to educate their children the best and give them enough financial help for their children to then themselves be wealthy. There's no merit to that system, it's despotism. When you then have poor families with none of those advantages it's no wonder that their children grow up to continue the cycle. 

Can you make everything completely fair? No, but to say that any attempt to fix this is foolish only cements people into classes and creates a caste system. All the work ethic in the world will not get you into the upper echelons when the deck is stacked against you like it currently is. People like Bill Gates are the exception and not the rule and to treat them as anything more than an anomaly distorts reality. Social mobility is something this country was founded on, it's something that Europe had never really embraced and the idea of a fluid ruling middle class was very radical for the time. 

EDIT: And to clarify on healthcare, I am not advocating a single payer system. I am only saying that it is in our best interest to have a system where healthcare is not tied to our jobs and does not disappear the second employment does. With no government interference this is the system that created itself, the invisible hand of the market did not work in this case and change was needed to insure our health despite economic turmoil. That doesn't mean you get it for free but it does mean that your health is more than the bottom line on a bill. It's callous to tell people that they have less of a right to live because of their wealth, we have more of a responsibility to each other than that, I'm an atheist and I still believe that.

,"There is of course, some merit to the claim that the US overspends on defense and it certainly makes sense at an intuitive level. The existence and troublesome effects of the military industrial complex are far too great to be denied and the US could certainly scale back its defense spending in a number of ways and still maintain the current distribution of power in the world. But this is a point that people who haven't studied international relations theory usually do not understand. The current distribution of global power, which necessitates huge US defense spending, keeps the world safe from the major great-power all on all conflicts of the past. 

Throughout its relatively short history, the modern state system has been governed by the balance of power. When the system was multi-polar, that is, when it had multiple great powers vying for dominance (think Europe just before WWI and II) the world tended to be very unstable and prone to massive conflicts. 

After WWII the international structure changed to one of bi-polarity (two great powers - the US and USSR) which, while terrifying because of the nuclear element, was seemingly more stable. 

Finally, the USSR collapsed and the world was left with one super-power, the United States. Today, it is US power which underpins global order. Typically states cannot go to war with one another because the US has security guarantees spanning the globe. You cannot attack a state that has the world's lone superpower guaranteeing its safety.

Take East Asia as a case in point. The US hub and spoke system of alliances guarantees Japanese safety from China and it reassures China that Japan won't be militarizing and forcing them into an arms race. Same with Taiwan and China and India and China and North Korea and South Korea etc. etc. 

Is the US perfect? Far from it. But in this one area, it is Uncle Sam that most likely prevents the international system from reverting back to a Hobbesian world of all against all - or at least some against some. 

TLDR; While it can be reduced, it is US defense spending that keeps most of the world from falling into murderous interstate conflicts. So think of that as a form of safety and aid it provides.",True,Economics,JohnKennethHalitosis,c14312k,1426546718,False,t3_dz61e,1,0,False,1,t3_dz61e,t1_c14312k,0,0,1288620696,,t5_2qh1s,

The CIA funded art exhibits in Europe. The reason it did so was to demonstrate to Europeans that America was forward-thinking and free, and the Soviet Union was not. The reason it felt the need to promote this obvious idea was that Europe was looking at McCarthyism and institutionalized racism in the U.S. and not liking it. This was pushing many Europeans into a ""pox on both their houses"" position. The CIA wanted to remind the Europeans that the U.S. was part of the West, and that included the notion of absolute artistic freedom for the avant garde. And I think that was (and is) a good thing.

,"No argument. We are greedy and violent.

But that really is just an extension of how we evolved, asking people as a whole to change that is pointless on any realistic timescale.

Also our greed is the source of most of the truly great things mankind has done. Granted it is also the source of most of the truly horrifying things mankind has done.

When Europeans first came to America they found vast herds of animals flocking all over the land, so to feed our families we hunted them until it was more economically viable to ""farm"" animals than to hunt them.

This was a great tragedy in that many animals were pushed to the very brink before it became more economically viable to farm (ranch) animals then it was to keep hunting them.

I think we will find the same thing will happen with fishing. We over hunted the land animals and now we are over hunting the water animals.

However rather then a crash at the end we are likely to see a boom. The number of cows that are harvested every day in the US far exceeds the number of buffalo that ever could have been harvested.

I expect that soon we will start having ocean fish farming on a grand scale. The boon will be far higher food production, the tragedy will be the loss of species.

As for the dumping into the ocean. The worst offenders of this are the developing nations. We have watched as each nation moves from developing to developed they become far more concerned about the environment.

The simple fact is that as long as people have to worry about how they are going to feed their people they will be far less concerned about the future.

The US can be cited as the most greedy country in the world, yet we have the cleanest industry for it's level of output in the world.

Now we are starting to see the same effect in China the worlds worst polluter. They are shutting down old plants all over the country and replacing them with new cleaner ones because the damage the old ones do is exceeding the good. (Good = income for China, Bad = Massive sick rates due to pollution)

When people are wealthy they have more time to dedicate to learning and to annoying their government to keep them in check.

Clear cutting is likely to be a long term problem that I don't see a solution to. The most common example is the ranchers in Brazil. They can make far more money in a few years of ranching then it costs them to cut down the jungle.

Also the jungle produces almost no food and no income for Brazil while cleared land can and does produce food and income. I really see no way of stopping this as you are asking people to please stay poor. Never going to happen. (And yes I know about the soil erosion problems)

I think hazing is stupid, but this underlines a bigger problem in Brazilian football: football players aren't educated. Kids play for clubs since they're 12, 13 years old. The best players are usually poor so good schooling and educational support isn't in their horizon, plus their families can't provide that for them. Teams don't want them to spend most of their times in school because that isn't a good return of investment.

The kids have to train 4, 5 times a week at the training grounds, and usually, since they are poor, a trip like that is about 3h to and fro. Imagine yourself as a kid, from a poor neighborhood or worse, a favela, going to a terrible school for 5 hours a day (if that), wasting 3h in transit to your club's training facilities, training for 2, 3 hours...there's no way you're getting a decent education in that environment. It's not like the US, there's no ""student-athlete"" thing, no program to ensure grades and academic improvement, there's only ""athlete"". And then, after high school, if they manage to make it in football, none of them go to college.

See a guy like Neymar, for instance, ever since he was 16 he knew he'd be a professional player. All he did is finish high school (due to his conditions and background probably not a good one) and went on with his life as a player. The guy gets paid 500k reais per month and he's still only 18. He's lucky that his family is supportive of him and appears to have their heads on their shoulders, but imagine getting paid half a million when you're 18!? How can you cope with that if you never went to college, if your schooling is not very good.

As far as behavior goes, this hazing thing is basically the result of man-childs put together and only exposed to a single face of society. Hazing in some levels is about fun and just joking around, but things escalate quickly in this example because there's no self-control. Some of these players aren't even young, something like 27, 28.

There was a different episode, also with Santos' players, where they went on TwitCam and said some bullshits to fans and people who engaged them there. No one there (three players, the one getting hazed in this video was one of them) had the foresight and restrain to step back and think for a moment about what they were saying. The guy getting hazed here (ZÃ© Eduardo) even disrespected Robinho on camera when Robinho himself called them up and asked them to stop with the TwitCam bullshit because it was hurting their image.

I think the saddest thing isn't even the behavior here, but the lack of options these guys have. When they retire they won't have anything to fall back to. The amount of players who get paid very well is extremely small so it's not like they can live on that money forever. Ronaldo said something to that effect a month ago or so, only 10% of professional Brazilian players have a net-worth of over 1 million reais (my stats my be wrong, I can't find his actual quote, but that's the idea -- I think 10% may be too much though). Almost all of professional players live paycheck to paycheck and even if that paycheck is better than most professions it's not heavenly as it might seem.

,"This is not so dissimilar to the conflict between Russia and Georgia. The last recent skirmish between Russia and the independens in Ossetia, which resulted in Russia attacking Georgia, has a similar underlying premise. Ever since the fall of the USSR, and the independence of the satellite states, the Kremlin has hankered for a return to the old ways. Given the massive natural gas and oil reserves in Russia, they have a fantastically powerful bargaining chip. If they can just swing it their way... Watch any of the political updates of the last few years involving Gazprom and their contracts with the Eastern European satellite states. Countries previously under the USSR's thumb, but now independent, have been hit with massive price hikes for energy supplies. Russia, however, will not yeild to lowering costs, unless certain political demands are met. Now, back to Georgia. During the skirmish, Russian military forces attempted to bomb the pipeline linking the oil fields themselves to Eastern and Western Europe. They missed. Had they hit? Not only would shipping costs to western europe have skyrocketed, but also, Eastern European countries, who generally got a mixture of energy supplies from bot Russia and the Arab states, would have been forced to rely solely on Russia for the energy they so badly need come the cold harsh winters they live through. Russia has been threatening these countries with price hikes unless they play along with Russia's political desires. If Russia should succeed with destroying the energy pipelines, then these satellite states would be once again under Russia's thumb. Plus, as far as western europe is concerned, costs of getting the oil there would be massively increased, thereby fucking things up for the western dogs too. This whole power game over oil is the single biggest threat we as humans have ever faced - Economically, Environmentally, Politically.

At this stage of WotLK most of the better raiding guilds are not going to take you.  My guild has members that have taken a break before Cata and we struggle to fill our runs with the right classes.  If we need a spot filled we ask our friends in other raiding guilds â we donât pug spots.

The other big issue you face is ICC now shares a 10/25 lockout so while some guilds used to pug a icc25 each week most do not anymore.

Your wow-heroes link is interesting
http://wow-heroes.com/index.php?zone=eu&amp;server=Lightbringer&amp;name=Zaevi

To be blunt you have a few gems and no enchants.  You need a belt buckle.  I would not take you in a pug.  You have a few i200 items and some PvP gear on as well and that will hold you back.  Even just gemming with rare, not epic gems would be a big improvement. 

Some of  your gear could be improved from the drops in FoS/PoS/HoR Heroic.  Try to run these each day and hit up wowhead/atlas loot to see what drops from each boss in there.

On Wed or Sat try for an ICC rep farming run.  These just clear the trash and reset, but a little rep in there gets you an i251 ring. 

Are you running Deadly Boss Mods (DMB) &amp; a threat meter? Do you have a headset for vent/mumble?  Do you run recount to see how you peform?  These are all things I expect from raiders and other guilds will as well.  Also bring some fish feasts, mana, health and haste potions. Some personal buff food is also good in case you die on the trash, you donât need to use a fish feast just for one person. Flasks are also viewed as essential by raiding guilds.  Bring enough for the raid and an extra hour in case you need it.

Donât buy your raiding mats on a Wed night, the price is usually very high due to the reset that day.  Plan ahead and buy on the Monday :)

My advice would be to find a friendly guild that does some casual raiding in the lead up to Cata.  Hang out in Dal and get into any Naxx runs that start (you can still do 10&amp;25 naxx each week)  This will give you Justice points, and probably some upgrades.  Do VoA 10/25 each week and try to do more than 1 boss.  Do the weekly each week and do it on Wed night when you have more of a chance to get a group that might do more bosses.

Once you get a few upgrades you should be read for ToC runs as well.

,"&gt;I think its also a matter of culture. 

True. Actually it's a matter of the disparity of the cultureS.

&gt;I've been learning Chinese for about 6 years, live a pretty much chinese life in china, and the hardest thing about learning the language was not the characters or the tones (and grammatically its pretty easy). Its being able to immerse yourself in the culture. Chinese music/movies/print media just really isn't that appealing, for a slew of reasons.

But isn't the main reason that you are coming to it as an adult, with a fairly well-established (non-Chinese) cultural outlook on everything?

Children who are ""exposed"" to and/or ""immersed"" in it (and yet still significantly exposed to and/or immersed in ""Western"" culture) at an early enough age will have a different *blended* cultural basis -- so to them a lot of Chinese things will not seem ""uniquely odd"" or ""unappealing"" at all, they will just be taken for granted.

&gt;When China becomes the number one economic power, will swedish kids be watching chinese tv like they do american tv now? 

Well, American culture definitely changed during it's ascent, and while a lot of Europe, Latin America, and really the rest of the world ""embraced"" American things, the American culture was also significantly affected by them in turn.  

We took in European things (pizza, spaghetti, etc) adapted them, changed them, and then in a strangely odd form iterated them back -- whereupon the Europeans took to certain aspects or portions of them, and then adapted and changed them to suit themselves.

Will Swedish kids eventually be watching Chinese TV? Yes and no.  They will doubtless end up seeing SOME Chinese TV (much as American kids ended up being fans of some things from Japanese culture ""Mach Go Go"" (aka adapted as ""Speed Racer"") along with the Transformers, Pikachu, Manga, etc.)

During the early years the mixing of cultures always seems awkwardly improbable, nigh on impossible. Yet over time it happens and neither side tends to be completely swallowed up by the other, rather they change each other in entirely unpredictable ways over a time span of generations -- and what comes out on the other side is a unique new culture that would probably be equally and almost totally unrecognizable to members of either original culture a few generations before.",True,business,LWRellim,c143754,1426546796,False,t3_dz1qb,1,0,False,1,t1_c142sxo,t1_c143754,0,0,1288624221,,t5_2qgzg,

&gt; Do you feel if you were a student in Europe, for example, that you would have more opportunities for real work in Physics?

No!  The U.S. is the best place to do research in physics!  OK, if you want to work at the LHC, Europe's probably a better place, but there's much more money in the U.S. for science.  That means you get paid more and there's more money for equipment.  

In the U.S. we have a terrible pyramid scheme where a PI (principal investigator, typically a professor) has several postdocs (2, usually) working for her.  The PI will also have half a dozen or so grad students working as well.  Although it's easy to get a postdoc, it's really hard to become a PI.  This makes many grad students really, really sad.  The system is even worse in Europe, where (as I understand it), there is an extra level between postdoc and PI.  There, I believe a PI has several professors working under her.  At an international physics conference, I met several grad students from Europe and heard this.  Many of them really want to do research in the U.S.  When I said I'd like to do a postdoc, they looked at me like I was crazy.

,"For simplicity, let's only talk about diamond players that have used all their bonus pool. Top 200 players are like this because they play every day and have used up their pools (maybe they haven't played in *8 hours so they'll have ~4 bonus pool*, but that's no big deal). 

Basically the TeamLiquid (TL) poster is saying that the hidden MMR for those players is simply their visible rating + 1500. If that were true, then the top 200 list that Blizzard releases every Monday would be almost exactly the same as the rankings at sc2ranks.com (at least it would be accurate for that day unless somebody goes on a wild win or loss streak). [Here is last week's US top 200](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/994850#blog), a new one will be posted sometime today at http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/ so you can compare it against sc2ranks.

But Blizzard's top 200 always has players that are out of order compared to sc2ranks (with Dayvie jumping around the place as a common example). The players from ranks 150-200 are pretty close point-wise, so you'd expect those players to jump around a lot. But the top 20 players are sometimes wildly out of order with players that have visible 200+ point differences being switched around.

Excalibur_Z explained why there is a difference between the weekly Blizzard top 200 and sc2ranks.com [here at TL](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=165344&amp;currentpage=5#91).

,"Depends on how far you go back, what viewpoints you consider valid.

Hindu theology is not 'defined' in the same sense that abrahamic religions define their theology (that is- 'THIS TEXT BOOK IS THE WORD OF GOD').

Rather there are hundreds of texts, some on borderline atheistic philosophy, others purely on ritual and worship, fables and epic poems that come together to form the basis for hinduism, and multiple variants of each- Often contradicting each other. 
So all hindu theology boils down to interpretation- you can interpret anything any way you want to, even challenge the major texts- because there will be some text or philosopher that backs you up.

Texts from some eras staunchly support caste based discrimination while others don't refer to caste based discrimination at all.

I am no expert on theology (atheist), but some of the people I've spoken to who claim to be accomplished in the field say this-
The hindu religion (the religion of the protoindoeuropeans) existed before concept of castes came about, and that caste was originally just a classification based on occupation- which wasn't based on one's birth, but slowly became rigid and discriminatory.

As of approximately 2000 years ago, the hindu religion was very much into to caste based discrimination and ritual worship- probably one of the major reasons for the advent of buddhism.

Hinduism as of today (post independence and with major influences of philosophers ranging from swami vivenkananda to gandhi)- the preachers try to distance religion from caste as far as possible.
 
Like the priests who say that christianity and the bible did not promote slavery, they say that hinduism and the (casteist sounding) texts did not promote casteism and untouchability, that the relationship between two simply must be taken within the context of the times they were written in.

,"Despite what American politicians will have you believe, the fundamentals of the American economy are not that strong anymore. I really do think that if the US doesn't find a way to start finding a productive way to replace the low-wage jobs you're leaking to India and China, you're going to end up economically less signficant than countries like India and China, and even the EU. Anyway, your examples are bogus. In the great depression there was both serious investment and recovery (the argument that it might even have gone better is not an example, but a dogmatic statement of belief founded entirely on hypotheticals) and the hyperinflation in Germany was not due to economic investments, but pressure to pay off the warreperations decided in the treaty of Versailles: an expense with no productive merit. At any rate there is a huge difference between blindly printing money hoping inflation will stimulate the economy (which is not what's happening) and lending money to spend (which is happening).

As for my examples, you might want to look at the Marshall Plan, which was an investment of the US in Germany which created a great market for American products and ended up playing a large role in making the US the leading economy of its time. To stick with Germany for a moment, the government played a key-part in the very quick and succesfull industrialization of Germany right after unification in 1870.

,"&gt;Another point worth exploring is the role of inheritance in the employer employee relationship, and the formation of aristocratic classes through hereditary business practices.

I want to address this as well. This is hubris. It would be one thing to say there are some analogous properties of inheritance, but to just say there's the ""formation of aristocratic classes"" in the US is silly. Aristocracy is a system where some people are considered superior human being by birth, and not by merit or even by wealth. Sure, rich people get unfair advantages in the US, but our legal system isn't giving them better constitutional rights or taking away the constitutional rights of the non-rich. For instance, it's fair to say that India is still leaving a caste system wherein some people legally cannot do certain things by race or by birth. In the US, it's only fair to say that some people are born with money and that's pretty unfair. Still to seriously call it an aristocracy is enormously disrespectful to the horror that aristocracy really is.

Personally, I was born into a family with a single dad, on welfare, and we had to find a tenant for our house while we couch-surfed and were basically without a home.

One of my best friends, on the other hand, was born into a family where his mother is a multi-millionaire, and where she had, and he also had a lot of advantages I didn't have. Still, I would say I'm much more successful than he is today. 

In a real aristocratic system, if he were aristocracy, the most I could hope for would to be a house servant. If we both went into the same industry, he would automatically be an executive officer, and I would start on the floor - not based on merit or education or skill, but just by class. If we both joined the military (we both actually did in real life), he would join as an officer, and I would join as enlisted and there would be no way to become an officer. He would gain command of troops just based on his birth, and I would be carrying a rifle simply based on my birth.

In real life, he went to more expensive schools, got free cars, and got help buying a house, where I had to do these things on my own. Fortified by my struggles, and gifted with talent and intelligent, I succeed in our system where you *are* rewarded for taking risks, gaining skills, and making connections. 

That is *not* an aristocracy.

Now, before you begin to argue that I'm some libertarian who is enamored with our system -- I am not. I'm a leftist. I know that being born into certain situations can promote excellence and being born into other situations can doom someone to certain failure, and as long as we have a system where that is allowed to happen, we can never really say we have an ""American Dream"". 

I had some unfortunate, unlucky aspects to the situation I was born into, but I also had a lot of luck. I was born with a lot of genetic gifts such as intelligence and good health, and that's by no merit of my own. I'm a white male in the US, and I didn't do a damn thing to deserve those default advantages. I had parents who didn't teach me hate or cynicism and who encouraged me, while some people are so beaten down by life that they burden their kids with their own shitty attitude. I didn't have to worry about any of that. My friend had a slow start in adulthood because he had been so pampered that he was unprepared for the cold nature of the working world. He figured it out, but he sure got off to a slow start, whereas I left home when I 16, and had been paying bills and working my whole life, which made it easier for me to get my shit together early. 

For these reasons, I understand systems like affirmative action. Sure, it may not be fair on an individual scale, but the social effects are to break cycles of dependency in cultures within our country that have become perpetually poor. Sure, a black kid may be ""unfairly"" accepted to a university over myself, but it was easier for me to be encouraged by my teachers and I didn't have to spend my childhood proving to every teacher I had that I wasn't a thug. If we were more used to seeing black teachers, he wouldn't have that stigma. If I walk into a bank and ask for a business loan, I have better chances of impressing the loan officer simply because my skin doesn't give him the jitters. If black loan officers were more common, that wouldn't be a factor.

So, our system is unfair, yes. It is *not* aristocratic. To call it aristocratic is missing the mark. It's rhetoric. It's misdiagnosing the problem. We don't live in 1930's Europe where a lot of that revolutionary talk had more punch because people actually *did* live under aristocracy then.

If you want to address problems of class and birth, then you need to talk about the problems I did a few paragraphs above. Those aren't solved by the same kind of classist bullshit that caused them. They're solved by education: both educating the poor and also educating the middle class and educating the upper class. It's important to show the middle classes how much they're being used and to keep them involved. It's important to show the upper classes how beaten down the lower classes actually are and how unfair those disadvantages are. My friend's entire family has this shitty, unfounded idea that they're all little self-made Fords and that the lower class is just lazy. Finally, we need to make sure that the lower class is getting into well-funded schools that even the field. That they become educated technically, academically, and ethically, and that they're taught not just working skills, but also business skills and critical thinking skills that will give them upward mobility.

,"It's critical to remember that many of the things we know about the Mongols were written by their enemies. They attacked and repeatedly defeated sophisticated cultures with a bent for writing history, and they were naturally excoriated by Arab, Chinese and European chroniclers. More than that, you have to remember that the Mongols practiced a relatively straightforward form of psychological warfare: the more awesome and terrifying they seemed, the more likely an enemy was to simply surrender. A captured enemy was more useful to them in any case, as they would pick up auxiliaries in any region they passed through. While the Mongols benefited from their hardiness, their greatest strengths, the things that led to them to conquer the huge swath of land between Poland and Japan, was their iron discipline, precise organization, and born-into-the-saddle training.

And the point has already been made that the Mongols were not unusual for their time. Anyone reading a history of the medieval world (pre-Mongol) would have to feel beaten down by the endless drumbeat of invasion, counter-invasion, wars of ambition, wars of religion, and more. The great storehouse of culture and knowledge in Baghdad was itself the product of the great storm of destruction that arose as Islam was born and spread across the Middle East, into Africa and Central Asia.

&gt;Impact of the crisis on unemployment has so far been less pronounced in the EU than in the US


&gt;In the first quarter of 2010, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the EU27 was 9.6%, just below the rate in the US which stood at 9.7%.

* I withdraw my previous statement. In terms of unemployment the EU generally seems to be on par with the US. However, some countries are better and some are worse.

* If one we to compare unemployment rates, it's preferable to be as detailed as possible about demographics, area and industry sector. Something like 18-25 year old males with a tertiary degree living in Amsterdam working in IT.

,"You do know that Alexander had conquered Egypt, and it was under Greek control at the time, right (hint: click on the Ptolemaic Egypt hyperlink, read)? Regardless, the article also points to the Roman shipyard of Narni in Italy. But the true example of high-tech comes from the [Carthage Naval Base](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Maquette_Port_militaire_punique_2.jpg), which supposedly had a system of locks and defenses and individual docks for naval ships in a circular arrangement.

As to the fact that Chinese *scholars* believed in a flat Earth, here are a few:

*(Remember, the Greeks rid themselves of the flat Earth model in the 5th century BC and Eratosthenes calculated the circumference to -5-10% accuracy around 240 BC)*

[""Heaven takes its body from the Yang, so it is round and in motion. earth takes its body from the Yin, so it is flat and quiescent"" - 2nd Century BC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth). Zhang Heng calculates distance from the Earth's surface to the Sun to be 100,000 é (about 50,000 km, lol).

[Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo#Astronomy_and_instruments) Shen Kuo, father of the famous astronomical water clock, advocated heavenly bodies (Sun, Moon, planets) have spherical shape, but did not extend that thought to the Earth.

To avoid the charge that European learning took precedence over Chinese learning, Xu's memorial to the emperor stressed that the translations of Western methods were the first step in preparing a comprehensive systme of correspondences between Europe and Chinese measurements: ""Melting the material and substance of Western knowledge, we will cast them into the mold of the Grand Concordance system."" *Such accommodative language diverted attention from what the translations actually signified, that is*, **a new cosmological system**. Unlike Li Zhizao, who earlier in 1610 had stressed the *newness* of Jesuit calendrical methods, Xu, in 1631 minimized novelty and stressed accuracy instead. This emphasis on unifying European and Chinese was a tactic that would continue during the Qing dynasty. [*On Their Own Terms: Science in China 1550-1900*](http://books.google.com/books?id=KPEpPhlzPg0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), page 96, referring to political tactics used by Xu GuangQi, to convince the emperor to accept a European calendar model based on a spherical Earth.

[It is worth noting that the shape of the earth had not been a problem for either of the early Chinese and Greeks before the seventeenth century when missionaries arrived in China. For the Chinese the earth had been always flat, whereas the Greeks had taken for granted the earth was spherical. This seemed to be, at least at the outset, associated with what they considered as ""ideal"" form. That is, for the Chinese, the word of flat or square -fan -is associated with the much valued virtue of being righteous and robust, and in contrast, the Greeks considered spherical to be the ""perfect"" form, as evident in Plato's text. Yet, more distinguishing is that the Greeks went further to seek evidence by conducting experiments, while the Chinese simply kept to premise the flat earth in their astronomy (Chu, 1999).](http://www.ied.edu.hk/apfslt/v6_issue2/liusc/liusc4.htm) HK website.

,"A couple of reasons:

1) In the aftermath of WWII, G.I.s were viewed as heroes for going over to Europe and the Pacific to justly defeat the evil fascist and military regimes of Hitler and Tojo, which perpetuated the stigma that has been prevalent in this country that our soldiers had fought for just causes and the right wars which up until Viet Nam (aside from massacring the Native Americans but thats a separate discussion) had been the case.  Serving in the military was viewed as an honor.

2) Since Viet Nam was the first war that America outright lost, the country wrongly placed most of the blame on the soldiers that were drafted to fight it.  We thought that they didn't care, killed babies, and just generally lost it.  The Viet Nam vets were spat on, called baby killers, and were treated like shit when they returned.  Veterans affairs was defunded, which led to a lot of veterans not receiving the physical and mental rehab they needed when they came back.  That's why you had the stereo type of the crazy hobo Viet Nam vet for a while here in America.  Side Note: Rambo: First Blood is actually a very good book/movie about this.

3) Those in the military that do not go in immediately as officers are usually from the more impoverished demographics in this country.  A large portion of them are either misled into enlisting or have no other choice.  They were sent halfway around the world to fight a war the country was misled into and is no longer supported.  Coupled with the guilt that this country now feels about the treatment of our vets after Viet Nam, many people (is it safe to say everyone?) have taken the view that while Iraq and Afghanistan may be disasters that need to be ended today, none of the blame should be placed on the soldiers that were sent over there and they need to be taken care of this time when they come back.",True,politics,mojo975,c1441a3,1426547204,False,t3_dzb1h,1,0,True,1,t1_c142k9k,t1_c1441a3,0,0,1288637624,,t5_2cneq,

It's probably a roll of the dice.

I think the US is facing a slide toward a police-state (we've been creeping there bit by bit for decades), and what comes out the other side of the economic collapse/reset is anyone's guess -- possibly everything from a new totally clean libertarian republic, to quasi-elective-dictatorship with a centrally controlled economy (until that too collapses).

No way to know for sure.

As to Italy... well they've already been through all of those things (to a much greater extent than the US is) -- you'd know more about what (if any) lessons the population has learned or retained from that.

I guess to my mind the bigger country *ought* to have a wider range of opportunities, and more diverse situations (i.e. if you move to California it's not like you are prevented from moving around to the other states -- though of course the EU allows a lot more of that right now as well).

,"At this point, I'd only really recommend Shun and Global, in that order. I started with Wustoff, and they did me alright, but I just don't like how their steel holds up, and really, I find the traditional European handle/bolster/spine to be really uncomfortable. Both Global and Shun make wonderful products, but I find the handles on Globes to be too skinny. Plus, as a super-mega-bonus, Shun allows you to return your knives back to them for the entire lifetime of the knife for sharpening, for free (you pay shipping to them, that's it.) It's painless and relatively fast. 

They also have a much shallower angle on the edge, which I LOVE, though some people (usually those who are set on Wustoff/Henkles) only like a deeper edge. But goddamn they cut like butter. The only problem with the shallower edge is that you definitely don't want to A) use an electric sharpener on them (the edge is asymmetrical and the commercial ones out there don't have the proper angle) which is alright as they sharpen for you for free at the factory, and B) definitely DO NOT use a magnet hanger with these things. You'll bend the edge. If you go to Bed Bath and Beyond, you'll see it. They hang them all on those damn magnets and it ruins the blade. Get a nice block, or just get a [Kapoosh](http://www.amazon.com/Kapoosh-650-Holder-Woodgrain-Finish/dp/B000Q4I9LM) (I have one and it works).

Look, if you want to completely flip his lid, this is all that any home chef really needs (IMO):

[Shun 7"" Santoku, hollow ground](http://www.amazon.com/Shun-DM0718-Classic-7-Inch-Santoku/dp/B0000Y7KPO/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288640338&amp;sr=1-2). This is my goto knife in the kitchen and it can do just about everything. I use it on 80% of what I do. When I upgraded from the standard Safeway $11 chef's knife to the Wustoff is was an amazing, night-and-day transition. The heavens opened up and I saw the light (and more importantly, what a sharp knife could do for you). When I bought this 7"", it was exactly the same transition, only higher up. The balance, sharpness and quality of this knife over the Wustoff was what I had been looking for and it was every bit worth the money. Someone here mentioned that everyone needs a 10"". This is overkill. It's like cutting onions with a samurai sword. While it looks cool, all the extra effort you need to exert for those extra 3 inches just fatigues the wrist and arm, which is not something you want when prepping a lot. 7"" FTW.

Every chef needs a 7"". Whether it's a european chef's knife or a santoku is up to the chef, though you'll notice that santoku's keep getting more and more popular every year. I think there's a reason for this.

So, too, does every chef need a good paring knife. They go hand in hand and you cannot do without one or the other. My 7"" handles 80% of the work load, my paring knife handles 15%.

[Shun also makes a wonderful 4"" paring knife](http://www.amazon.com/Shun-DM0716-Classic-4-Inch-Paring/dp/B0000Y7KNG/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288640636&amp;sr=1-2) That's not very expensive. This thing will get in and get out, work in all the small spaces it needs to and do it with deft and ease. It's light, doesn't have much mass, and again, Shun's steel is wonderful (in my eyes). 

The last 5% is for a good cleaver. Don't be fooled by big money in this category-- the cheap ones are the best. You don't need super knives here, they're for doing the hearty, down and dirty, bone-breaking work, and the nice steels wont hold up to this work. [This is the greatest cleaver ever in the history of mankind.](http://www.wokshop.com/store/detail.php?show=145) I have the No. 3. It is quite possibly the best $11 I've spent in the kitchen. I'd gone through about 5 cleavers before I found this one, all of them failed to hold up. This knife holds it's edge forever (seriously-- in the 5 years I've had it, I've only sharpened it once), it's got the heft you want in a cleaver and it's ridiculously comfortable to hold. I would suggest this with everything I have.

So there you have it. I firmly hold, and you will find others to agree, that all you need in the kitchen is a really good 7"", a good paring knife and a quality, cheap cleaver. That's it. All those $600 sets with every kind of knife you could imagine are nonsense. I got a nice $150 boning knife as a wedding present and I've used it all of twice in two and a half years. Same with my carving knife. You just don't need them. They're totally nice when the need arises, but about 95% of the work in the kitchen can be accomplished by those three tools.

&gt;Whether you walk or sprint the stairs up requires the same amount of energy.

While he does cover it partially by saying, ""On the assumption that you do not sprint (burn more energy through arm/torso movement)."" He fails to mention that when you sprint, you need to use more energy to keep your internal temperature low (sweating) and increase some bodily functions in order to maintain that speed (breathing/heartbeat).  You could argue that it takes the same amount of heart beats to sprint 100m than walk 100m, but I doubt that doubling your speed doubles your heartbeat, I'm fairly certain there is not a linear relationship between the two.

Also, the model works on displacement.  You need to also calculate your change in length/width.  Stair require you to move up and down.  Even though you will end up directly above where you started, you still had to spend energy going sideways.

Android is one-size-fits-all, and this works to both Android and iPhone's advantage: the iPhone looks much more sleek and suave and less rough around the edges, and Android garners more sales and gets to claim the moral high ground by being relatively ""open"" compared to iPhone.

It's been this way for about half a year now, but only in the US. In Europe, Android's only 0.5% of the market to Apple's 20ish%, and Nokia's 50+% -- and the biggest reason is because iOS devices are availble on all carriers - not just one.

It seems it has always been about carrier choice, and never about ""openness"" or flash or any of that stuff we redditors love to debate, though we won't really know for sure until iOS become more platform ubiquitous here in the 'States too.

,"Africa is poor because of many factors.

1.) Africa was forcibly colonized and set up as a market for European goods. Raw materials were taken out, made in industries in Europe, then sold back to Africans for obscene prices.

2.) Africans didn't want to do things Europe's way when they finally kicked the Europeans out. Can you really blame them? That is a very good reason why large public sectors are more common in Africa. Europeans didn't do it that way, and Africa had many, MANY issues when they came out of colonialism.

3.) Many markets (especially agriculture) have their prices kept artificially low, so people can still purchase goods without prices skyrocketing.

4.) Due to horrendous amounts of government mismanagement, much of the money African governments had has been squirreled away by corrupt rulers and stored in Swiss bank accounts.

5.) Subsidies. Africans can't compete with the large national powers, because it will ALWAYS be cheaper to buy goods in your own country, rather than from Africa.

6.) Transportation infrastructure is nearly nonexistent. If you are a country that isn't on the coast, it is very difficult and expensive to ship goods.

7.) While African countries do have plenty of raw materials, they have to hire outside multinational corporations to actually get to them. These companies take most of the profit, and the country gets screwed in the process.

Believe it or not, most African countries do actually have regular elections. Socialism is really what they have, and they themselves want socialism. They are having issues with getting their shit in order, though. Honestly, who can blame them? They're quite infantile compared even to the U.S. Europe REALLY fucked around with them.

,"Here are some articles that examine this issue. I extracted key points the authors make and/or a summary of their articles. 

[Don't Buy the Hype on Pot Legalization](http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12485)

&gt;In a free society, the presumption must be that people can smoke, snort, eat or inject whatever they wish, so long as they do not harm others. The burden of proof should rest on those who would ban marijuana, not those who want it legal. That burden has never been met.

&gt;By adopting Prop 19, California can restore a presumption of liberty. That is reason enough.

[Drug Decriminalization Policy Pays Off](http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12476)

&gt;By any metric, Portugal's drug-decriminalization scheme has been a resounding success. Drug usage in many categories has decreased in absolute terms, including for key demographic groups, like 15-to-19-year-olds. Where usage rates have increased, the increases have been modest â far less than in most other European Union nations, which continue to use a criminalization approach.

[Drug Decriminalization in Portugal:Lessons for Creating Fair and Successful Drug Policies](http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10080)

&gt;The data show that, judged by virtually every metric, the Portuguese decriminalization framework has been a resounding success. Within this success lie self-evident lessons that should guide drug policy debates around the world.

[Marijuana legalization's unintended consequences discussed by drug policy expert in Stanford podcast](http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2010/august/humphreys.html)

&gt;Why theyâre scary is that big drops in price tend to affect primarily the people with less disposable income. If you're wealthy, it doesn't matter to you that the price of marijuana drops by half. The people it matters to tend to be teenagers, the unemployed, other people who have just a small amount of extra money. This will drop marijuana from something they couldn't afford to do, for example on a daily basis, to something they could easily afford to do on a daily basis.

[The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition](http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12169)

&gt;State and federal governments in the United States face massive looming fiscal deficits. One policy change that can reduce deficits is ending the drug war. Legalization means reduced expenditure on enforcement and an increase in tax revenue from legalized sales.

&gt;This report estimates that legalizing drugs would save roughly $41.3 billion per year in government expenditure on enforcement of prohibition. Of these savings, $25.7 billion would accrue to state and local governments, while $15.6 billion would accrue to the federal government.

&gt;Approximately $8.7 billion of the savings would result from legalization of marijuana and $32.6 billion from legalization of other drugs.

&gt;The report also estimates that drug legalization would yield tax revenue of $46.7 billion annually, assuming legal drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco. Approximately $8.7 billion of this revenue would result from legalization of marijuana and $38.0 billion from legalization of other drugs.

[Drug Legalization -- a Windfall for State Budgets](http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12185)


&gt;One of our points is that legalization will both save money on law enforcement and generate tax revenue. 

&gt;The issue of drug prohibition is part of a much bigger picture, one which depends upon our fundamental views on the extent to which the government should have a say over individual choices.

[Legalization of Marijuana: Potential Impact on Youth](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/113/6/e632)

&gt;Several recent studies concerning American adolescents, the Dutch experience with decriminalization (from 1984 to 1992), and the relationship between cheaper marijuana and use by adolescents suggest that decriminalization increases marijuana use by adolescents. 

[Marijuana Legalization: What Can Be Learned from Other Countries?](http://health.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/2010/RAND_WR771.pdf)

&gt;This paper provides a brief review of the changes that have been tried in other countries. The emphasis is on the nature of the changes and how they have been implemented rather than on outcomes.

[Examining the Impact of Marijuana Legalization on Harms Associated with Marijuana Use](http://wwwcgi.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/2010/RAND_WR769.pdf)


&gt;The exercise shows that the rise in health care expenditures associated with scientifically established health harms known to be associated with [drug] use are likely to be small relative to the expected revenue and cost-savings associated with reductions in criminal justice savings.

There is also no way for Japan to reach the center of our landmass, so even if they could get the population centers on the coasts the population can just move inland.  Air raids and economic strangulation would have quickly turned into a war of attrition that would have been unwinnable for Japan.

Finally, we have a much larger population.  In fact, there was absolutely no way for Japan to project power to a sufficient degree to dominate the USA in our hemisphere.  They could only hope to remove us from their sphere of influence long enough to entrench themselves to the extent that we would be unable to re-establish a foothold, which proved impossible even though we were fighting in Europe as well.

What the fuck are you talking about?  You seem to be very confused and can't tell the difference between culture and government.  

First off, the Roman Empire lasted a lot longer than a few hundred years.  The Roman Empire lasted from 753 BC to 1453 AD.   That's 24 centuries you ignorant idiot.

Egypt lasted over 30 centuries. 

And China.... has not always existed as a nation.  Heck, it has had more than a few ups and downs.    But even that is just China as a Culture that I am talking about there.  Current China as a nation has only existed since 1949 in its current state.    

The China as a Culture is the equivalent of the European West as a culture.  Which has existed for thousands of years.  Greece and Rome are the major foundations of Western Culture in somewhat the same way that the Xia or Shang are in China.   But they are not evidence of continuity of government.... which no nation can lay claim to anywhere on the planet.

,"Its always a good idea to look into the minds of the evil bastards that promote Endless War, or at least to look at what they publish and then try to determine the real goals that swim like dangerous monsters below the surface.

Mr. Miller makes a list of reasons that we should maintain a permanent war in Afghanistan. Here are his reasons:

**1.- Deny safe haven permanently.** The emphasis here is on the word *permanently*. This is the excuse for a permanent occupation. After all if we ever leave a government could come to power that would let Osama come back, right?

**2.-Prevent instability in Pakistan.** Pakistan was considerably more stable in 2001 before the US invasion. Pakistan is truly unstable now and the longer that the US occupies Afghanistan and murders Pakistanis with drone strikes, the more unstable Pakistan becomes. This is such perfect bullshit, that the real intention of the war insofar as Pakistan is concerned is the opposite of the stated reason. The War Party wants an unstable Pakistan as a nexus of problems that will never be solved and therefore will require a permanent presence of US and NATO forces.

**3.- Prevent Iranian, Russian, or Chinese regional hegemony.** There wasn't any danger of this under the Taliban, but now that the war is on, so is The Great Game Part II. But the US is incapable of the subtlety needed to win the Great Game. In fact, China pretty much already has it sewed up. 

**4.- Preserve NATO's credibility.** Why? NATO was an alliance established to protect Europe from the USSR. The USSR is dead and buried. NATO's new role is to give a multinational patina of moral authority to the American Empire's unilateral actions. The US drags NATO along by threat and bribe. The new NATO countries from Eastern Europe are interested in the $. The traditional NATO countries are afraid to piss off Uncle Sam. But these wars prove to be the death of NATO, sooner, rather than later.

**5.- Combat the global drug trade.** Ha ha ha ha LMFAO! Now, that's funny! The opium trade is mostly run by Hamid Karzai's brother and the CIA. How are we combatting the drug trade? 

**6.-Spread democracy** We are not spreading democracy, in fact we are showing democracy to be a sham that allows Western led tyrants and thieves t grab and hold power. Afghans are considerably less disposed to democracy now than before the invasion.

,"i have one other thing to say that's sort of related. 

everyone's talking about all the money that's pouring into the thing, and who is behind it. have you stopped to think about what all that means? no one is going to invest that much money into something without protecting their investment. that's a very basic business concept, and no one comes into the possession of enough money to throw millions of dollars into a campaign without having a bit of business sense. i don't think that these are very big jumps from idea to idea. 

so if you're going to protect an investment like that, how? well, obviously by trying to win so your employees (what we call politicians. think about the disparity between the money they make and the money they spend to win) will be in office to try to give you beneficial policies for your business. it's been this way for a long time. the word propaganda isn't new either. do people think it just went away? all the whacky racist wwI and wwII stuff just disappeared? no way, it just morphed into other things. catchy logos, flashy commercials. there's been more than the media side- some concepts and words are shaped in the collective consciousness to carry a connotation that makes most people recoil... and in this case, it's nazi. 

this is a pretty decent example. the nazi party (NSDAP rather) existed for over 20 years and became the dominant force in europe and the main belligerent on a side in the largest war in human history. they ruled germany for 12 years, and totally changed the situation on planet earth in only a few years. 

that's fascinating to me, but i don't expect people to see it that way, too. it's part of the conditioning to think that nazi = evil, no exceptions. ""oh yeah, erwin rommel, hell of a guy, fine general, but (sigh) a nazi. oh well."" i think this is just a result of effective long-term propaganda. the victors write history, after all. this isn't implying that they made anything up (they definitely did clean up the story a bit, though) but instead that they can write the record so they control past perception of the whole event. there aren't many people left who have first hand information, so once they're gone, all we have are our records. and since not many records from germany survived, all we have are our records, so our records become history. 

all this goes back to the idea that if you stop anyone on the street and ask them ""what do you think about when i say nazi?"" they'll say some variation of ""evil"" or ""murderers"" or something like that. you would be totally correct in an objective way if you said ""they made some excellent tanks"" or ""the army did a good job under tough circumstances."" if you said those things, you'd get total ridicule. i know because i've said shit like that. when you do anything other than agree with someone that the nazis were evil murderers you get treated like you just denied the holocaust. again, that's the steered perception created by a history written by the winners. 

so that's my rant about catching shit because i compared certain aspects of the tea party to certain aspects of the early NSDAP. in this one example, is it not clear how public perception has been used to close off an entire avenue of debate thanks to conditioned responses in certain people? most people of all types have at least heard ""those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"" but they never think about what it means. how do avoid repeating the creation of the nazis if you can't even discuss it?

,"Ahh... a Tea Partier walks among us. I want to ask you a question. What do you think of the UK? The UK openly calls itself a ""welfare state"" and prides itself in this, as many European nations do. I think that the feeling of an obligation to take care of your family and your neighbors through thick and thin is kind of ingrained in the old European cultures.

Yet and still, there's a lot of discontent in Britain with what people describe as ""class"" problems. My impression about this is a bit different. I think that the real issue is primarily a personality conflict between those who are more simple in their outlooks and those who reason with eachother every day on the BBC and in the British media about this and that. Maybe it's hard for ordinary people to understand the shorthand kind of discussions and reasoning process that goes on. And perhaps they feel left out. Is this the kind of thing that the Tea Party in the USA is trying to avoid? Some of you use the term ""liberal elites"" quite a bit. I wonder if this alludes to that kind of discourse which one sees if one watches political shows in the UK on the BBC.

The next question I want to ask is, ""What do you think of Canada?"" Canada has a very different style of public discourse with which they discuss their national and local issues. 

Australia has a third kind of zeitgeist. New Zealand has a fourth kind of national spirit. These are all our sister countries... we all have our cultural roots in the UK and Europe. If you know anything about these South Pacific countries, what do you think about their cultures and their governments?

,"The littlemonster speaks the truth.  Berlin is in my top 5 of European cities - very dynamic, diverse, growing, the center of a new Europe.  Munich is everything you would expect.  I've been to Dachau (Munich) and Sachsenhausen (Berlin), and while Dachau gives you more of the ""real"" concentration camp feeling, I can say that setting foot inside *any* concentration camp sends a chill up your spine and you WILL reflect on it.  Don't shy away - it's important to see the darker sides of history.

Street food is plentiful, and Doners are my favorite!  For wurst I prefer Bockwurst, but try everything, you'll find your favorite.  There is also an Italian/Pizza place in every town to city in Germany, if you're looking for something more familiar that doesn't start with a Mc.

I'd also recommend getting outside of the cities.  Small town Germany is storybook sometimes.  Half-timbered houses with flowers spilling off the railing, kids playing soccer in the streets, cobblestone streets - it's all there.  I've been to the Mosel area (if you like wine, GO THERE) and south-eastern Germany on the border with Austria.  Great way to unwind.  Small town Germany is both laid-back and efficient (such as taking a river cruise - the boat will leave EXACTLY on time, but once you're off, it's all coffee and cake from there on out).

While you won't *need* to speak German anywhere, it always helps and brings a smile.  Get your greetings, pleasantries, and numbers down, and you're ahead of the game.  German and English are very close languages - you'll be surprised how many German words you already know!  And Germans are extremely helpful people - if you're too bashful to ask for help, just stand around looking lost for about a minute, and someone will come help you.

$3k will be *more* than enough for 2 people for 2 weeks, especially if your accommodation is taken care of.  With that kind of cash flow, splurge a little somewhere.  You say you want to see great scenery, but not have to hike 6 days to get there?  Germany has many options for getting people out of the cities and into the country comfortably.  Do a little research, find something that appeals to you, and you can almost always book it on site.

Littlemonster has listed some good ""must see""s.  Germany is steeped in history, you'll bump into something important around every corner.  Oh, and yes, it's very safe.  It is unlikely that you would possibly find your way to a bad part of town, especially if this is your first time and you're unlikely to get off the beaten path.

,"I spent a semester studying in Germany, and have been to many (most) major cities in the area.

Everyone in this thread is talking about Munich and Berlin. Both are great cities, but I think there are two that top them (though they are both amazing places with lots to do). Look into Cologne and Freiburg. The nice thing about Germany is that you can make it there in a few hours by train.

Cologne's historic parts include a great untouched few blocks that are still cobblestoned, chock full of old-style bars and breweries that serve up Kolsch, the local beer (served differently than every other kind of beer I know). They also have one of the best art museums I've ever been to, right next to the worlds largest gothic cathedral. There's so much cool stuff in Cologne. Go see the bones of the three kings (I'm not religious but the cathedral housing them is so impressive).

Freiburg is a town whose downtown area hasn't really changed since the 1500s. It is nestled right up against the black forest, and is the only city in Germany with a Green government, so getting around by train is convenient and fun. You can find plenty of great local beers (Try Martinsbrau and Hausbrauerei Feierling). There are plenty of quaint shops, nightlife, entertainment (check the opera house!) and a very green/multicultural vibe buzzing throughout the city. To top it all off, the neighboring mountain has great trails that lead you to the top, eventually coming to a tower that gives one of the finest european views I've seen (The Schlossberg). I lived there for four months and I plan on returning as soon as I'm able. If you can visit, this is my favorite city in Germany.

If you go to Berlin, be sure to visit the eastside gallery (Painted Berlin Wall) and visit the posh areas of downtown. Go on a bar tour if you're inclined, they're wonderful. In Munich you can find guided tours of the historical points of interest in the city (in english, no less), and be sure to visit the Hofbrauhaus for some tasty beer, german food, and history.

Travelling in Germany has plenty of little secrets that help you get around and housed and schmoozing with the locals much easier.

This late settlement is very telling; despite some unique advancements, indigenous America was still a stone-age society when Europeans first made contact.  
  
Japan never rose to dominance primarily because they failed to understand the potential of gunpowder, and also because of China. Japan never had any room to expand because it meant either invading China or one of China's vassal states; considering China was the megapower of the region this was never going to successfully happen. Partly by geography and politics, and partly by their own choosing, Japan was extremely isolationist and failed to adopt technological advancements when they appeared elsewhere in the world. They were also in a constant state of civil war until the 1600s.

I won't argue with those.

The Civil War did result in greater (somewhat) voting rights, but that wasn't the only avenue to enable that change. Women got the right to vote without any wars being fought. Black men could have gotten the same right, had cooler heads prevailed during those times.

I'm curious why you included WW2, however. Germany didn't present a serious threat to the US beyond messing with our merchant vessels going back and forth to Europe.

Not sure where they originated from either. These next ones are copied since all the sites are the same - these aren't in my words, that is.

,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but a typical average IQ of a nation in south Africa is 80.  That's not ""very slightly lower on the curve than others,"" that's ""burn the witches in order to make the crops grow faster.""  If a US, European, Asian/etc state had an average IQ of 80, I'd expect the same kind of behavior there.

I was assuming that Forrest's IQ was around 80, based on the ""school"" scene.  If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, and I'll gladly admit it, but don't criticize me for saying that a nation has a Forrest Gump IQ WHEN IT DOES.  That's just plain dishonest on your part.

So your argument is that if southern Africa had NO resources, it would be rich?  I am unable to understand the mental acrobatics you must put yourself through to believe such nonsense.

You're basically saying that ""if humans weren't corrupt and selfish, southern Africa would be a success.""  That's obviously false, because dozens of selfish, corrupt governments (with fewer natural resources than southern Africa) have been more successful.

The second part of your assertion (accusation?) is that if humans weren't racist, southern Africa would be a shining light on the hill -- a glistening beacon of civilization for the rest of us to follow.  I assume you're referring to European racism, and not the Islamic racism that started the African slave trade (and not the African racism that causes Africans to kill each other today because of tribal differences).

This second assertion is false, because for every real racist that prevents southern Africa from (for example) getting loans, there are five anti-racists that give out loans to southern Africa, but nowhere else.  There is no shortage of well-intentioned, rich, celebrity do-gooders that stream to south Africa in order to make it perfect.

And, somehow, strangely, they all fail.

Perhaps it's because there are too many resources in southern Africa.  If only.... IF ONLY THEY HAD LESS!  THEN THEY WOULD HAVE MORE!

,"That's true, but you've got to admit there's some serious cognitive dissonance going on here. They're responsible enough to join the military and vote, but not to be trusted to no drink and drive?

Anyway, talking points aside, I think the real solution is to lower the drinking age and focus on getting people to drink more reasonably. Most European countries have drinking ages under 21, but they don't have the problems with drunk driving that we do. I think it would work wonders if parents would let their kids have a drink or two at home with dinner once they're in their early or mid teens. That way, they have their first experiences with alcohol in a safe, controlled environment, and they can learn what their limits are, how alcohol affects their abilities and judgement.

Then what's Central America?  And how about the Caribbean islands?  By that logic, eastern and western Europe would be two continents. So would the north and south portions of Africa.

This country has indefinitely borrowed (some might say stolen) the name of the continent.  That's because the founding fathers, despite all their wisdom,  made an unfortunate oversight.  They didn't give this country a simple, single-word name.

People from all over the continent feel slighted and offended by our use of the term American because it denies them their equal right to use it.  In other languages there's a term for the U.S. nationality but not in English.  In Spanish it's ""estadounidense"" and in French it's ""Ãtats-Unien"".

,"Morality is nothing else than learned behavior, not genetics. Thus, any normal human being, that is, one capable of learning, can become moral, which it only means able to learn and change to the established norms. So, killing people with different genetics than a certain group would not achieve the desired effect.

In addition, because Morality is relative anyway to a region or culture we can't kill them either because they happen to disagree with our local morality (although some norms can be universal). If it is ok for us to kill them, then it would also be ok for them to kill us. So, no, not a good idea. Now the ""moral"" Bible does think this is a good idea, and the result has been a never ending killing. Not very smart. For example, in most parts of Europe a woman exposing their breast in a beach is not immoral, she is just exposing her breast as any men does. No stoning going on in Europe because of that. Makes sense to me, not to the ""moral"" Bible and Qur'an. In some parts of Brazil, for native women, it is immoral (they feel dirty) to wear white women's clothes, to cover their bodies as those white men/women who have raped their country do; they walk around completely nude, the moral standard there. See, all relative. 

Now, murder is an extreme behavior from the established moral standard in most countries. Here we put those in jail, simply to separate them from society, and hopefully learn as to how to prevent these people from ever getting to that degree of extreme behavior (although most Republicans just want to build more jails, for example, influenced by Religion I am sure). 

Now, the idea of prevention, and also rehabilitating those already in jail, you can't possibly learn this new moral behavior from the ""moral"" Bible, please! We learned this new behavior precisely because we moved away from books like the Bible, and instead used our collective brain to come up with better, more practical solutions. It came from reasoning, not dogma. We have learned for example, from reasoning, not the Bible, that we should not kill extreme ""immoral"" people just because they act differently than the standards; we should give them an opportunity to defend their position in the case the standard is wrong, and needs changing, like when the Church wanted to kill Galileo for going against Church doctrine in saying that the Earth rotated on its axis and that it was the Earth which moved around the sun, not the other way around as it was the standard. Or we separate them from society if they are dangerous to the group (put them in jail); the ""moral"" Church would have burned Galileo to the stake.

,"I'd say Islam as a whole, and by this - I mean the religious basis - not the people - is about as much to blame for it as christianity is to blame for the persecution of other faiths, outcasts, and 'others' in medieval europe. (Gypsies, jews, and muslims being notable examples still relatable today)  

..which is to say - I don't believe Islam is at all to blame for it. These people, the extremists, are formed by their environment, growing up in squalor - in refugee camps, without proper schools, or learning. 

Indeed - it's believed that much of the recruiting for these extremist organizations has been done at religious schools, *offering the only available form of education.* 

The religion itself - and, by association, all adherents to that religion -(because when you denounce a religion - that is the effect it will have on those who have no particular interest in studying it.) - can not, I think be made to take the blame for what certain elemts are doing in it's name. True, they want a caliphate, they want their old empire back. (There are fascists in britain and france, who no doubt dream of the same thing) They want power, they want to matter - in a world where there is nothing for them, they get to make a difference. They get to be a part of something greater than themselves. 

..wether you're a neo-nazi, an israeli settler, a politician, an aid-worker, activist, communist, christian, buddhist, muslim or any ascribe yourself to any other understanding of the world, that's a powerfull thing.   So now, Islam is not to blame, Islam is a tool - just as any religion is a tool.  It's the people using the tool who are to blame, the people who allow themselves to be used, almost equally so. 

Well, that's my opinion anyway. :) 

P.S. I feel I should mention that it is my belief that (to inaccurately quote some unknown source) religion is like male genitalia - play with it if you want, but keep it away in public (don't wory, it's ok to show a bulge) and don't go shoving it down my, your or anybody else's kids throats.

This law violates free speech, and is unconstitutional.

The court doesn't give a shit. Every branch of the US government has massive blind spots when it comes to video games. All semblance of logic and reason is tossed out the window. They're not judged the same way as any other medium. You cannot convince a puritan to consider video games as an art form, and it would have to be considered an art form for there to be no loophole with which to uphold the law.

Like every other part of the US government, the Supreme Court is staffed with old people who don't know and don't WANT to know anything whatsoever about video games. Free speech doesn't matter, they'll use convoluted logic to uphold this ridiculous law.

So, the law will be upheld, and Wal-Mart will stop carrying any game with an M rating, or probably even a T rating. And since the large American publishers won't greenlight any game that Wal-Mart won't stock, the American video game market will be reduced to kiddy-game clones. Publishers can move to online-only distribution, but it will mean massive budget cuts, since you just can't make your money back on a large game without big-box retailer sales.

This will effectively collapse the American game industry, leaving the European market (which isn't big enough to sustain a large-scale game trend without American sales), and Japan, who will once again become the unrivaled powerhouse of the games industry (as if Nintendo needed a BIGGER advantage on the games market).",True,gaming,Sylocat,c1462jc,1426548155,False,t3_dzm1z,3,0,False,3,t3_dzm1z,t1_c1462jc,0,0,1288670987,,t5_2qh03,

I'll paraphrase his theory:

Basically Americans are not stupid, they only appear to be so because in the US there are so many well paying jobs and that creates a kind of selection bias. You see, the smart Americans are not in the cafes discussing politics like in Europe, they are busy making money on Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

,"I'm actually very passionate about the Mongols. Their military prowess and ingenuity intrigued me, go Subutai go. By our standards, they are definitely barbaric savages. Why must I write as if I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who thinks the Romans or Spartans were a civilized people. I'm 1/4 Greek and the only thing I like to boast about concerning that particular heritage is that I could be related to Spartans, in a way as if I should be feared, lol. Don't get me started on the other global empires, but the OP was a link to one of the Mongolian's infamous actions, and so the following discussion is, not surprisingly, focused on the Mongolians. I don't think anyone really feels the need to include historic comparisons. Who cares if I think they were barbaric, this was hundreds of years ago.

Would a German in the future ever look back at Nazism and be proud? I suppose, in that respect, I can see where your dissent comes from. That people shouldn't be proud or boast about their bloody heritage. I think it's always been that way when history has been written to make their cause look just. I really doubt the Mongolians have been treated that unfairly by history writers, because of the fact that those writers have a pretty general consensus on how the Mongolians conducted their invasions in China, the Middle East, and southeast Europe to northeast Europe. One thing is certain, the Mongolians won those battles, and they weren't bloodless. 

EDIT: Upon further reflection, ask yourself this. If you were a writer and you were conquered by the Mongols, would you write that your forces outnumbered them 3:1, and were outwitted tactically to the point where the enemy forces barely sustained measurable casualties, or would you write that your forces were vastly outnumbered by savage beasts without any morality but your defenders honorably fought to the bitter end, taking many barbarians with them?

,"I think you're assuming something here about an anarchist society that's not true, but it's a logical assumption: that is, I think what you're assuming is that if somebody could wave a magic wand and reorganize our political system into an anarchist one overnight, then as soon as people woke up tomorrow morning, that system would begin to destabilize and approach tyrrany as people within the system sought to accrue power for themselves and control others.

Now, that's true, they would in such a situation, but anarchism doesn't hypothesize only political reorganization; it's also dependent on a social reorganization. In order for an anarchist system to work, people have to actually *be* anarchists, and *think* like anarchists, just as if democracy is going to work, people have to think like democrats. For instance, in Western Europe, society is used to the idea of democracy, and so it fuctions (generally) pretty well; they are used to the idea of the rule of law, of checks and balances on institutions, and that corruption must be destroyed where it is found. By contrast, in Iraq and Afghanistan right now, societies that have been run politically by warlords and/or strongmen for many decades, the democratic thought process isn't in operation, and attempts at setting up democratic governments are running into problems--the only way to get things done (because it's the way people are used to getting things done) is through bribes and graft, and as a result, government is horribly corrupt and inefficient.

Likewise, in an anarchist society, you have to have people willing to participate in anarchist political processes: that is, a commitment to consensus-based decision-making, an understanding that coercion and hierarchy are bad things, and an opposition to permanent institutions. Of course anarchism won't work if everyone is constantly trying to subvert it, but democracy doesn't work if everyone is trying to constantly subvert it, either.

,"I recognize that religions exist, I just don't sanction their role in promoting and perpetuating conflicts. The issues of anti-semitism you implied are quite evident to me and I am sympathetic. Most of my Jewish friends are atheists but that doesn't mean they aren't subject to anti-semitism when it rears its head (though I imagine we would disagree about what constitutes ant-semitism). I understand the connection between the Jewish religion and its notion of nationhood. Coming from an Ulster Catholic family I understand how those connections are made. Of course, things are easier for me as I don't have to live in Northern Ireland but reside in Canada. Still, I understand the connection. (and don't get me going about what Canadian nationalism is). 

That said, I'm sceptical about attempts to naturalize the language of nationhood (not the word but the language of the modern conception) to the ""nations of the ancient past. It's enormously problematic to me. I'm sympathetic to atheist (or just secular) Jews who opposed zionism because the idea of linking the modern idea of nationhood to the religious identity of Judaism played into old religiously warranted tropes of anti-semitism. By adopting the narrative of the Jew as an ethno-national identity what hopes there were for Jews to be recognized as citizens in the new, modern nation states of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was severly eroded. I'm not playing polly-anna here, these were real issues and I'm well aware of the limitations they faced at the time. What I'm talking about should be familiar as the ""two loyalties"" trope that persists even to this day. As with much of this kind of debate, the issues were finally settled in favour of the zionists as a result of the desipicable crimes of the nazis (centuries of older anti-semitism aren't ignored by this statement but I would emphasize a qualitative difference even if functionally the brutality was of similar kind). Regardless, the categories of identity have not been fixed for all time. For that reason I do not accept arguments like yours that trade in naturalized terms and that hold Jewish identity to have been one thing for all time. This may not be your intent but it is the implication of the way you speak of Jewish nationhood and Jewish rights to the land.

The above observations about identity are crucial because it creates a space for speaking about Palestinian nationhood. You have a point when you ask for a historical basis for the Palestinian nation. In simple terms it is a ""facts on the ground"" issue. There were hundreds of thousands of Arabs living in Palestine (a long recognized term for the region) when the idea of the modern nation-state was thrust upon the middle-east in the wake of WWI. Whether they would have wished to have become a nation is another matter entirely but principles of self-determination and the complicated turns and twists of history made a nation that identifies itself as Palestinian. 

In anticipation of your potential response, this same kind of thing (different in detail, of course) holds for all nation-states. Even seemingly obvious examples of self-evident nations like France do not stand up to historical scrutiny. France was a kingdom for most of its history and its sovereignty was located in the person of a king and his dynasty not in his connection to the land of France (and regional identities far outstripped national ones in importance). The connection to the land ran only so deep as what the sovereign could maintain through force and treaty. So locating historical sovereignty in the way you suggest I do for the Palestinians is an absurd request. I will, however, play the game and run through your categories:

System of government, capital, currency: Palestine was part of a multi-ethnic, multi-religious empire as you well know. That does not negate the creation of a nation. If it did it would negate Turkey and many other modern states. Culture? Clearly it is part of a broader Arab (and majority Islamic) culture. The same can be said, however, for Christendom. Should that negate the separation of identities among Europeans. Language? My Arabic is non-existent but in my few forays into a desire to learn it I was confronted by the fact that accent and dialect play a significant role in the Arabic language. Is ""Palestinian"" a stand alone language? no, clearly not, but Palestinian arabic I'm sure marks a person out from the Arabic of an Egyptian or a Saudi or an Iraqi.

But what makes a nation? The men and women who made Israel did not have just one shared language, culture or currency. Indeed, in terms of religious observance we can hardly say they had a uniform faith. Modern Hebrew, as a written language, was reconstructed using Arabic. This after deciding that Yiddish was not going to be the way to go (or Arabic, or German or French for that matter). Culturally, modern Israel was a melting pot of European Jewish traditions as well as middle-eastern Jewish traditions. I'm sure you are familiar with the political and moral issues that surround the class divisions between the various ""kinds"" of Jews that have become part of Israel in the last sixty-plus years. 

You can fall back on essentializing narratives about the Jewish nation if you like. That's the role of nationalism. That's the *raison d'etre* of nationalism. But it does not stand up to scrutiny. I am very sceptical  and cautious about nationalism as a thing. I am and will be ardently pro-Palestinian nationalism right up till when they get their own state and have a nation. Then, I'll be right there criticizing them to try and transcend ""nation"" as a concept. The core issue is sovereignty. Without Palestinian sovereignty the problems of the region are insoluable. It is the basic reaon why I am sympathetic to the existence of Israel as a state (if not in its historical becoming). Once the Jews had become a modern ethno-nation, a sovereign state became a necessity (though not necessarily a Jewish state but at least one separate from the European states that had been such lousy hosts). If I'd been party to those debates I would have argued a different case than the zionists did -a single state of Jews and Arabs probably. Sadly, that ship is sailed I think. 

I think I've covered your questions and assertions. I did not touch on your bit about Jihad because I think you could probably guess from my other posts that I am not convinced by your elision of Palestinian, Mulism and jihadist. What you call ""calling them as I see them"", I call oversimplification and an inattention to contexts. I'm not defending violence done in the name of religion but to speak of a global religious war is nonsense. Indeed, it is worse than nonsense it is precisely what the evil religious bigots of the world want. 

Pardon any errors of spelling or grammar but I wrote this quickly so I could get back to work on other matters. I apologize that my last post was so incourteous to your faith - I may be an atheist but some things are not appropriate. I tried to take the time to address your points more carefully in this reply. I do not, however, back away from my other points and I emphatically believe that your understanding of these issues is dangerously narrow-minded.

,"Firstly; 
arguments are not logical/illogical they are valid/invalid.

Secondly; 
I've read the bible 7 times. When I was on a trip to Europe last summer I managed to get my hands on a 16th century illuminated Bible in Weimar (eastern germany). There is absolutely nothing in the Bible (any version) that states that God will right all wrongs. In fact, it is the basic teaching that God will not just hand things to you. 

What wrongs began being righted with the cross? Btw a cross is a torture device... how you can right things 'justly' and 'kindly' with a torture device is beyond me. Also, in the old testament (which christians conveniently do not follow) god is an angry/vengeful/fire breathing god who will punish you forever if you cross him. 
proof:
2SA 22:7-8 (KJV): The Earth trembled and quaked;... because he was angry. Smoke came from his nostrils. Consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.

I'm also assuming (and correct me if I'm wrong) that by the 'cross' you mean Jesus' crucifiction (for all you christians, Jesus' real name is actually Yoshua ben Yosif). How did that right any wrongs? It states that Jesus died for our sins on that cross. Clearly he died in vain because the sins that we commit now are not forgiven through his actions. Not to mention the clearly mythical sin of adam and eve (original sin), which happened before Jesus' or apparently any of the rest of humanity even existed, for some reason was not washed away through Jesus' crucifiction because we still have baptisms today! (baptisms sole purpose are to cleanse the newborn babies from original sin). 

Also your holy book is full of plot holes/inconsistencies and your god is absent from the world. Need to abandon fairy tale world. 

Spiritual healing doesnt work; if it did we wouldnt have doctors.
Religion doesnt help the world; if it did we wouldnt have atheists.
God is not that great; if he was he would have written a better book (or dictated it better to the hundreds of human authors that wrote it)

,"The bible itself doesn't say what he looked like, except for some fanciful descriptions in *Revelation*. These descriptions are obviously not literal -hair like ""white wool"", eyes like ""a flame of fire"", his feet like ""brass in a furnace"", etc.

The earliest actual descriptions are from [Celsus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsus), around 180 A.D., which claimed that Jesus was short and ugly, and [Justin Martyr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Martyr), who said Jesus ""had no beauty"". Both are silent on the topic of race.

The physical idealization of Jesus did not begin until around the time of Augustine, around 400 AD. Before that, people seemed to have been content to accept Jesus as ordinary looking, or even downright ugly.

The early church stressed that Jesus was of the line of David, and this meant that he was a semitic Jew. Therefore, they depicted him as dark and middle-eastern looking.

Jesus acquired his nordic European look in stages, beginning with the Crusades, but predominantly in the vast artwork of the Renaissance. In Victorian times and on to today, Americans and Europeans have gone even further, insisting he was white, for racial reasons.

The argument is that Jesus didn't have a dad, only a mom. And since his conception was ""divine"", fuck genetics. So he could be any color god chose, and god chose white because god likes white. Thus we go from near contemporary reports to church agendas to racist agendas, and Jesus keeps changing.

Celsus had some other interesting things to say about Jesus, such as:

1. he was a bastard, and the Jews knew that, and also suspected that the father was a Roman named Panthera (a common Roman name at the time).

2. His mom was a poor country girl who made a living spinning cloth.

3. That he was an observant Jew, and followed all traditions of the Jewish faith at the time, including making sacrifices.

4. That Jesus went to Egypt, which is perhaps where he acquired his different outlook on the Jewish religion.

5. That the story of his resurrection was spread by ""one hysterical female"".

,"Anarchism is based on organization without authority. There is no reason for any educated adult to assume anarchism is violent or chaotic or dangerous in any way. It is understandable, however, that many, many people are continually indoctrinated to see anarchists as bomb-throwing, dagger-slinking assassins hell-bent on spreading terror and violent uproar for no logical reason. You have to ask yourself why this image is continually forced upon the masses when only a precursory understanding of what anarchist philosophy engenders shows it to be a system of mutual aid, democratic equality and political freedom, though.

Anarchists are organized without authority. They are still organized. Anarchism comes from the Greek AnArchos- An: 'Without' Archos: 'Archons'. This in no way means violent chaos, upheaval, destruction, tyranny of suffering. Yet... how many media outlets continually enforce this false image?

Archons are figures of authority. Archons are expressions of a system that uses authority to validate itself. So, what then, is authority?

Authority is violence, plain and simple. Authority is punishment if you don't do what you are ordered. Consider this; that the classical conservative philosophers of the US and the original political dissidents of Europe and Russia that formulated a working theory of Anarchy (beyond the Greek's origin) agreed on some very universal concepts: that the sole and total sum of the State was that it held the absolute monopoly over the use of violence in the geography it claimed control over.

Ponder that for a moment; every claim for legitimacy throughout human empire is predicated by and based upon the central theme of being the sole dispensary of violence throughout the region of rule. To simplify: authority is the force behind punishment; the validation of violence by the state or it's agents (regardless of what semantic gymnastics the organization attempts).

So then, what is the opposite of force? What is the opposite of violence and authority, the ability of authority to say 'Do as I command, or you will have violence visited upon you'. Whatever apologetics you might endeavour to excuse the particular idiosyncrasies of some manifestation of the state and authority you personally agree with, in the end the driving force of control falls upon the same rule: violence against those who will not obey.

So, what is it that Anarchism espouses, if we know that violence is certainly the foundation of authority and it's central tool?

,"The problem isn't the minimum wage, the problem is the maximum wage.  The US is pretty unique in its paying of CEO's and Board of Director's and everyone else that isn't a peon.  



The CEO of Duetsche Telekom made less than $4 million in 2005, while the CEO of AT&amp;T (Ed Whitacre, who left AT&amp;T, was elected to Exxon's board of directors, and then helped GM revamp itself out of bankruptcy, and then left them in September) made $38 million in the same year. 10x the pay for running a company worth 2/3 as much.  Germany doesn't have a minimum wage in the same manner we do, it is calculated by the averages of each private sector, ie retail, services, bankers, mechanics, etc etc, the average income was about $30k.  The minimum wage in the US in 2005 was $5.15 or $10,712 a year , and the average income in 2005 was $23K (median was $45K). Since the average income puts us at $11 and that's a ratio of a little more than 2:1 to the minimum, we'll say Germany had a minimum wage of $7/hr and $14,560 a year (half of the average incomes $14.4/hour [30000 / 52 weeks / 40 hours = 14.42307]).  

Average Joe CEO in Japan had compensations averaging $1.5million.  Yes, One Point Five Million, not billion, not ten million, not one hundred million, less than $2 million.  Minimum wage in Japan bottoms out around $5.5/hr, roughly $11,440 a year, and the average income was only a bit higher at $13,256.  

So what we have here is a Japanese CEO earning about 131 times as much as a first day cashier and 113 times as much as the average worker, a German CEO taking in 274 times as much as a cart pusher and 133 times as much as a the assistant to the regional manager.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the typical CEO is taking in 3,547 times as much as the lowest person on the totem pole and 1,652 times as much as the guy who carts around the mail in the office.

We don't have a problem with pay disparity, we have a fucking epidemic.  The rest of the world has (for the most part) sorted this thing out, but for some reason here in the good old US of A we seem to think that the people that ran GM, Chrysler, eBay, The Home Depot, and Circuit City in to the ground are worth as much as THREE FUCKING THOUSAND CASHIERS.  Not every company is like that, some are better, some are worse (I'm looking at you, every bank that got a bail out).  

Not every CEO is only concerned about his pay check, but Bill Gates is the exception and not the rule.

I think part of the right answer is higher taxes, but the rate doesn't need to be 75%+, I really hate to say this, but I think the answer is a law about executive pay.  No person in an organization should be allowed compensation greater than, I don't know, 500 times the lowest paid member of the company.  That should include stock options. I know a lot of you are saying ""That's fucking absurd"" but I think if the stock options put you over that 500x limit, the money should just be used to purchase more stock.  Seems like a fair compromise in my opinion.  

I also think that the compensation of the CEO's and Board of Directors and etc should be posted publicly on the company's website and in every breakroom of every office, just like the minimum wage and OSHA (?) stuff.  If CEO's really believe they deserve more than 500x what the lowest paid person is getting, I think they should tell us why they deserve it.

Good, but they'd still be punished by decriminalization as they wouldn't have a good source for their fix, like they would have with full legalization. I don't see the argument against legalization. Why is your party against it? Is it just making drug use legitimate? Because it would not happen.

Anyway, my point isn't moot, as you were talking about scientists you learnt about through history books. I was offering a counter point about why they make terrible examples. Anyway, Heisenberg was born during the turn of the century, practically the 1900s, into a country that was going through, shall we say, a fiercely nationalistic period, one which also came with a distinct flavour of home-grown religiosity. It would have been highly unlikely to find a European atheist during the time of the world wars... As for David Bohm? Another early century guy, born during the Third Great Spiritual Awakening in America, on the eve of religiosity so fierce it would briefly encourage prohibition. Not to mention David's position himself, born to Jewish immigrants, who would have seen faith and culture as intertwined parts of their identity, with David's father being an assistant to a rabbi for chirst's sake. Of course he was going to be religious.

Now I can sit here and individually debunk every example you give, but fact of the matter is, the vast, vast, VAST **VAST** majority of Scientists are opposed to 'mysticism' as an unfounded money making scheme. Vast. You're finding exceptions to the rule, but they are few and far between. Most scientists believe in evidence-based proof and the rigours of the scientific method, not in faeries, unicorns, magical crystals and every child being born on the same day, at the same time living out identical lives due to the  placement of giant celestial bodies millions of miles away. Note how I group unicorns and goblins in with tarot, astrology and other new age crap. This is because there is an equal amount of proof for all these as there is for the effectiveness of new age piss-farting around.

,"I have to disagree with you, until the abortion issue, devout Catholics weren't single issue voters and typically voted democrat.  Historically, Catholics in America were often working class minorities (Irish, Italian, German etc.) who supported union rights, usually associated with the democratic party.  In the present day, Roman Catholics who follow their churches' teachings are anti-death penalty and torture.  Pope John Paul II was against the war in Iraq.  Many Catholics are pro-immigration reform, as many Catholics in America are Hispanic.  Some Catholic parishes actively try to help undocumented immigrants.  The Catholics in America who vote Republican are often passionate, single issue voters who are against abortion, some of them extend that to being against gay rights.  However, most Catholics I know, who go to church every week vote democrat, are uncomfortable with abortion (but are not single-issue voters), are against the death penalty, are pro-union and are for institutions like welfare. 

The Catholic Church historically provided social services that weren't weren't provided by the state (or in some cases were provided by the church which was part of the state), such as charity, hospitals, and housing the sick and poor.  I would argue that one of the main reasons that Europe is so comfortable with all these programs is because they have bee there in the form of a Church-State relationship for over a 1000 years.  I'm not saying they were always implemented well, or at all, but a central spiritual belief in the Catholic church has always been the need to take care of the poor (and monks, who were supposed to be poor).  

I'm not Catholic, I'm actually an atheist, I just studied a lot of medieval history in college.   I want to emphasize that the church did not always follow these practices and that wealth was often a cause for tension, especially between the papacy (which was often held by members of wealthy families) and monastic ideals.

That sentence proves, IMHO, that you haven't yet grasped the spirit of the pre-WWI-times. Even a democracy like the US had jumped on the colony-grabbing bandwagon and helped themselves to Guam, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines. Italy fought a war against Turkey to take possession of Libya. Belgium exploited the Congo, Portugal and Spain had their spots of African, the Dutch had the East Indies etc. 

To a German of the early 1900s, to forgo colonies must have seemed like sheer folly, i.e. looking on, and losing out, while your enemies and competitors became stronger.

&gt;Wilhelm wanted national pride and prestige through colonies and warfare 

That was the mindset of more or less every European (and American) nation at that time. The difference was that most of them unlike Germany, already had successfully helped themselves to colonies, fleets, and glorious campaigns in faraway places. 

&gt;Bismarck had solutions to these problems, give the socialist and lower classes small concessions over time

A good biography of Bismarck will reveal that he made those concessions grudgingly, and even thought of rescinding them before his fall. This was in fact one of his points of disagreement with Wilhelm II, who liked to think of himself as Emperor of all Germans, workers and socialists included. 

&gt;These solutions had worked in the past and there is no reason to believe that they wouldn't have worked again.

His administration can not seem to tell the truth about much of anything.

He keeps passing legislation that costs jobs.

His approach to foreign policy is a nightmare that offends our closest allies and kisses the asses of our worst enemies.  Worse, his foreign policy is unsteady and no one seems to know what the hell he is going to do next.

If the Korean issue spins out of control, do you seriously believe that Obama has the credibility to influence it in any way?

,"There IS a transitioned female player in professional golfing, she has been playing in LET and European Tournaments for many years, and does not hit farther than average women (the longest drive I think is an 18 year old), and can play in ANY professional division EXCEPT the LPGA because 'transpanic' occurred when she passed the European school to allow European Pro Play and passed a rule to make sure she doesn't play in the LPGA, even though the IOC has debated the standard for three years coming up with a comprehensive policy on athletes who have transitioned (which involves the time it takes to make alternations due to hormones and other factors).  

The very nature of the 'issues' brought up in these questions show the loophole that was created.  The rules tend to apply only to those who have had SRS, or genetalia surgery, and for female to male it is up to 14 times more expensive and not yet fully developed, so most transgendered men don't get it.  So, getting full androgyn/testosterone shots, and with a masectomy these men are told they MUST compete with the women, because they rules state they do not meet the requirements (which were created due to the illogical, historically inaccurate and strange panic that 'men will invade women's sports!!!' - take the Caster incident as an example - several transgender men have won competitions as men since the 1950's and that no one really cares should indicate a social trigger (one that should be faced and addressed).

As to height, women with Marfan's Syndrome, a genetic condition, which the US Hall of Fame Volleyball Player had who died during the Olympics produces extreme height in women (6'2-6'8) - and usually a percentage up to 50% of the US team, and other ranking women's volleyball teams have women with this genetic condition (it has a side effect, a thinning of your aorta which can cause spontanous rupture - the 'athlete suddenly fell over dead' stories - those are people with marfans usually).

A couple years ago, a transgender male high school shot putter was forced to compete with females though he was on testosterone (and win, and win BIG) because the rules are written for gate keeping out transgender women.   Maybe that indicates what males think of the sport victories of women?  That they don't matter? 

By the by, very detailed investigations into gender and the olympics have revealed that none (that's right ZERO) of the women who were 'gender tested' (and it used to all were, but the results were so innacurate that they gave it up), have been anything but female.  In the last 80 years, no males have 'snuck into the Olympics' - when will this myth end?  Maybe when the GUYS who participate ALSO get a gender test and ALL male athletes are told to ""Bend over and cough"" - since the IOC and IAAF are both male dominated committees, I am sure that gender tests would then be eliminated.

,"&gt; let's see those dirty, go-anywhere machines.

Actually, I was disappointed that my KLR *will not* go ""anywhere.""

It's about a 90% road, 10% dirt machine, even though my older version is styled to look like a motocross bike.

When I first got it, I hauled it in my pickup truck out to Holiday Valley
west of Palmdale, where I had ridden my Yamaha DT-1 250cc Single Enduro almost every weekend for years.

I tried to ride the same sandy desert trails, but the KLR's front tire would knife into the sand until I decided to let most of the air out of the tires to spread them out and stop them from doing that and stopping forward progress.

I've tried the OEM mild offroad DOT tires, I've tried knobbies with big knobs that were so big they caused the bike to rock from side to side on paved roads, and I have a set of medium knobs on the bike now, but it still doesn't do sand very well.

I took the KLR to Anza Borrego State Park and rode it up Fish Creek through Split Mountain and it was pretty well bogged down in the sand all the way.

I could go just as fast through the sandwash *in my car!*

(Somebody who was really going fast through the canyon was a naval aviator in an F14. He rolled his blue jet fighter on its side and flew through the split in the mountain like Luke Skywalker using the force to nuke the Death Star.)

One impossible solution to my KLR's lack of ability to go through deep sand would be for me to become 6' 4"" tall so I could stand up on the footpegs and get my butt over the back of the seat so the front tire is unweighted and floats on the surface of the sand.

That ain't gonna happen, so the *real world* solution is to find a 19 inch mild knobby tire to replace the 21-incher and lace a 19-inch rim on there so the tire floats on the sand without transferring my weight to the rear.

19-inch knobbie used to be common and cheap back in the late 1960's when a lot of desert riders were still using Triumph 500cc twins as the basis of their ""desert sleds."" They stripped off the lights and put a skid plate under the engine and they were good to go.

One of my buddies had a Triumph TR6 650cc bike that he would climb any hill with, but he was crazy.

In the early 1970's, the Europeans brought their motocross bikes over here and they all had 21-inch front tires for precision handling on harder packed European tracks and a 21-inch wheel was an optional accessory for my DT-1, so I mounted that wheel/tire combo.

But the DT-1 weighed 250 pounds and the KLR weighs 400 pounds. That makes all the difference in

,"400 million people below poverty line is unprecedented in human history. There are 400 to 600 million people doing okay. It has taken 60 odd years (20 years of accelerated growth) to reach to here. It will take at least another 30 to 40 years to bring most Indians into the middle class category. The list of problems India faces is very clear, exploiting political class,  inefficient government and lack of infrastructure. 

No other democratic country has faced this kind of problem before, not America, not Europe, not Australia. Some people from these countries do not yet grasp the magnitude of the problem and the effort involved. 
For example, Australia in the 1970's ended its anti aboriginal policy, and yet despite so many resources available, has still been unable to integrate its aboriginal population properly.
Even the 14 trillion dollar economy still has to contend with poverty, lack of medical facilities for all its citizens, people working two jobs just to make it, etc..

As regards China, we really do not know the true picture, no one can tell us with any conviction how many people in China are below the poverty line. China is a lot more than Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong. There is no doubt China has achieved a lot, but we do not know the true cost of it yet. 
We cannot, in India, follow the policies that China has used to create wealth, e.g destroying villages to create dams, etc.
India should stop competing with China, and build is own path to prosperity.

If someone says they cant live in India because they find poverty offensive or whatever, believe me, just ignore them. They can never understand the underlying issues, and will always point you the superficial ones. There are a lot of good things India can offer, but they will always ignore it.

The issue is like with other public goods: we need them, they are usually costly to produce but once produced the cost of using them is negligible.

To day the cost of digital production is almost entirely in the initial product any subsequent production is almost free.

Why not learn from other areas that have had the exact same issues for centuries and look at the business models developed around those products?

Some examples: public roads, public transportation, public schools, healthcare (European, that is). These are all areas where the ""public goods"" approach has been tremendously successful. Of course, most of those products have been deemed crucially important to society thus motivating governments to carry the initial costs.

So this applies to drawings? to photshop concoctions? 

to European ""apparently underage"" laws that outlaw 23 year old pony tail girl nudes and call it child porn? 23 year olds?

And to 15 year olds that photograph themselves in the mirror? The only trauma they get is the police arrest and inquiry afterwards!

And try to tell a 17 year old punk that he is a child, you might be sorry after he gets back at you.

That leaves only the TRUE child porn (everyone knows what we mean) to be discussed. Real children, and real porn. Not nude adolescents.

It seems there is a small amount of that around, most of which has been produced 20 years ago and will not traumatize any kid again. 

And then it remains to be explained, why maiming and killing children can be legally on youtube, or in prime time TV news and Hollywood movies. We have decided that it is impossible to create movies where children (err 16 year olds)  get actually clubbed to deatch without being exploitative to that child.

,"I'm an ex Muslim (atheist), half Arab, Frenchman. What you say is true. They should NOT be above criticism. If they react violently to criticism it's that their faith (or at least their confidence in their faith) is not solid enough to withstand it.

I am all for criticising Islam, but it is very difficult to know where to draw the line... like for Judaism, where is the line between criticising Judaism or Israel and being an anti-semitic xenophobe? 

But, by the way, the Pakistanis who hang around in groups and exclude others is a very Pakistani thing to do. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Arabia (all countries), and Iraq and Jordan, are very tribal cultures, and that is how tribal people act. It is not necessarily religion although religion does exacerbate this (it offers another reason to be tribal). They have done this to me, and I'm a Muslim too. 

It seems to me as well that you live in the UK? I live here too (in Scotland, but hey). The way minorities (including the Muslim ones) live and are treated here is very different to my home, France. In both countries minoroties tend to be among the poorer segment of the population. There are very few Pakistani / Indian origin immigrants in France - most tend to be North-African, West African or Indochinese (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, etc...) origin, and more and more from Eastern Europe. 

In the UK, minorities tend to live together, and there's the phenomenon of ""white flight"", and you end up with whole neighbourhoods of only Asian or black families. 

In France minorities do not end up isolated. Their living conditions are worse (living in council flats in housing blocks in a concrete jungle in the suburbs) but they are mixed with other minorites and whites. When the riots occurred in Paris and all over the country a few years back, many commentators said it was the Muslims but the violent groups were composed of whites, Arabs, blacks and even Indochinese. 

So I think what happened in your school is probably *more* a reflexion of Pakistani culture and British attitudes towards immigration than the religion itself (although I'm sure it plays an important role).

To be honest I find British attitudes to the subject a bit strange. Like, shariah law can be applied here in cases of inheritance, marriage, divorce and such. I find that worrying!

That's everything, I brought nothing with me, as it was unplanned, so I serviced it all myself and everything...

My planning also cost me money - buy maps beforehand... Eastern European maps shouldn't even be called maps... my god i bought a lot of them... (mostly less than $3 each though...)

Here in Oz, it would be harder, camping grounds are often the price (or more!) of hotels in Poland and Belarus, and towns are further between - to the point of having to carry food and water and camp!..

,"I will ignore your slightly rude tone. But I understand, the anti child porn crusade has seriously brainwashed most people so they get profoundly irritated, like about religious topics.

I will repeat my argument I posted below, as it really is directed towards you.

Interesting how people think this has nothing to do with men's rights.

Thousands of men get 5 to 20 year jail terms, often for possession of a small thumbnail with a nude girl that is potentially 16, but might be 19.

Or for having a nude photo of the girlfriend who is 16, over the local age of consent. He can have sex with her, but not her photo.

In Europe you get arrested for having a legal photo of a girl proven to be 22, by US age requirements, but looks 17, because she has pig tails.

And, due to purposeful confusion, a nude 17 year old photo in the mirror is called child porn. The same name that used to be given only to undescribable deeds with 4 year olds.

As someone mentioned, even if it is decided that 17 year old nude photos cannot be done without harming the poor 17 year old who took her own photo, the decision seems quite wrong.

All this should inspire terror into any man who crosses international borders, or who gives his computer to a repair shop.

Even a feminist woman has a small risk to have, inadvertently, a photo of a nude minor in her disk cache, due to an accidental click, a spam email, a virus, or her own son's curious surfing, or her underage daughters nude cell phone self portrait.

===========
so I hope it is clear why it is a man's issue. 

98% of people who might have a nude 16 year old photo on their computer, are men. But there still is the occasional woman who phtographed her baby in the bath tub and this possesses child porn.

And, as I mentioned, the issue about TRUE 5 year old child doing True porn is a fringe issue that still can interest men's right, but is a exotic issue for the few who are interested in 5 year olds. We can agree to disagree on that issue, if you can agree that men should not be locked up for having photos of 16 year old nude girls at the beach.

""The first baseball game recorded in Canada was played in Beachville, Ontario on June 14, 1838"" ""The London Tecumsehs of London, Ontario were charter members of the International Association and won its first championship in 1877, beating the Pittsburgh Alleghenies."" (Still, took how long for Canadian teams to join this ""world series""?  1960s?)

""The Guillo brothers and their contemporaries formed a baseball team in 1868âthe Habana Baseball Club."", ""In late 1878 the Cuban League was organized"" (bear in mind the Cuban war of Independence got in the way)

Tariffs... and a whole book.

&gt;Actually, normative statements through democracy. Both inflation and deflation have negative and positive impacts. The question is, which is ""better""? I'm conceding that I can understand either position, but the context of the global market has had its say, and it's that inflation is better than deflation. It's not science, it's qualification and values.

No. The global market has not had its say. The governments around the world had its say, and decided inflation for the same reason all the governments through history choose inflation and end up bankrupting their nations.

&gt;That's one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is culture (negotiating your wage is hard in America because employers are seen as competing with employees, a good explanation why our unions suck compared to others),

And yet, americans have had higher wages than europeans, when suposedly we (europeans) have ""better"" unions. Maybe is that you (americans) have ""better"" unions (in the sense that they are less active).

&gt;yet another is prior obligations (a capital owner is hesitant to lower prices because, though the money's worth more, so is his debt).

Capitalism without default, is like christianism without hell. Bad managed companies (like the ones that did go into too much debt) need to default so more skilled people take over or other companies take their market share. Defaulting is one of the most important parts of a market economy. Trying to avoid defaults is a horrible policy.

&gt;Being that those two affect all industries as much as it is possible and regulation affects various industries differently, I think it's at least unwise to say that the majority of the effect is regulation.

Sorry, you are going over the top here. This is a non-discussion. Regulations make the labor market more rigid.

&gt;Then in the interest of reasonable discourse, could you cite one?

1) The crisis at the beginning of the 20's that was brought about because of the bubble created to pay IWW.

2) The crash of 1837 in the USA.

There are more.

&gt;I didn't say that. I said spending money on things people actually might value is better than digging ditches. Is this statement really contestable?

Again, the problem is not saying it, the problem is knowing what ""people actually might value"". If this was really that easy, there would be no need for a market, and the ""intelligencia"" could run the economy.

You can keep using catch up words, like ""regulating but properly"" or ""a good president"" and things like that, but its not saying anything. If you really know what people value go out and get rich. But its easier to say than to actually do it.

I get the idea that the NFL is looking into expanding ""globally"" and all that, but the only reason they're considering it is because of money.

I think it basically screws over both the teams that have to travel across a minimum of 5 time zones (in the 49ers case, it was GMT -8!) in order to play a game in front of fans who aren't the core audience.

I know that a lot of fans overseas DO enjoy the games and I think that's cool, but I am glad so far that my team hasn't had to make the trip.  I'm not really all that happy for Bills fans that they get to watch their team play in Canada next Sunday, in what should have been a home game.

If the NFL wants to expand to Europe, then the talent will need to get a lot better (as it is right now, the NFL is really watered down.  It makes it more exciting week to week since any team can beat any other, but overall, to make it really worthwhile, they'd need a minimum of 4 teams in Europe.)

I don't think there's enough talent to do so, not at this point.

If they do expand to that point, I get the feeling that European teams will spend a good chunk of time either in Europe playing or in the US playing.  I don't know how they'd do it, as it would definitely wear on the players.

Yes, that's sort of what I'm talking about.

&gt;Capitalism without default, is like christianism without hell. Bad managed companies

Wait, a company is badly managed because it took on some amount of debt, then a bunch of consumers decided they want to save money (perhaps still while buying that company's product), the money supply contracted, and suddenly the company had to default or remain at high prices?

It is that easy, but you're misunderstanding the strength of the statement. Knowing that people might value some product or good X is different than knowing that they value it above all else. People buy what they value most, but if you give them something else that they value (if less), it frees up their ability to get the things they value most. An example is illustrative: I have no idea if you would prefer an iPod to a Zune, but I'm willing to bet you'd take a free beer if I gave it to you, and there's a better than not chance, if you're not a teetotaler, that it'll save you $5 down the line, which is money in your pocket.

,"I am getting tired because you are bringing new arguments, most of them false, and ignoring my answers or the point of the answer:

&gt;and if the people had such a problem with it, they could very easily change it. As it is, at least most people seem to prefer inflation to deflation, hence why you didn't see a bunch of governments get overturned when the gold standard lost favor.

90% of the USA was in favor of auditing the Fed. It did not happen. Go explain beautiful stories about governments being for the people to someone else.

&gt;Yes, that's sort of what I'm talking about. Because there's this stiff competition that's inflexible and unreasonable, unions run their companies out of business here because they refuse to take pay cuts (another reason why deflation in America has been bad), whereas European style unions actually negotiate with their managers.

Huh? You certainly have not been in Europe, and dont know much about it. That in some ocasions some government unions do something right it does not mean its the norm.

&gt;Wait, a company is badly managed because it took on some amount of debt, then a bunch of consumers decided they want to save money (perhaps still while buying that company's product), the money supply contracted, and suddenly the company had to default or remain at high prices? You're judging a company knowing nothing about its product?

First of all, the job of an entrepreneur, to forecast. He can get a high reward because he is taking a lot of risk, meaning that if his forecast is not right he is going to loose big. That is being an entrepreneur.

Second, your scenario is nonsense. You are saying that credit crunches happen because people decide to save. Nonsense.

&gt;I've never said otherwise. But to argue that it is the majority of the reason that it's rigid at all is not substantiated by intuition or evidence.

In fact, it is. There are examples in history where prices are less rigid.

&gt;You could say that such and such policy helped end the recession faster, or perhaps it just wasn't that bad of a recession. I thought that Non-Keynesian ideological economists were all against trying to draw conclusions from past economic events?

You though wrong then. In fact, non-keynesian economists usually have a wider and better understanding of history. I usually find keynesians very ignorant about economic history (but, to be honest, that could be because the standard government education is keynesian and then by default there is more non-interested keynesian economists).

&gt;It is that easy, but you're misunderstanding the strength of the statement. Knowing that people might value some product or good X is different than knowing that they value it above all else. People buy what they value most, but if you give them something else that they value (if less), it frees up their ability to get the things they value most. 

Huh? No. Its the other way arround. You are making the mistake of assuming that the government can create things out of nowhere. But its not true. Government takes income away from me, not allowing me to purchase what I really value most, then gives me something I dont value that much. That is a loss for me. And it also distorts the economic structure because it ""stimulates"" some sectors that in reality consumer dont want. It sends wrong signals.

&gt;I'm willing to bet you'd take a free beer if I gave it to you, and there's a better than not chance, if you're not a teetotaler, that it'll save you $5 down the line, which is money in your pocket.

Yes, if you give me that beer from something you produced Ill be happy. But if you take my money and then give me the beer when I wanted something else (what government does) I will be pissed.

You keep missing that the government takes first. You assume that the ""free"" stuff the government gives comes from lala land.

Again, the whole argument is that you were recomending some investments for the government, but you have not addressed the fact that the government burocrats dont know what people want.

&gt;Crises last as long as crises last. The problem with the boom/bust cycle is that we do not follow Keynesian economics and put the breaks on. That's really what makes things worse.

,"The background of this is very interesting. This is very quick and dirty, and can be debated to no end, but here's a quick summary: It goes back as far as the 17th century, but the real dispute traces back to the early days of Japanese imperial aspirations and the friction with Imperial Russia in the 19th century. Japan beat the pants off Russia in 1905 and Russia returned the favor in WW2. 

Japanese Naval expansion and the attack on Pearl Harbor could be traced to the battle of Khalkin Ghol, where the Soviet Army routed the Japanese and firmly put the political power in the hands of the Japanese Navy, not the army. The result was the continuing expansion of Japan into the Pacific. 

After the end of the war in the European Theater, the USSR, per the Yalta agreement, turned back to its business in Japan. When the US victory was pretty much assured (I believe after Hiroshima, but before Nagasaki), the USSR invaded and annexed the Kuril Islands. 

They are claimed as sovereign Russian territory and as Japanese territory. The conflict has been going on for many years, more recently as Japan has assumed a bigger role in world politics. Russia will not give these islands back, so it naturally causes tension. This particular incident pissed off Japan to no end because Medvedyev is the first Russian/Soviet leader to visit the island in a long time.

I don't think that it is a coincidence that most of the games played over there have been pretty brutal.  The best way to expand to Europe would be to put an entire division over there, which just isn't practical right now.

While I think there is more football talent out there than we know, but further expansion would certainly increase the pressure on certain premium positions like quarterbacks.  There aren't even enough good QBs to spread across 32 teams, let alone account for injury and expansion.

So we arrive in Heathrow Airport and head to Picadilly Circus to find the hostel to sepnd the night.... no problems. The next morning we wake up and jump on the next train goin to brussels (attempting to reach Amsterdam of course) Turns out we had a pretty long layover so we didn't reach Brussels until around 11pm when everything was friggin closed, un-be-known to us it was the world cup qualifiers in Europe so there was no vacancy anywhere, I mean nowhere! So we walked back down the road were some drunk douchbag tries to pick pocket me, not too big of a deal I had no valubles in my pockets so I oushed him away and told him to fuck off (I've been told I look mean) which seemed to work, spooked me all the same afterwards thinkin about what could have happened. 

Anyway we ended up back in the train station to try and get a few zzzzzzz's before the next train but they leave the doors unlocked all night for drunk bums to keep warm or something. Anyways I was asleep on the floor my friend taking the first watch when I hear a ruckus next to me, apprently this drunk guy wanted money but ""we had none"" so he tried to piss on me apprently (WTF) I woke up fully and started to tell him to get lost along with my friend which didn't work and he was gettin louder and louder in some unknown lang. This fucker just wouldn't leave us alone.

Out of the corner of my eye this guy just casually walks up to the drunk (until this point he was just sitting minding his own business) bum and politly asks him to leave in his own language, of course this doesn't work and the bum get all pissed off and this is where the most awsome thing I've ever seen happen..... 

The guy tryin to help us casually rolls up his magazine while arguing with the bum and wacks the rolled up magazine across the bums face around 6-7 (left to rigth type style) times and then politly asked him to leave again, the bum took off  like a scolded cat. He then tells us ""sometimes you just need to smack the fk out of them until they leave you alone"" he then went back to reading his magazine.

,"Hi Tsotha

May I suggest that Americans misread just how much they can afford to tax the wealthy. Somehow other countries have managed it. Loopholes are easily closed by a committed government. Have you failed to read how much of your country's wealth is in the hands of 1% of it's population? Of course the middle class pay a fair amount of tax in any country- that's why you need a well paid, and large, middle class. Your middle class is shrinking and it's pay is plummeting because the wealthy screwing everyone.

As for spending, your Democrats don't spend wildly in comparison the the Republicans. That is part of the joke looking at it from outside. Your Republicans spout drivel and their supporters lap it up no matter how untrue and unsupported by facts it may be. The Democrat plan is to lower taxes for the poor, keep them the same for much of the middle class and raise them for the wealthy. They will offer services for the poor and middle class.  They can balance the books doing that. Clinton was the last to do it. Your country's highest marginal tax rate on persons in the 1960s was above 80% (even I think that's 10% too high and I did get it from a secondary source so it's worth checking). Your corporate taxes are a joke. Historically in the US Democrats balance the books and Republicans run up deficits.

The Republicans will give tax breaks to the wealthy on the unproven idea that they will create jobs. The Republicans simply shit on the little guy every day and in every way.

I find this sad because I've visited the US and, overall, I liked the people. I understand that it's still a young democracy, though, and has to learn to distrust it's leaders and potential leaders a lot more. A leader like GW Bush wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes in Western Europe (except maybe Italy) and wouldn't have even survived the lower levels of politics in most of those countries.

I note that Democrats, in their media and in person, tend to elect people and then harass them at every step. They distrust the very people they elect which, is ultimately, the only sensible thing to do. Obama kept about half of his promises which is pretty good for a politician. Not counting the things he hasn't dealt with but including the things that the Republicans blocked him on.

I note that Republicans vote for someone they think is like them and then support them no matter what, having faith that they are doing the right thing without any stringent analysis. That's why, I think, the Republicans have an electoral edge. 

Republican voters distrust Democrats. Democrats distrust politicians. I do think you need a grassroots movement to build a police anti-corruption unit that spend it's whole time investigating and prosecuting politicians. My country used to be the only democracy in the world that had one... it got disbanded last year. Surprise, surprise.

The horrible economy is the fault of the Republican Party under Cheney and Bush (and Blair/Brown in the UK and quite a few other world leaders) and it will take from 4-7yrs to correct it properly. Obama was following a fairly standard plan (nothing he has done is radical or socialist in the eyes of the free world) that has worked in the past. The Republicans blew it- they shouldn't be given another chance so soon.

The reason, in case you're wondering, why I am interested in American politics is my country is an even younger Democracy, and we still have to go through a lot of what you guys are.

The problem I have with it is that it's a lie. If you see Ivory Coast, for instance, a team with great players, one of the strongest teams in the world, and they don't have a local coach. So what advance is importing coaches doing for sports in that country? In other African countries you have coaches just parachute their way into competitions and leave right after it. That doesn't help, there's no coordinated effort to improve the sport, to improve tactical knowledge in local coaches, to improve sport medicine. They get dependent on these one-time coaches and when they leave there's no continuity later eliciting another parachute coach to put order in the house.

*Some* (very small number) countries do have international coaches that are part of the football history of the country. I think Ghana has a Serbian coach that is there for 10 years or so.

Another point, which I think is much more important, countries have a football culture. That's true for any country and the weaker ones (sports-wise) have that too. What do you think of when people say Germany's football team? You think technique, control, etc. What do you think of when people say Brazil's NT? You think grace, beauty, agility, etc.

There was a time when African football had a defining culture, fast-paced and joyful football. Not the most tactical, not the most technical, but enjoyable nonetheless. Now African teams are an amalgam of players long separated from their homes, some coming now from England, others from Italy, others from Germany, etc. They meet a few times per year and a coach who never set foot in that country before gives them the whole tactical plan and they implement it like robots. Where is the culture in that?

Was anyone excited to watch Cameroon in this last WC? Ivory Coast? Nigeria? They didn't have to win, no one expected them too, but the style of play they played was *horrible*. Besides the color of their skin they was nothing in Ivory Coast that made me think ""hey this is an African team"", same thing with Cameroon.

I think coaches should be immersed in the country's football culture, while bringing other cultures with him (if needed, most settled countries don't need other football cultures, Brazil/Argentina/Germany for instance). Capello for instance probably has a good grip of what English football is and how to use his players, but he takes ideas from other places he's worked. Also he mostly picks his team from national competitions (although for England it's pretty much the only choice). USA's coach doesn't have to be American, but there needs to be a coach that knows what kind of football they play and is interested in evolving the national league. Same goes for any country, African countries specially. Until these countries have a strong league and stop only exporting players to Europe they'll never win anything.

TL;DR doesn't matter what the nationality is as long as the culture is preserved and the investment in the sport is continuous.",True,soccer,cartola,c147hbd,1426548811,False,t3_e01i1,9,0,False,9,t3_e01i1,t1_c147hbd,0,0,1288711490,,t5_2qi58,

Expanding the league to Europe? I just don't see it being viable. Even if the logistics are worked out, you've got dilution of talent to a large degree (you'll need at least 4 teams in Europe, more likely 6-8), and you have to draw people **consistently** - the London games are big draws due to novelty/scarcity. And you'll never move an existing team to Europe; people are in an uproar about the possibility of the Bills being moved to Toronto!

NFL Europe was only able to draw players who couldn't hack it in the NFL (again, the talent dilution thing), and average attendance was only 20,000.

,"These guys have a great idea. All respect due to actual Veterans, but we shouldn't be ignorant of the fact that the foreign policy of the British Empire was partially responsible for the escalation of both European wars into World Wars. British support for France and Belgium turned what would have been a quick repeat of the Franco-Prussian war into a 4 year meat grinder that shattered the old order of Europe that had existed for hundreds of years and resulted in a power vaccum filled by Hitler and Stalin. While British policy in 1939 was a bit more justifiable, we can't forget that the Germans were re-taking lands 1) populated primarily by ethnic Germans who wanted to be part of Germany, and that the land belonged to Germany for centuries and 2) that Poland at that time was ruled by a fascist junta and hardly a respectable state due to its human rights abuses, and that it was the UK guarantee of unconditional support that began WW2 and undermined any attempts between the Poles and the Germans to come to a peaceful settlement. 

We also can't forget our hypocrisy in declaring war only on Hitler but not Stalin when both collaborated to invade Poland and destroy the european peace.

Britain insisted on what would have been short regional conflicts into massive world wars, and this policy ultimately destroyed their empire and left half of Europe under Stalins thrall, hardly better than letting Hitler have his way in the exact same geographic space. Neither were our landings in France actually aimed to overthrow Nazi Germany, but to run the Germans out of France and western europe before the unstoppable Soviet juggernaut overran more of Europe than it actually did.

Basically what I'm saying is that Remembrance Day should be about analyzing the reasons history played out the way it did, what could have happened, and recognizing that our role in both conflicts was marked by just as many hypocrisies and hidden agendas as our enemies, and a fair share of atrocities and human rights abuses to boot, as much as it should be about honoring the courage of individual soldiers.

If the Ron Paul wing were in charge, the military budget would probably be cut by half. They support free trade and diplomacy, they just don't support being the world's policemen. Their basic idea is: all empires eventually go bankrupt. America is going broke right now, let Europe and other countries pay for their own defense.

&gt; an MBA is worth the paper it's printed on

Sort of agreed, I think the advantage is the connections you make and that the knowledge can be useful when applied. I imagine the connections made at Harvard Business School are decent. ;) I'm not saying I'd ever get one, but I am not going to look away if someone is interested in teaching me business concepts for free...

&gt; Did you stay in Cali the whole time?

Yes, but I did stints in [UAE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) (2 months) and [Diego Garcia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Garcia) (2 months). Both of those tours were actually amazing, as was California. In UAE I was put up in the suite of a hotel (this is not the Marines, you see) and my ""workweek"" was 2 12 hour shifts on, 1 day off, and during time off I had free access to beach facilities and whatnot (did I mention that a lot of pretty Europeans vacation in UAE?). In Diego, I drank 1 dollar beers, biked around this gorgeous island for fun, got a lot of downtime due to a lack of work so I surfed the Internet (they had free Internet there, but phone calls cost 5 bucks a minute!) and read books and played beach volleyball.

,"&gt;Of course if my current love was conservative, it wouldn't last longer than till the cumshot, but luckilly she's not, only the religion part that bothers me.

Ok, wait, woah, hold your horses partner. You mean to say she is progressive, but believes the world is 6,000 years old? You mean she is down with stem cell research? You mean she can accept separation of church and state, abortion?...either your girlfriend is a liar or you two are European.

I know what you mean when you said you fell in love, I thought the same thing when I was with my Catholic ex, and I bet you if Reddit had been around that time I probably would have made a very similar post to yours. I really was convinced I could gradually change her opinion, and in some ways I succeeded i.e. she finally agreed that the Bible was not historically accurate, but when I probed her how she knew which stories were fake and which were true and that it is possible for all of them to be false it was like I was playing Monopoly was about to bust out some big moves and suddenly roll doubles three times in a row. Its like, ""oh shit its working, oh damn two in a row!? I'm on fire! Three fuck! it was a trap!"" 

It seemed every step forward I could get her to take required three steps backwards, hell I even went to church with her as an exchange like, ""ok this weekend we don't do church and do what atheists do; disregard bullshit, acquire knowledge, next weekend we do your mopey and hopelessly depressing/retarded (no offense against the handicapped) shit.""...also not my words, just my thoughts on the matter.... 
Anyway, one Monday after having gone to Sunday mass with her she came over and I told her, ""I am not going to church anymore, it ruins my weekend."" She got all high and mighty and zealous ""you just wanna go smoke pot and drink and gamble with your buddies til late at night"", ""yup"" was my response and then I told her I wasn't going to be putting up with guilty religious condemnations neither. She asked me if I was breaking up with her, I bit my lip, nodded and said, yep. Then she started crying, oh my the waterworks this girl had. She was all like, ""ok we don't need to go to church anymore."" She had told me this several times before, it usually lasted a week, and I wasn't about to take that gamble again. I mean she was making offers to take her back that had me thinking, well holy shit its not everyday you go to trade in your used ;86 Chevy s-10 and come out with a promises of a brand new McLaren, but then it dawned on me, aha, there is a reason why that never happens, because offers like that end up being full of shit.

Pretty much, it sucks that you fell in love, because one or both of you are likely to get hurt as a result of it, that is why my advice would be to get out before you get too deep. I mean if you need further proof just look at all the Reddit posts that are similar to yours, look at the posts by married guys who realized they were atheists *after* they got married and how difficult it can be for them. You should be lucky you spotted this red flag early on. 

Let me put it this way, whats your favorite guilt pleasure/vice? Mine is weed, I love weed. But I would stop loving weed if every time I smoked it I would have to sit through a lecture about how all my beliefs are wrong (although factual) because a story book says so. I would stop smoking, cold turkey, if if every time I spent with Mary Jane it felt like walking on egg-shells around a topic too sensitive to talk about. I would never roll another joint if all my joints reminded me that science is more flawed than religion. But hey, weed is a plant, I don't need to worry about it finding Jesus under my couch (I keep Allah in the attic and Buddah in the closet, Jesus chills under the couch with other discarded/useless stuff...although I swear he steals the remote from time to time just so that I will look under the couch to check in on him.....if you haven't been able to tell by now, I am stoned, so I will conclude....in a little bit

My advice is break up with her, get over it as fast as possible, and find a girl who creates interesting problems, not depressing ones. It sounds like you had a better time with your previous girlfriend than this one, but then again, that is based off only a handful of words. Obviously relationships are more than common interests and views, but religion (especially Catholicism) is just such a buzzkill, they can make anything less fun/interesting/worthwhile. I'll put it to you like this, can you imagine living everyday feeling like your wife will convert you and your kids(and trust me she will try, she wants to see you and them in her afterlife after all). You will never make her stop believing, if you do, she will resent you for it, if you start following her religion, you will resent her for it....it will basically create a constant imbalance in your relationship, an imbalance that will require daily maintenance and I dunno about you man, but I got enough problems that I don't want to worry about the war on the home front every day.     

Again, I know its not positive and you have absolutely no obligation to listen to me, but take my advice, from experience...break it off before you are in too deep, and whatever you do, I mean whatever you do! Don't get her pregnant! I mean, I hope you guys are using condoms (which would mean she is just a cafeteria catholic), but if you toss some bread in her oven. Man! You're fucked for life.

,"Well, one thing that can be confusing is that U.S. demographics tend to generalize as American then broken down to white + visible minorities.  In Canada, you guys seem still classify as Canadian then break it down further to European descent.  So while I may be part German, Irish, Italian, and Scottish, I'm really just white.  That describes most white Americans.  So in terms of demographics, Canada breaks it down in terms of descent, making you look like the world's most diverse population.  But if we're lumping whites together here, we've got ~30% visible minorities in the U.S., and only ~15% visible minorities in Canada.  A third of our population walks down the street and is read as a non-white ethnicity. 

We do have a range of ethnic makeup and immigrant population in cities.  When I lived in San Francisco, 75% of the population was nonwhite, but only 40% of the population was immigrant.  In Pittsburgh, PA the nonwhite population is a little more than 30%, but the immigrant population is only like 3% of the city.  New York's immigrant population is 40% - that's 3 million people!  One U.S. city's immigrant population is equal to 10% of your entire country's number of people.  I have no idea what this means except that there are a lot of other examples I could give you of white/nonwhite and immigrant breakdowns across all U.S. cities that would show that each city has a completely unique makeup, racially, politically, socioeconomically.  The point I guess I am trying to make here is that our entire population and the places they live and work in are so massive, complex, and interconnected, each with their own constantly shifting identities that the two can't really compare.  Some of our cities are growing (Austing, Raleigh Durham) others grew fast and peaked (Phoenix, Atlanta) some are shrinking (Pittsburgh, Baltimore) and some have hit bottom and are seeing the beginnings of a renaissance (Cleveland, Detroit).  Some cities will never suffer any of these problems (New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles).  

In the town I live in, over 50 languages are spoken at the regional high school.  We're not a bilingual country because we don't affiliate with any one heritage.  How could  we pick a language?  Spanish is the closest we'll come, but to pick a second national language would be to put ourselves in a box.  We are everyone.

When I say politically diverse, I should mention that our two-party system has issues.  What I was getting at is that here, you'll find constant scenarios where die hard republicans live and work with bleeding heart liberals, and are forced to all get along.  It's less that we all agree - which you guys are better at - and more that we all are free to disagree, so long as we don't take it to extremes.  The fact that we have so much disparity of outlook in one place means that coming to one nationwide consensus on something like health care isn't just a matter of rolling our eyes at anyone who thinks health care shouldn't be universal.  They have their valid points too, and have every right to voice them.  We just have to figure out how to make it work, if that's even possible.

I am *all for* universal healthcare.  But I believe in some of the values and attitudes that are against it, and I think there are some benefits to some of the associated arguments against nationwide regulation of any sort.  I can go into detail if you'd like.

I just wish you guys weren't so quick to judge and compare because the two scenarios are like, totally different in almost every aspect aside from the drive to seek humane health care solutions.

,"&gt; ""Asian"" refers to PEOPLE from the Orient.

Actually that's not true.  Asian refers to people from Asia.  ""The orient"" refers to a specific part of Asia, not all of it.  While the term ""Oriental"" refers to different parts of Asia in different countries...Where I live it is specifically used to refer to South-east Asia.  Other countries like India, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran are not considered to be part of the orient...While countries like China, Japan, Laos, Thailand, Korea, and Vietnam are.  I currently go to a school with a very high population of Korean exchange students (As well as others, since TOEFL is not required).  Here, even the exchange students use the term ""Oriental"" in reference to people.

Oriental in reference to people only began being considered offensive by some in the 1990s simply because the term is considered dated, and somewhat connected to the attitudes at it's time and place of origin...Colonial Europe.

[Relevant link](http://www.nwhealth.edu/diversity/resources/MythoughtsonthewordOriental.aspx)

&gt;The book is titled Orientalism and was written by Edward Said in 1978.  Saidâs Orientalism outlines the origins of the word âOriental,â including the ways in which colonial Europeans heavily relied on the term to describe and denigrate âthose peopleâ living in the East (i.e. the Orient).

In my personal opinion, the whole political correctness thing with certain words has gone way to far.  If we seriously want to avoid being offensive why don't we refer to specific country of origin?

I'd guess what would happen as things run out would be that prices would increase and that would make the alternatives (or energy conservation)  more attractive.

I don't think we'll run out of energy per se in the foreseeable future - say the next thousand years - there's plenty of sunlight and solar panels only requite silicon and energy.  Algae biodiesel just needs a lot of ponds.

&gt; The United States Department of Energy estimates that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the United States, it would require 15,000 square miles (40,000 km2).[10] This is less than 1â7 the area of corn harvested in the United States in 2000.[11] However, these claims remain unrealized, commercially.

And it's worth pointing out that fuel efficiency has increased quite a bit since the oil shock. There's still a long way to go though. You can buy cars in Europe that have twice the gas mileage of the ones in the US. So the US could halve its fuel consumption even with present day technology.

In fact you can look at Europe as being in the US's future in terms of energy prices. Taxation on fuel is much higher and people just drive more efficient cars.

,"&gt; Your points about gambling debt and drinking are completely false. a quick check of wikipedia reveals that

Probably because this study was done **after laws were passed to make the legal drinking age 21**. When you restrict access to alcohol to minors, they tend to get into less drunk driving accidents. 1982 is around the time when, as I've shown before, most US states changed the drinking age to 21. If anything you've simply proven my point. Not only that, Canada is not the United States. It's a giant country with far less congested areas than the United States.

As a resident of New Jersey, I pay somewhere around the 1st or 2nd highest in auto insurance for the entire country. We're [the most densely populated state in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_jersey#State_population), so car accidents are common. Is this ""fair""? In an ideal society everyone should be paying the same rates no matter where they are, but the facts are the facts. If people in this state want to start paying less for auto insurance than they should get in less accidents, but that's simply the way it is if you live in a state like this. If kids in the United States can be morally responsible drinking alcohol, then the law can be repealed, but that hasn't changed, and all your statistic has done is prove my point.

And finally, what kind of moral responsibility can the majority of teenagers have? They are not accountable for anything because they are minors. So unless you want criminalization of substance-related crimes to be the same for a teenager as an adult, because then by gaining access to these things they should be recognized under the same consequences, you are full of it. You can't give a group the same rights but have special consideration under the law simply because of age. Minors are minors because we recognized they're too naive to be held fully accountable for their own behavior, so we restrict them from things that can severely influence that behavior from unavoidable high school factors like peer pressure.

&gt; Your point about 21 one being chosen because it is a time when you are going out into the workplace and make ""real decisions"" is exactly why the drinking and gambling age should not be 21. Kids need to learn a healthy behaviour with these things and the best way to do this is in a family environment. Throwing kids into the wild at 21 and saying ok heres a job and some money, also you can gamble and drink now is a massive temptation. A lower drinking age would allow a safety net for people that would be 'at risk' of doing something foolish.

What is the obsession with trying to campaign vigorously for a lower drinking and gambling age? You think it's going to bring about some utopian society by changing this?

The belief that a lower drinking age has removed the ""taboo"" element for youths in Europe and thus leads to less substance-related crimes is rubbish. If you have a journal subscription, you can read [right here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/107/6/1363) in a study posted by the American Academy of Pediatrics that Europe has a much worse rate of binge drinking. The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs also reports that Europe has [more underage drinking, injury, rape and school problems](http://www.espad.org/documents/Espad/ESPAD_reports/2007/SUMMARY-The_2007_ESPAD_Report.pdf) because of teen drinking.

Do I even have to mention that teens get drunk twice as fast as 21 year olds and have more trouble knowing when to stop?

,"I agree that vegetable oils including olive oil are pure fat and Americans are being lied to about the fat content in them and as a result are consuming way too much. And just to let you know I don't believe the good fat/bad fat ideology. Fat is fat and the body can only handle so much a day.  
 
I see you linked to your blog post that is selling a weight loss program and I'm surprised no one has called you on it. What are you selling? 

I'll [link](http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-butter-i1145?size=2) to some nutritional information about unsalted butter. Butter is 100% calories from fat with nearly zero nutrient content (a bit of vitamin A) . I'm surprised that anyone would claim that it is healthy to eat in large quantities. What nutrients are you deriving from butter?

You can also lose weight on an Atkins-style diet, but you also increase your risk of having a heart attack. Have you considered that? I've seen it first hand and while I obviously can't prove that case specifically there's plenty of evidence that a diet high in fat will cause heart disease.

To point back 100 years and say butter was used in large quantities by a population that was mostly outside working in fields all day, burning calories is misleading. Those people also ate pork fat on toast. Is that a good idea? Also, you're not looking at their entire health and only at one metric. There is plenty of evidence that people who ate fat were fat. Look at paintings of European kings and queens for example.  

&gt;People still think that butter and saturated fats are the reason heart disease is one of the top killers in this country (and now in many other countries as well).

Other countries are beginning to experience the same problems as USA because they are adopting the same eating practices as Americans. This is a recent phenomenon and only goes to prove my point, not yours. Most of these populations were doing just fine with large amount of starches (rice, corn, potatoes) with vegetables and small amounts of meat or fish.  

I agree that processed foods and sugar are also a big part of the problem.

I disagree.  The name had been established and used to refer to the whole continent for over 200 years before the U.S.A. was founded.

,"Of course specialization is possible in an anarchist society; even if you're talking about organizing communities of only a hundred or so people, surely the workers in, say, a microchip factory or an automobile plant count as a community. Right now society isn't made of anything but overlapping communities on that scale; anarchism (as I see it) is just about making those communities the basic political unit as well as the basic social unit.

Also, I think you've misassesed the amount of dissent an anarchist society can tolerate without destabilizing. First of all, what's it going to destabilize to? If you're sick of the people around you in an anarchist society, you can just go somewhere else. If you're trying to accrue power to yourself, people are probably just going to ignore you; and if you try to use violence to gain that power, well, in an anarchist society the state doesn't have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force, and I know plenty of anarchists who aren't pacifists, so good luck with that.

Secondly, the anarchist system is designed to make as many people happy as possible, and to meet the needs of everyone in the community effectively. This isn't exactly a fertile breeding ground for discontent.

Thirdly, as I responded to Hieronymous Bossk, the existence of an anarchist society is predicated on its citizens thinking like anarchists, just as in this day and age the existence of a democratic society is predicated on its citizens thinking like democrats. Your assumption is that if people are unhappy with an anarchist system they will seek to implement a different system, but people who are pissed off at the government in the United States right now aren't seeking to implement a monarchy or communism or a kritocracy; they're looking to simply alter the policies of the democratic government, because they've accepted the cultural discourse in which that is the dominant (or only) form of valid political organization. If you're an anarchist, and you're unhappy, you're still going to seek to change the community's policies, but you'll do so within the framework of anarchism, like a democrat working within the framework of democracy.

One of the goals of anarchism is to get to the point where people understand the anarchist system as intuitively as they understand the democratic system now.

Anarchism seems fantastic because it's very different from a lot of other political systems, but it's no more overly optimistic than democracy or, for that matter, monarchy or communism. It would never function as perfectly as its theorists would like if it was practiced in the real world, but *no system of government would*.

,"I would appreciate any corrections but this is the way I understand it-

General history  - Japan was isolationist for 250 years until 1850's Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay, threatening to burn it unless   Japan accepted unequal treaties. Japan overthrew the old dictatorship to catch up with the West.  Meanwhile, Russia, unable to compete for colonies with its European rivals, was expanding as far East as it could go.  Dersu Uzala, a Kurosawa movie, shows lyrically the relations of a Russian  and an indigenous hunter  of the areas north of China.   When Russia moved into Manchuria, Korea and with the Trans Siberian railroad coming, Japan decided to attack. Russia became the first modern European country to be defeated by an Asian country.  
Specifically - the islands are part of a long archipelago that probably has been fished by indigenous people for tens of thousands of years (perhaps the forebears of Kennewick man).  They were never claimed by Russia.
Japan on the other hand had always referred to them as their northern islands.    However, the Soviet Union was promised territorial concessions if it helped the U.S. and allies defeat Japan in World War II.   Russia waited to enter the war with Japan until Germany was defeated and Hiroshima.  It grabbed the islands and deported the Japanese.  Russia claims it has the rights to the spoils of war.  Russia and Japan have been in ongoing negotiations for decades over which islands will be returned to Japan. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute
With the U.S. and Japan weak and with China's expansionist claims to the whole area it seems Russia is staking its claim to be involved in any regional remapping.

You know, this argument is bullshit.  Peer pressure occurs everywhere, not just within Muslim communities.

&gt;Yes, I do agree with you in the departments of the state needing to go, and in the anarcho-capitalism enforcing the hierarchy of property as a form of tyranny.

How is democracy anything other than simply another label for the state? Coercion is axiomatic to democracy.

&gt;Scarcity economics could largely be averted, but not without significant change. There are millions and millions of acres of area that could easily be turned into power-and-food generating fields (rooftop and window gardens, solar and wind power, those kinds of things.)

I actually work happen to work in the solar and wind industry at the residential and industrial scale, so if I may comment on this: these technologies are not generally economically feasible without massive government subsidy. To be economical, one must be thinking long-term (at least 10-20 years), and to be sure the people who think long term and take advantage of that will reap the benefits. But they are far from a magical solution, and they also require materials such as rare earth metals which Chinese has most of.

&gt;We have technology that is the next-best-thing to replicators: affordable rapid-prototyping devices.

I am certainly away of rapid-prototyping, however it is not even close to the replicators. They don't bring us anywhere near eliminating scarcity, but simply allow us to ""spike test"" the feasibility of future technologies. Scarcity of raw resources are the bottleneck, not scarcity of high-level constructs.

&gt;We have a lot of the answers to end scarcity economics, but they aren't being applied because they don't make economic sense to the people who stand to make the money or the people who own the properties.

As I said your suggestions don't come anywhere near ending scarcity economics. And solar &amp; wind do make economic sense on the long-term, and to be sure some people are taking advantage of that. They will be rewarded in the long-term. I think a FAR bigger issue is government regulation of the market which distorts price signals. For example, oil is being subsidized heavily by the federal government. Without that, solar and wind would make more sense here. This is why you see renewable energy having already gained steam in European countries like Germany and Spain where military hegemony and subsidizes aren't available to provide them with cheap oil.

&gt;Because of the tyranny of property-as-hierarchy, we are being fed garbage at exorbitant prices, and being numbed to our pains by script-happy doctors (who in turn are being subsidized by the pharmaceutical companies.)

I believe that you may be seeing capitalism as the culprit where it is primarily the government. Private industry does not subsidize their own product; that doesn't even make economic sense from a self-interested point of view.

We're merely dealing with the aftermath of widespread failure of democracy. If representative democracy gets usurped by special interests, *and* are being rather obvious about it, *and* the going gets tough, the results are usually not pretty. 

The last time that happened it caused a World War. Here's hoping we're more lucky this time.

&gt; So this is a passive-aggressive attempt to call the US and its partners pussies?

Passive-aggressive, my hairy ass. It's pretty well known that the U.S. has not won a war against a major adversary since WWII (even then Russians did most of the work). As long as the kill ratio is 3000:1 or better (what is it now? 10000:1?) things are easy. 

I think the only way U.S. would not pussy out with a kill ratio approaching 1:1 is when invaded on home soil. I'm still not sure this would happen, but I'm willing to give benefit of doubt here.

,"Very well, you make many good points.  I'll be the first to humbly admit that I'm not all that familiar with the parliamentary model, except that it introduces slightly more choice into the electoral process.  That said, by all accounts I've seen, both the EU and AU are as perforated with nepotism as the US.

With regard to corrupt officials, I don't think that most people wake up in the morning and think, ""I am going to do evil today.""  They rationalize their behavior somehow, and often well-meaning public officials are compartmentalized, exploited and manipulated for corrupt ends.  I agree that said manipulation is in-fact perpetrated by a minority, and furthermore corruption exists on a spectrum.  The degree of corruption varies from individual to individual, but I daresay no official can escape its grasp.  I'd contend that, if not deliberate, either through negligence, willful ignorance, or simple complicity - most officials are corrupt in some way or another. 

Corporate shill is a strong slur, you're right - but such slurs pale in comparison to the massive disease, debt, and general misfortune suffered by the general public at the hands of said shills.  Perhaps it comes off as aggressive, but considering the state of society today, I think a little vitriol is healthy when directed at the right place.

""Fair"" is one thing, justice is quite another.  I tend to agree that the term ""fair"" is fairly useless.  No one can rightly expect to discern objectively between right and wrong in every situation, however given enough information, an independent judiciary and legal precedence I think we can ensure corruption and back-room deals cease to define our foreign and domestic policies.

Run for office?  Ha!  Well.. I have in-fact led organizations of ~150 people for years at a time, though not in a bureaucratic or political context, I feel I have more experience as a manager and leader than most.  I'll agree that compromise is paramount to the success of any competitive organization.  However, the gov't isn't really competitive, nor are the corporate monopolies and special interests that the gov't caters to.  Without competition, the compromise is often one-sided - evidenced by corporations successfully eroding our civil liberties and economic vitality over the past several decades.  Their version of ""compromise"" usually means that after they've robbed you blind, they say ""sacrifice your rights, voluntarily subject yourself to our dominance and we may just keep from *completely* destroying you - any questions?""  This is where most politicians, even well-meaning ones, sign on the dotted line.

There are absolutely worse places in the world today.  Most of those places have cultures and history which I know very little of.  It would be disingenuous for me to attempt to draw any kind of comparison.  

On the subject of gratitude, well - that's tricky.  I feel and immense, undying gratitude for all the people who have afforded me opportunities that I may not have otherwise had.  However, that gives me very little consolation - as there are many of my friends and family who have not been so fortunate.  It's difficult for me inspire gratitude towards a gov't that has systematically disenfranchised and indebted so many people for the sake of faceless corporate profit.  Even more-so when considering eugenics and the realization that several generations from now there may not be many free people left to feel anything, much less gratitude.

I personally wouldn't advocate a parliamentary system, though probably better than what we currently have.  I am inclined to believe that the ubiquity of technology and the internet will enable us to implement something resembling a direct democracy(but thats another discussion for another day).

,"1) There are four major caste divisions and literally hundreds of 'sub-castes', that are mostly limited to regional boundaries in rural areas. Big cities have a mix though, once you're educated you can go whereaver.

2) Am I sure WHAT is not different? Try to explain the question.

3) My father's family is Brahmin and my Mum's family is Vaishya. 

4) Very few Hindus have grandparents of different castes, even for parents the number is pretty low. Most parents belong to both the same caste and the same sub-caste. These are wild guesses but I'd say about half or so Hindus have parents from the same SUB-CASTE, and almost 80-85% have parents from the same overall caste. Within caste marriage is intrinsically related to arranged marriages- as arranged marriages decline, love marriages accelerate and the dating culture catches on, I expect a significant reduction in this number in the current generation. Social Media is finally branching out from the old 'don't discriminate' message to target the more passive and hidden evil of caste-based mating.
I suggest you google a paper by MIT Economics on India's Caste-Marriage equations to find the strong correlation between arranged marriages and caste.
Love marriages are of course, largely free of any direct caste preference. I say largely because I have actually heard some looney say that they wanted to fall in love with and marry someone of their own caste.
(My MIND=BLOWN)

5) I do not know.

6) No, I wouldn't, unless they directly told me for whatever reason, and it's the same for pretty much everyone I know. It's irrelevant. 

But I'm in one of the country's elite engineering colleges, the kind of people I exist with aren't an accurate representation of the nation as a whole. The same could be said of the school I went to- everyone had educated, professionally successful parents- (there is no casteism in schools though- it's only jaded, bitter adults that carry it forward) and the companies I've interned for were very professionally run, so once again, nothing.

If a guy was a hardcore casteist and was obsessed enough, he would probably try to extrapolate a person's caste from their family name, home-town, eating habits, etc. 

7) Some castes have stereotypes associated with them and if we're in a politically incorrect mood we might make fun of it- the nerdy brahmin, hot-headed kshatriya, money-minded vaishya. Otherwise not really, nothing statistically significant.

8) Caste's look differently? You really can't tell- fairer skinned people from north india might just tend to be from the traditionally 'higher' castes. It's an interesting topic though, there's a theory that the caste system was established when the proto-indoeuropeans, the 'Aryans', invaded India and the possibly-dravidian denizens of the erstwhile Indus Valley civilization were enslaved and made 'Shudras'.

Not too much proof for the theory though.

Also, skin colour is VERY heterogenous, varies within all castes, much more so all regions, and hell even occupations- you get a serious tan when you work outside every day, so you can't make generalizations without a proper statistical survey. 

I do think there's a chance that there's some truth to what may have been a racial/eugenic component of the caste system as it existed in the ancient past and the topic deserves further statistical examination, but this would require a massive survey factoring in DNA and phenotype differences over caste lines. 

9) Local elections and state are often caste based- if say, 1 or 2 castes are very common in a town, and you have 2 candidates, 1 belonging to the caste and the other not, candidate 1 will have a much easier time convincing the public to vote for him- the population will think 'This guy is from our caste, so he'll have our interests in mind', might not be true though. Certain parties try to woo certain castes by various means. Caste is an identity- every identity can be exploited to become a votebank.

National level elections for electing the government at the centre, are, surprisingly, majorly free of caste consideration- one of the good by products of the freedom struggle I suppose- that people actually leave petty squabbles aside when it comes to choosing a government to actually run the nation.

Elections in urbanized areas are also free of caste-consideration.

,"&gt;&gt;so I'll have to take your word that Palestinians had the best standard of living of all the Arab populace in the Middle East. 

Please don't. By all means check my assertions. One source that will give you immediate numbers is [here](http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=118&amp;x_article=1394).

&gt;&gt;I don't think that Palestinians would have traded a high standard of living for violent conflict without some solid reason.

It's basically a return to the illusion that got them in this quandary in the first place: the offer by their ""leaders"" of a life of much riches and pleasures after the Jews are swept into the sea. From the link above: ""Improved well-being did not stop the Palestinians from launching a campaign of violence in 1987. It is a curious fact that both the first and second Intifadas were launched during economic upswings. The first intifada broke out on the heels of the highest annual growth in 12 years and the second highest on record. This suggests that economic progress and political progress are not linked.""

&gt;&gt; but ""extrajudicial killings, mass detentions, house demolitions, deportations, and so on"" added to illegal settlements seem to be a more likely culprit for the First Intifada

A good point. The flaw is that prior to the first intifada there were no ""extrajudicial killings"" - if you can call that targetting a terrorist on the way to commit an attack, or targetting the infra-structure and leadership that enabled said terrorist in the first place. There were no deportations, house demolitions (apart from those initiated by illegal construction), or mass detentions. All those mechanisms came to be as responses to the heightening of the first intifada.

&gt;&gt; Egypt is not inclined to work on their behalf.

And yet for some reason Israel is supposed to ?

&gt;&gt; includes good faith on the part of Israel

All good faith Israel had for Gaza was spent in 2005. When the last soldier closed the gate after leaving Gaza, it had all chances and prospects to become an example of co-existence. Why Israel is supposed to do even more baffles me.

&gt;&gt; If for the duration of negotiations, Israel can't even stop building settlements, how will Israel and Palestine agree on interim borders, final status, or Jerusalem?

The building in settlements was stopped for 9 months prior to the beginning of the talks. In that interim, Bibi, the US, Europe, asked, cajoled, bribed the Palestinians to come and talk. They waited 9 months, knowing there was a due date for the freeze...and then complain about it?
Btw - the ""building"" in the settlements is minimal. The big news headlines mostly point to the giving of permits or planning, and little to no ground has been broken. East Jerusalem is under an undeclared building freeze. 

&gt;&gt; but I don't agree that Hamas can exercise much real military pressure on Israel. 

Low-intensity conflicts are a bleeding wound. Full scale wars are an amputation. Each drains the body in a different way, but the result is almost always the same. The fact that Israel has to divert resources to dealing with the LIC in the Gaza border is a major drain in the country. It doesn't need to translate into exploding bodies to be a credible threat.

&gt;&gt; As to why Israel has to pay for Gaza's infrastructure, electricity etc, I suppose that's because the IDF destroyed so much of Gaza's infrastructure and hasn't allowed the rebuilding of the power plant.

Would you mind explaining to me how come a power plant that has been destroyed and whose Israel won't allow rebuilding can be [closed](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/08/20108792815777160.html) by a dispute between Hamas and Fatah in August 2010? Israel supplies (and has ever) 70% of Gaza's energy. Egypt supplies 5%. How come the Hamas lets themselves be so dependant on Israel? How come they don't strike a deal with their Egyptian Arab ""brothers"" ? 

&gt;&gt;So far, due to the blockade, that choice isn't extant.

Actually, it is very much [existent](http://www.paltelegraph.com/eng/press-release/110-press-releases/7269-CAABU-Construction-materials-still-desperately-need-in-Gaza.html): ""Hamas has an adequate supply of concrete and steel thanks to the smuggling tunnels"". And is it being used to the betterment of their population? The same article continues: ""the Palestinian people who canât afford the inflated price of the Black Market"". So Hamas is not passing their building materials to the population, or doing the building themselves. Where is this material going then, one asks?

Well, here is one eye [witness](http://gazadispatches.blogspot.com/2010_07_01_archive.html): ""Just last week, Hamas used these materials to finish construction of a new jail (pictured above) capable of housing 800 prisoners. Gaza's largest prison was destroyed during last year's war.""

That Hamas puts the need for cells to jail their dissenters up and above the needs of their population seems to show very clearly where their priorities lie.

Your lack of logic is alarming, Irish people are British as they're from Britain - this doesn't really mean anything though as it's an archaic term, the proper modern terms used would be 'Irish' for nationality or 'European' for greater nationality.  Anything else is just meaningless geolocational babel.  
  
It doesn't change depending on time period, it changes somewhat depending on popular usage over time but academically the actual concise meaning has stayed the same - please remember here that someone corrected someone else on the use of a word, i'm simply point out that in fact the way the original person used it isn't only acceptable but it's historically technically correct.  
  
As for picking a random time period, you're saying that we should pick a different time period just so i'm wrong?  Seems kinda dumb as an argument, the little bit i chose to put was from the origins of the word - where it started, from here there is a very complex and involved history of english literature and politics and i'll grant you that for various reasons at various times what people take 'british' to mean has changed in the common vocabulary however even during the hight of Victoria intellectual texts and cartographers continued to classify the archipelago of islands as Britain.

Work was worse. The boy in the shift before hers was always just a little too good at his job, and that meant nothing for her to do. But, oh no, she wasn't allowed to bring a book or her game, and she wasn't allowed on the phone either. *That just wouldn't be proper*, her boss had said.

A: This is something we are putting a lot of time and resources into. Minimizing delay to servers, along with optimizing networking code, is very important to being able to enjoy DotA on both a casual and competitive level. Weâre expanding the Steam infrastructure around the world so the matchmaking service for DotA 2 is able to provide the lowest possible ping wherever you are playing. There will also be some uniquely located servers that are optimized regionally for handling longer distance matches.

Q: What kind of hardware requirements will the game have? (by S.Hong)
A: We donât have an official minimum spec just yet. The goal is to make sure that people with older computers and the PCs at LAN centers will be able to support the game, while also allowing for newer computers to scale well.

Q: I heard there was going to be an AI feature for when a player leaves. Is there going to be an option to take direct control of the hero? (by Stephen)
A: The AI features will be optional to the players in the game. You can have teammates use it, send it to the base, or give it AI modes and behaviors to follow.

Q: Will there be anything like the AI maps in DotA or a âtraining modeâ with difficulty levels? (by L.Pham)
A: Yes there will be bot support if you just want to play by yourself, or you can create a party of friends and fill the rest of the slots with bots. There are a variety of different settings you can use in order to configure the bots, ranging from selectable difficulty levels to specific behaviors that you want to practice against. For example, if you want to practice your lane control, you could configure the bots to be stronger at denying, last hitting, and harassing. Weâll also have some specially crafted challenge scenarios, similar to things like Pudge Wars, which Iâll elaborate on in the future.

Q: Will the replay system allow me to move freely backwards and forwards in time rather than having to watch a whole replay? (by Luciando)
A: Youâll be able to jump around to any point in the replay, add bookmarks for easy referencing, view detailed stats and graphs while the game is going, and watch through a specific playerâs view (with regards to their camera movement). Youâll also be able to watch replays with friends if you want to review a game or learn from your mistakes. To aid videomakers, the replay system will have flexible camera angle and speed controls. There will also be a bunch of commentating and editing features you can add to your replays.

Q: Donât you think you should make a lot of changes to the gameplay? (by Robert)
A: Significant changes would not necessarily make it a better game. There are countless features we are building around the game that will make the experience a much better one. The gameplay itself, though, has always evolved step by step, and it will continue with that methodology. We consider this a long term project, in the same way DotA has always been. We want to provide a quality experience and not just change for the sake of change. Youâll naturally see additions and improvements to the game as time passes, but it would be a natural progression aimed at improving the game for the players and not for other arbitrary reasons. Valve and I strongly believe that the player focused development process the game has gone through is what will allow us to continue making the best decisions with regards to where we spend our development time.

Q: Can you spectate an already ongoing DotA 2 game? (by Valo)
A: A lot of the game will be built around spectating and shoutcasting support. You will be able to join most ongoing games (unless the players marked it as private) and just watch them. You can join a game your friend is in, see what your favorite clan is doing, or simply pick a skill level and a hero you like and it will find you one to watch. We also have a system in place that automatically distributes the load to multiple servers so that the game itself wonât be affected by users joining to spectate. Our distribution network will allow us to support any number of users that want to watch, by dynamically assigning more servers to the task. There will also be special tags and search options to help you find live or old shoutcasted games. Shoutcasters will be able to operate as directors, so anyone watching will have his camera looking at the same things the shoutcaster is viewing. There is also an optional anti-cheat mechanism built in so that the game you are spectating can be time delayed by any amount of time to reduce potential abuse.

Q: Will you keep loyal to casting times like Torrent and will it still be possible to do the advanced tricks, like animation canceling, fog of war tricks weâve learned, etc? (by Lycan)
A: Yes, those mechanics are implemented. They are a very integral part of the game and it wouldnât feel the same without them.

Q: How will we manage replay files? (by Nikos)
A: They will be automatically saved with your identity online utilizing the Steam Cloud storage system, so you donât have to worry about losing them. Youâll be able to use the replay browser tools to search, sort, tag, rank, and favorite them. 

Q: Are you going to work on DotA after DotA 2 is released? (by Jack Lee)
A: I plan to keep DotA updated for as long as the community wants. That being said though, I think that DotA 2 represents the long term future for the game. 

Q: How will development change with regards to your role, current beta testers, community feedback, etc? (by Basel)
A: All that stuff will remain the same, except that now I also get to work with the developers at Valve. All of our current playtesters and even contributors like Kunkka are helping. One of the most important things for me has always been getting input from the community. There will be a lot of opportunities, throughout the next year, to give your feedback on all the things we are working on, ranging from features to visuals.

Q: Are the upgraded graphics going to be distracting? New graphics are great, but when thereâs too much, you canât see whatâs going on anymore. (by Lycan)
A: Gameplay is definitely the most important aspect, everyone on the team understands this concern. The number one priority is making sure players can quickly and easily tell whatâs happening on the screen at all times. Fine tuning the right visual balance with each ability, effect, hero, etc., will be an ongoing process as the game is playtested and we get your feedback. A clean and understandable visual representation of the action is important to everyone from experienced players, spectators, to new players.

Q: Will I be able to help test DotA 2? (by Sing Liu)
A: There will certainly be an opportunity to get involved with beta testing DotA 2 and help us with your feedback. Weâll release more information about how to sign up in the future.

Q: Are you going to do anything to make it easier for new players to get into the game and feel welcome? (by Arvin)
A: Some of what makes it hard, in current DotA, stems from the lack of services around the game that can help foster a better relationship between players and that itâs hard for players to be matched up with equally skilled allies and opponents. Things like tutorials, matchmaking, AI bots, identity, coaching, and community contribution will go a long way to making it easier for new players to fit in.

Q: What hotkey setup will exist in DotA 2? (by Stany Kaff)
A: We have a few default templates that cover the most popular configurations, but youâll also be able to fully customize them to your liking. You can customize it on a global level or on a per hero basis if you choose. The hotkey configuration will include everything, not just heroes and items, but also how you navigate in the game, control the camera, autocast, set control groups, etc. Your settings are saved to your identity online, so if you go to a LAN center you will not have to reconfigure your keys.",True,leagueoflegends,[deleted],c148vae,1426549460,False,t3_dzyye,2,0,False,2,t3_dzyye,t1_c148vae,0,0,1288731393,,t5_2rfxx,

,"You sir, are a very intelligent individual. I like the way you think. I tend to agree with your thoughts on almost all of this, more than anyone else I have spoken with.

I agree that we are 50-100 years away from Rome, though federal and especially the executive branch of our government has been gobbling up a lot of power since the turn of the 20th century. We gave Reagan and FDR a lot of power. Power which was generally used in our best interests at the time, but has been abused by presidents such as Nixon and Bush. I think the world is far to mesmerized and fixated on bickering with their opposite party they don't really see what is going on yet. I think we are still a ways away from revolt as everyone is just pit against each other, and they are not geographically divided enough to lead to an actual civil war, so instead the war is fought virtually, keeping the public locked in constant blinding battles, metaphorically speaking of course.

I don't think a committee would actually work unfortunately. Committees of that sort are remarkably good at getting nothing done. Especially after the initial phase. I think we need some sort of built in system to keep it clean and streamlined. I think that we need a system that forces organization and efficiency. Perhaps even a period where legislation go up for re-vote or/and an easier process where the people can petition to remove legislation. This will also force the laws to become transparent enough for the general populace to be able to familiarize themselves with legislation quickly. I also think that the more specific the legislation is, the more regional it should be. ie states counties even cities.

,"&gt;&gt;Seriously though, who's NOT fiscally conservative? I mean who runs on the ""blow it on bullshit"" platform.

That's a pretty heavy oversimplification (even for a drunk).  Paul Krugman for example (who I'm sure redditors are/would be quite fond of as he's a pretty far-left economist) was hammering on Obama for not pushing for a much more massive stimulus.  Krugman is someone who I'm sure would shirk a fiscally conservative label.

Also, FWIW, it's interesting that most of the reddit community (and America in general) would assent to some form of fiscal conservatism, so much so that it's even hard to name what the opposite position would be.  In Europe on the other hand, which redditors clearly have strong affection for, the notion of fiscal conservatism is almost peculiar.  Whereas the debate over much of government spending in the States is based on the question of whether solving social problems is the right role for government to play, in much of Europe the answer is generally accepted to be yes.

,"I know there are european redditors, so let me preface by saying my post is in reference to the finances of the US. I'm saying this so you guys know I'm not a self-centered American who only thinks of the US.

I am fiscally conservative. I think the way our financial system works now is way too risky for the reward it provides in the sense of the wealth our economy can generate. I think we need to reinstate the [Glass-Steagall Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act), and I think we should raise taxes, reduce government spending in sensible ways, namely military spending. We rank first in military spending per year. I am not saying we should relinquish that spot, but we absolutely should not be spending more than the next 12 countries on the same ranking list combined. Social Security needs a major overhaul, and future social programs need to generate some kind of revenue on their own accord instead of being fully funded through tax revenue.

Other than that, I think we need to let capitalism flourish. Over the years it has been proven that Adam Smith's invisible hand is not completely infallible, and I think we need to adjust our system as needed to maximize the benefit of our financial structure.

And with that all being said, in terms of social benefit programs paid for by the government, Lewis Black said it the best yesterday on my NPR station, ""People are not property.

,"I think I disagree on one main point with you, and it comes down to this:

&gt; One of the two places you do see government imposing itself to the dislike of the citizenry, socially, is in the crime and crime prevention area. Since the Bush years, a number of programs have sprung up revealing programs whereby American citizens are detained, spied on illegally, etc, not to mention things like the Patriot Act, or current manifestations of the drug wars. But anger against this usually comes from more leftwardly leaving people, and rarely in the context of limited government, so I don't think that's what the phrase means either. 

I have often seen exactly this being claimed in the name of limited government. Things like excessive police force, drug prohibition, capital punishment, gun control and others are argued against because they overstep the bounds of the government.

Taxes are another example. I have heard it argued a number of times that there is no problem in principle with taxes being used for a social safety net and such, but the use of force to collect taxes is the problem. People can go to jail for not paying or even for incorrectly paying taxes, or pay fines, and that oversteps the bounds again. If there was a way to collect taxes without force, it would be OK. 

So I really think that side of does very much exist. But let's take a look at the other side, the people who want to limit control of the economy.

This section seems to divide yet again into two parts. One side seems to think the free market is perfect and cannot be improved upon. I suspect *these* are the people you are talking about, and they certainly seem to be popping up quite a bit lately and might form the majority, so I'll give you that if that is what you mean. 

But I think there is another closely related side, which is the side that argues that while the free market is *not* perfect, the government is *even more* inefficient in many cases. I think this is an important distinction however. These are people for example who could be convinced that the health care system would work better with some government intervention, since for example European systems where that is the case already seem to be outperforming the USA where there seems to be less regulation. But when you hear that the US is paying more for air-conditioned tents in Afghanistan and Iraq than then entire NASA budget, the inefficiency of government operations becomes somewhat clear. Even the NASA budget seems a bit much when you consider how far SpaceX seems to be getting with what would be only part of the annual NASA budget (they are close to being able to take people to the ISS and back). They are even making a profit.

I'm describing what I think other people mean by ""limited government"", not my own opinions, but I think this has helped clarify to myself what I think about it, and it could be summarized like this: Many of the things that the government does, the laws they've made, the things they spend money on, are ineffective and sometimes counter-productive. It would be useful to take a good look at government and find out what it does well and what it does badly. Then the things it does badly should be curbed or replaced with better systems. Solutions which require less government intervention would be preferable because of the decreased risk of error on the part of the government, and the decreased use of power.

'Ripples' were felt across the world as nations from every (non-polar) continent entered the war.""

&gt;Roast Duck:

Someone will drag you to a roast duck restaurant. It's absolutely delicious, and there are a few places that do it well. The one all the foreigners (and people from China) go to is ""Quan Jude"". The most famous one. However, all the native Beijingers know that ""Da Zhong"" is the best roast duck in Beijing. A well-kept secret.

For another shop, ""Bian Yifang"", the oldest roast duck place (est. 1416) and is steeped in tradition. 

---

&gt;Bars: 

The common bar street is ""Sanlitun"" close to the Embassy district (I think it's actually located in Chaoyang district), but the best bar street is in ""Houhai"". It's a series of 2-3 interconnected lakes in the middle of the city, very close to the main street (Chang'an). You can rent a electric boat for cheap, and drink your night away either on the boat, or one of the many bars that line the sides of the lakes.

I don't go out much in Beijing as I'm usually with family. But the good bar districts are in Chaoyang and Dongcheng. Both are heavily Westernized and by no means cheap.

---

&gt;Art:

This area I don't know too much about. However, there is a street specializing in traditional Chinese art and calligraphy somewhere close to one of the 8 Quanjude locations in Beijing. I went there with my grandfather to get a calligraphy piece framed. Also not a tourist trap and primarily serves Chinese artists and hobbists. The pieces here are fairly certain to be done by hand. Whereas if you buy art in a tourist district, it will be a reprint, but for much cheaper. If that's what you're looking for. See below:

---

&gt;Knockoffs: 

Two are the most famous. The first is ""Yaxiu"" in the embassy district. The second is ""Xiu Shui Jie"" in Chaoyang district. 

The latter is easier to get to as there is a subway station directly connected to it. The station is either ""Yong Anli"" or ""Da Wanglu"", I can't remember, but both of them are on the main line (the one that runs in front of Tiananmen square).

Personally, I think Xiu Shui Jie is much better. Prices are bargainable, but don't go on weekends (more people, means less prices for you). You'll get outrageous prices as a foreigner, but take it from a local:

T-Shirts: 30-40 yuan
Button up shirts: 40-60 yuan
Hats: 20-30 yuan

Buy in bulk to get a better price.

Another one is ""Tianyi"" for small knicknacks, curiosities, and just fun little things. I love this place.

---

&gt;Food:

Beijing specializes in Northern cuisine, particularly influenced by Shandong and the N. Eastern styles. Imperial cuisine is large too, but I think you would be lost trying to order it. Northern China is fairly conservative in terms of cuisine, and you'll rarely find anything besides beef, pork, chicken, or lamb on the menu. 

Things to try:

1. [Zha Jiang Mian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zhajiangmian): Speciality of Beijing. There's a place called ""Lao Beijing Zha Jiang Mein"" that makes a mean bowl. They're franchised so you can find it.

2. [Yoshinoya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinoya): Not Chinese, but a Japanese franchise. They have an AMAZING beef and rice bowl. Definitely should try.

3. [La Mian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_mian): Hand-made noodles. Very cheap. Try this at a mall foodcourt (Da Pai Dang). 

4. [Street food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangfujing): Found behind Wangujing in the Dongcheng district at night. A bustling street food market that's sanitary (that have operating permits as opposed to vendors off the street), delicious, and includes a mammoth amount of variety. You can avoid Wangfujin during the day unless you want to buy expensive watches and clothes.  Not worth seeing as a tourist in my opinion, no different than any other shopping area in the world. On the flip side, China's first McDonalds opened here.

Try the ""Yang rou chuan"" or Lamb-Skewers. Brought in by the Uighurs from Western China, it is absolutely fucking amazing. For a few bucks, you can get 4-5 skewers, the classic Beijing street food. Other Bejing classics are ""Tang Hulu"" or candied-apples. 

6. [Hotpot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot): OMFG good. Get platefuls of meat and throw them in the boiling broth for 10-20 seconds to cook it. Immediately dip in the mandatory peanut sauce. Heaven in a mouthful.

Go to the franchise ""Xiabu Xiabu"". It's a Taiwanese franchise, but they have very fresh cuts of uber-thin sliced beef, pork and a ton of other stuff. Impeccably clean and great service. Going close to lunch or dinner will almost certainly involve a wait, especially in the winter. 

I also recommend the Vermicelli (very common in Beijing) and a ""shao bin"" (a chinese pancake) to make sandwiches with your freshly cooked beef. Ask for the pepper oil to add a kick.

5. Other: Baozi (Gou Buli is AMAZING), jiaozi (find a dumpling restaurant. Classic Northern Chinese fillings are pork + lettuce, pork + jiucai (garlic chives, chinese leeks, this is most authentic filling), pork + leaf mustard. 

Any mall food-court. The better mall food courts are Sogou, Golden Resources Mall (4th ring), Chang'an (they have both a Yoshinoya AND a Xiabu Xiabu. A huge dilemma for me everytime).

---

&gt;Hutongs

Hutongs are small and narrow alleyways that represent ""Old-Beijing"". Most of them have been demolished to make way for high-rises, mainly because a ""classic"" hutong has a square courtyard in the middle, and the bedrooms surrounding it. The high population density of Beijing doesn't allow for this anymore.

The ones near Houhai are almost certainly tourist traps. Companies run rickshaw companies to take tourists in. Not authentic at all. However, some families in order to capitalize on this trend, open up their homes to the public, of course for a fee. If you actually want to see what one looks like on the inside, you'll have to go this route.

If not, rent a bicycle and visit the hutongs in ""Xidan"". A beautiful and old neighborhood in it's own right, the hutongs here are much less well-known. The good thing about these, is that they are 100% authentic. No tourist bullshit, and the people who live here are ""real"" people and not rich guys buying the ultra-expensive hutongs near Houhai. Most of them are scheduled to be demolished, but its been over 20 years, and still no movement to do so. Nonetheless, visit them before they're gone forever.

&gt;Other things to do:

Get a massage. A real one, not the one you're thinking of you horny bastard. It's a lot cheaper than the US, and it'll make you feel hella good. 

There's a massage parlor I usually go to in the Chaoyang district in a hotel. It's very close to the Kerry center, but they offer all you can eat snacks and noodles while you get your massage, a double win. Most nice hotels will all have this service, again, for much cheaper than the US. Feel free to look around

Go the summer palace. It's not too far away from the center of the city, a 50-60 yuan cab ride. Still within the 4th ring road, so still considered part of the city now. It's absolutely gorgeous, if you have time, wander around the [Long Corridor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Corridor). Containing 14,000 pieces of art adorned upon each doorway. The art series tell famous stories and events in Chinese literature. From ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" to ""The Dream of Red Mansions"". Commissioned in 1750, it is both historic, and absolutely gorgeous.

The [Old Summer Palace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Summer_Palace). This is in the middle of the city. The Europeans burned it down during the retaliation for the Boxer Rebellion. It's an extremely cool park, and also very eerie at night due to the burnt down ruins that have been allowed. It's a good place to go to in order to understand the current psyche of China, a reminder of the bullying China withstood in the early-1900's. They don't call it a ""hundred years of shame"" for nothing. 

The [CCTV tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Central_Television_Tower) is the tallest building in Beijing. Has a rotating, buffet-style restaurant in the middle (the buffet is EXCELLENT), and offers gorgeous, 360 views of Beijing. Close to Chang'an jie, so it's smackdab in the middle of the city.

For electronics, then [Zhong guan cun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongguancun). Termed the ""silicon-valley"" of China, its an extremely dense block with high-rises chocked full of electronics. If you're a tech geek, you'll be blown away. Prices also bargainable, but not much cheaper than the US. Don't come here expecting to get a deal on anything besides memory (flash or otherwise).

Man, there's so much I can tell you. What are you interested in? Do you wear glasses? Go to ""Pan Jia Yuan"", I get glasses in China all the time. Got my last pair over 2 years ago there, quality is great and they'll match your prescription.

For traveling. During the peak times, subway is the fastest. Prepare to get crushed though. They are VERY full during rush hour. Taxis are cheap, usually 2.00 yuan per kilometer.

A ride from most places in the city is about 60-80 yuan at most (just over 13 dollars).

,"&gt;There can be no argument that China was much more developed than the Middle East at this time. And if you are committed to saying that it was a center for trade and cultural exchange, 

The levant area was central to trade for Asia minor, Carthage, Greece, and Rome (during pax romana for NT none the less).

Comparatively, for the OT, China was in the [warring states era](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_china#Warring_States_Period_.28476-221_BC.29)(I'd argue that OT was between 400 BC-100BC) and actually [had roman embassies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_china#Han_Dynasty_.28202_BC.E2.80.93AD_220.29) by the time of the new testament.

&gt;how is that fair to all of the people on the continents of North America, South America and Australia who have never even heard of the Middle East?

If you mean currently, that would be explained by lack of christian intervention.  If you mean historically, it's because God only had the one son, so picking the most ideal place for the ideology to spread would be crucial.

&gt;If he takes this route he's obviously not trying for an 'intellectual debate.' Sides' it doesn't really even matter if he answers one way or the other. If you work it through with him slowly, all answers lead to absurdity. If he still insists that ""God works in mysterious ways,"" he is not worth your time. He's lost. He just doesn't know it yet.

""I don't claim to know"" would actually be the most honest stance in my opinion.  The bible might say that the only way to the father is through the son, but that could just be incentive to spread the religion while something else is in practice.  He could also argue that both grace through works and faith are preached in the bible.

&gt;* Should slavery should be legal?
   
There is only one passage in deuteronomy which actually condones slavery.  This passage deals more with indentured servitude than the traditional concept. 

The indentured servitude was common from Jew to Jew, but the regular slavery was only practiced with foreigners.  This is in part why slavery of whites [was abolished](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Europe#The_Vikings_and_Scandinavia) after the spread of christendom in Europe.  The continuation of slavery outside of the race is a misconstruction of the idea as the switch from Judaism to Christianity made for the inclusion of all people regardless of ethnicity. 

&gt;Should women be allowed the right to vote?

To my knowledge, the bible only asks that women be submissive to their husbands.  Voting rights are not mentioned.  The verses regarding silence in the church are a matter of Paul's opinion and not actual doctrine.

&gt;If a woman is not a virgin when she is married, should she be stoned to death?

This is one of the 613 mitzvot.  After Jesus' death, all hygenic and debt to God style laws were abolished.  Civil law continued however but there's no reason to think that the civil law should not be fluid.  The reason that the law was encouraged in Abraham's pact was that it would be impossible to determine if a woman was pregnant before marriage unless she was a virgin bride, which is not to mention the whole adultery thing.

&gt;So are you saying God changed the absolute morality that He in His infinite wisdom originally came up with?

Yes, in part because of Jesus' death and allowing fluidity for civil law.

,"&gt;Many Israelis perceived the talks' failure and the subsequence violence as a complete rejection of compromise and peace, essentially equivalent to declaring that Israel's right to exist would never be recognized.

The PLO recognized the ""right to exist"" in 1988 and again in 1993.

&gt;In 1988, however, the PLO officially endorsed a two-state solution, contingent on terms such as making East Jerusalem capital of the Palestinian state and giving Palestinians the right of return to land occupied by Palestinians prior to 1948, as well as the right to continue armed struggle until the end of ""The Zionist Entity.""...On 9 September 1993, Arafat issued a press release stating that ""the PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security"" -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization

It's also a giant red herring:

&gt;Yet, Hassan's point was well taken. First of all, the concept of a state having a right to exist was, and is, outside the conceptual bounds of existing international law. It had no standing meaning. Was the right being referred to a legal right or a moral right? And more fundamentally, did it refer to a right to have come into existence, or a right to remain in existence? 

&gt;On November 15, 1988, in the text of its Declaration of Independence, the PLO affirmed for the first time that the historic Partition Resolution of 1947, (UNGA Res. 181) was part of valid international law, thus accepting that Israel came into being lawfully. Indeed, the Declaration of Independence specifically noted the factual truth that the Partition Resolution provided for 'two states, one Arab and one Jewish.'  -- http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000393

As did Hamas (the great demonized, duly elected rulers of Gaza, which we so quickly forget in our rush to ""respect democracy"")

&gt;Hamas leader accepts Israel's right to exist after Carter visit - Hamas will not recognise Israel but will accept a Palestinian state on Palestine territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, the Islamic militant groupâs exiled leader said today. The statement by Khaled Mashaal in Damascus amounted to a tacit acceptance of Israelâs right to exist alongside a Palestinian state, but without explicit recognition. Hamas has previously called for the destruction of Israel, which occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war. Israel later declared the entire city of Jerusalem as its capital. -- http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3791655.ece

-

&gt;These three verbal formulations have been used by Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a rationale for collective punishment of the Palestinian people. The phrases are also used by the media, politicians, and even diplomats interchangeably, as though they mean the same thing. They do not. ""Recognizing Israel"" or any other state is a formal legal and diplomatic act by one state with respect to another state. It is inappropriate â indeed, nonsensical â to talk about a political party or movement extending diplomatic recognition to a state. To talk of Hamas ""recognizing Israel"" is simply to use sloppy, confusing, and deceptive shorthand for the real demand being made of the Palestinians.

&gt;Israel has never defined its own borders, since doing so would necessarily place limits on them. Still, if this were all that was being demanded of Hamas, it might be possible for the ruling political party to acknowledge, as a fact of life, that a state of Israel exists today within some specified borders. Indeed, Hamas leadership has effectively done so in recent weeks. -- http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p09s02-coop.html

In the end, it's total rhetorical nonsense - even if the PA, the PLO, Hamas, Hezbollah and beyond *all* denied the supposed ""right to exist"" (which they do not) it's a totally moot point - it's like asking if Canada denies the right for the US to exist - even if we didn't believe so, Canada has *absolutely no means or method* to make this desire come about. Hamas has no control of its own territory due to Israeli blockade, and cannot even feed its own population, how could they possibly affect the existence of one of the world's wealthiest and most well armed states? it's a preposterous talking point meant, yet again, to distract from real issues (i.e. the Israeli military occupation and violation of international law). There is no conceivable power in the region that poses any plausible existential threat to Israel, nor does any power have any *reason* to pose an existential threat - and most certainly not one of the most impoverished and most maligned organizations on the earth, Hamas. 

To me, this whole scenario is like a school yard bully kneeling on a weakling's arms saying, ""I'll stop terrorizing you when you admit you're gay."" The failure to admit his gayness is then used by the bully to ""prove"" he is right in punishing his victim for his recalcitrance. The poor kid is totally supine and helpless, but wants to retain a modicum of dignity, yet by force the bully is demanding he give up the last scrap of humanity and self respect he retains. It's such a laughable circumstance if you take a few moments to actually think about what these deceptive words games actually entail or imply.

The only ""not existing"" that is *actually* happening - as opposed to rhetorical non-existing being mentioned - is Israel's frequent successful efforts to make Palestinian women and children *not exist* - as they did in 2008/2009 where they made at least 960 ""not exist"" in under 3 weeks.

The Rhode Island colony had an elected president. Comon now.

Albemarle was under British rule (same goes for Rhode Island, really), and they were all english citizens who had been given land grants and benefits to settle the new world. They were given a governor quite quickly.

**Holy Experiment**

&gt; Penn now had total control over his colony, which was named Pennsylvania (meaning ""Penn's woods"") by the king, after his late father. He now tried to attract settlers to Pennsylvania and make a profit off his newly founded colony. Penn did a brilliant job of advertising Pennsylvania, and it quickly became the most famous colony in England and the rest of Europe alike. Penn sought to create the Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania and he did this by creating a liberal frame of government, and attracting all sorts of people, including many Quakers, who made up the Holy Experiment. He also wanted to treat the Native Americans fairly and not cheat them out of land.

One man with total control over a colony. Yep, that sounds like Anarchy! Also, I found this bit quite hilarious

&gt;It did run smoothly for a while but then the French and Indian War came and many Quakers in the community wanted all other Quakers out of office because they would be in a position to send the others to war.

,"The opinions held by the anti-socialism crowd revolve around the idea that social welfare is a bad thing.  In America, you should have to work hard and earn your keep.  If you don't, you're a bum, a drain on the system, and you should go get a job.  Taxes should be lower and government should be smaller.  If the government is spending money, they're wasting it.

The problem is that these folks truly believe that if the government shrinks and gets less involved, stops funding social programs, allows the wealthy to accumulate wealth easier, that even the bottom rung of society will benefit, and moreso than the alternative.  The justification for this is that it makes the economy more efficient, therefore everyone will be richer.  It's a philosophy based on old ideas that don't play out in the real world, otherwise present-day Western Europe (which is as socialist as it gets) would be like 1980's Eastern Europe and Africa (a continent largely free of regulation and taxation) would be like Earth from the Star Trek universe.  At the very least we would see the two trending in these directions.

The Americans who deride socialism are, whether they know it or not, pursuing economic efficiency to the detriment of the social good.  In other words, economic efficiency is their sacred cow.  The evidence shows that a certain amount of redistributive policy and industry regulation is good for society, but the people who are afraid of socialism in all its forms see the (purely theoretical) economic inefficiency and don't understand or acknowledge that the end result of freedom and prosperity for all is better served by pursuing a more balanced approach.

The other approach is that some people don't even care about the social good as long as the system is 'just' (another sacred cow) which I find silly because in my mind letting people starve for any reason is pretty unjust.

I find it hilarious that you back this statement up with a quotation from 1965, and by Milton Friedman nonetheless - a man everyone anywhere near the mainstream is to the left of.

Anyways, the field of economics has changed quite a bit since 1965. If you take a look at the actual European anti-crisis policies you will see that they are much, much less Keynesian than that of the US - they are mostly focused on saving and reforming expensive government programs, particularly in Greece but also other places - Germany has even been [hounded by Krugman for being ""deficit hawks](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/opinion/18krugman.html).

You also seem to have certain problems differing between monetary policy, financial policy and general leftism.

,"WWI was over oil. This joke is a joke.

The conversion of the British Navy under Churchill to oil from coal meant a high risk strategy as England had abundant coal but no then-known oil. It secured a major concession from the Shah of Persia in the early 1900âs. The Baghdad rail link was increasingly seen in London as a threat to precisely this oil security. The British response to the growing German disruption of the European balance of power after the 1890âs was to carefully craft a series of public and secret alliances with France and with Russiaâformer rivalsâto encircle Germany. As well, she deployed a series of less public intrigues to disrupt the Balkans and encourage a revolt against the Ottoman Sultan via the Young Turks that severely weakened the prospects for the German Drang nach Osten. The dynamic of the rise of German assertiveness, including in addition to the Baghdad rail, the decision in 1900 to build a modern navy over two decades that could rival Englandâs, set the stage for the outbreak of a war in August 1914 whose real significance was a colossal and tragic struggle for who would succeed the ebbing power of the British Empire. The resolution of that epic struggle was to take a second world war and another quarter century before the victor was undeniably established. The role of oil in the events leading to war in 1914 is too  little appreciated.  When the historical process behind the war is examined from this light a quite different picture emerges. The British Empire in the decades following 1873 and the American Century hegemony in the decades following approximately 1973 have more in common than is generally appreciated.

,"Let me expand on what I said, because I think it's important to focus on just *what* implicit social contract is being examined.

There is something of a prescriptive-descriptive break between the social contract theories prior to Rawls, and Rawls' own. Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau worked this way. The purported to reduce the actual human condition to some essentials, what they called the State of Nature. Putting aside the hair-splitting arguments of whether this state was an actual *historical* state, it's fair to say that all of them considered there respective accounts of the State of Nature to accurately describe the essential *metaphysical* state that people are in, fundamentally. From these few principles, they then reason to their respective social contracts.

The important thing to keep in mind is that their State of Nature was meant to describe, logically, what conditions human beings would find themselves in without society. It's meant to answer, at a very fundamental level, what do human beings require of a society.

Now, the three of them came up with very different conceptions of society. Hobbes argues for an absolute ruler; Locke, for a very minimal state. I think this is pretty non-controversial. Let's leave Rousseau out of this for now, except to say that his account is different than that of the other two. (I don't want to start another controversy.)

Rawls ""Original Position,"" which is analogous to the State of Nature, at first glance, is very different -- something which he himself is keen to point out. He's not claiming to be giving a fundamental conception of what conditions people would find themselves in without a society. It's not a metaphysical question for him. He's not trying to describe society-less man, wondering what his wants would be, and then reasoning to a set of ethics.

Rawls' explicit program is to find a ""starting point"" that will result in his forgone conclusions, or, as I've said above, the conclusions that he like-minded people already subscribe to. It's not a *prescriptive* program like the other three; it's a *descriptive* program.

I trust you understood that to begin with, but your comment doesn't make that clear. The ""implicit social contract,"" as you say, that the Original Position examines is the one that *he* already has in mind -- you know, what ""all reasonable people"" would find agreeable.

I think the reason his philosophy is popular is because there were lots of people in academia who wanted a way of justifying what they already believed, and could not find it in traditional liberal philosophies, nor in Utilitarianism. Moreover, they were not only uncomfortable with the conclusions of the Big Three liberal philosophers, they were uncomfortable with the program of liberalism itself.

Liberal thought argues that there is some universality to human beings. Hobbes, Lock, Rousseau -- they all believed that the principles they were putting forwards spoke for all of mankind, in other words, they were universal principles. That was fine until multiculturalism came into vogue. After that, it became rude and ""close-minded"" to argue that there was something fundamental to human society the world over, that there was a *one true way.*

Rawls dodged all that. He used the trappings of liberal theory, the heuristic reasoning from the State of Nature, but threw away the universality of it. You can see quite readily in his work that he argues that the Original Position he puts forth is meant for ""our"" society (whether that means European-American society or Western society, I can't remember), and that other societies may begin their reasoning from different Original Positions.

All this is what I reject. Social Contract theory is the right course to take, as far as I'm concerned. But, one should begin by trying to logically describe the human condition in its essentials and in actual existence; and this condition is applicable to any and all human beings. The resulting society arrived at from reasoning from whatever fundamental principles you begin from should be applicable universally.

This is what I mean by needing to read only the first 50 pages or so. I spent an entire semester as an undergraduate in a class taught by a professor with a real hard-on for Rawls. The entire semester was spent in a close reading of the entire *A Theory of Justice,* followed by readings of other authors critiquing *A Theory of Justice.* That was almost 15 years ago, and I'm certainly no expert on his arguments. But, you don't have to know the ins and outs of the entire work.

What is that book? 600 pages? 800? I don't care how ""dense"" it is, or how ""nuanced"" it is, when you read some section of it out-of-context. If you keep focused on the context I described above, and you reject that context from the outset, the rest of the book is merely an exercise for the reader -- and not a very agreeable exercise at that.

Also, how on earth can a relationship be ""saved"" by a ring? How can a relationship be reduced to such materialistic shit? A ring does not even provide anything...a house is practical, you can live in it, what do you do with a ring? Sell it to buy food?

Someone needs a reality check, it is either me or ""you."" I dunno.

ps: I friend got married recently, here in Europe, they made a ring using the rock of his grandmother's ring. Yes, the grandmother was happy to give her ""engagement"" ring away. The material value is unknown but it is probably not much because it used to be large and then was cut in two pieces (one for each brother). On the other hand, this ring represents the ""blessing"" from the groom's family for the bride, it represents a lot of emotional value.

If one interprets his ""Original Position"" and ""Veil of Ignorance"" in an absolute sense, it makes a lot more sense, IMO.

,"I think those notions that Europeans had of America were pretty much bullshit to begin with. When I lived in Germany (around 03-05), there seemed to be two different perceptions of the US. One perception was of wealth and glamour, typically pushed by Hollywood and the entertainment media. This view was probably the more dominant one prior to the 1990's. The other perception, pushed by the European news media, showed Americans as ignorant buffoons who love the death penalty, hate the poor, and who regularly go around shooting each other. Both of those extreme characterizations are wildly inaccurate. 

For anyone who is interested, the most accurate portrayal of the US, in my opinion, is the *Stephen Fry in America* series. He covers many aspects of the US that I think people outside the US (and many Americans themselves) seem to miss. He shows the good parts, bad parts, and the very strange parts.

&gt; the Green Energy Act, a policy so bad, so expensive, so ideologically driven and so perverse that any normal person should be seeing red. The Green Energy Act gutted public utility regulation and introduced new stealth taxes. The agent of this madness, lest we forget, was George Smitherman, currently running for mayor of Toronto.

&gt; Power expert Tom Adams may know more about this subject than any other living being. And heâs steamed. Ontarioâs rates, he says, have already surpassed the U.S. average and are headed for European levels â âjust because of public policy.â

&gt; The policy is to go all out on renewables â wind and solarâ whether or not it makes sense. The province is paying sky-high rates for power it doesnât need so we can have wind turbines marching on and on to the horizon, just like Denmark does. âPower demand has been dropping since 2005,â says Mr. Adams. In fact, we have so much excess supply that, from time to time, it threatens to crash the system. Because of this, weâre even paying the neighbours to take the power off our hands.

&gt; âOntario will need new power supplies in the future,â Mr. Adams says. âBut why not buy it when we need it?â Instead of waiting, the power authority is signing long-term contracts at the rate of about $1-billion a week, while paying enormous premiums to attract wind and solar producers. In other words, itâs making 20-year commitments to pay stunningly high prices for power we donât need.

&gt; On top of that, the province is building new transmission lines to nowhere while neglecting to ensure that Torontoâs hospitals and banks can keep the lights on. In July, Toronto experienced what Mr. Adams calls âOntarioâs first green blackout.â That blackout occurred because the cityâs downtown core is badly underpowered. It has the weakest power system of any financial centre in the developed world. ",True,canada,andrewmp,c14a4l5,1426550046,False,t3_e06g8,1,0,False,1,t1_c149975,t1_c14a4l5,0,0,1288751191,,t5_2qh68,

Wait. What? You think that a guy with no insurance who needs brain surgery and aftercare that amounts to millions of dollars will receive the same care as someone with the ""Platinum"" insurance plan? 

Bullshit. If you have no money you get patched up at the emergency room and kicked out the door if you are lucky. You then get billed thousands of dollars for a procedure that would cost exponentially less if you had insurance.

&gt;The question is does a poor person in the US have access to such a procedure as compared to another person in say uganda? No, the poor person in the US has a much better healthcare than someone in Uganda. The equipment is better and the doctors are better trained.

Strawman. Seriously who the fuck is talking about Uganda. How about we compare US healthcare for the poor to Western Europe's or Canada's and see what we get.

&gt;I agree with this, but Obamacare doesn't really help all that much. You might get healthcare, but you're still going to be poor and maybe even a bit poorer as a result.

As we were waiting, we saw this short wiry guy making a commotion as he passed through the crowd.

,"A few points:

1. A tax for health insurance is not very distinguishable from a fine for not having health insurance.
2. The US has the highest cost of health care in the developed world for a myriad of reasons. That cost has to get down (currently it's around $1800/person/year) regardless of whether or not a public, single-payer system is installed.
3. The US is much larger and more varied than most current single-payer systems. Canada is probably the closest analog (the UK and most European systems are wholly unsupportable in the US from an administration standpoint--scale and all that), but it's not a perfect analog. The US system is not just an install of a currently living system--it would have to be something almost entirely new, and that takes plenty of time and money to set up.
4. Money has to come from somewhere. Budgeting is one of the most political processes in companies and governments alike. We've been running a deficit for far too long at this point to just keep spending in a deficit. From a Keynesian point of view (really the one you want when you're talking about running a deficit), the most you can really argue for is a deficit in stimulus funds and discretionary spending. Unfortunately, we're at a deficit before we even hit the discretionary portion. I should also note here that Social Security isn't the cause of this--it's got its own tax and account structure that is good until at least 2039 (plus, it cannot borrow money). A lot of people like to point blame at it, but it's not actually the case. The majority of the budget is chewed up with Miscellaneous Mandatory (17%), Medicare and Medicaid (19%), and Defense (23%). Of those, only Defense has any practical wiggle room. Even if you cut out the war contingency (DoD has their operating budget and then a war contingency budget), you still don't get back to black. If you cut the Defense budget significantly (as would be necessary), you end up losing jobs which exacerbates the already fairly dismal unemployment (and also adds some to that Misc. Mandatory bucket, so it's not a straight net of the DoD cuts). How much? I don't know, but it's not negligible.
5. The debate on health care is not something that can be summed up with pithy remarks. It's a complicated, intricate mess that exists that needs to be reformed from the ground up.

From [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/31/observer-editorial-obama-midterm-elections):

&gt;In normal times, Obama would be vulnerable to a hostile Republican party. Faced by Tea Party America, Obama's Harvard Law School demeanour has seemed hopelessly out of touch. The Tea Party, fuelled by the same longing for greatness that animated Obama's own campaign, has mobilised a kind of Yankee poujadisme: wild talk of rescuing the country from those who have seized control, limiting ""big government"" and going back to a golden age where the ""Constitution"", like Holy Writ, guarantees life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Obama has a way with words, but not even he seems to know how to respond to the Tea Party's inchoate rage.

,"Very good reply, hblask.

I would like to add a couple of things.

&gt; severe mental disabilities such as schizophrenia, bipolar, or borderline personality disorder should have the right to bear firearms?

One of the ways that the government can take away freedoms is by declaring you insane, even if you aren't. Ever been to a psychologist for any reason? That might be a good enough justification for a govt to take away your rights to a gun, your driver license, or whatever, without a legal procedure. My 'libertarian' position on this is that only courts / jury may take away such rights.

&gt; Who will fund our schools, hospitals, transportation, and all other services that are currently government-funded?

Agree with hblask - the more local the government that decides these the better. Another libertarian response for this would be to have as much of infrastructure made private **as possible** (this does not mean govt-crony deregulation a la California electricity). What stays government funded should be as much paid-by-users as possible (you do not have a car - you do not pay for the roads). Of course the what the libertarians consider ""possible"" tends to vary across libertarian ideology.

&gt; There needs to be a public option, and the only way this can be enforced is through well thought-out government regulation.

This problem is not just in the healthcare. It is the general problem that there are people who are too poor to afford what can be called ""basic human dignity"" which includes food, schooling, etc. This is actually a big source of disagreements for libertarians. 

What libertarians agree on is that the free market will aim to provide services for even the poorest members, as long as they have something. This means that a true free market will have low-cost healthcare for individuals, low-cost schooling, low-cost food, to the point where it would even be accessible to panhandlers.

Of course there may be individuals who are not willing or able to produce anything. Mentally or physically disabled people, orphan children, etc. These can not really be helped by any market. The anarcho-capitalists (a minority) tends to say tough luck to those people, and leaves them to charity. Less hardcore libertarians are OK with minimal services for these people, provided as much by local governments as possible. The fact that the local government should decide this tends to be important as you want as much input as possible from the people in how to define ""basic human dignity"" and how much they want to pay for it. 

For example, many libertarians are OK with social security for serious disabilities. I know plenty that would support some form of emergency healthcare assistance. Once again, the more local these programs are, the more acceptable they are to libertarians.

*Basically, when faced with such issues a libertarian position would be to try to solve the problem with the least government interference possible in the most market driven way with as much input from the people who are taxed (local government). This approach goes for all govt issues, such as roads, transportation, and anything else you can come up with.*

If you want a more concrete answer to the healthcare question, take a look at the Singaporean approach to healthcare. It is not what libertarians ultimately want, but it works, and it is certainly closer to the libertarian ideology than the US or European systems.

&gt; but not nearly enough to cover the cost of living for all senior citizens who cannot support themselves.

&gt; the govt gets less than 1/3rd of the money it takes for programs to actual recipients, with 2/3rds going to bureaucratic waste. A typical charity gives 70-90%.

This is a common response given by libertarians, but it is usually not satisfactory to most people. This will be treated as a ""basic human dignity"" issue by libertarians, and addressed as such. And if individuals are so charitable as to push the standard of ""basic human dignity"" higher, the libertarians will be beaming with joy.

,"It seems that sometime around the Reagan era conservatives became neo-conservatives. The previous (rational) ideas of spending less money on government and having lower taxes across the board was thrown out. Instead we ended up with a party that taxed people less (sometimes) but spent a whole ton. Yet, these neo-cons still point to smaller government and lower taxes as being reasons they vote for republicans even though their candidates spend more and tax around the same (or way less if you're rich).

My parents are great examples of this mindset. I'm sure my mom is taxed less under Obama, but she probably doesn't even realize it. Instead she mindlessly votes for republicans because they're the ""lower taxes"" party. Fifty years ago that might have worked for her, today it boggles my mind.

Add to that the social aspects of modern-day conservatism and you get a party that rewards the extremely wealthy, denies basic civil rights (aside from gun rights), and who appeals to ""family values"" and strong ""Christian beliefs,"" whatever those terms mean. It's a party that is totally confusing to follow and understand.

Now having ripped on republicans for a bit, I'll turn around and rip on democrats as well since they are also confusing to me.

Dems have a lot of fundamentally good ideas, but they are sometimes quite flawed. They seek to grow government to the maximum size possible, providing all sorts of services to the population (don't get me wrong, these days republicans do this too). Spend more on welfare, education, social services, tax the rich more (at least before Reagan they did), tax the poor less, strengthen unions. I feel that on the surface things like welfare are hard to argue against. It helps out families who need help. Who wouldn't want that? Except you're rewarding a behavior that does not contribute to society, and you're penalizing contributors to society. Generally governments should want to tax things they wish to discourage, and give rewards to things they wish to encourage. In Europe the governments tax gasoline heavily to dissuade people from using lots of gas (and it works well). In America we tax middle-class workers nearly the same amount that we tax the rich, and that money goes to people who do not take care of themselves. In this respect, we are encouraging bad behavior.

Federal health care has become the poster child of the lunacy of our government. Few people realize that congress has its power restricted by the constitution. Article 1, Section 8 lists out things that congress can pass laws about, and the tenth amendment reserves everything else to the states. A great 20th century example of congresses limits was prohibition of alcohol. There was tremendous popular support for prohibition in the beginning of the 20th century, but congress didn't pass a law making alcohol illegal. Why not? Because they didn't have the power to. Instead a constitutional amendment was required to ban the consumption of alcohol at the federal level. Only then was alcohol prohibited in every state. But today we have laws that make marijuana illegal at the federal level. Legal scholars will say that the feds have this power under the commerce clause, but I have never heard an explanation for why prohibition of alcohol required a constitutional amendment but prohibition of marijuana did not.

Getting back on point, the health care bill, is similarly not a power that has been granted to congress, and therefore must be a power granted to the states. Democrats love the health care bill because it makes sense and it'll save lives. Republicans hate the health care bill because it'll likely raise taxes in the long run and they didn't come up with it and it forces businesses to act a certain way. Libertarians hate the health care bill (and FISA, and the US PATRIOT act, and all sorts of other things) because it throws the constitution under the bus. Unfortunately libertarians are an evil third-party, and will forever be disparaged as unelectable.

Tonight I personally voted for one republican (John Dennis) who is awesome and is a true patriot, one green party candidate (for state treasurer), and everybody else was libertarian. I'm 100% sure none of the libertarians are going to win, but you know what, I don't care anymore. The republicans and democrats have become identical to me, and I refuse to settle for second best. I won't vote for politicians who cite terrorism or cry for people to think of the children or use any similarly pathetic attempts to scare me into voting one way or another. I also don't think this country will ever wake up to the reality of how broke our de facto two party system is.

,"Well, no one gets this deep into comment threads, so this is essentially a PM session now.  Please read the following twice, because it takes on a different tone the second time around. 

I want to clarify that true communism in no way goes against natural human motivation. In Marx's view, (and it is in large part a very sound view by virtue of being based heavily on scientific research) communism is a return to the most basic and direct of human motivations with the added ease of living brought on by the technological advancements that come about as a result of the necessary evils of the capitalism which predates it. 

Marx loved capitalism. He absolutely adored its ability to bring about great change and innovation. But this strongpoint, in his view, was to be contrasted against the weakpoint of the inhuman conditions brought about for the working class. Inhuman conditions which we'll never be acquainted with, because we don't live in a capitalist society. In general, you'll find that the more capitalist and ""business friendly"" a society is, the worse the working conditions are. The way that most societies have managed to bypass communist revolutions, is to make small concessions *just* at the level which would make a revolution seem unworth the effort (thus we, get our modern European socialist societies with a very happy workforce). The way that the US specifically has managed to bypass a revolution, is through rampant anti-communist propaganda. 

Capitalism is a slightly more interesting case than Marx had anticipated though. In his time, it seemed as if capitalism had little else to offer once labor met the efficiency of industrialization and mass production, and for a very long time this was the case. After the telegraph, the human condition wasn't improving in the slightest until we got to the modern personal computer just a few decades ago. For all intents and purposes, this innovation was unpredicted and unpredictable; a fluke. And now that we're here, witnessing the marvels that come about when humanity's greatest minds have bulk access to humanity's most valuable resources; it's much more difficult to know in which direction we should be going. If we continue with a capitalist idea of blind advancement, we may come across some dangerous knowledge which can not be undiscovered. However, if we choose to live only with the advancement we've made thus far, and peer no further into Pandora's box; then all technological advancement from here on out would be carefully controlled and guided; engineered for utility instead of market appeal. With the apparent weakness that the immediately useful technology isn't necessarily as useful as the technology which branches from a seemingly useless one. 

All that is to say that in the present day and age, it's very tricky to decide the direction in which we ought to move. Capitalism is the hard and unpredictable road. Risky, and painful, and interesting. Communism is safe and simple and pleasureful and predictable; but it's also the retirement of humanity's newfound quest for technological expansion. When you're dealing with real human lives, is it really so easy to decide which future is the best future? Is it so simple to decide that the possibility of colonizing other planets is worth the massive labor and risk to personal well being required of the people mining the resources necessary for the effort? Is it so simple to say that making huge leaps in medical technology which could improve quality of life later down the line isn't worth that same labor? 

I think that, to make a claim either way, is to lay a claim of extreme weight upon ice of extreme tenuousity.

,"1. The reason why conservatives are often (but not always) strong advocates of national defense is not dissimilar to the reason a bank likes to have a strong vault. Wealth creation and preservation primarily occurs in stable political environments. Stable political environments rarely exist (historically) without some praetorian guard equivalent and in the modern era (post ww2) it seems an absolute requirement.

 A certain % of security spending based on the asset protected is reasonable. Conservatives see the spend on national defense as the umbrella under which business as usual operations can continue. In some countries, this cost of stability is picked up by another nation but it always exists. When you are protecting trillions, you wind up with a security presence that has the capability to destroy the economies of entire regions.

2. In contrast -- healthcare reform as structured does little to preserve/create wealth. The primary users of healthcare in a first world society like America are often the least economically productive members (the old and the infirm). Healthcare reform (as discussed) structurally transfers the cost of health care from 'terminally' sick people to healthy people who have statistically low odds of becoming sick. This structure is designed to pay for/subsidize the care of those who are known to be sick rather than to offer insurance (in case they become sick) to those who are healthy. This cost burden not only saps the productivity of the payees but creates a negative economic feedback loop where the more you spend on maintaining* the sick population, the more you are required to spend.

2. The costs do NOT work out the same -- sick people by the nature of being sick are not as productive as healthy people. At a high level -- healthcare does not so much cure (restore productivity) as it does extend life. A gender-cost differential is only one (and the most simple) of risk differential pools -- the biggest price differential would likely be between a young and an old person. The key point is that conservatives believe that people/groups should pay for their own costs/risks rather than the costs/risks of 'others'. Progressive who support healthcare reform seem to argue that everyone is just as likely to fall ill and so the cost of healthcare should be borne at the society level. The actual data regarding who gets sick (and with what illness) does not support this philosophy.

*Cigarette companies have actually done studies for certain eastern european nations showing how medical care costs would be lowered if the restrictions on marketing their product were not limited. i.e. If the sick people die due to a shortened life span, the total spend on health care is lowered.

Also if your language skills are not near native level, getting a job can be problematic.

,"Champions League and Europa League are actually a mixture of leagues and knockout cups. Both are organized by the UEFA, same as the Copa America is organized by the CONCACAF.

First, there's a preliminary playoff phase, where the lesser winners (usually 2nds, 3rds or 4ths in their domestic leagues, and even some winners of low-level leagues) compete in a knockout tourney to select a few which will join the league winners (and in some leagues like Liga, Premiership, Serie A, Bundesliga, etc, also runners-up) in the group stage.

In the group stage, after a draw, everybody is put in one of eight groups. In each there are two teams who get to this stage directly (domestic league winners and runners-up) and another two who classified (won the preliminary playoffs). These four teams compete in a regular league format, with home and away games, scoring 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss. The two best teams in each stage go through. If tied, the aggregate score of the two matches between the two teams tying decides. If still tied, the one who scored most away goals passes. The third team in the group gets to play the Europe League. The fourth team is eliminated.

Now we have 16 teams (two from each group) who compete in a knockout tourney, with home and away games. Best aggregate score goes through. If that is tied at the end of the second match, the one with most away goals go through. If still tied, there's extra time in the second game. If still tied, penalty kickouts decide.

The final takes place in a neutral stadium, decided beforehand. Single match, with extra time and penalty kickout if needed.

Europe League is pretty much the same format, except with second-tier teams (3rds and 4ths of their league, winners of a crappy summer tourney, there's even spots reserved for sportmanship awards...)",True,soccer,Cuerzo,c14b8i0,1426550578,False,t3_e0fej,2,0,False,2,t3_e0fej,t1_c14b8i0,0,0,1288772804,Spain,t5_2qi58,49

,"&gt;Your contention is that the poor receive bad haelthcare in the US. In other words, if a poor person walks into a doctors office, slaps $100 on the desk and asks for a flu shot, that they will give him a shot with a used needle. that is simply not the case.

The contention is not that the poor receive lower quality service, but rather that no one will serve them. The poor can't walk in and throw down a hundred grand for an operation (they're poor if you'll recall), but the rich can walk in and drop two grand for the same procedure and their insurance will cover the rest.

,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. I am, however, somewhat confused by what you wrote re welfare:
&gt;I feel that on the surface things like welfare are hard to argue against. It helps out families who need help. Who wouldn't want that? Except you're rewarding a behavior that does not contribute to society, and you're penalizing contributors to society. Generally governments should want to tax things they wish to discourage, and give rewards to things they wish to encourage. In Europe the governments tax gasoline heavily to dissuade people from using lots of gas (and it works well). In America we tax middle-class workers nearly the same amount that we tax the rich, and that money goes to people who do not take care of themselves. In this respect, we are encouraging bad behavior.

But surely welfare as you describe it is unavoidable? To my knowledge, it is a fact of life that there will be those people who can work and pay money and those who (often temporarily) cannot. This is not simply a matter of behaviour, as being able to work and pay taxes is often a factor of e.g. health or of being able to find work. 

How else would one do it? Stop welfare? What would then happen with all the people who received it before? Surely those dependent on welfare would end up without housing or food, and many of those would starve or turn to the only ""job"" available to them: crime. As far as I can see welfare is the least-bad response to randomly-caused socioeconomic inequalities and serves not only those who take advantage of the social safety net, but also those who share a society with them.

I think your critique of the dems in this aspect does not hold water, as social welfare is not really comparable to Pigovian taxation.",True,IAmA,GermaneGerman,c14bcnn,1426550632,False,t3_e08b4,13,0,False,13,t1_c14az3x,t1_c14bcnn,0,0,1288777963,,t5_2qzb6,

,"(didn't expect to write so much, but I guess I never told the whole thing).

My experience is similar to yours.  After finishing my last semester I was sick of school, and I think all that studying honestly negatively effected me.  So I said fvck it a few weeks before finals, and booked a flight for 3 weeks to London.  Since I'm normally the type of person to think about these things, and not do them, I just bought the non-refundable ticket and told myself I'd have to figure it out from there.


So between then and when I actually flew out there, I was online all the time thinking, ""I've always wanted to get there, or see that"".  So I had a list of places I wanted to check out while overseas and started working out how I could make it happen.

I eventually settled on getting an unlimited Eurail pass (highly reccomended!), and worked out a general idea of where I'd be going.  (loosely of course, because I wanted some freedom to go where ever I wanted if I choose to spur of the moment).

I wasn't trying to spend too much money, so I stayed in hostels most of the time. (if you go to Europe on your own, DO THIS... seriously.)  I booked a hotel for the first night since I expected to be jet lagged, but after that I was on my own to figure shit out.

From London I took the train to Paris, saw all of the sites, stayed in a hostel, got drunk and made a bunch of new friends (this was the story in every hostel I went too).  One guy in particular I spent a day handing out with was an engineer from ESA (European Space Agency), he was in charge of the rocket guidance systems or something of that nature for their new space shuttle.  The guy was really smart, and was surprised I knew so much about the subject.   We ended up becoming pretty good friends, and he offered me a place to stay the next time I'm in Paris.   I just thought it was really cool to meet and party with someone like that, especially since it was so random.

From there I took an overnight train to Madrid, slept on the train to save $$.  Met this really cool artist dude on the train to Madrid, we ended up talking the in morning and neither of us knew where to stay, so we decided to figure it out together.   Once we get off the train, these two Canadian girls said they booked a really good deal on a hostel and invited us to come along.   We did, and ended up staying in the same hostel as them, and partied with them on a pub crawl that night, and I even got lucky :)  (which was great considering I'd been too caught up in finishing school the past two semesters to even go out).   Also, if you do ever go to Madrid, make sure to go to a Bull Fight, that was so much more fun than I expected it to be.

From there I flew to Rome (it was a long train ride, and Ryanair had a $25 flight, so why not).  Rome was cool, did all the tourist stuff, met some cool people, went to a few clubs and had a good time.  After Rome, it was on to Venice.   Venice is a really cool city to party in, the people there are just... different (in a good way), and friendly as hell too.  And I'm sure the parkour there would be fun!  There really is nothing else like it out there, something you have to see before you die.

I knew this girl in Munich who I was supposed to be staying with, but I wasn't supposed to arrive for a few days, so I said fuck it, I'll just go somewhere random that is somewhat on the way.

I ended up in Zurich.  If you're in the area, definitely check this out.. if for anything, just for the Swiss Alps... it's pretty amazing.  I got there at night, and upon arriving at the train station, everything was closed.  I had no where to stay, so I was kinda freaking out.   I asked this random black guy for advice, and this guy pulled out his cell phone, called a dozen or so places for me, and helped make a reservation.  Was cool as hell, we smoked after and apparently he had a connection at the biggest night club there, so he got me into VIP.   Crazy random shit that never happened in the US seemed to happen every day over there.

The next morning at the hostel, I met this former American hippie who was around 35, who told me his story about leaving America and spending 5 years or so bumming all around the world.  It was cool hearing about someone who did something so drastic with their life (literally begging for food everyday), just to experience the world and their life to the fullest.   When I met the guy, he was completely together (you'd never guess he was like that by looking at him), had a masters degree, and was teaching at a university in new york.  We spent the day exploring the city, drinking, smoking, talking to girls etc, until it got late and we both got on separate trains.

Got on the train to Munich, pretty exhausted from the craziness/partying and overall non-stop 'GO' of the past couple days.  I knew this girl in Munich and her family from when I was younger (kinda friends of the family).  So I got there, and really just wanted to pass out.   Of course, that wasn't happening... while on this kind of trip, especially when you only spend a few days in each city, everyone wants you to see the best of their city.  So when we got there, it was straight to the pub, and then to a club later on, where I got smashed once again.  The next day I got to check out all the sites, went to a huge castle on the mountain and then to Dachau (the first concentration camp)--- this was kinda depressing, but definitely something you should see since it's such a significant part of history.  The next day we spent the day at a beer garden (this is another must).  Sitting outside with a few thousand other people with gigantic beers, getting absolutely hammered in the middle of the day was great.   Went out again that night, and then it was off to Amsterdam.

Amsterdam was a lot more beautiful than I expected, as that wasn't the primary reason for booking it.  After booking the hostel, the first stop was to a 'coffee shop' :)  It was really a weird experience coming from the US to walk into this place and be presented with a lengthy list of choices so nonchalantly.  Since I was in Amsterdam, I figured I'd do it right... so I picked up a bag of the most recent Cannabis Cup winner (apparently this was pretty rare stuff.), it was the most expensive they had, but still pretty cheap.   This stuff got me absolutely smashed, the whole Amsterdam trip is still kinda a blur.   I ended up just chilling at the hostel's bar most of the night playing pool (there were around 30 others, around my age doing the same).  But I ended talking to this former US Marshall, who spent around 10 years on the job, saving $125,000, and just deciding to leave everything behind in America to travel the world until all his money ran out.   Definitely an interesting character, it was certainly weird getting completely blasted with the guy.

I was in such a haze while in Amsterdam, that I lost a day.   I planned on taking an overnight ferry back to London the day before my flight so I wouldn't miss the flight.  Well, I arrived at the ferry station completely out of it, only to be told that my ferry left the day before.  I was freaked the fuck out.  I got completely lucky though, the lady at the counter saw how horrified I was, and called the boat which was supposed to have left a half hour ago, and asked them to reopen the doors to let me get a ride to London.   She didn't charge me anything, and I was given a suite on the boat.   That was the best night's sleep I had the whole trip.

Woke up the next day, got off the boat, went to 2 more museums, the big ben, the london eye, and got on the plane back to America.

So in the end, I'm glad I bought that non-refundable ticket to just see 'what would happen', and would recommend anyone else in a similar position to do the same.

Looking at flights on there own they were $250.

4) In each city, look if there are cheaper ways to use public transport.  E.g. weekly tickets in NYC or even in england you can go to thetrainline.co.uk and purchase long distance tickets cheaper than you can at the station and you can pick them up at the ticket machine.

5)  If you don't have a particular order of cities you want to see, play around with different orders.  I was in Chicago and wanted to go to Montreal first and then Seattle and greyhound it down to san fran and LA and then fly back to Chicago.  I saved about $600 Going 
Chicago -&gt; Montreal -&gt; LAX -&gt; San Fran -&gt; Seattle -&gt;Chicago 
instead of 
Chicago -&gt; Montreal -&gt; Seattle -&gt; San Fran -&gt; LA -&gt; Chicago

6) Look into camping sites.  Even if you don't have a tent, many camp sites actually provide a room/cabin and it can cost much cheaper than a hotel and is not always far from the major city.

7) In Europe check out http://www.busabout.com/.  You can get an open ticket which you can hop on and hop off wherever you like on the routes.

8) Look for different ways to travel besides the usual plane/train.  We got a ferry from venice to greece for a fraction of the price of a flight.  Mind you we slept on deck in our sleeping bags but if you can handle that (and the occasional rain sprinkle lol) then you will save a lot of money.

9) Don't be afraid of other languages.  I caught trains in Poland with only rudimentary Polish and I saved a tonne of money travelling first class from the north to the south.

10) Be very mindful of taxi's in many cities.  The one constant was how quick they want to rip you off when they find out you're a tourist.  Hell even a london taxi driver at 3am swapped a few pound coins for 20p coins when he handed it to me through the passenger window and drove off.  Sometimes it pays to have small amounts of cash in your wallet and show them up front and ask if it'll be enough.  If you decide on price up front you can save a few dollars.  A lot easier to do on trips you may need to do regularly.

11) Search for coupons and deals when planning.  For example when I booked greyhound from LA -&gt; San Fran -&gt; Seattle... I found a deal site telling where members said you can sign up for a free membership and get a discount on your first trip.  That on top of the 21-day advanced trip, I managed to travel up the whole west coast for around 60-80 bucks.

Shit... That's all I can think of.  I just finished travelling for the last 2 years so it's still pretty fresh :D  Did the same thing.  Graduated and wanted to see the world before settling.  The hardest is re-establishing yourself and getting a job when you get back.

It cant be China, since they own most of the loans Bush took to fund the wars and would therefor loose big sums if the U.S didnt pay back.
Europe is another candidate but its doubtful, since they probably would fail along with the U.S since the heavy co-dependency.

,"i spent a week in Barcelona on a European post-high school summer trip. it was **GREAT**.

i think mainly it has this really well balanced combination of culture and nightlife, that fits into a beautiful city with great weather and a beach.

* you have the Picasso museum which is absolutely gorgeous, i found myself just roaming it for about 4 hours enjoying the paintings.

* you have one of the worlds best soccer teams, hosting matches of the highest level in an amazing 80k seats stadium.

* great nightlife, a lot of parties, and lots of pubs. full with young people the nights are long and thrilling.

* Gaudy. why don't people build like that? his structures are bloody well amazing. the gaudy garden is so much fun just roaming around, and the ""sagrada familia"" is incredible.

* i don't know what it is about that place, but for some reason, it has an unbelievable concentration of hot women. i'm serious, we'd wake up in the morning, go out to the balcony drinking coffee smoking a cigarette and before you could even finish the bloody cig, you'd see at least 4 jaw-dropping beautiful damsels passing by the street.

* tons of young tourists in the hostels, friendly and mixing. you meet so many knew friends over there and discover different people from all across the world (mainly Europe) and have a blast with them.

,"Make a Q&amp;A thread; archive and organize all the questions for future reference.

Speaking of questions:

1) Why isn't the Vet tournament seeded by ELO? You can assume unranked players are 1200s.

2) One *week* to determine picks and bans? You may want to reword that.

3) Why aren't we using draft mode in practice to just ban/draft? If the other team doesn't have Miss Fortune, why do I want to waste a ban on her? An on-paper ban is fundamentally flawed unless we know which heroes each person on the other team owns.

4) If you get first ban, I assume you'll have second pick?

5) What about a player who is level 25 now? That is, if they advance in level in the middle of a tournament, how will that go?

6) I still think $10 is quite steep for administrators. That's equivalent to 3rd place in the newbie/veteran tournament. I understand it takes time and effort to organize, but most TOs will put any money into re-investing into improving the community or getting better setups, etc. etc. Why not use the $50 total to hold a raffle or more casual event to keep/generate interest in the community? That is, we're not an entirely competitive community; let's use that RP for a drawing contest or something.

7) What's the process if both teams fail to show up at a proposed time?

8) What if a time is never scheduled? Whose shoulders does it fall on? Basically, you guys need to make rules for disqualification and whatnot very clear.

9) Are matches best of 1? Best of 3 (and if best of 3, policy on picking blue/purple team)? What about finals? Single Elimination? Double Elimination? Swiss and cut to top 8?

10) Can we reconsider the ARAM tourney, or at least get some popular opinion on it? If this tournament is for US servers, what about hosting one for EU? What about a TT tournament? I honestly don't see it as being competitive. EDIT: Okay, considering some of the responses you guys put up, why are we having a tournament that you guys think will be decided by ""sheer luck""?

11) We have no dates at all for when the tournament is starting or signups.

12) How are we going to receive our prizes, and who is going to handle that?

13) Policy on new champions or items being released in the middle of the tournament?

14) Punishments for raging/unsportsmanship behavior?

15) What's the rule on disconnects?

16) How do we report results?

17) How much RP is $5 worth of RP? Are we going by lowest pay scale? Highest?

1. We are a democracy, you get that. 2. The government recently agreed to a series of changes to how it operates to increase efficiency. 3. We dont have anything like the deadlock you find in other democracies. 4. Your assertion is just flat out false, we rank [fourth in the world](http://www.business.nsw.gov.au/aboutnsw/climate/A11_govt_efficiency.htm) in government efficiency.

&gt;the government-run classifications board is not.

The Classification Review Board was established by government legislation but is [an independent statutory body](http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/Classification_in_AustraliaWho_we_are).

&gt;Australia sits just a few spots higher than the United States in terms of health care and is trumped by many European nations. 

You're referring to the WHO list from a decade ago? We've had substantial changes since then and now operate significantly better and cheaper than almost all western nations, including those in Europe. See these:

Yes, we do.

&gt;Australia has water supply issues.

Seriously? We're one of the driest countries on earth buddy, luck of the draw, but the fact it doesn't rain enough here isn't something we can change easily without a weather machine. Nor does it mean there's a problem with our society, culture, economy or governance.

We still produce some of the worlds [largest crops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Australia#Crops) and we're building desalination plants in every city we can.

&gt;Its coastlines are being damaged by a growing coastal population.

Again, seriously? We have some of the best [coastal protection](http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/coast_and_oceans/coastal_management/index.html) and [management](http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/coasts/about-us/coast-protection-board.html) in the world. We're obsessive about our beaches. To add to that, any areas which are being damaged are only a [small fraction of a percent of our total coastline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline).

&gt;Australia has a very high income tax rate.

Tax isn't bad if your government uses it properly. We have an effective tax system which still produces a lot of rich people while also limiting income inequality. All the statistics show this to be a good thing. In any case, your statement is false, our tax rates are [low compared to nearly every western country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP).

&gt;Australia has no guarantee of free speech.

This is true, it is not written in our constitution. But we, having a government founded on the Westminster System, rely much more on historical precedents and they have led us to be one of the [freest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World) countries [on earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) by any imaginable measure.

,"&gt;See the problem? 

I see the problem: the US doesn't have a parliamentary system where parties are represented in legislative matters according to their respective numbers of voters. 

Transposed onto a European-style democracy, your example would give a *lot* of power to Kinsey, since his would be the deciding vote whenever Buck and Bennet disagreed. This is how European politics works - smaller parties are marginalised when the larger parties agree on an issue, but as soon as anything controversial comes up, those larger parties start looking for ways to compromise to win the support of one or more of the otherwise ""fringe"" parties, who thereby win some (often considerable) amount of representation. More importantly, perhaps, is that during this process of compromising a lot of potentially constructive dialogue takes place.

It's also [55% black, last measured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Washington,_D.C.). So your graph goes right out the window. DC is the worst for infant mortality, and Utah is the best, so the examples are blatantly cherry-picked. Now, the worst state is Mississippi. And its strongly Republican. And poor. Followed by Louisiana, South Carolina, and Alabama. DC tops the list, but since it's a District its deserved #1 ranking isn't granted.

Infant mortality is directly linked to poverty and available, affordable medical care. Utah's got a 9.7% poverty rate, compared to Washington DC's 16.9%. 
The US is ranked #33 in infant mortality. Below Cuba, below nearly all of Europe, below Brunei, below Cyprus. And that's the UN list. The CIA factbook puts the US at 46th.

Nice attempt to death-panel this discussion, but it doesn't fly. You're working off bad data.

,"You're right, there's gotta be a better way, and IMO it's the original way our country was designed to run. The Founding Fathers, adepts of ""The Enlightenment"" were profoundly deep and careful thinkers, and appear to have considered absolutely everything when figuring out how best for a nation to govern itself. They began with an astonishing premise: that every citizen, high-born and low-, had the same rights as a sovereign (king) in Europe and the rest of the world, and that The State did not confer those rights and therefore could not capriciously take them away. When an American bought a piece of land, he held ""allodial"" title to it, which meant that he owned it absolutely, as a king in Europe would own lands. This was unthinkable in the history of the world leading up to that moment.

These same thinkers must have considered democracy as a form of governance, but they evidently rejected it, not wanting to have ""mob rule."" So, they chose a ""representative republic"" wherein citizens would take turns stepping out of their normal occupations to occupy temporarily the various elected offices of government. They'd do their best to represent the interests of the people of their district, then when their term was up, go back to their lives. (The ""citizens"" to be selected at that time weren't just ""ordinary citizens"" but were rich white males who owned property. That evolved over time.)

This was a remarkable concept in governance, never equaled before or since. What happened to it? How did we get from that to... *this?*

The banking interests of Europe wanted to take control of our money, and resented not having control over America as they did over Europe. They began their attempts to subvert our autonomy as soon as the nation was formed and continued until they were finally successful, when they implemented the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. What you see as the America of today is a result of their subversion. We have a ruling class of aristocrats, all doing the bidding of the financial interests. We desperately need campaign finance reform so that the officials we elect will once again represent the interests of the people who voted for them, not the people who paid for their campaigns.

At the end of the day, CCP wasn't that far off their rocker in deciding to revert sov.  But the disturbing bit is that they didn't bother to check to see if the problem was contained to just TEST hitting Delve.

The PROBLEM is that CCP's petition resolution team is notoriously myopic; they simply cannot ""think outside the ticket"".  This is certainly not unique to CCP, many other software companies (particularly European ones) have the same problem.  

In this case, CCP could have easily determined that there were systems outside the scope of the ticket that fell within the rule that they drew up because of the ticket.  That they didn't do the investigative work to determine this themselves hints to several possible conclusions:

A.  It didn't occur to them to check the state of their database to see if any other systems met the same criteria as the TEST systems (incompetence).

B.  They didn't care about whether any other systems met the criteria because they hadn't been petitioned (negligence).

C.  They only investigated because it was in Delve (corruption).

,"Well, assuming that the two of us are right and can get from current evidence/arguments is an agnostic position with Occam's Razor cutting to no (aren't we smart - sarcastic), it might have the same scale of real-world implications as the turn away from the beliefs in gods. Changes in social norms, government policies, etc. have been concurrent with loss of unvalidated beliefs in religion in northern Europe. Some logical consequences for lost faith in free will for our judicial system are rather nicely laid out [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/20/E82.full). Or, [to put it this way](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/10/4499.full.pdf+html),   
   
&gt; If free will is an illusion, then it becomes more difficult to hold
people responsible for their actions. I have argued that one of the
reasons that individuals have been so reluctant to question the
reality of free will is the belief that it would be difficult for society
to function under a system in which this concept was abandoned.
However, this has not stopped people from speculating about the
inadequacies of the present system and alternative possibilities.
As argued by Wright, âAll told, then, âfree willâ has been a fairly
useful fiction, a rough proxy for utilitarian justice. But all of the
time-wasting debates now in progress (Is alcoholism a disease?
Are sex crimes an addiction? . . .) suggest that it is beginning to
outlive its usefulness. After another decade or two of biological
research, it may be more trouble than itâs worth; and in the
meantime, the scope of âfree willâ may have shrunk considerablyâ
(20). Wright then suggests, as one alternative, that we â....dispense
with volition altogether and adopt explicit utilitarian criteria
of punishment.â ...   
   
&gt;One might ask: How does this proposal differ from the present
system? Whereas in some ways, not significantly; in other ways it
differs fundamentally. The primary difference would be the
elimination of the illogical concept that individuals are in control
of their behavior in a manner that is something other than a
reflection of their genetic makeup and their environmental history.
Furthermore, psychiatrists and other experts on human behavior
should be eliminated from the initial judicial proceedingsâthe
role of the jury would be to simply determine whether or not the
defendant was guilty of committing the crime; the mental state of
the defendant would play no part in this decision. However, if a
defendant were found guilty, then a court-appointed panel of
experts would play a role in advising on matters of punishment and
treatment. This is a system that would hopefully minimize the
retributive aspect of criminal law; concerns about this aspect of
law, which have probably been around since laws were first introduced,
include those expressed by Wootton (33), Menninger (36),
and, more recently, Greene and Cohen (37). Also I note that I am
not the first to propose that psychiatrists should be excluded from
the initial court proceedings; Glueck (38) and Menninger (36), for
example, who both had substantially more expertise than I have in
this field, long ago made similar suggestions.   ",True,TheAgora,cuginhamer,c14bmf7,1426550760,False,t3_e0bnj,2,0,False,2,t1_c14axau,t1_c14bmf7,0,0,1288789202,,t5_2s584,

Yes. It took me 24 months after I got my B.A. (2 years of living at home, minus 4 months I was abroad ""trying/failing out"" grad school), but I am now teaching in Korea. I've been here for 8 months and have really enjoyed the experience. However, I'd traveled quite a bit before I came to Korea and I grew up in a predominantly Asian town, so the culture shock wasn't as much as it was for people I know. I know some people, mostly from New Zealand and South Africa, who STILL haven't adjusted to being in Korea, even after 8 months. Packing up and moving to Korea was the first traveling abroad they'd ever done.

So, my advice to you is to take it in steps unless you're one of the best-adjusted people you know. Take a month and go backpacking around Europe (novice) or Southeast Asia (less novice) or South America (even less novice). See how you like that, see what you learn about yourself.

,"From the comments
&gt; This is the biggest load of dribble i have ever read you are officially a idiot. 
when you wrote this article i take it you wanted to use the two most dirtiest and addictive substances to create a bad image for drugs.
professor nutt is not trying to promote the use of crack and heroin.
Drugs such as mdma,lsd and cannabis are all safer for you than alcohol this is proven yet you are too high and mighty in your castle to accept this. Alcohol is alot worse for your health than these substances. It is classified as a poison!
If you actually met any drug users you'd notice that they are most of them are generally hard working adults who like to unwind on the weekend with either a spliff, a couple of bombs of mdma at a rave etc etc. For some reason you wanted to talk about skag i dont know why. me and almost all my friends use drugs but i dont know anybody who uses heroin. your a fool. get a life

And

&gt; I don't agree with the majority of the conclusions you have reached in this article and think it's pretty short sighted and bordering on ignorant.

&gt;Firstly, your said ""I believe that legalising drugs, or even just taking them less seriously than alcohol, would be a social disaster in which the poor and disadvantaged would suffer most."" 

&gt;Don't you think that this is the case NOW, and precisely because of the laws of prohibition? Are you aware of anything that's happening in the drug producing countries? 

&gt;I have a Colombian girlfriend, and her country as we all know has been ravaged by the illegal black market in Cocaine. This market EXISTS and will continue to do so in Europe and the USA despite Cocaine being highly illegal in both areas. The UK and Spain consume more cocaine than any other countries in Europe - but is it legal?

&gt;The USA has pumped billion of dollars into the so called ""war of drugs"", and all it has caused in the countries producing the drugs is massive amounts of displaced people and poverty, hitting the poorest hardest. The drug growers just move elsewhere each time - the ""balloon effect"".

&gt;The point is, anyone with a grain of intelligence knows that humans have always and will always take drugs. FACT! Humans have consumed drugs and alcohol for many thousands of years. Have you not noticed that the laws don't affect this one bit? 

&gt;I have taken drugs, most of my friends have taken drugs, most people I know in London take drugs and all of them are respectable middle class university educated professionals in managerial positions. You imply that people can drink responsibly but that anyone taking drugs is irresponsible.

&gt;Drugs should without doubt be legalised and controlled. As you point out, most adults drink responsibly, and in exactly the same way, most adults take drugs responsibly.

&gt;All you're doing is feeding the classic stereotype of drugs users hanging out in back alleys and dirty toilets passing around dirty needles and AIDS. For God's sake wake up to reality!  

Pretty much sums up my feelings. Do you think that the small percentage of people who use cannabis, ecstasy, mushrooms etc cause more social problems than the millions of people who go out drinking on a Friday and Saturday night? Get real.

Democratic reformers, Solidarity, had been working for over a decade to gain power.  They won the first presidential election with Lech Walesa.  However, the economic changes hadn't yet produced desired results (in fact, they were in a deep recession).  So, a former communist elite was elected in the next election and served from 1995-2005.
    
Poland isn't unique, and this phenomena has occurred in a number of countries (not yet Slovenia where OP is from).  Hence, it is wise politically to make sure the economy rebounds before the next election.

,"About three years ago I was driving home after having gone through some serious emotional shit. The road was wet and slick after the first rain we'd had all summer. This fucking dog that hangs out in the area, his owner never keeps him on a leash, ran out in front of my car as I was coming out of a sharp turn. I was indeed going a little too fast, and I swerved to miss the dog. Worst mistake ever. I decided that now that I had missed the dog it was probably a good idea to miss the ditch as well. The jerking motion of my car mixed with the road conditions had me sliding sideways and backwards. I don't really remember much after that until my car had stopped. What ended up happened was I hit a huge (200lb I found out later) rock that lifted my driver side tires up. That rock saved my life. The guy lines of the telephone pole slid in behind my tires. If the rock had not picked my car up off the road I would have either had my head chopped off by the guy lines or the whole car would have rolled into a very pointy fence. I was about a half mile from my house and extremely dazed. I started walking and about 5 minutes later some guy who had drive by me earlier, saw the accident and turned around, gave me a ride.

About a year before that I was on a Eurotrip (not to catch the love of my life though what happens in Europe stays in Europe...). The last leg was a 3 day home stay in Malta. The group (about 34 of us) was split into 3-4 person boy/girl groups. A series of vans was sent to pick us up after the last planned event for the day, with 3-4 groups per van. Our van ended up dropping us off on the other side of Malta from our homestay 5 blocks from where they were supposed to be dropping off the group we were mistaken for. We were at this wedge shaped intersection of two streets. There was an old shirtless man sitting on the group outside of his fishing shop (you could see nets and his boat up in a garage like entrance) eating oysters out of a bucket. On the other side was an open-to-the-street bar that we were pretty damn sure was a gay bar with what we thought were scary gay fisherman who kept giving us the fisheye. In the middle was this white phonebooth. The three other guys in my group were scared shitless, and I was pretty close. It was about 11pm. So we did what all sensible Americans would do: we used the phone. We called the main branch number of the group we were with, the number meant for emergencies. We got redirected to the same lady 3 times, the one in charge of groups in Malta. We explained our situation three times. Every time she hung up on us. We tried to call the girl I was sleeping with on the trip, who of course was in the shower. So we start walking out towards the main roads. We find this big church and figure, hell if nothing else we'll stay there for the night. In Malta the catholic churches are real churches and there are indeed little fryers in brown robes that will offer you a meal and a place to stay, but I digress. After trying another series of phone calls in another phone booth we were walking back towards the church when a group of girls sitting on a raised concrete railing thing starting shouting out cat calls. We're all junior-senior aged highschool american boys, so of course we go over. Turns out these ladies were a group of extremely friendly hookers. We had some great conversation, and they told us how to get to the police station nearby. When we all looked like absolute idiots trying to figure out their directions they decided to take us. It was a really nice walk with the exception of one alleyway that looked exactly like the one in Hostel 2. Once we got there the hookers wouldn't go into the police station, but stayed outside and smoked. Inside we met some extremely nice cops who called all the other stations to see if anyone else was looking for us. Turns out when the girls showed up at our homestay's home the old man was like ""WTF, I've got four guys staying at my house, not four girls"" and went to the police station. The head cop was constantly making good natured jokes about the fact that we were brought in by hookers, and was constantly sexually harassing the one female cop there (making suggestive remarks, slapping her ass, etc.). She was not please. Eventually the couple showed up to take us home, but didn't have enough room for all of us in his little car. The head cop drove me in what looked all in the world like a little red Ferrari. When he took a call from his wife, who bitched him out in German, he apologized. I caught most of the conversation and replied with one of the few German phrases I knew, ""Aren't women a bitch?"", as my german II teacher at the time was a fat old pervert. Finally we got back to our homestay and proceeded to spend all night talking about our little adventure. 

One final note: The guy of the old couple we were staying with is retired in this nice little house. I asked him what he used to do and he replied with, ""During World War Two I smuggled things. Like, exotic birds, mammals, snakes, oh and I smuggled cocaine. Lots and lots of cocaine."" Greatest vacation ever.

As an Australian I am also sick to death of the ""Republicans = democrat"" bs. It sounds just like a cheap ploy weaken Liberal stances so that die hard Republican voters will win back the majority. 

Get some bloody perspective, things aren't nearly as bad as they were and they're getting better, why would you want to throw away all that you've accomplished so far either through opposition or apathy.

The main difference between Liberals in Europe and the US is that Liberals in the US are whiny, self-entitled cowards with no ability to see things through.

,"None of the issues you mentioned really touched upon the core of the problem, which is the one-man electoral district. 

See, when there is only one representative per electoral district, there will always be huge incentives for smaller parties to merge. Assume, for example, that in a random Californian electoral district the democratic party split into the ""democrats"" and the ""progressive democrats"", and that each party gets roughly 30 % each, leaving the republicans with 40 %. In the current system, this means the republicans win the electoral district, and the remaining 60 % of the voters will not have any representative at all.  Obviously, the two democratic parties would hate having the republicans in power more than each other, and to have any power at all they would merge. Any 5% party would of course never get any influence at all. (Also, a ""fun fact"": In the UK/American model a party can win control of the parliament with ~25% of the vote, since they only need 50.01% of the votes in 51% of the states).

The obvious solution to this is to do like in Europe (except for Britain) and make it so that there are several - let's say 20 - representatives per electoral district. This way a party with 30 % of the votes could get 30 % of the representatives, and a party with 5 % of the votes could get 5 % of the representatives. This is arguably much better than today, where 49% of the votes will give you precisely zero representatives.

In most European nations they have also introduced a couple of representatives that are awarded to the party that has the most disproportional ratio of %vote/%representatives. In Norway we call this a ""leveling seat"". For example, if a party has 4 % of the vote but only 2% of the representatives this party receives a leveling seat to make it all more representative of the vote.

One reason why the American system has been so dominated by parties is that it really wasn't designed to have parties in the first place; the founders had imagined that each place would simply send the guy the most trusted local citizen to the congress, and that would be it; no ""factions"" as Jefferson called it, no politicking etc. That failed pretty hard, but that's another story...",True,reddit.com,h0ncho,c14bywl,1426550920,False,t3_e0kt8,64,0,True,64,t1_c14bn8h,t1_c14bywl,0,0,1288795657,,t5_6,

That kind of statement would need to be based on the entire gene sequence, not just the y chromosome (or mitochondrial dna for that matter).

&gt; Q: Some political leaders from the US and Europe are calling for the RMB to appreciate at a faster pace. How do you respond?

&gt; A: On the RMB exchange rate, I suggest you carefully study [Premier Wen Jiabao's speech at the 6th China-EU Business Summit](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/07/c_13545683.htm), in which Premier Wen Jiabao elaborated on the issue.

&gt; In this era of globalization, we are all in the same boat. RMB appreciation cannot solve the issue of US trade deficit or reverse the imbalance in the world economy. This is simple and clear.

So you can only wonder.. when the Bush administration was [making up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Atta%27s_alleged_Prague_connection) Iraqi-9/11 connections, was that being diplomatic? Or when Bush personally misquoted IAEA reports from the 1980's as if they were current, to make the case Iraq was close to having the bomb, was that diplomacy? What about when the UN Inspectors were let back in, and the administration painted them and Hans Blix, as incompetent idiots for failing to find any weapons.. Was that diplomacy? Or when they started a hate-fest against ""Old Europe"" and France in particular for having the audacity to disbelieve all these trumped-up reasons for going to war, was _that_ diplomacy?

The only notion of 'diplomacy' that the Bush administration had was ""Getting everything we want without going to war."", and only in that sense did they ever try to find a 'diplomatic solution'. But you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe that _that_ was ever on the table. 

It was _obvious_ there was never going to be a diplomatic solution, because their _real_ goal was always to get rid of Saddam. Their 'problem' was that they couldn't convince anyone to go to war over that alone. So they had to come up with fake Al-Qaeda connections, exploiting the general post-9/11 psychosis, and WMD claims. It was nothing but an inconvenience to them that the only potential problem anyone really believed they had, actually _did_ have diplomatic solution.

,"&gt;The majority of third world countries are capitalist? Care to provide a citation?

As far as I know the only countries in the world that don't have traditional capitalist market economies are North Korea and Cuba, and even Cuba isn't too far removed from that model.  

&gt;I'm fairly certain the majority of developing countries are riddled with government and the governments are usually incredibly corrupt as well.

""Riddled with government?""  What does that mean?  There's nothing about capitalism that precludes a strong and powerful government.  In fact most of the most successful capitalist countries in history have had strong, powerful governments that intervened in the economy.  Of course, this is also an unsubstantiated statement, since many developing countries have had to shred their social safety nets and privatize government services and infrastructure due to IMF and World Bank structural adjustment plans.  ""Corruption"" also does not preclude a capitalist economy.

&gt;As with most things in modern human history, a government with too much power is responsible for most ills of humanity. 

Asserted with no evidence, but that's beside the point: This doesn't have anything to do with whether or not a country is capitalist.

&gt;Africa and South America are fairly solid examples of large governments with much power riddled with corruption.

""Africa"" and ""South America"" aren't countries that have governments.

&gt;Correlation does not imply causation. Do you truly think that under a communist or socialist system things would be any different? History has shown us that in fact things are far worse, there'd probably be much more wide spread starvation.

Actually history has *not* shown that.  There were famines in the Soviet Union in its early years, which is hardly unusual given the circumstances (fresh out of a civil war, huge political power struggles, drastic reorganization of society), but there were no significant famines in the Soviet Union after WWII.  Even the nations that the Soviet Union ""colonized"" in Eastern Europe and Central Asia were much better off than capitalist-aligned Third World countries today.  And history has not shown us that things would be ""far worse"" under a socialist system.  History has shown us that certain socialist countries have suffered failures at certain times and places.  It has also shown us that capitalism has suffered failures at certain times and places.  The fact that the Soviet Union failed at x thing at y time does not indicate that another hypothetical socialist country will fail at z thing at w time.

You're right, correlation is not causation.  That's why I don't say that just because people starve while capitalism is dominant it's capitalism's fault.  I say it's capitalism's fault because one can point to specific ways in which the global market destroys local Third World economies for the benefit of the developed world.

Also there doesn't need to be ""causation"" to prove the point I was arguing in what you quoted.  The guy claimed socialism was inherently prone to starvation, which is an absurd claim when one can point to specific mass famines that have occurred under capitalist governments and mass Third World famine that exists today under capitalism and continues unabated.

They *all* would disappear without funding ... as Mindboozer effectively admitted to below.  This is a core libertarian belief, that taxation is theft at gunpoint.  Taken to it's logical extreme, that even means down to your local level ... no municipal fire department, police.  No public schools.  No government provided roads.

And back up to the Federal level, it means no NASA.  No FAA making sure two planes don't crash into each other over your house.  No Department of Energy.  No FDA issuing nationwide recalls for eggs with [Salmonella](http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm223248.htm).

In the Libertarian ideology, free market actors will step in and perform all of these functions instead.  However, the libertarian ideology often glosses over [free rider problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem) especially when it comes to [public good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) types of items.  Mindboozer provided a perfect example below - he's just *certain* there's a private weather monitoring service out there.  somewhere.  He just can't point to any.  While there are some good points to Libertarianism as an ideology ... it often falls short when pressed to point to real-world examples.

Case in point -- in the US, our country existed for 130 years without an FDA.  During that time, no ""free market"" solution ever stepped in to solve the problem of food and medicinal poisonings ... until after one very severe incident - the [elixir sulfanilamide disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_sulfanilamide), the people decided that the government should step in.  In the Libertarian mindset, this is somehow the ultimate tyrrany - a democratically elected representative government stepping into the free market to protect its citizens.

In Libertarian ideology, ""bad actors"" will magically be removed by the free market.  Yet, just a decade or so after the FDA was created - a severe disaster was avoided in the US with [thalidomide](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873697,00.html) which caused a massive number of deformed babies across Europe ... but an FDA inspector blocked it from release here in the US.  The company that made thalidomide and put it on the market in Europe, is still in business today.

Libertarians get uncomfortable with the concept that the government has ever done anything right.  In the 1990's, regulations (and an actual cap and trade system) solved [acid rain problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain#History_of_acid_rain_in_the_United_States) in our country.  If left up to Libertarians, no regulations would have been put in place ... and the great lakes would be as dead as the dead sea.  To be fair, I would never make the argument that government is perfect.  Not by a long shot.  But Libertarians will frequently take instances where the government has not performed its best - extrapolate that to say it is a complete failure, and ignore any situation where there was a positive outcome because of the government. 

A large majority of Libertarians want no government at all.  Just private contracts between individuals.  And somehow they seem to think that this will evolve into a peaceful, magical society where everyone acts rationally in their own best interests at all times, and is a fully informed consumer in all areas and no [information asymmetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) ever exists between two parties.  They consider this ultimate utopia (which seems to ignore the entire history of human existence and human nature) a [stateless society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_society).  IMO, it really resembles medieval feudalism more than anything else. 

I can give you plenty of counterpoints to what the Libertarians will tell you here ... if you're interested.  Obviously, I'll be downvoted into oblivion - but you seem like the type that is interested in hearing both sides of an argument.  To be fair, there are some great ideas to consider and contemplate in Libertarian ideology.  Unfortunately they are wrapped up with a sense of hyperbole (liberty!  tyrrany!  theft at gunpoint!) and delivered by evangelists whom have generally studied which arguments have the greatest effect on the unprepared. These arguments, by the process of selection, tend not to have obvious refutations, and when confronted by a refutation, the commonest tactic is to recite another argument.

Just because I am not a murdered (and/or a cop) doesn't mean I can't recognize and condemn criminality.

the entire purpose of the rule of law and rule by the people is to *not have* ""the dark side of human nature"" in charge. That you cannot recognize this is a profound failing for you and your country.

You are completley missing the point of what I said, and my ability to murder or not has no bearing on the total corruption, venality, and crminality of the US armed forces and its ongoing war crimes.

Your nation is truly lost if you cannot recognize evil, and evil instiutions, when they rob from your public treasury to commit unjustified mass murder abroad. there is absolutely no reason to have a single soldier or aircraft in Iraq, it is a corrupt enterprise from day one and everything that follows from it - all the violence, all the terror, all the starvation - are the result of the profound criminality of the US and its military.

Apparenlty, if it were upt o people like you, the japaenese would not be war criminals for their actions in WW2, nor would the germans, the russians, the Congoese today etc... there is not law, there is no morality, there is only war and anything that happens therein is acceptable because it is ""horrible."" You are a disgrace to your nation if you cannot recognize the need for the rule of law, even in war, and that war should *never* be waged for illegitimate reasons - they hanged people in Nuremberg for committing precisely this crime - aggression - that the US now casually commits. Care to comment on this?

It is *precisely* because war is horrible that it should not be waged in such capricious and criminal manner that the US government has done so in the past half century.

If you think I do not know, I will leave you with the words of someone who agrees with me whom I believe you ought to respect as an authority, that the people and the soldiers of the US have completely forgotten:

&gt;You people of the South don't know what you are doing. This country will be drenched in blood, and God only knows how it will end. It is all folly, madness, a crime against civilization! You people speak so lightly of war; you don't know what you're talking about. War is a terrible thing! You mistake, too, the people of the North. They are a peaceable people but an earnest people, and they will fight, too. They are not going to let this country be destroyed without a mighty effort to save itâ¦ Besides, where are your men and appliances of war to contend against them? The North can make a steam engine, locomotive, or railway car; hardly a yard of cloth or pair of shoes can you make. You are rushing into war with one of the most powerful, ingeniously mechanical, and determined people on Earthâright at your doors. You are bound to fail. Only in your spirit and determination are you prepared for war. In all else you are totally unprepared, with a bad cause to start with. At first you will make headway, but as your limited resources begin to fail, shut out from the markets of Europe as you will be, your cause will begin to wane. If your people will but stop and think, they must see in the end that you will surely fail.

-------------

&gt;I confess, without shame, that I am sick and tired of fightingâits glory is all moonshine; even success the most brilliant is over dead and mangled bodies, with the anguish and lamentations of distant families, appealing to me for sons, husbands, and fathers ... it is only those who have never heard a shot, never heard the shriek and groans of the wounded and lacerated ... that cry aloud for more blood, more vengeance, more desolation.

Because the Democrats are about as leftist as the public face of the CDU, and that's the most right-wing (relevant) party Germany has, constantly taking care that no party right of them ever succeeds? That's the reason to call both wings ""right"". The reason to speak only about wings and not parties is that the variance inside the individual groups is larger than the variance between the groups.

...aside from the issue of centralised vs. decentralised government, of course. Dividing parties along those lines makes no sense at all to Europeans, because it's of course the federal government which rules federally and the states which defend their own interest.

So, in short, get the republicans out of the federal government and the democrats out of the state ones. Saner politics will ensue.

,"&gt;That's ridiculous because now you're just defining capitalism out of existence, under your definition nothing is a capitalist economy, because practically every capitalist country in history has had strong governments, or at least all of the ""successful"" ones. I could just as easily say that the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and any other country that could conceivably be used as an example of socialism isn't a real socialist country and therefore any criticisms of socialism based on those countries is invalid.

The most successful capitalist country (the U.S.) had quite a small government prior to the 1930s. But I will concede what you have to say, I'll state this though: without protection from coercion and fraud there cannot exist a capitalist economy. 

&gt;Africa and South America are countries? Wow, I had no idea. lol

You're being pedantic, I was referring to to the countries in South America and Africa tend to have similarities to the countries on the specific continents.

&gt;So no evidence then? Cool.

I gave evidence further below.

&gt;Your statement that this is the natural state of man in this context implies that these people are poor and starving ""naturally"" and capitalism has nothing to do with it. This is something you have to prove, given the fact that in our globalized, industrialized world, no one lives in a Darwinian vacuum.

It's simple, ancient man spent the majority of their time constantly looking for food and were obviously quite poor. Is this hard to understand?

&gt;So your best example of capitalism at work is a state where the government is heavily involved in the economy, even though you say this isn't real capitalism. Whoops! Your argument became completely incoherent quite suddenly!

The government was not as heavily involved when G.B. still had control of it. There aren't many examples now days of absolute free markets. But in general the most successful economies are the ones where the government is most hands off and don't chose winners and losers.

&gt;So you're saying people were better off under the Tsar and the Qing/KMT than they were under the Bolsheviks or the CCP? Are you sure about that? How do you define better off?

So? If it were a ""delete all files button"" that didn't 'remotely execute arbitrary code' would that immediately make it okay and immune from any laws? Why does it have to execute arbitrary code? The fact is, it was an undisclosed back door - which make any access obtained through it 'unauthorized'.

I believe I already established that, by virtue of him not disclosing it, the backdoor would seem to constitute unauthorized access. The act was clearly intentional, given that he admitted to doing it intentionally.

And seeing as I mentioned other first world countries, let's take a look at the UK's Computer Misuse Act (on which several commonwealth countries have modeled their computer crime laws).

Section 1 covers:

&gt; ""unauthorised access to computer material"" and is punishable by 6 months' imprisonment or a fine ""not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale"" (currently Â£5000)

Section 3 covers:

He modified the ban list. He was not authorized.

I was traveling through Europe, and ended up at a hostel in Florence.  It was a nice place, probably the nicest I stayed in all of Europe, but it was a little lonely.  If you've ever stayed in a hostel you know, the refrigerators tend to... *accumulate* things over time.  This hostel in particular had 6 floors, many of which were barely occupied, which meant six fridges full of random shit and freedom to experiment should you find yourself hungry &amp; poor or with a deathwish.

I came back one night drunk as hell and with a bad case of the munchies.  I hadn't bought any food during the day and there was nothing open at that point in the night, so I decided to get creative.

I scoured my floor, and the one above mine, and came up with a brilliant idea.  I found a tin of breadcrumbs, some ground parmesan cheese, various spices (garlic powder, cayenne pepper (!?), cumin, probably a few others) and some salsa, All of  *very questionable age*.  I decided I would mix the breadcrumbs, cheese, and spices together and fry them in a pan, then use the salsa like a tomato sauce and eat that.  With no one around to judge me, I was an italian master chef at work.

Well, being drunk and evidently wanting to pile on my future self I also managed to just decide proper washing of a pan wasn't that important.

I ate my creation, which turned out about the size of a huge omelet, with delight as I finished a half bottle of wine I had also scavenged.

EDIT: I just realized part of the reason it turned out like a giant omelet is because I also mixed in like 3 eggs (expiration date -??) I found on the floor above mine as well.  I knew I was leaving something out. God dammit.

,"Just read this response on ad busters site

""Dear Judith,

Thank you for making a detailed comment on the issue of Israel/Gaza. Here is a reply to some of your inquiries.

1) When we compare two items, do they need to be the same? I think they don't, but they do need to have some level of similarity. For example, comparing the rise of American Empire to British or Roman empire. No one thinks they are same but one can certainly draw parallels between these empires. Similarly, Warsaw ghetto and Gaza's open air prison are not the same but similar in aspects.

Q) How can you compare the trucks of aid that enter Gaza with the 250 calories a day fed to the people of Warsaw with the intent of starving them?

2) Israel recently released documents detailing the system of passing any supplies to Gaza and it revolves around the concept of ""breathing room"". Allowing just enough supplies for Gazan's to survive and nothing to store so in case of a conflict Israeli troops can stop the supplies. STARVE THEM BEFORE YOU FIGHT THEM seems to be the policy. In all fairness its not just Israel, Americans and British did the same in Iraq through sanctions before illegally attacking the country.

About malnutrition, here is a piece from JPost,

""There are serious problems of malnutrition, mainly as a result of a lack of protein in their diets â the main source of protein was fish, but because of the coastal blockade and Israeli fears of smuggling weapons via the sea, fishermen are not allowed to go out to where the fish can be found. There are also serious health problems as a result of the water, which is not fit for human consumption.""

Q) Are you seriously saying the goal of Israel is to starve the people of Gaza to death?

Seriously, I am not saying that the goal of Israel is to starve the people of Gaza to them. The current policy is to starve the people of Gaza and keep them an inch away from death. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has set 1,800 calories per person per day as the minimum amount of food necessary to prevent hunger. On that basis, the IDF has calculated how much food must enter Gaza every day based on the size of the population so that Israel fulfills its legal responsibilities as the occupier under the Geneva Conventions. I take 2500 cal/day, I will be starving in Gaza. JPost is saying that Gazans are suffering from malnutrition. Judith, how many times do you eat an extra meal? Are you worried about the 10 lbs that you need to lose? Well Gazan's can't have that extra meal.

Q) Can you explain the population increases of that population vs the annihilation of all the people of Warsaw.

3) 5000 people in died in Warsaw every week, 2500 Gazan's were killed in the recent War on Gaza 5800 wounded, not a bad start on the road to start a ghetto. And Read point # 1. And, Do you really want to drop yourself to a level where you are adopting Nazi standards, I don't.

Q) How about the points of entrance? Why can't these people go through Egypt.

4) Judith, I for one do not criticize Israel for creating Gaza prison. There are three guards to Gaza prison. US, Israel, and Egypt. US gives three billion dollars to the Egyptian dictator/yr for securing one end to the prison, the dictator is selling lives for dollars.

Q) As well, Israel treats many of the sick of Gaza, something that when it does not happen enough the Gazans complain about?

5) I applaud Israel's medical transfers. I think its a great deed. Few weeks ago, I gain insight into these transfers from ""I SHALL NOT HATE: A Gaza Doctor's Journey"" by Izzeldin Abuelaish. Please read the book to learn what a sick person has to go through before being transferred to Israel. Secondly, those transfers are not free, PLO pays for every cotton swabs used for these patients. Not so humanitarian.

Q) It is Hamas who calls for the death of every Jew in the world; to forget and discount the Jewish people who live on the border of Gaza and suffered a decade of relentless bombardment and compare them to Jewish innocents who hurt no one and were not politicized.

6) Judith, I beg you to ignore the rhetoric and look at the actions. According to UN, from July, 2007 to December, 2009 Hamas fired 2700 home made rockets, killing 4 Israeli's (innocents who hurt no one and were not politicized). During the same period, Israel fired 14,600 artillery shells into Gaza, killing 59 Palestinians civilians (innocents who hurt no one and were not politicized), and we are not counting the bombs dropped from the planes. That should settle who is firing what.

Q) Just curious, however. In your world when the Palestinian and his 200 descendants go back to their exact home of 123 Main Street, do you think he and his family will now have prosperity? What natural resources will he suddenly have? If a Jewish family lives there and the man is a lawyer and the wife a genetic researcher, will the now 201 residents who live there get their lifestyle? What exactly will this couple have taken from the land that makes it necessary for these people to go back to this exact spot?

7) No, but some compensation will be fair. Secondly, the ongoing settlements are evicting the 2000 year old residents of land, I hope you do not support them.

Q) As well, the Jews have 1/6th of 1% of the Middle East, the part with no resources, so what percentage is ok for them? And when will the Palestinians have enough room? Israel took in all the Jews thrown out of Arab land. What swap will there be for the land they gave up?
Q) Any room for the Jews anywhere?

8) Agree, but Israel also absorbed more than 1 million Jews from Russia and is inviting any Jew who left the land 2000 years ago to come and settle in Israel. Clearly, there is room for more people so why can't we allow the people that were forced to evict 60 years ago.

Land swap with Arabs, very few Jews were thrown out from the Arab countries, most sold their properties to settle in the ""promised land"".

Q? is it?) I just read that when the Soviet Union invaded the Kurile Islands and took them from Japan after WWII, they expelled the Islands' whole population and settled Russians. Can we have a re-do there? And also with respect to all the rest of the Russian population moved into communities in the Soviet Union and the 14 million Germans thrown from their homes in Europe.

9) What is your argument, they did wrong so we should be allowed to do wrong things as well. Secondly, look at your examples, they are over 60 years old, you want to do things ruthless tyrants committed 60 years ago and you do not want people to draw parallels?

Judith, When we compare two items, do they need to be the same? I think they don't, but they do need to have some level of similarity. IF ISRAEL WAS A RESTAURANT IT WOULD HAVE A ""JEWS ONLY"" SIGN AT THE DOOR. CAN WE DRAW A PARALLEL TO ""WHITES ONLY"" SIGNS?

The unarmed man is not just defenseless, he is also contemptible.

1. The world is filled with violence. Because criminals carry guns, we decent law-abiding citizens should also have guns. Otherwise they will win and the decent people will lose.

1. ""The tank, the B-52, the fighter-bomber, the state-controlled police and military are the weapons of dictatorship. The rifle is the weapon of democracy. If guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns. Only the police, the secret police, the military. The hired servants of our rulers. Only the government - and a few outlaws. I intend to be among the outlaws.""

1. ""When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.""
-- Thomas Jefferson

1. ""By calling attention to 'a well regulated militia', the 'security' of the nation, and the right of each citizen 'to keep and bear arms', our founding fathers recognized the essentially civilian nature of our economy. Although it is extremely unlikely that the fears of governmental tyranny which gave rise to the Second Amendment will ever be a major danger to our nation, the Amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic civilian-military relationships, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason, I believe the Second Amendment will always be important.""

Charles Austin Beard, historian

1. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.
Thomas Jefferson

1. Laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
Thomas Jefferson, quoting Cesare Beccaria

1. A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity.
Sigmund Freud, General Introduction to Psychoanalysis (1952)

1. The Second Amendment is a doomsday provision, one designed for those exceptionally rare circumstances where all other rights have failed -- where the government refuses to stand for reelection and silences those who protest; where courts have lost the courage to oppose, or can find no one to enforce their decrees. However improbable these contingencies may seem today, facing them unprepared is a mistake a free people get to make only once. Justice Alex Kozinski, US 9th Circuit Court, 2003

1. People sleep peacefully in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. George Orwell

:::Backstory that you need to know but no one wants to read (Iâll try to make this quick):::
 
I was in Nigeria for business. Working for an indigenous oil and gas company whose owner is a well-established millionaire. The day I was going to leave Nigeria, he insists we have a dinner party at his house. Important: This manâs company does a lot of business with us so it was really important that this dinner went well. To add to the pressure, he was flying his family from the UK to Nigeria just for the purpose of attending this dinner. He has a son, Abu, who is about my age. The dinner was at 8:00PM and Abu offers to show me around Lagos before the dinner.
 
...This is where the story begins! 

It was a hot and muggy Saturday afternoon in Lagos, the city smog was thick and the sunâs light seemed to shy away from the gritty streets like a scared puppy in the corner of a dark room. Abu picked me up from the office in his nice, new, all custom, Range Rover. With an exterior as black as the night and interior as white as the arctic snow, this vehicle stood as an artistic statement of power and class. Abu did his best to weave in and out of the corners of the city, the Range Roverâs gleam a stark contrast to the squalor all around us. After driving for about 30mins, he asks me in a thick, almost timeless, British accent, âwould you like to stop and get a drink?â. Sick of the Lagos traffic and dehydrated from eating nothing but peanuts all day, I replied, âsounds awesomeâ. 

We pull up to what looked like an iron wall, Abu beeps the horn twice and, like the doors to Oz, the iron wall opens to reveal what can only be described as a luxury hotel at the center of hell. Abu pulls in and parks the Range Rover in line with two Porsches and a Maserati. The worlds of luxury and elegance combine as we enter the marble halls of this hotel. Weâre greeted by the owner who promptly escorts us to a table out by the pool. The liver shaped pool seemed to boast arrogantly with its edges adorned by an array of supple European women, each a beauty queen in her own right. The hotel owner sat before us two perfectly prepared drinks and joined us for what turned into 2hrs of conversation about art, business, philosophy, and why bacon goes with everything. 

Having lost track of time, Abu tells me weâve got to hurry back as the dinner will start at 8PM sharp. We bid the hotel owner adieu, I slam the rest of my drink down, and frolic off back into the comfort of the Range Roverâs soft cloud equate interior. As weâre cursing along the freeway, I sit quietly trying to mentally prep myself for the dinner ahead while Abu drones on about something to do with microwaves and the environment blah blah. The Range Rover glides over the dilapidated freeway without a bump when, out of no where, deep inside the chamber of my bowels, a bump is indeed felt. Uncomfortably I shift in my seat. My eyes begin to aimlessly search the crisp interior of the car as my mind tries to understand whatâs brewing within. The seconds start to seem like hours as what feels like a deranged prisoner locked inside the walls of my stomach begins to try to pound his way out â with an ever growing intensity.
 
Iâve always been one to believe that a disciplined mind can control the body. So I told myself, âIâm not going to let this happen, there is too much at stakeâ. Quickly this battle cry is silenced by the black hole that is wrenching my insides. Category-5 waves of âalmost vomitâ slam against the levees of my throat, each one causing my cool and calm outward composure to breakdown more and more. Not wanting to really open my mouth, under my breath I quietly ask, âhey Abu, can you please pull overâ. He looks at me, slightly confused, and says, âweâre only 10mins from the houseâ. I say, âlook, I really got take a leak, pull overâ. Half-heartedly he pulls over to a patch of ground which fonts a small village and is flanked by a barely standing cement wall. At this point Iâm feeling dizzy, with shaky hands I quickly exit the Range Rover and stumble over to the cement wall. I press my sweaty head against the wall, whip out the olâ elephant trunk, and try to take a leak. I take a few deep breaths, just trying to regain control, when I completely BLACKOUT!
 
The next thing I know Iâm laying flat on my back and I can hear Abu yelling my name and telling me to âplease wake upâ. I open my eyes and see him above me, there are tears streaming down his face, he say, âthank god, I thought you died!â. I donât say anything, still light headed I sit up. Abu has both his hands on my shoulders, he is shaking me and asking if Iâm ok. I try to answer but instead of words the only thing that exits my mouth is an exorcist style stream of peanut based vomit. Poor Abu takes it directly to the chest. I can still see the whole thing in slow motion, even though the blow mainly hit his chest, his head snapped back, his eyes shut, and like something out of the Matrix he falls to the ground a few feet away.
 
Still reeling from the aftershock of what just happened, I lean forward onto my knees (kind of in a âdoggy styleâ position). Dizzy and confused, I look down, kinda between my legs, and realize the ivory tusk is still out, draggnâ ground. Behind it, I can see a few villagers have gathered around. From the looks on their faces itâs clear that theyâre in shock - guess that stereotype about white guys isnât true after all! Whatever, canât focus on that, before I even get a chance to smirk about it I blackout once more, collapse, and throw-up again. I awake with the right side of my face coated in the remainder of whatever peanuts where still in my stomach. However, at this point Iâm feeling like a million bucks. I hop up onto my feet, zip up any still exposed body parts (much to the villagers dismay), and walk back over to the Range Rover where Abu is using a towel to get the peanut mix out of his shirt. I stroll over to the passenger door, open it, and with a big smile on my face say, âdonât we have dinner plans?â. I sit down with a squish, oops, the white interior!

,"I can balance the budget in five points:

1. Raise income taxes in some way. Either let the Bush tax cuts expire (raising revenues by adjusting the marginal rates) or severely limit the vast amount of deductions people can take. Those various deductions add up to about 1 trillion every year. Cutting them in half would bring in 500 billion a year without raising the marginal tax rates.

2. Restore the Reagan balance to social security. When they set the payroll tax limit (only applied to the first ~$110,000 or so of income, indexed to inflation), that tax was applied to 90% of income. As the nation's income has become more top-heavy, it now is only applied to 80% of the income. It's really no mystery why Social Security is hurting. 

3. Dramatically reduce military spending. We spend $700 billion a year on the military. Our closest rival, China, spends $70 billion a year. We can cut the budget by half and still spend 5 times what they do. So I say do it. End the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, truly support the troops by bringing them home. Let Europe, Japan, and South Korea pay for their own damn defense, we're going broke over here. 

4. Medical care: allow Medicare/Medicaid to reimport drugs and negotiate drug prices. Establish a public option set at Medicare rates plus some percent. Yes, the doctors and drug companies wouldn't like this. But fundamentally, someone has to receive less money if we are to balance the budget. I would rather make Medicare more efficient than slash its coverages. 

5. There are some other expenses right now that are really high - food stamps and unemployment insurance. But these will decrease as the economy improves. 

That's it. We have a 1.3 trillion dollar deficit right now. A good chunk of that is just the bad economy (less revenues and higher unemployment and food stamp costs), but maybe 600-800 billion of it is structural, independent of the economy. We could comfortably bring in another 500 billion in income and social security taxes. We could shave a few hundred billion off of the pentagon, and those medical reforms could probably save 100 billion a year. 

These are rough estimates, but you can see that there are significant areas to save money. There are enough ways to bring in extra revenue and cut spending to completely balance the budget. But you are right, the SS+MEDI+Defense+Interest is where you need to look. You're not going to balance the budget by shutting down the EPA or cutting NASA's budget.

,"For all the Europeans, Australians and anyone else out there wondering why the election went the way it did yesterday here in America, this explains A LOT. It's been my recent experience that those on the right are FAR MORE likely to simply spit back out the propoganda they've heard. The propoganda itself is bad enough but sadly it is now an accepted political tool in America. Why? Because ignorant, ill-informed Americans completely buy into it and instead of being skeptical and researching political theory (and by that I mean simply going to wiki or a dictionary to learn the BASIC definition of socialism) and how it's used in America, they go straight from their couch to the voting booth. Somehow that has been construed as being ""political"" -or in tune with our political process. I'm not soliciting pity here, but we are simply left with too few options besides Lead, Follow or Get Out of the Way and unfortunately liberals (citizens, not politicians) seem, I feel, despondent and unencouraged to participate in the voting or political process at all (I struggled with this myself last week). Conservatives, on the other hand are the followers and they are willful and domineering people -once again my own experience. We value our right to say whatever the hell we want in this country but these are generally the people who, excessively, if you ask me, exercise that right most often and most publicly. And the leaders? Doesn't matter. They're all puppets for money. 

What's my point? THIS is where the anti-intellectual movement has gotten us in America. It has seeped into every nook, cranny and pore of our society and culture and has our country, I cant help but feel, careening to the right of the political spectrum. American Redditors are but a small slice of this country (and a biased one at that. by far and away liberal) so you must realize that for the most part Americans DO NOT think outside the box, they CONSISTENTLY take their freedoms and form of government for granted and then to top it off, they take ZERO responsibility for their actions, inactions and anti-intellectual lifestyle. 

So, we can sit back and trash-talk the media in this country until we are blue in the face but the fact remains that until American citizens concede their self-destructive ways and turn the tide on the increasing ignorance in this country we are destined, culturally and politically, to continue down the unfortunate path we've been on since September 11, 2001. But don't expect this to change all you foreigners because you simply can't just tell an American they're wrong any more because apparently besides all the freedoms we were given in the Bill of Rights we now have the right to be wrong and believe me people defend it just like speech and guns.

Americans! I would LOVE some feedback on this but for everyone else I hope I've given you a closer look at why exactly ""the most powerful nation on earth"" has become the largest cluster-fuck in human existence.

It is two party and always will be two party because it was intended to be two party. We work on a winner takes all system.

In America, if you get 20% you lose, and most likely took that 20% of the vote away from a candidate who could have used it to win.

To solve this problem, parties join, they always join up to beat the opposition. They look at it as, well they are getting 40% of the vote, Im getting 30% and you are getting 20%. We know neither of us can win, so lets bundle are parties constituents together and get 50% of the vote FTW!

,"The dollar is still by FAR the #1 reserve currency in the world.  Yes, it may be devaluing over time, angering a nation like China which has 60% or more of their reserves in dollars, however this is not an ultimate reason or indicator that things will change soon, if at all.  The USD has shown unmatched stability in comparison to the other reserve currencies, and this is what really matters right now.  

Lets look at the other realistic options:
Euro, Yen, SDRs  

Do you think, after looking at the EU's recent trouble, that a nation would suddenly exchange their dollar reserves for Euros?  Don't think so.

Yen - Japan's currency is strong which might suggest a good reserve option.  However, Japan's future is quite unstable (aging population, bad loans, increasing public debt).  Yes, countries keep Yen reserves, but a replacement of the dollar?  Ehh...not likely

SDRs - I don't know much about them but I'm inclined to simply say not likely, however I'd like to see what people with more knowledge have to say.

In the end, it's going to take a lot more than a bit of inflation to remove the USD's title of #1 reserve currency.  Stability is the key and we've shown stability.  Yes we fluctuate like any other non-fixed currency but it usually evens out in the end.

,"If I remember correctly, Canada doesn't have huge stockpiles of dollars like China does. Some time ago, the China Investment branch of the Chinese government switched from just piling up dollars to making targeted investments. They've started buying up banks, industries etc.

Sure, the dollar can be debased, but that would leave the US in an even greater mess. I could point to the Germans for a similar episode in the past.

The stuff you buy from China is mostly throwaway stuff. It doesn't hold its value, while the Chinese can still buy up your gold with your dollars, which they are.

And saying you can't have friends in international relations is bullshit.

If you think that my view is based on conspiracies, you're wrong. I do put the current American way into perspective and look further back than just a few years. Basically you are claiming that Americans will prevail where every empire has fallen before it. Judging by the progress of the current economic recovery around the globe, America isn't doing that well. You're lagging behind, and with more crises on the horizon, my bet is that Wallstreet and their bailout elves will not magically fix this. You'll be looted before you know you should be reacting.

Your current debt levels are insane. Especially given that you accumulated a large proportion of it because of an insatiable need to control the world to preserve your #1 position. You may want to wake up and smell the bullshit, because most things that got you to #1 (education, safety within your borders, infrastructure, diplomatic friends) are withering away.

Your foundations have eroded and are cracking under the weight of your debt. And fixing those foundations costs a lot (money an time), which will be an even heavier burden to hold up.

When I feel hindered, it's usually my ego, so I say ""Fuck you, ego"" and do whatever my ego doesn't want me to do, to break what little ground my ego has now. 

You can always meditate in your car (if you drive). For me, I meditate on my way to work. I silence my mind, and become fully aware of what I am doing and where I am. Every split second I stay in the ""Now"". Of course times come when you have to stop and focus more on driving than on silence but it helps, especially if I'm sitting in traffic, that's the best time to meditate. Traffic is usually annoying, but you can begin your breathing, and pull your awareness into the now. Which will not only relax you in stressful traffic, but also be a great test of your patience and your ability to respond to stressful situations. It's a great practice. I usually get so relaxed that I'm smiling all big and sometimes giggling to myself.

Wherever you have extra time that you have to waste, like sitting in traffic, or waiting in a doctors office, or waiting in line, try practicing forms of meditation. By the way, you don't need to sit in any way to properly meditate, or close your eyes. You can do it standing up, sitting at your desk or driving. It's just pulling your attention into the now. Being aware of the present moment.

I did start, but the **second** paragraph is:
The most liberal Muslim intellectuals who focused on religious reform include Sayyid al-Qimni, Nasr Abu Zayd, Abdolkarim Soroush, Mohammed Arkoun, Mohammed Shahrour, Ahmed Subhy Mansour, Edip Yuksel, Gamal al-Banna, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Ahmed Al-Gubbanchi, Mahmoud Mohammed Taha, and Faraj Foda, the last two were killed after apostasy claims which most of them have been accused of by traditional islamic scholars.

Come on man, being killed for ""apostasy""?? Really?? So in order to reform Islam, you have to pretty much expect to be killed. And this is TODAY, not the days of Genghis Khan. Still not convinced.

In response to the cartoons which I have already dealt with. Look at the genocidal context of the Western occupations of Iraq/Afghanistan.

What is new however is the genocidal western barbarism in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.

,"Heh...

I was in charge of doing maintenance to some servers of a very busy call center that handled customer service for a few companies. We had different IVRs for 4 or 5 different locations, configured in an active/active failover. Incoming calls come from the PBX to either server. To do maintenance we had to disable the server from some management application, otherwise calls might come to that one and the user would get a ""technical problem, please call again"" message. The service was 24h all over the world so even if they were not in prime time we had to make sure calls could always go through (client requirement, of couse)

It was around noon in the US and I had to fix some shit on the European servers. So I just open the application to reroute the european calls, do the failover, do some test calls, check the status and everything seems ok. Time to RDP to the now standby server. I ran some patches, change some settings, and proceed to reboot the server. The naming convention was xxIVR01 or 02 and xx was the location (US, EU, LA, etc).

I open up a terminal and do a ping to see the server coming up. Maybe some 30 seconds into it I noticed that the server is still replying, but the other application says the server is in fact offline. Something's wrong. Hmmmm.....

You know that feeling when you realize what just happened, that sweet sweet agony of discovering what the problem is (and how to solve it) but at the same time realizing that you just did something incredibly stupid?

Because the server name was very similar, I RDP'd to USIVR01 instead of EUIVR01. I took down the US server during prime time. USIVR02 picked up but it could handle all the load. That's not it, the changes I made on USIVR01 for some reason fucked up USIVR02 too, so now ALL incoming calls were being dropped. In those 10 to 15 minutes it took to reboot the server, undo the changes and bring it back up a few hundred calls were lost, dropping the SLA of several clients and getting some managers pissed off.

Look to [425](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/italytime.html). While we might be more familiar with the 'ghettos' of Nazi-Europe, it was by no means a new idea. Usually they were even established in already existing jewish quarters of cities.

If you travel in any part of Spain that was occupied by the muslims, you will see a [Jewish quarter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_quarter_(diaspora\)) or ghetto. It was a part of the city where Jews were permitted to live.

,"&gt; My view: Nations and race mean nothing.

You're not quite right. They might mean a lot, depending on what you mean by ""mean"".

From a biological perspective, yes, we're pretty much the same kind of organisms. No one doubts this.

I'd also agree that from an ethical perspective, race *ought* to mean nothing in an ideal world.

BUT. The reality is that your race and nation DOES mean a lot when it comes to the stereotypes you'll be associated with, the opportunities you're exposed to, the social pressures you're subjected to by your immediate family circles and I'd argue EVEN the image and expectations you have of yourself. For example, being white has very concrete advantages even in an egalitarian society like the USA. There are certain things that you are expected do and certain things that you don't. Ditto for being Asian, Black, and so on.

How often have we heard statements like, oh, the Japanese have very high standards for quality; the Europeans tend to be cultured; the Arabs are hyper-religious and conservative, or that the Chinese are hard working and collectivist.

&gt;Of course it's still prejudice -- making assumptions based on appearances -- but do you really think all the zealous folk in Southern churches and backwater community centers would have a beef if, suddenly, the Middle East mass-converted to Christianity?

Tell that to African Americans. Converting to Christianity did wonders for them.

&gt;Do you think the majority of people really have an issue with huskier complexions rather than an ideology of violence and bigotry (and associated -- justly or injustly -- with terrorism) that is incompatible with the West?

Several point. Firstly Western capitalism and democracy is orders of magnitude more violent, exploitative and repressive than Islam. Secondly, just look at America's horrific history of racial persecution and xenophobia. Modern Islamophobia is an ugly, irrational melange of xenophobia, racism, imperialism and, yes, religious bigotry.

,"This is even more of a propagandized response than I'm used to taking on. But let me take this one step at a time.

Firstly, you are buying the government line, when there are many other indicators that paint an entirely different picture. GDP, for instance, isn't calculated the same way it used to be. When we drop a bomb in Yemen, that destructive use of scarce resources, is counted as GDP. When Goldman Sachs sells a MBS package that is counted as GDP. When I buy a sweater from Banana Republic that was made in Egypt, that is counted as GDP. In all cases, we have produced nothing.

Secondly, the Consumer Price Index that is used to help calculate inflation is another big propaganda piece. If the price of somethings hikes up in a way that doesn't fit the inflation narrative the FED is projecting, they simply don't count it, and give some other excuse as to why that price is rising. I know that there is some distribution value added here, but that isn't accounted for in the government statistics.

There is absolutely no way we are going through deflation. We haven't seen any price lowering. Perhaps you are conflating the credit crunch with deflation. Or maybe this is some kind Orwellian double jive. The prices of just about everything is going up, yet deflation is the threat? hmmm? Monetizing debt, re: QE1 and QE2, creates inflation, how is that contributing price stability?

In terms of Gold, the DOW has lost of 50% of its value over the last 15 years. Now before you go all Glenn Beck gold bubble on me, the DOW is performing even worse in compared to zinc, copper, oil, and as one redditor pointed out pork bellies.

Our currency is actually at record lows compared to the Australian dollar, and yes... gold, zinc, copper, pork bellies. Just to give you an idea of how fantastical our bubble economy can get, Yahoo was once trading higher than the entire GDP of New Zealand . And the fallacy of our exports increasing during a weaker currency assumes we actually produce things other countries want to buy. We are running a tremendous trade deficit, and we have been for decades. What we produce is hot money, nothing else. 

On a side note, I had some investments in Brazil, and I was sure they wouldn't or at least would be the last to debase their currency in response to a weakening dollar. Boy was I pissed when they took overnight measures to undercut the dollar.

China and the EU have, to great success, imposed capital controls in their respective currency zones to fend off speculative hot money influxes. In other words, they are breaking parity. China, in fact is encouraging their citizens to buy silver and save. Unfortunately for the European countries, they have some terrible entitlement programs that are drag on their neighbors who may have more sensible policies.

Obviously the dollar is the reserve currency of the world, that is a given. China used to buy ad nauseam in order to stabilize their export market and the Japanese are doing the same thing. Rather than retooling their factories and adjusting their market, they are propping up our banking system. There are external factors at work here. You would also do well to remember that our military might all over the world has tremendous influence. 

You are making the classic Keynsian mistake. Credit is not capital. Capital is derived from savings. Savings, by definition, is under consumption. Our government, and the FED, encourages us to get deeper into debt. And rising prices during stagflation is sure to prove as much.

We are openly devaluing our dollar, that means your savings and your purchasing power is set to decline. That also means debt will be easier to cope with, this simply encourages taking on more debt.

The radicalization of the Mideast also was an effect of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the land grab by the French and English.

moderator,"Courtesy of Goggris:

&gt;Make a Q&amp;A thread; archive and organize all the questions for future reference.

That's basically what this is. I asked the LFG people to make a different thread, since I wanted this to be all about asking questions.

&gt;1) Why isn't the Vet tournament seeded by ELO? You can assume unranked players are 1200s.

Because it's unnecessarily complex for extremely limited gain.

&gt;2) One week to determine picks and bans? You may want to reword that.

We are basically giving people one week to determine the picks/bans before they play, so when they get to the practice game they aren't. 

&gt;3) Why aren't we using draft mode in practice to just ban/draft? If the other team doesn't have Miss Fortune, why do I want to waste a ban on her? An on-paper ban is fundamentally flawed unless we know which heroes each person on the other team owns.

We'll do that.

&gt;4) If you get first ban, I assume you'll have second pick?

Yep.

&gt;5) What about a player who is level 25 now? That is, if they advance in level in the middle of a tournament, how will that go?

Case by case basis.

&gt;6) I still think $10 is quite steep for administrators. That's equivalent to 3rd place in the newbie/veteran tournament. I understand it takes time and effort to organize, but most TOs will put any money into re-investing into improving the community or getting better setups, etc. etc. Why not use the $50 total to hold a raffle or more casual event to keep/generate interest in the community? That is, we're not an entirely competitive community; let's use that RP for a drawing contest or something.

It wasn't originally in our plan, but Marcou suggested we do it. In fact, I've told you that before. If enough people are legitimately upset we can lower it to 5 dollars per admin, and make the 3rd place in the ARAM get 10 per person instead of 5.  (leaves 5 dollars leftover total)

&gt;7) What's the process if both teams fail to show up at a proposed time?

Case by case basis - shouldn't happen if two captains agree to that time.  If one team doesn't show, it's a forfeit.

&gt;8) What if a time is never scheduled? Whose shoulders does it fall on? Basically, you guys need to make rules for disqualification and whatnot very clear.

Both teams forfeit. It is the fault of the captains of each team if they cannot come up with one hour or so out of a week for both teams to play in this tournament.

&gt;9) Are matches best of 1? Best of 3 (and if best of 3, policy on picking blue/purple team)? What about finals? Single Elimination? Double Elimination? Swiss and cut to top 8?

Best of 1 for most games.  Finals will probably be best of 3.

&gt;10) Can we reconsider the ARAM tourney, or at least get some popular opinion on it? If this tournament is for US servers, what about hosting one for EU? What about a TT tournament? I honestly don't see it as being competitive.

No, we will not reconsider.  Also, EU tourneys need to be dealt with by the EU Riot employees.  The point isn't for it to be as competitive, and just be more fun (that's why we're doing ARAM).

&gt;11) We have no dates at all for when the tournament is starting or signups.

Be patient. This is merely a preliminary information session.

&gt;12) How are we going to receive our prizes, and who is going to handle that?

We give the summoner names of the winners to Matt Marcou, who will distribute prizes accordingly.

&gt;13) Policy on new champions or items being released in the middle of the tournament?

What policy is needed?  Anything available on live is fair game.

&gt;14) Punishments for raging/unsportsmanship behavior?

Case by case basis.

&gt;15) What's the rule on disconnects?

Case by case basis - leaning towards no mercy.  Otherwise it would be too easy to game the system and disconnect on purpose.

&gt;16) How do we report results?

BOTH captains report it to their admin. If we can get livestream to work, it would help.

&gt;17) How much RP is $5 worth of RP? Are we going by lowest pay scale? Highest?

Well let's see... I went to ""Purchase Riot Points"" in the client, and it says $5 will get you 650 RP. Yep.

No, we get the point. The Warsaw Ghetto was exterminated. It was used as a way station for the transport of Jews to the death camps. And the people of the Ghetto fought back by attacking German soldiers, not by randomly attacking civilians.

,"As *MentalVacancy* [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ds8ux/dea_speaks_out_against_legalization/c12iysn), this article was written to invoke an emotional response, not a logical one. Here are some counter-points I wrote, just for the sake of debate.

**Medical Marijuana - It already exists**

&gt;Are those who are calling for Legalizing marijuana really calling for medicine?

* Tylenol has quite a wide variety of their brand painkiller. But what about Advil, Ibuprofen, Vicoden, etc, etc? By this logic, there should only be one brand or variation of any given painkiller, yet that is not the case. If any form of government were to restrict OTC medication ""because one kind of pain medication should be sufficient for all Americans"", how do you think the people would react? In addition, and what *should* have been the argument behind Prop 19 from the beginning, is our right under the Constitution for personal responsibility to self-medicate without regard to a person's motives.

**Marijuana and Crime**

* This whole point is useless. It serves no point and provides no basis to fund the argument that marijuana is bad in any way. Correlation does not imply causation.

**What happens when drugs are legalized?**

&gt;the best way to predict possible effects is to examine what happened in places that have tried drug legalization.

* Yes, but only if it's a two way street. You can't say ""look it failed in Alaska in the 70's!!!"" while simultaneously ignoring that legalization has worked perfectly fine in several **modern** European countries. A lot has changed since the 70's, it's unfair to say that because something didn't work back then that it wont work in a more modern, more advanced, and generally smarter society.

**Confusion in California**

&gt;the law has created so much confusion about what is and what is not ""medical"" marijuana that it has opened loopholes allowing anyone to grow, traffic, and smoke marijuana with virtual impunity.

* I'm not familiar enough with this specific Prop to comment on it directly, but I read this to mean Prop 215 = confusion = loopholes. Prop 215 is documented in the same manner as every other prop in the US. If people are becoming confused by it, then that should be addressed accordingly, but saying the proposition is at fault because it's being misunderstood or used inappropriately is invalid. Taxes are confusing as fuck, yet the IRS doesn't allow people to get away with tax fraud because of it.

**What Are Drug Treatment Courts?**

* More filler text with no purpose.

**Marijuana and Addiction**

* The scary ""addiction"" statistics aren't so scary when they're [compared to other, **legal** substances, like Nicotine and Alcohol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_%28mean_physical_harm_and_mean_dependence%29.svg) that are **far** more harmful in many ways.

* I've never actually done it, but yeah, you can. It's not allowed, nor is it in amsterdam (Amsterdam is merely a city in the netherlands, the exact same laws apply here in Eindhoven) but the police will only take any kind of action if there are children and/or old people around. The action is no more than a request to smoke elsewhere, preferably inside. I usually smoke with the same people, and we try not to bother anyone. That's harder to control when high, so we stay inside when we do it, mostly. Also, I bake more often than I smoke.

*  I don't do it, and I don't really know anyone that does, but yeah, it'd be possible. It's legal to own and harvest up to ~~three~~ five plants.

*  It's not, portugal has a comparable system. Even more lenient, or so I heard. I'm not an expert on the subject.

*  No. Never experienced or even heard of them, really. I'm sure it happens, but rarely. Violence because of alcohol abuse is much worse. Doesn't happen often, but on saturdaynights, it does.

,"You're looking at our economy as too black and white, and assuming the slippery slope argument. You propose worse case scenario, with no middle ground that is more likely to happen (which is what I argue for). Like I said, we're not seeing the end of the world. 

1) Regarding GDP, CPI and infl/deflation - I'm not a big fan of defense spending, I'll leave that. I think it should be gutted.

But, when BR sells a shirt made in another country, the Gap company makes a profit off that. That money goes to the US. I'm not sure what nothing you're talking about, that looks like a growth in capital (profit). They actually export quite a bit and help our trade deficit. What credit do you give to the American marketers or financiers or strategists that made the business possible? Or the designers to design the clothes? It's not all about the gain / loss of manufacturing labor -.- 

I'm not sure how you think businesses run, but the actual product they produce is never their strength (what lets them compete with other companies). If the best product can't be competitive in the market, it will fail.

I do agree that the CPI is out dated. I don't think Americans buy half the stuff on the list anymore anyways, but - America has seen an enormous increase in purchasing power with modern trade over the last 20 years. The average person can consume so much more than before (and I'm not talking about driving up debt). It has never been easier to go to do things like go to college, own your house/ car, buy a wide arrange of groceries, all that cheap shit from Walmart, travel the world, etc. We also have very low sales taxes compared to the rest of the developed world, making whatever inflation we do see almost irrelevant. Americans do need to and are changing their spending habits as a result of the financial crisis. Savings has gone up!

2) comparing USD to Gold. Oy, everyone likes to do this. Look how much gold you could buy in 1910 with 1 inflation adjusted dollar! Gold is just a commodity. It isn't commonly bought or used by consumers like eggs are, so why are you comparing our dollar to it? It's a globally traded extravagance (perceived value)/ tech commodity. Gold is so god awfully high right now due to speculation, just like oil was when it hit $4.00/ gal and then crashed. If this were true, the value of our dollar would have been cut in half during the crisis, except everyone else's currency tanked harder so we actually came out ahead. Capital goes where returns are highest [for a risk adjusted rate]. Investors think gold will offer them a higher return, and the stock markets are too risky and won't offer a good enough return. As the stock markets pick up, people will dump gold and go back into the stock markets and gold will crash, yada yada Bubble you think is a myth. 

3) Chinese Yuan vs USD - um, first off it's a fixed currency. Real value not changed. Secondly, we WANT it to appreciate vs the USD so our exports can be more competitive globally because the actual value of the Yuan is significantly higher than the set amount now. China plays dirty by fixing their currency to ours lower than it's market value is. Thirdly, it's the fastest growing economy, and a developing country - where do you expect it's currency to go? Down? It's not like China started on a level playing field with us like the Euro or Pound. It's a high demand, low supply currency at the moment that's valued way too low.

As for the Aussies, good for them. Haven't really heard much news on their economy, so I don't really have a comment.

4) The EU is kind of fucked right now in case you missed the incidents with Greece, France, UK and Germany? Their currency was valued too high for a while crippling their exports too. Not sure they were a great example... Like I said about China, they cheat to drive their export market and growth. If it was correctly valued it would curb their exports significantly and they would be hurting like everyone else. They get huge amounts of pressure now from pretty much everyone to let the markets value their currency.

5) Credit and capital. Credit is actually capital + the cost of the capital. Your definition of capital doesn't really apply to companies, and I don't think you know how business financing works do you? I'm talking about business financing. You're talking about Personal Savings. HUGE DIFFERENCE. I'm all for our population saving. I'm also for our businesses OPERATING.

Businesses run on capital from 2 sources - Debt and Equity. Since most small to mid sized companies are private, they run on debt, usually from banks, family or friends, or even loans from them selves they one day intend to pay back. The debt allows them to operate, and hopefully make enough after the cost of debt (interest rate) to support themselves (or get rich!) [As you get into public companies, you balance debt (cheap, risky) with equity (costly, not as risky)] Please please PLEASE don't say debt is bad in business! It is totally different from *personal debt* which I don't like.

The biggest problem we're having right now is small to mid sized companies aren't getting any credit. This means they don't have enough capital to operate, or start up, or pay their bills, and their growth stops and they start to die.

I'm not sure how you got Keynsian out of financing. Keynsian is the theory Government should spend where it's economy is lacking no? Not relevant.

6) Openly devaluing the dollar - you missed my word ""stable."" It's a balance. We want a lowER currency, but a stable one. We want to do this to an extent because it's hugely successful in China. They get crazy growth for having a crazy currency, but they cheat too. We can't really cheat. The market still sets our currency prices. 

You don't really seem like an economist, and definitely not a financier. I see a big trend of that here. The more I understand about the two topics, the more respect I have for the decisions made by the Fed. They weren't perfect and some people get hurt, but they really aren't that bad and probably the best ones that could be made at the time. There are definitely people smarter than us working there trying their hardest. We are not as fucked as you think.

The biggest impact you will see is from your state regulations, and then cities openness to big corporations. States most heavily regulated are doing shitty now (MI, CA) and we're doing reasonably well in TX (especially being in San Antonio with USAA, Rack Space, Valero, NuStar, Toyota, etc..) Heavy state regulations not only hinder companies already there, but also deter others from setting up shop in your state.

Moving on...

First of all, culture is ever changing...and when discussing indian culture, you have to keep the global context too...that is, indian culture has been lately influenced by the globe, and the globe in part, has been in its own way, influenced by indian culture too.

For the sake of limiting this discussion, lets define culture in terms of a few key things : religious thought, traditional customs, movies, food, music, public opinion things like media coverage. (there are plenty more, but i dont have all night to write this). 

Now lets see how NRIs have contributed to these things

*Religious thought: Nothing in particular. These are more or less old things which have been going on for centuries. One thing they actually have made an impact on is the dissemnation of these things, with temples, gurudwaras etc being built in various places in europe and US. Dubai has one temple too;)

There has been the Hare Krishna movement, which has had a few converts in the west, but is still looked at by westeners as a fringe movement and sort of cockoo. However, money has flowed from ISKON into making grand temples in India.

Indian businessmen are actually surprisingly religous, and contribute a lot to various temples, and religious institutions. I assume many of them to be NRI businessmen too, so their financial contribution to the upkeep and speading of religious insitutions, I imagine, is large...though I have no way to prove it, so its mere speculation from my part. Someone here should prove or debunk this.

Traditional customs: One of the oldest Indian traditional customs (if it can be called that) is Yoga. It has been a cheif cultural export from India. NRIs brought yoga to the *mainstream* in the west. Interest in it meant free flow of interested people in india too, with ashrams swelling with such people in places like haridwar. Overall, Yoga has gained respect and prominece among quite a few people worldwide, and I guess, one of the main reasons is NRIs. 

Its not that westerners did not know about Yoga before NRIs started to go in droves abroad ... its just that it did not take off, and did not have such a great acceptance in western society as it did then...

*Business: Another way in which NRIs have had an effect on indian culture is by their success, especially in the US technology side. Since the fifities, and especially in the seventies and onwards, IIT grads have been shifting to the US for higher studies, and ended up working there and doing really well, for the most part. They stayed there, earned great and were generally prosperous. This prompted the great IIT study race...where students basically gave up all fun and life for about 3-4 years to study for the IITs. Coaching classes started springing up all across the country promising to get poeple in the IITs....with a town in Rajasthan (Kota) being famous for this shit ... producing students which enter the IITs in relatively large numbers. The IIT grads (some of them) also became reallly really rich, and contributed back to the IITs...financial or otherwise. 

In many ways, I think NRIs have served the role of a lubricant (for lack of a better word) between the non-indian-origin westerners, and Indians. For example, many NRIs came back to india during the boom period to lead Indian operations of major international companies who wanted to set up a presence in India.

FDI in india grew a lot during the last ten years, in no part because of NRIs having a hand in it, either by directly investing money, or by convincing people to do so.

*Movies and TV: We all know Yash chopra movies in the nineties and stuff...and how they catered to the growing US/UK market. If you look at the bollywood movies which have done well internationally (relatively speaking) you will find some of them even entering the UK top ten...Whenever I talk to my NRI friends, they always seem to know about the upcoming bollywood releases, most of the time even I dont know about them (mainly because I think most bollywood movies suck). I think filmakers have catered to this growing interest, and it reflects in the movies we make sometimes(not all the times though) as well. These movies have also attracted tourism in international locations from Indians and Indian origian people....there are some places in switzerland for example where there are so many indian visitors that they readily serve people samosas and chais there. (these are just one or two small places in the hills though, so dont assume at all the entire country is like this!). 

Also, Katrina Kaif.

Regarding TV, shows like Goodness gracious me and the Kumars at number 42 have been sucessfull in the UK, but not that much here in India, though it does have popularity amongst small numbers here. I havent seen any NRIs as such play a good role in TV production yet (on or off the camera), but I'm not knowledgable at all about this area, so maybe some other person can shed more light on this.

Music: You have artistes like Richie rich, asian dub foundation, Raghav, J Sean, etc doing okay ... with J Sean, Raghav and Richie rich being slightly successfull in India too. All the indian sounds you hear sometimes from various pop stars like Nelly furtado, Jay-z, MIA, etc - someone must be playing those instruments as well....most of them are NRIs. 

Food: Chicken tikka masala is quite popular in the UK. Some say a bangladeshi immigrant invented it, and some say an Indian person did it. Who knows. It still has indian influences in it, and has a cultural role to play in the UK too. NRIs have played a role in the greater awareness and appreciation of indian cuisine. Most NRIs have kept their indian resturaunts fairly high end (at at least not fast food type cheap) which led to the greater perception (warranted or not) of Indian food being somewhat high-endy (for lack of a better word) and not something to take lightly. 

*Public opinion and media coverage: This is a double edged sword. many NRIs are still harshly critical about everyday life in India whenever they talk about India with their western counterparts (everyday life, not business stuff). 

They have been quick to call us out on the gujarat riots, and lobbied intensively to deny Narendra Modi a US visa. The India Caucus is growing in influence with some major US politicians trying to be on its good side. Its still never going to be as influential as day, APAC, but they have been having some influence on politicans in the US, and have lobbied hard for policies which promote india friendly things like outsourcing. 


Regarding how Indians percieve NRIs? If they are relatives, then they are looked at as a thing which can get them some stuff which isnt avaible here....'When are you coming from the US? Bring me an iPad from there'...stuff like that ... though with the opening up of the economy and the increased avalibility of goods, this has reduced a bit, but still prevelant. 

I noticed that most people view NRIs (if they are not their relatives) as foreginers which just have a little more of an idea of how india works. The average shopkeeper on the street, if he find you're an NRI, will still try to overcharge you a whole lot...though he may not overcharge you as much as the white tourist, or may be willing to bargain more with you.

How do ABCDs percieve India? Dont know, but I imagine its the same as when i go abroad and visit any indians there. At some level you connect, and at some level you want to connect but just cant. You're just from different worlds. These are generalizations, and im sure there are plenty of people who have no problem bonding or hating completely. 

These are just my thoughts and I'm sure I have missed some stuff and people are free to add or correct whatever i stated. I tried to answer thoughtfully, but its almost 3 in the morning here and I should really goto sleep.

""The founding fathers on religion:

""Every man ""ought to be protected in worshipping the Deity according to the dictates of his own conscience.""~ George Washington

""Question with boldness even the existence of a god..."" ~ Thomas Jefferson

""When a Religion is good, I conceive it will support itself; and when it does not support itself, and God does not take care to support it so that its Professors are obliged to call for help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one."" ~ Benjamin Franklin

""... Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all."" ~Thomas Paine

""What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error
all over the earth.""~Thomas Jefferson

""As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of government to protect all conscientious protesters thereof, and I know of no other business government has to do therewith."" ~Thomas Paine

""The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries.""~ James Madison

""and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience."" ~ Patrick Henry

""It may not be easy, in every possible case, to trace the line of separation between the rights of religion and the Civil authority with such distinctness as to avoid collisions and doubts on unessential points""
~James Madison

However, the death blow to this argument comes from the Treaty of Tripoli, authored by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, unanimously approved by the Senate:

Section 11 states: ""As the Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Musselmen; and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.""""",True,atheism,a7h13f,c14dlkw,1426551682,False,t3_e0u32,3,0,False,3,t3_e0u32,t1_c14dlkw,0,0,1288819735,Agnostic Atheist,t5_2qh2p,knight

Not quite.  I'm bringing this up having in mind that American law and jurisprudence don't really have any common ground with Sharia.  American law is based on alot of things, a good bit of it English common law and further back European law - basic principles of constitutionality.  You could even make the argument that some laws are based on moral precepts out of the Church, but even these have to ostensibly fit under the framework of whatever current constitution is in place.

If laws can be likened to evolution, American law is a direct ancestor of European law, or at least shares a recent common ancestor.  Sharia has no such similarity.  

To further force an awkward analogy, if American law is an angiosperm, European law is a gymnosperm.  Sharia is a fucking mollusk.  Total different branch!

&gt;Because it's unnecessarily complex for extremely limited gain.

The gain is much better results, and it's not complex at all. It's just a bit of math. I understand people ditching their friends for higher ELO players, but this is a *tournament*. If the ARAM tournament is supposed to be a more casual tournament, why aren't we having a 

&gt;Well let's see... I went to ""Purchase Riot Points"" in the client, and it says $5 will get you 650 RP. Yep.

If you purchase $50 of RP, you get 144 RP/$ as opposed to 130 RP/$ for the $5 purchase. Which one will it be? The prizes aren't all $5 worth of RP.

&gt;Best of 1 for most games. Finals will probably be best of 3.

Single Elimination? Double Elimination? Swiss and cut to top 8?

&gt;It wasn't originally in our plan, but Marcou suggested we do it. In fact, I've told you that before. If enough people are legitimately upset we can lower it to 5 dollars per admin, and make the 3rd place in the ARAM get 10 per person instead of 5. (leaves 5 dollars leftover total)

Thank you for editing your post; this is a legitimate concern and I'm trying to be civil about it. I know Marcou suggested it, and yes, I know TOs take a lot of time and effort and should be rewarded. But why take money out of the pot, especially money from a sponsor? It looks bad to the community and it looks even worse when you institute a one month limit for having a reddit account and then introducing your roommate to help organize the tournament...when his reddit account is incredibly new? I know there's lurkers in the reddit in-game chat who I've played with before that don't have a reddit account, and that doesn't help the legitimacy.

&gt;What policy is needed? Anything available on live is fair game.

Razer TT tournament; their policy was that Garen was banned because of balance reasons. There's nothing saying we can't do the same.

&gt;No, we will not reconsider. Also, EU tourneys need to be dealt with by the EU Riot employees. The point isn't for it to be as competitive, and just be more fun (that's why we're doing ARAM).

In that case, I'd like to see how you guys gauged interest in having an ARAM tournament instead of a different kind, like a TT tournament, etc. etc. If it's being decided by ""sheer luck,"" then why are we staking money on it? Can we have a poll or something of the kind to see if people really want an ARAM tournament? There's better ways to create a more casual, fun environment without it being a luck-fest.

,"First of all - we don't have world destroying weapons.  Civilization destroying, yes, world destroying, no (I mean, heck, there are fungi living **on** the Chernobyl reactor core using gamma radiation for energy).  And even if all of the weapons were fired, vast amounts of humanity would likely be largely unscathed - who would nuke Argentina?  Peru?  Indonesia?  Singapore?  Nigeria?  The DRC?  Somalia?  Enormous numbers of humans would certainly survive, if in a world where the political and economic structures have radically changed.  

But think for a minute - who would fire nuclear weapons and why?  Nuclear weapons are not controlled by ""the masses"".  Hell, they aren't even a particularly useful option, unless one plans on losing a war - modern nuclear weapons are a last resort, not first.  Might one nuclear weapon be used?  Yes, certainly possible - terrorism is an especially likely avenue.  Will all of them be used?  Most definitely not.  

Frankly, it's silly to believe that somehow the raving masses of religious people (which is an annoying phrase because religious belief is actually not a particularly useful identifier for other personality characteristics, regardless of what some on r/Atheism want to be true) will rise up and cause the beginning of the end times or some crap like that.  First, there aren't enough of them (end times crazies that is - which, also, is not the same as being religious).  Second, they don't have control over the power mechanisms to carry out such an action.  Speculation as to whether they will at some point have convinced a large enough portion of a nuclear armed democracy or taken control of a nuclear armed state to enable an Armageddon scenario is pointless.  I could just as easily speculate that humanity will become a vat grown, genetically perfect species that engages in copious amounts of consequence free sex and happens to trade with a group of tall, blue skinned aliens who look and act suspiciously like Amerindian groups prior to European colonization.

There is no more reason to believe that your scenario of death and destruction by religious crazies will come true any more than my awesome but slightly unoriginal fantasy world will occur (ignoring, of course, the scientific difficulties surrounding my little creation).  Remember that during the Cold War, there was never a point where the US was going to launch, and the few times the Soviets (the distinctly not religious side) were going to, particularly savvy and rational individuals at the point of control prevented such an occurrence.

,"I am born with the fall of communism there. Basically you have two types of people. Those that are very anti-communist, and those that are more like ""Yea, it sucked, but at least the government supplied us with a lot of things."" 

See the strengths of communism are very well recognized. Especially by the older population. But a lot of people also remember the lineups for bread, or the lineups for gas. Shit like that. So it is a lot of mixed feelings. Definitely not like the outmost ""righteous"" hate for communism that you see in the States. 

I mean the infrastructure in Bulgaria right now is pretty much what is left over from communist times. We have been trying to build a highway connecting the capital with the border to Turkey (one of the main routes for stuff from the middle east coming into Europe) for like 20 years now and it's only like a 350km stretch or something.

The fact is, (actually at the top of my head really), there are really virtually no large scale projects since the fall of communism in the country. From nuclear reactors, to dams, etc. Everything stays from communism and either people are trying to conjure up the money to maybe maintain it, or simply, I guess to try and improve on projects like that.

One example is we have a beautiful interesting sculpture in the center of the capital in front of our ""National Palace of Culture."" Amazing structure but for 20 years now they can't restore it. It's quite pathetic.

,"hmmm lets look at this in context. when did this kind of all over art begin? new york, post ww2. these original artists felt a need to express what they had seen and had been through, in such a way that figurative art simply couldn't do. this was a time where images of the war were seen by the public, thus painting a dying or mangled figure simply lacked the oomph. Adding to this, there was a new culture arriving in america. immigrants from europe brought their talents, and tried to acclimatise themselves to this new way of life. So, abstract expressionism involved; expressing, obviously, their emotion via abstract forms or colours, which, ironically, works on a much more primitive level than the high-art status it received. think about it, walk into a bedroom of one colour - how does that change your mood?
these artists had heavy questions on their mind as a result of their uprooting. theological and philosophical questions were addressed in these works, using a language that they created to try and express the rawness they were feeling. So that's where it began. it became big, and opened up a new realm of debate - much along the lines of your question above.

so... nower days people come along and do a quick whip and wipe of the paintbrush and try to achieve the same result, which unfortunately cannot be achieved, and here is where it generally looks quite average. Abstract art may look hasty and improvised, but actually it's just as considered as any Vermeer. instead of skin tone, its composition, layout and colour. symbols are still there, you just have to look for them. 

thus, the people who do these paintings which sit in cafes and mimick the barnett newmans of the 1950's arent actually addressing much. sure it's a good way to relax etc or decorate the lounge, but i guess its the same as a guy learning to play the guitar putting his 1st vid on youtube as opposed to a professional making an album. same tool, different intent.

that would be why so many of us support legislation and social change that redresses the past injustices visited on this land's previous inhabitants? Many of us have and continue to acknowledge that past treatment of Australian Aborigines was utterly wrong.

&gt;  so many immigration problems

you mean why don't we shoot them then they try to cross the border? Or that most of us find the treatment metered out to boat refuges harsh, in-humane and in breach of their basic human rights? And that taxes invested in re-settling, housing and educating migrants produces a positive financial and social return to the country. 

Then again, consider that the number of refuges who arrive by boat is miniscule - 90% of over-stayers arrive by plane, are mostly from developing/developed nations and choose to stay for economic reasons. The 'immigration problems' you read about in the media are largely a product of a media and politician-inspired manufactured conflict.

Also, how is the following statement getting up-voted?

&gt; The comic implies ""global elite bankers"" control everything. Frankly, no such group exists. Do corporations exist which have a lot of influence on government? Yes. But these are seperate corporations with separate interests, there is no one unified ""elite"" group.

Why restrict the use of the term ""group"" in this way?  There is something in the dictionary that says that ""group"" only applies to people that have formal ties to each other?  Aren't African-Americans or European-Americans, or Asian-Americans ""groups"", even though their members are all individuals with separate interests?

And the fact is there are numerous official organizations that represent the banks, through which the banks act in concert:

 * American Bankers Association
 * American Financial Services Association
 * Independent Community Bankers Association
 * US Chamber of Commerce
 * The Federal Reserve (large banks are members, bankers sit on the boards)
 * and more.

Nothing I am writing here is about ""conspiracy"", but is about the well-known coordinated actions that bankers take to further their interests.  They might have independent interests, but they definitely have significant common interests that are in opposition to the interests of ordinary people, and they work together through organizations such as the above to further those interests.

,"Zionism is a movement started by a number of European Jews in the 1890's who claimed Palestine as their homeland due to historical biblical ties. Out of a population of 1,000,000 people in Palestine in 1897 only 5% or 50,000 were Jewish.

Those few Jews in Palestine reacted negatively to Zionism. They neither saw the need for a Jewish state in Palestine, not did they want to exacerbate relations with the Palestinian Arabs. At this time in the Holy Land, religions lived together in relative harmony, a harmony only disrupted when the Zionists began to claim that Palestine was the rightful possession of the Jewish people to the exclusion of its Muslim and Christian inhabitants.

In 1914 the Zionists had 127,000 dues paying members world-wide and had been trying to push the Jewish people to Palestine since 1890

The didn't want to go, In world war 1 the Jews were told to go to Palestine and only 25,000 actually went.

In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany, and in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws made German Jews and later Austrian and Czech Jews stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many Nazi allies in Europe.

In 1935 as a result 60,000 Jews moved into Palestine. This was not enough as the Zionists wanted millions to move there, but of course just like WW1 no one wanted to leave the green pastures of Europe to go to the desert, a final solution was created, either go to Israel as the Zionists wanted or be persecuted and exterminated by the Nazis who were funded by the Zionists Rothschild's league of bankers.

The Jews had a choice, move to Israel or get persecuted

History as written always goes to the winner and the globalists back then and the MSM haven't actually told the truth about Hitler's roll in WW2 on behalf of the globalists.

We hear a lot about the Jewish holocaust but not much on the fact the Zionists funded and controlled/owned Hitler and his agenda.

http://www.savethemales.ca/hitler_was_a_godsend_for_israe.html

&gt; As soon as the Nazis assumed power in 1933, the Zionists gained a visibly protected political status. After the Reichstag fire, the Nazis crushed virtually all political opposition and closed 600 newspapers. But not the Zionists nor their newspaper which was hawked from every street corner, and saw its circulation multiply five times to 38,000. Zionism was ""the only separate political philosophy sanctioned by the Third Reich."" The Zionist uniform was the only non-Nazi uniform allowed in Germany. Same with their flag. Hebrew was mandated in Jewish schools. Still German Jews wanted to stay in Germany ""even as second class citizens, even reviled and persecuted."" But the Zionists scorned the German Jews saying they deserved to be persecuted for wanting to assimilate.

Then came the Zionist funded holocaust

There is the truth and the older generations can vouch for it in Germany, little bit different than what the main stream dissemination (media) will ever tell you, but none the less the truth

After WW2 the Nazis were moved to the united states under operation paper-clip and america became the new foreign military corporation for the Rothschild league of bankers and the Zionists new dog.

Secularism didn't arise because a few founders of the US constitution may have been Deists. It arose because [Christians have a history of killing each other over theological differences.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion)

Right now there's some pretty frightening rhetoric about secularism being in opposition to religious belief. Reinforcing this notion is only likely to make those people more afraid and more likely to listen to the Pat Robertson's of the world rather than the experts.

I know we like to get our hate on for religions out there and it can be pretty upsetting when the news media promotes crazy book burners and ignores moderate, peace loving believers like President Carter but really this is the law. Secularism lets everyone believe whatever crazy stuff they want to and at the same time it keeps them from passing laws that explicitly favor their religious beliefs.

Rather than making this into a case of secularism vs religion. I'd say that people should make an endeavour to point out how separation of church and state allows people to practice their religion free from government intervention. If the world is becoming less religious would they feel comfortable with an atheist or Mormon passing laws which prevent them from following their personal beliefs?

,"Yeah... don't do that. There is a line between aesthetics and emulation. But I do enjoy WWII period pieces in part for that reason. There's something that's just fascinating to me about World War II altogether. I've been that way since I was a kid and I first learned about it.

I can still remember reading, in, God it must have been sixth grade, about the Holocaust and the Nazis, and just sitting there, jaw dropping lower and lower. I couldn't wrap my head around it. My world view simply didn't allow for things like that to be possible. From that minute on, I read and watched everything I could about all of it. 

For some reason, the Islands campaign never captured me the way the European theater did. I really want to think that it's because the European front was stressed so much more in school, rather than me just being ethnocentric. As a kid, the Japanese were practically aliens to me. They might as well have come from Mars. And there was Pearl Harbor, which was like War of the Worlds in my mind. But I knew German people. I'm partly German. My great-grandfather emigrated from Germany (of course my grandfather fought for the US in WWII, but he said he was never quite sure what side his dad was on, and he died before he could find out).

Anyway, I watch movies like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, Inglorious Basterds (just naming new ones, but there are lots of great older ones too), and I'm just enthralled. These people lived through something incredible. It's not like war today, at least for the western world. I don't glorify it. It's not a fetishist kind of thing. It's horrible. I just marvel at their ability to get through it and for those who survived, to get on with their lives.

Not necessarily positively profiting, but, your system existing the way it does is a benefit ONLY compared to a situation in which you would change it.

To clarify, if you had legalized weed today as the status quo, I would be shocked and reject a prop that voted to criminalize it. I would not want to benefit off of that.

But, your system is fucked and the majority of you seem to love it. And you keeping it the same is just...a lot less mentally jarring.

Also, I have to reject your claim here: 

&gt;People lose their jobs or their freedom here because of this still, the product that you ship to us.

That's as weak reasoning as the idea of pot as a ""gateway drug"" (or any gateway theory really...) or the idea that alcohol makes people go to work drunk. People lose their freedom for a multitude of reasons, including personal responsibility, but it is far too simple to and easy to say the cause or reason is the product. Like you say, it's a system.


Now, heh, the lack of empathy. Fuck you guys. Honestly.

No, not you. Not your friends, none of that. But, holy shit were you guys campy on the militarization of drug task forces in the 80's, combined with the drafting of new laws and powers to district attorneys. Not to mention senate bills on the anti-drug bend and incentives for local law enforcement, all the way up to local politicians and district attorneys.


Yup, because of your wonderful concern over...what was it...your children's safety? Communities? Jesus or some other bullshit?


Either way, Reagan's reefermania was well supported. And wow, not only did it pervert your country, you felt the need to export that allllll over the world. Latin America, Canada, fuck...you guys still rule the UN council on drug-related bullshit (I forget the acronym sorry...).

So great, on a huge wave of naivite and failure to acknowledge reason you set a paradigm for the world. Heh, and I didn't even talk about the killing of cannabis culture in Asia post WW2.


Oh, and recently, in addition to COMPLETELY BLOCKING ANY AND ALL LEGALIZATION/DECRIMINALIZATION INITIATIVES IN CANADA, EVER, ESPECIALLY IN 2003, WITH **EXPLICIT** THREATS TO KILL CROSS-BOARDER TRADE, you FUCKS....ahem...

You decided to use your DEA offices in my country (why are your DEA offices in my sovereign country..?) to extradite a Canadian citizen, Marc Emery, on trumped up, bullshit charges, for things you Americans did (ordering seeds from a Canadian distributer? sounds like some shit for YOUR customs to deal with).

So, the point of that rant? much like the beginning: fuck you. the last thing you deserve is empathy after ruining shit for everyone else over the last century. 

Sorry? I mean I would have felt some joy, most definitely, if you Californians got prop 19 through. I'm no monster, I like personal freedoms and supported the proposition. I could give you an 8 page essay on why the proposition should exist and should have passed.

But, you get understanding. Not empathy. Lazy fucking young voters, misinformed, draconian right-wing idiots...apathy...a perverted system no one CARES enough to fix...STIGMA...that you still enshrine and allow...these are the reasons you lost prop 19 and until you address those...well fuck you guys.

Two final points:

Prop 19 could not have resonated across states. Your problem is at a Federal level and goes down (heh, one instance in which trickle-down theory actually applies..cough). That will always be the final problem. And we known Obama isn't stopping those DEA raids on medical facilities.

And secondly, you must understand....the underground market WILL NOT adapt. This is falsehood. Outright.

You know (I hope) how prohibitionist economics work. Without the inflation that illegality adds (it makes EVERY step of the process dangerous and costly, from growing, especially, to middle men, to street men) there is absolutely no profit incentive.

The variety of cannabis that could be marketed, grown and consumed (think about it: no more ""my guy got me lemon kush...I think...looks/smells/tastes like it...kinda"") would be astounding. With actual verification on strain types. Yes, you could use Amsterdam as a model, but this would be much, much bigger. Not just a tiny city in Europe, the rise of pot as a consumer good. Especially in huge metropolis'.

You would have large scale farms, and smaller scale boutique type cottage industry (think vegetables right now, organic vs. safeway).

But the black market does not integrate into this scenario. (this is good). 

You can look at previous alcohol prohibition...some barons lasted (Rothchild's in Canada I believe) ...but, and I can't cite this I admit, but I believe the general trend was the removal of ties to organized crime.

My reason for this belief is based on two facts: Jewish DNA clusters closest to Kurds and Armenians (both descended from the Hurrians). Likewise, something called the Tikunani prism was discovered. Its older than the Israelite nation or any conception of a ""Hebrew people"". The Hurrians were described as ""Habiru"" [the generic term from which Hebrew derives] and had names that were distinctly Hebraic. Once again, these Hurrians were from a time-period older than the Israelites. So, based on DNA, the Tikunani prism and a number of other circumstantial facts, I'd wager that they were NOT ""semites"" at all in origin, but Hurrian. Hurrians who (as we know from history) swept down into the Middle East and eventually adopted a Semitic language (just as Jews would later adopt Indo-European languages [like Ladino or Yiddish].) Their language has changed a dozen times within recorded history--from proto-Canaanite to Hebrew to Aramaic to the aforementioned Ladino to Yiddish. There's no reason to assume that Hebrew was their ""first language,"" or that adopting a ""Semitic tongue"" turned them into Semites. DNA places their origins in the Northern Middle East among the Armenians and Kurds, not in the South with Arabs. But no matter. . . .

,"BTW:  If you really like the biochemistry of food and evolution, gluten is an incredibly interesting protein.  Not only is it a relatively complex mix of peptides, but some of them can interact directly with the consumer's opioid receptors.

I've kind of mused that the most complicated plant proteins might act like a ""muscle"" for defense. One theory floating around is based on [molecular mimicry of rotavirus](http://www.celiac.com/articles/1057/1/Is-Celiac-Disease-Linked-to-Rotavirus-Protein-By-Roy-Jamron/Page1.html), an evolutionary deception designed to make the plant look like an infection instead of food.. and over 10,000 years we've been genetically selecting the ones that exhibit the strongest defenses.  

Well, some of us, because obviously my genetic ancestors weren't growing wheat.  On the other hand, I can drink a ridiculous amount of milk without even the slightest burp or discomfort.  Makes extra sense, because the coldest cow tribes of Europe were also some of the last to really grow gluten-containing grains, and the introduction of those foods around 1500 and later as staples coincided with a relative decline in [Ireland](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11482004) &amp; [Scotland](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/3/247.abstract).

,"&gt;Why is it absurd? What kind of problems do you think this could cause, can you name an example? Keep in mind that there is such a thing as trials in absentia.

Take the case of this bomb maker ( the Chicago bound bombs) in Yemen. Does it make sense for the US to ignore him, simply because he is a citizen? Does he get a free pass? That's insane. If you can, you take him out, most likely with a drone.

&gt;You've got to be joking. We've got to trust that a government which assassinates US citizens without trial is going to be ambivalent? One thing the founding fathers of this country didn't trust is the government, that's why the Constitution exists. Otherwise, we could just make it up as we go along..

So your premise is nothing should be secret, and the president should be powerless to pursue national defense without some appointed judge?
If that were how war and self defense was pursued we'd be worshipping Hirohito or Hitler.

&gt;They CLEARLY don't have the evidence necessary to say that it's a national security matter, otherwise they would have presented it to a judge instead of claiming state secrets.

Yes, Patton patiently waited to be sure a judge approved his campaign across Europe because American lives were a stake. What is clear is that a judge has no jurisdiction here.

&gt;Really, what's hyperbolic about it? Stalin killed ""enemies of the people"" without trials (sometimes there were also sham trials for extremely well known individuals). The US government is claiming it has the power to assassinate US citizens without trial. What's the difference? That not many people have been assassinated by the US but many were assassinated by Stalin? Stalin didn't start his assassinations in 1920 after the revolution. First he established a power base, then the assassinations started. You propose we continue giving the government more power and hope and pray they don't use it against us even though history has shown they always do and even in the US they do?

What is the difference between Stalin and Obama? Hmmm, let me think about that for a moment......

&gt;Suppose your relative has been targeted for death, say your son. You want to challenge this. You sue the government. The government says ""we don't need to present any evidence to anyone, if we want, we can assassinate your son, who is a US citizen, at and time and we will as soon as we find him"" - that's the situation that the parents of this guy are in. That seems ok to you?

If my son was in Yemen making airliner bombs?  Yes.

&gt;Tell me, if the US government can assassinate you without a trial, what good are your rights? What good is your right to free speech if the US government can say ""speak all you want but if we find you, you're dead?"" How about your other rights? Which of them stay intact?

First, anyone can assassinate me without a trial, including the local crack head. Second, you are begining to rave. Obama and even Bush were not on a rampage to eliminate political enemies. I suggest you read a little about Lenin and his rise and the politics of Russia and then study our form of democracy and compare the two. 

Then I suggest you calm down a bit.

Take a deep breath and look into the history of the OSS and CIA, and even the FBI. Yes, they have done some ugly things. Some of it very scary. There is nothing to guarantee we will not fall into some despotic form of government, except our national experiences and rhetoric. It is ultimately the people who choose the government they will live under or won't. Even Stalin's tough regime died with him. 

I have no problem with suing the state, Obama or whomever to put this through the courts. In my old age I don't think this will get anywhere or even believe that it should, but it is important to keep arguing about it. Vigilence is the most important part of democracy that doesn't appear in the Constitution.

,"Made this throwaway just so I could respond to you. 

Firstly, man that was a surprise! I always thought GrammarNazi was a busy Chennaiite sitting in a Barista in sweaty Chennai correcting Reddit's grammar! Now I know you are on this side of the pond.

You asked so many questions in your ""first"" question, I will try to answer them in bullets. Thats how I like things. Neatly organized with bullets.

1a) What do you think the NRI community's effect has been on Indian culture? 

- I had sisters, cousins, uncles, aunts etc who were spread around the world. Their influence on me (apart from the candy they brought) were the amazing stories of how clean roads were and how organized traffic was, and generally how accepting of diversity people were. Hearing these accounts and seeing the quality of their lives, my mind actually did broaden up much before I went outside (to the US - 4 years ago). They had certainly told me that life is not a bed of roses outside, decidedly harder than living at home. But working for it made it more enjoyable because of the perks they enjoyed (like not having to bribe the clerk to get what we owe). In short, I think the cultural effect of knowing an NRI in your friend/family circle is that it opens your area to swathes of land outside of what you routinely see. Like arm chair tourism.

1b) Has India become more liberal because of NRI influnce? How so?

- Just over the last two decades, Western programming on TV itself has led to liberalization of the youth. Just think about it - simple ""high fives"", baggy jeans, backwards worn caps, saying ""kewl"" or ""like"", hanging out at cafes, pubs, and lounges are even the simplest things that have rubbed off on the Indian youth. None of these needed NRIs. Maybe the visualization of NRI's in the movies you named did help a bit. The greatest liberal move I could see was the rush towards buying conveniences to make their lives better - washing machines, fridges, and microwaves. Once an NRI returns home and finds one of the above devices missing, they usually go out and buy the best one availale.

1c) Has India become more open? less corrupt? How so?

I am not sure why NRI's would affect corruption/open ness? This much I can say that if you look and talk like an NRI while in India, you can rest assured you will get prices quotes in dollars! 

1d)Is there a significant movement by anyone, governmental or nongovernmental, in keeping Indian talent in India? What are we doing about that?

- I had no intentions to leave the country, till I realized that I wanted to specialize in a field, thus needed grad schooling. Was quite upset to see not a single decent university who specialized in it. Had to leave the country because of top notch univs elsewhere. However if you are talking about business etc, students seem to have really good places to covet (ISB, IIM's etc),  same for medicine (AIIMS, CMC Vellore). Not heard of a specific program to help retain people in India. Just heard rhetoric about all the 'brain drain', nothing concrete.

2) If there are any people who can shed light on the perspective of these fellow Indians who have this tenuous connection to India, can you please explain how you view India? Why you view it that way?

- Many of my father's colleagues moved to the USA just like your parents did. My parents had offers too, but stayed so that we could get Indian values and more importantly the company of our grand parents. Now when I look back, I tell my parents every chance I get, that was such a mature and amazing decision, I really thank them for giving me my upbringing and presence of grand parents.

That said, most Indian-Americans (I refuse to use the ABCD term), grow up with their first gen immigrant parents, and occasionally get to bond with their grand parents and uncles. Even this becomes a formality or a forced ritual. The biggest reason for this is the communication barriers. The child doesn't understand the hard accents and the relatives dont get what the child wants to say. Its just that we are used to talking to kids in a certain way in India (not expecting them to give smart/mature answers, and not tolerating indifference/apathy). But smart/mature/indifferent/apathy are typical attitudes you can see from an average Indian-american kid. It's just normal to be like that, but not seen as 'normal' by the Indian relatives. This alone in my view creates an abhorrence towards connecting with India. The rest of the dirt, smell, the cowdung burning, mosquitoes etc are the final straws. Now coming back to my own experiences with my father's colleagues kids when I was in India, I thought these kids were the coolest, because they knew how to play poker and go bowling, and I had only read about all these things in Archie comics. I totally ""got"" them. So they too never felt alien with me. We guys still keep in touch.

Again, depending on the country they go to, some people I know had a very difficult time growing up (being attacked by rowdy boys in Europe etc), and others have a great time competing in science bowls and other creative projects that I could not even dream of doing when I great up in India.

Lastly I think the Indians coming out of India now are generally of lower calibre than say what you saw in the early 80's or 90s. My justification for this is that today with the Internet it is easier for people to find jobs / school admits and move more easily than before. Although I myself came in this generation, I see myself as having paid my dues in striving to get the best grades, and applying for the best universities, and always sticking to the high road. Sadly the same cannot be said about many other NRIs I see on a regular basis. Some come through ""consultancies"" who get them visas even without having a job ready in the USA. Many of these NRI's routinely fabricate certificates and work experiences using established methods. The reason they go to such lengths is because becoming an NRI pushes their 'market value' in society. Better offers of marriage! A certain US consulate in India even published a warning on their website saying that they are receiving high cases of fraud. Where am I going with all this? I myself feel so repulsed to talk to these mediocre Indians who come here through unfair means. I cannot imagine what Indian-Americans would want to do with them at all.

,"&gt;&gt; most Americans maintain a power relationship with their kid
&gt; Is it different in other countries / cultures? How so?

I wish I knew the answer, but this topic is on the back burner for me, while I research other topics.  My guess is that western cultures all use power relationships, but to different degrees.  Perhaps European cultures are more prone to treat their children as team players and partners, rather than adversaries.  If I can find some place that predominantly avoids power relationships, I'll try moving there.  Ironically, America seems quite fertile for moving towards team work and leadership in the work place, as this helps employees flourish, and thus improves the business case.  You can see this in startups (probably a startup in any part of the world), and then places that, for example, use open-book management (there is a book of that name by John Case).  In contrast, in Germany, I got a strong sense of an institutional division between management and labor, in the society, which creates harmful relationships at work.

I'm happy to hear about your purchase of Summerhill.  That book is like the missing manual for one's self --- it breaks psychology down to the basics, and helped me understand that discipline for the first time.  It focuses on the positive side of psychology (and I've been trying to corroborate it with modern scholarly work, e.g.: ""What Good Are Positive Emotions?"" by B. L. Fredrickson), which seems to be much much simpler than the negative side and all the neuroses that come from negative input.",True,IAmA,redcircle,c14emq6,1426552163,False,t3_e0rzq,5,0,False,5,t1_c14e5ob,t1_c14emq6,0,0,1288836236,,t5_2qzb6,
,"I was in a miserable two year relationship with an emotionally and physically abusive psychopath. It was so bad that I was suicidal for several months because I was convinced I'd never be able to have a healthy relationship with anyone after him, so I might as well stay with him until he ultimately murders me (it felt somewhat inevitable). The last straw came when he admitted he had been seeing another girl. I told him he had to get out of my apartment and that we were through. He was on the lease, and said that I couldn't make him leave, it would be considered an illegal eviction, etc. etc. My landlord sided with him. 

He spent six weeks coming home to my apartment telling me how his girlfriend was better than me in every possible way, that he had been cheating on me during our whole relationship, etc. etc. Finally, one night he flipped out on me and kept me awake all night telling me he was going to kill my dog, destroy everything I cared about, torture me, harass my friends and family, etc. etc. I tried to leave the apartment but he physically prevented me from doing so. 

I took the journal I had been keeping during our whole relationship cataloging his physical abuse and threats to the cops and got a restraining order. The Sheriff's Department evicted him from my apartment. Even though the order of protection was only temporary, it got him out of my house and, eventually, out of my life. 

On the 1 year anniversary of dumping him, I was in Europe on a two week vacation with my best friend, having the best summer of my entire life, living in a much nicer apartment, and dating a guy who treats me better than anyone ever has before. 

He's currently working a minimum wage third shift security job and failing out of community college. The girl he started dating before we broke up dumped him about two months later because he refused to take his meds and she didn't want to deal with dating a ""psychopath"".

,"I don't think people should be confronted at all. I've been watching a lot of BBC TV recently and I love watching well reasoned-through programming. The science and history programs are fantastic.

Canada has very even tempered press which is heavily regulated by laws which require truthfulness and such things. One finds that issues are discussed within simple frames of reference that everybody can agree on. I think it makes for a better society.

,"German Gay Marriage: YES (minus tax credits)

Germany on Drugs: NO

&gt;Germany alone practices a dual system of harsh repression and an ""accepting"" drug policy. The repression includes determinant sentences, prison detention, even including the cannabis consumer. Probation and parole are only given under the condition of a ""voluntary consent"" to undergo a long term treatment program in specialised drug free programs. That means at least 9 months of confinement in remotely located, closed institutions. In fact this represents a system of forced therapy.  [link](http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/boll1.html)

German Taxes [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Germany)

The rate of value-added tax rate generally in force in Germany is 19%
Marginal Tax rate of 14-24% and upwards of 45% for the very richest. 

So Germany isn't any more free in regards to taxation than the United States. But they do allow gay marriage yet have fairly strict drug laws.

Is Germany more free  than the United States? Fuck no. Unless of course you are gay, but even then you have to provide all sorts of information and pay all sorts of fees and regulations. 

Germany is in no way more free than the United States. I can continue researching and find even more examples if you like. 

As for Sweden, their taxes are incredibly high. 

And lets look at drugs.. [link](http://www.cannabislegal.de/international/se-yates.htm)

&gt;The anti drug laws have got progressively more severe over the years and are now the hardest in Europe. Police give drug violations top priority and Sweden **is the only country in the European Union that has criminalized drug use as well as possession.** Passing a joint counts as trafficking and carries a mandatory prison sentence and drug violations are regularly given harsher sentences than other crimes, including crimes of violence.  

Gay Marriage: YES

Noticing a trend so far? Both Germany and Sweden have tough drug laws and high taxes but they allow for gay marriage. 

Iceland.. well there is one country I can agree with but they also have quite a few economic problems thanks to the massive debt they accumulated. They once believed in smaller government and lower taxes but not so much today. 

And South Korea.. [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_South_Korea)

&gt;Same-sex marriage is not legally-recognized in South Korea. Homosexuality is strongly criticized in mainstream Korean society, and many Koreans consider homosexuality to be a Western phenomenon.

South Korea also has VERY strict drug laws. 

Not to burst your bubble or anything, but the examples you provided are not any more free than people living in the United States. 

You can argue that in certain areas there are fewer restrictions. Gay marriage and drug laws seem to be two areas where many countries in Europe provide more freedom. But not that much. 

The one freedom that the United States once had above all other countries was economic freedom. And that freedom has been fading steadily since the 1970's.

I was going to leave a sarcastic comment about OP being a dumbass but it occurred to me that as a young person he may not have thought this brilliant plan all the way through and it might be good for his general education to actually see some of the world.

The unpleasant aspects of human nature are hardly confined to the US. Xenophobia, racism and religious oppression are just as present in Europe, Africa and Asia (far more so in many cases). Problems with the media? Sit down and actually read through some other countries newspapers or watch their news shows (in the original language of course). You might find that FOX, MSNBC, etc. are not as outrageous as you thought they were.

Lets not forget the practical aspects of living as an expat either. It seems obvious, but most of the world does not speak English. Whatever language you may have picked up in high school or college might be a start but it really will not be enough to get you through all the things you have to deal with as part of day to day life outside the English speaking world (renting a place, dealing with neighbors, dealing with the government (visa applications, taxes, work permits, etc.)). Also if your language skills are not near native level, getting a job can be problematic. As far as employment goes, most of the world still is not doing so great economically and what job openings there are will go to locals first. Remember also that most places do require you to have a job before granting any type of long term stay visa.

Also since dual citizenship is not an option in many cases you will have no voting rights in your new home. Some people do try and give up their US citizenship to get another one but its not as easy as just returning a pair of shoes you dont like. Also for all its faults the US system is actually far more representational of voters than many other systems. Japan where I live is a good example: rural votes are weighted more than urban votes. Its an elaborate version of gerrymandering which is locked in at the national level so redistricting becomes impossible.

,"Yes, sure its not as ""extreme"" as it was under nazi rule, but you have to take a few things into account here. Firstly you have to understand that what the germans did wasn't just to the jews, there were many people affected by nazi rule, like the soviets, hadicaps, the french (but not to a great degree), so you can't just ignore those people and say it was only the jews who were affected. Secondly you have to consider that what occurred the European jews lasted for about 6-10 years, where as conditions in Palestine have been on going for about 38-40 years, and perhaps more if you take into account British Mandate rule. Thirdly the holocaust has been show and studied over and over again, and we've all seen movies about it and read about it and so on, but where as in Palestine a large portion of you see or what you read is what the media provides to you (however I will not deny that there are some books very good books available, but they don't tend to be in as great circulation as books on the holocaust etc.). If you want a little better perspective go read Al- Jazeera news, there is little that gets filtered through there, and it is a reputable source I'm sure we can all agree. But now if you really want to see what's going on, go to Gaza, visit the homes the families and the hospitals and see whats its like for the people there. Try going through check point after check point, even as a journalist, waiting hours in line and being harassed by the soliders just to try and get to your job.  Go see what its like for the kids, for the elderly and for everyone. Sure people aren't being thrown into ovens, but that doesn't mean it cant be compared.

,"Well to be perfectly fair, I left right before grade 7 - the grade where you would get all your modern history teachings. By the end of grade 6 you just cover until the second world war (this was ~8-9 years mind you).

However I have read the textbooks about them. And this might sound really silly, but there really is no bias that I could see in those teachings. It straight out laid facts - how it was. There are no misconceptions or anything of the sort. It's just who is in power, what happened, what did they do. I mean our communist regime wasn't as oppressive as some other countries from the ""Eastern Block."" I mean we were our own country and not part of the USSR. But most of the trade occurred with USSR and we had a lot of support from them, as well a lot of the infrastructure again as I said, is here because of communism. I mean - the country hasn't done much by itself since the fall of communism... I mean there was a crisis in like the mid nineties but that's about it.

But again, the books are very fact oriented. The only bias I could say is that we are taught to love Bulgaria, and we are extremely patriotic. People from Bulgaria who are not patriotic nowadays are, in my opinion, a bit extreme. I am not talking about the people who want change and are really unhappy with the way the country is ran (I am one of them), but there are a lot of people who are really hateful towards the country as a whole. Maybe it is because I left, but I will never assimilate to the extent I was there. For me home, will always be Bulgaria even if I never have anything there. It's weird.

And your PS, you can't research this. No matter how many hours I spend explaining to someone what it's like back there, you just won't understand Eastern Europe until you go there. And live there.

People still lineup to pay their bills, people are still afraid of using credit cards (because of hackers). The stability of life you get in countries like Canada (I am here), you won't have there. People can be either really lovely and generous, or really aggressive and hateful. I would never move back to live there, but god if I had the money I would be going back all the time...

,"I go to Drexel University in Philadelphia and major in Music Industry. I'm only a Freshman, but it's been pretty awesome so far. You can concentrate in tech or business, so if you want to be on the creative side you can do technology and do production, engineering, and scoring for picture. If you want to do the management side you do business. You don't declare until after sophmore year, so you learn a lot about both aspects. All the professors are from the industry so there's a lot of valuable advice coming from experience and you get connections. Plus they've all been great teachers so far. For example one of my teachers founded/owns Jade Tree Records which is a hugely influential indie/punk label. My Computer and Digital Applications teacher is in a techno band called Plastic Operator that is relatively successful (mostly in Europe). The A&amp;R teacher signed John Legend etc.

There's a lot of awesome extracurricular stuff to do too, both with the school and outside it. Our radio station was just named best college station of the year by CMJ and it's entirely student run. I'm currently working on become a DJ and also a production person for when we have live bands come in. I already got to help engineer for one of my favorite bands when they came in. In Philadelphia itself there's a great music scene, especially if you're into punk/indie music. I know a couple guys that are in the program/just graduated that run and book shows at a really great all ages space. The main thing the school advertises is the co-op program which is basically a mandatory internship. You can do anything related to your major, so you can work for a label, be an assistant in a studio, do live sound, book shows, whatever. The school tries to make sure you're not just getting coffee either. It helps you make connections and get your foot in the door which is super important for the industry where you're degree isn't going to really matter so much as what you can show you can do.

If you play there's a ton of opportunities to play too. Almost everyone I know is in a band or working on getting one together. You take a lot of music courses too. You're required to take at least guitar or piano I, and a few semesters of theory. Songwriting, ear training, and composition are also some required classes, especially for the tech track. A couple recent bands that have come out of the program include Algernon Cadwallader, the Wonder Years, and Chiddy Bang. If you want to make it as a musician, knowing how to negotiate contracts and record is going to be really important, and the connections you make won't hurt either.

This really comes off as an advertisement for my school, but I was in the same boat as you in high school (I'm assuming you're in high school) and am just really excited about this place. Tuition is expensive, but they give out a lot of aid and scholarships so its not a massive barrier. 

Edit: So I did a little internet stalking and found out from your band's myspace that you're from the west coast. If you're looking a little closer to home, I have a friend that goes to Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. He does a similar thing as me and seems pretty happy with it.

EDIT:  Jesus, people, what's with the haterade?  I said we're decent enough, not that we're angels from up on high.  Chill out.  Fuck.

EDIT #2:  Seems my little throwaway comment has struck a nerve.  I'm an American, and FWIW I'm a very left-leaning liberal type.  I'm against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, I absolutely detested Dubya and his administration, can't stand virtually every Republican, and feel the Democrats are mostly sellout centrists, when they're not being DINOs.  Dennis Kuchinich is the only true liberal in American politics.

The Tea Party is a symptom of the death throes of the white middle class male's privileged life.  It is greed and racism and fear embodied, with bits of truth veined throughout.  It is a fad and won't last much longer. 

I think that Scandinavian countries--Sweden, The Netherlands--have the optimum societal model.  High taxes, yet very high standards of living for everyone.  My dream would be that America reaches that state of wealth. 

Another thing is I'm an expat living overseas, and I have been for almost a decade.  I've traveled--and lived--in other countries extensively.  I know how other people live, at least how some people live differently from Americans.

I get how people hate America.  I get why people hate America.  I'm one of those people, sometimes.  But it's annoying in the fucking extreme when I am judged solely on the fact that I'm from America.  This comes almost exclusively from European/Commonwealth countries, namely from Aussies and Brits.  

I get it.  America has a lot to answer for.  To me, as well.  But she's also a very big, very wide, very easy target (as is evidenced by this thread).  It's easy to take potshots at America.  But I stand by my statement that the *people* in America, however stupid and moronic they can be in picking political leaders, are not inherently bad people.  Americans take a lot but they also give a lot, too.  

I think patriotism is the last bastion of idiots, but just because America's wrong doesn't mean any potshot you take at her is *right*.  So in that sense I get pretty defensive.  

Once I had a discussion with a German man while visiting Germany, and he asked about my vacation time.  ""I have two weeks a year,"" I said.  ""But surely you get more?  Americans don't work so much.  They are lazy because the education system is terrible, and then they don't work but about 25 hours a week."" (I'm paraphrasing).  Yes, he really believed that.  This from a guy who gets at least a *month* of vacation time mandated by the German government, whereas Americans get a big fat 0 vacation days mandated by the American government.  BUT, he was sort of right about the bad education system, but that seemed almost a lucky guess.  

In living in other countries and talking with other people I have had this kind of discussion A LOT.  Just because you take a lazy swing at the big, slow, dumb giant doesn't mean you're *right*.  I've heard so many wrong-headed arguments about the U.S., and the frustrating thing is that when I try to debate or argue against these wrong-headed ideas and opinions, I'm construed as some redneck, red-state rightwinger patriot type, which couldn't be further from the truth.

,"Many ""conservatives"" are actually classical liberals.

**We oppose:**
-Inescapable government that stretches coast to coast.  States exist so you can vote with your feet.  States exist to allow communities to experiment with social issues.  Both cultural statists and economic statists are gradually concentrating more power in our national legislature because they fear each other.

-socialism.  Socialism represents one possible outcome of unlimited democracy.  Unlimited democracy has been repudiated in our oldest political documents for precisely the same reasons it has been scorned over and over by one community after another.  It's just too much power to give to any majority.

-government that doesn't trust people.  Governments that try to offer too much run into the problem of people who game the system, and then it institutionalizes paranoia against the very population it serves.

-making the indolent comfortable.  It is one thing to empathize with people, but they need tough love and real friendship to realize that their community *does* need something from them.  Generating a social surplus involve both hard work *and* paying attention to what other people actually need.  This is also why conservatives don't give a damn about public sector employees or clockpunchers.

-substitutes for charity.  An absence of charitas is detrimental to any community.  We all come into the world completely helpless, and many of us will leave that way.  Turning charity into entitlements alienates people from community.  Most of us stand in the same grocery lines as you, and seeing people purchase candy and non-essentials with dole money is irksome when you realize that you spent the first two or three hours of every single day slaving away for the taxman.  Alienation produces balkanized ghettos where the main culture is rejecting the exterior ethnically plural society (called by ""intellectuals"" as evil white european oppressor culture) and where participation in the informal economy is an accepted form of survival by subversion.

**We try to protect:**
-entrepreneurs.  These people are game changers.  More and more they bring about things that completely change the nature of the debate.  Their job is hard, the failure rate is high and they choose it willingly.  Even the ones that don't reinvent the wheel provide stability for parts of their communities.  The vast majority are affable and highly trustable, and tend to genuinely care about doing the right thing when they understand why and how to do it.  In lifeboat ethics, these are the people you are tempted to move ahead in the queue, although it's probable that they will just build their own damn lifeboat anyway.

-liberty.  Our ancestors crossed the globe for it when that was something quite difficult to do.  Their successors fought and often died not merely to give it to us, but to allow us the opportunity to take on the duty of doing the same.  We come from all over the world, and the world is still a miserable, violent place wherever it is absent.  As far as we are concerned, it didn't exist in the world before the seventeenth century.  If you had freedom before then, it was because you and yours successfully took it away from everyone that disagreed with you on what was just, looked different, or merely happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Warlords are big on unlimited democracy so long as they can cull those who want the wrong thing.  Most of the world still embraces this goal of homonoia as a guiding principle.  Unfortunately, we do need a military at least as large and readily equipped to handle ALL of the bristling firepower that is commanded by this violent worldview.  Those of us throughout the liberal democracies of the world are lucky that we do for the time being.


As for gay marriage and abortion.. the government shouldn't be in the business of marriage licenses anyway, and individuals and families should be entrusted with the task of making difficult decisions which they alone will have to live with, and their privacy is currently protected, as it should be.

Where healthcare is concerned, we already have the most open system in the world.  It doesn't exclude anyone on the basis of whether or not they are governmentally connected, whether they are a preferred demographic, on the basis of age, or pre-existing health.  All you have to have is money even though that is not a preliminary requirement, and any sub-genius person can make money if they are willing to think about it.  Although easily abused, we give our money to people we trust.  Those who are trusted a lot, whether for good or ill, tend to get a lot of money.  The vast majority of the time, this works out.  In fact, it appears to work better than anything else tried.  Somehow, the radical move of simply trusting other people has put us at the forefront of the world's economic engines.  Being responsible with money doesn't simply mean being a scrivener, but using it as a tool to help yourself and a community you care about.

As to whether or not our ideas will be dead eventually.. well, in the end we are all dead anyway.  The definition of conservatism changes with time and pretty rapidly at that.  We are always opposed to many ideas not because we don't agree that there are real problems in society, but because the cure seems worse than the symptom, or because the power sought to implement that cure implies harm to the liberty of our neighbors.",True,IAmA,lowrads,c14fd25,1426552503,False,t3_e08b4,0,0,True,0,t1_c1494ql,t1_c14fd25,0,0,1288849906,,t5_2qzb6,

Well, I shall have to start getting some Drupal experience then, for sure. I was kind of hoping that some iOS experience would be useful, but who knows how valuable it will be in a years time. I take you work in this area then? Maybe we should keep in touch :P. A few questions though, if that's cool... how much experience did you have before looking for work in TromsÃ¸? did you find it easy to get a job? Did that job sponsor you (assuming you're from outside the EU) in getting a residence permit so that you could stay? Did they help with anything else (i.e. finding an apartment, transportation etc)? 

Great to hear about those clubs, that sounds like exactly what I'm looking for, and what I hoped existed.

I think a break every now and then would be a great thing as well. Earlier, I was a little bit apprehensive about living so far away from the west coast (Sogn og Fjordane &amp; MÃ¸re og Romsdal), but I think Troms has just as much beauty in its own right and just as many places to explore, and when I want to take a break, I can always head down south. Not to mention Sarek or Finland...

I wasn't there for long, I visited on the 29-30th of September last year. It was snowing ontop of FlÃ¸ya, and I couldn't believe my luck, as we had absolutely no expectation of snow (to an Australian, frozen flakes of rain falling out of the sky and collecting on the ground is pretty damn mindblowing!). It was raining in the night, and no northern lights (I hear you didn't get any in the entire season this year :O), but still beautiful. We walked over TromsÃ¸bruen in the dark of night and rain, and that's about when I decided. 

I'm a little bit strange to most people, I appreciate night as much as day, rain as much as sunshine, and cold more than hot. Those are great attributes for living in Norway, not so much Australia...

Thanks for the reply, I almost can't my luck finding someone in such a similar position.

,"I think Osama Bin Laden is not a major character in anything at all. He's just a convenient source of fear in American media (also in Europe, but I think at this point Americans are MUCH more gullible when it comes to what the government says). 

I think the important thing with conspiracy theories is to get the right kind of perspective. Take the global economic system in place right now. You could say it's a great way for us here in the west to get all kinds of new things and goods and services and entertainment, etc... Or you could say that we are made to buy all this crap we don't need at the expense of blood and tears elsewhere. And that furthermore all that crap is making us dumber, not vice versa. 

You could say that it's great that there are many news sources where we can get a balanced view of all things... or you could take a peek at alternative media and realize that there are innumerable things going on in the world that the average westerner is never told about.

You could say that banks are good because they let people and countries borrow money which can be used to bolster growth. Or you could follow where the interest goes and then find it strange that wages and tax dollars are both being efficiently channelled into private hands. 

The bottom line is that ""conspiracy theory"" has been made into a fringe concept, and admitting to believe some of them will quickly label you a marginal weirdo in most contexts. But we have to remember that a good part of the real underlying implications of ""conspiracy theories"" are really just facts of life that are present in the collective consciousness.

,"Ok, here we go!

1. Physical Attractiveness I'd rate about an average of 8. I found the women there to be extremely attractive. Psychological: This one is hard. The girl I dated came from a very proper wealthy family so she was very polite but she could be very snobby and prudish. This one is hard but I would give her a 9 for being proper but like a 6 for being fun. As for obesity, I saw very few overweight people. Everyone was in pretty good shape I thought.

2. Definitely. Israelis are incredibly friendly and approachable. Especially the women. However, being from North America I think makes you much more interesting to them right off the bat.

3. Yes and no. There were definitely Arabs women at clubs that I was at. But there are also Arab bars as well. It's much like it is back home with other cultures.

4. Maybe Hebron. It's safer than it was but I certainly wouldn't want to live there. Jews basically live on one side and the Arabs live on the other side. It's also heavily occupied with Israeli troops.

5. I was supposed to live on a Kibbutz for 2 weeks but I met that girl so she let me stay at her house and I was very happy to accept. However, I did stay at the Kibbutz for 3 days. It wasn't really my scene because I wanted to be in Tel Aviv. However, what I found most interesting is that Kibbutz aren't like they used to be. Back in the day, everything was shared and it was basically a commune with communistic values. However, it's switched to more like a small village or community. It's the same old story. The people who were doing all the work got pissed at the people who weren't doing any work and it slowly moved to a more capitalistic structure. Before this, everyone used to completely live and do all their work in the Kibbutz. Now, people work off of the Kibbutz and no wealth is shared.

6. Yes and it was beautiful!

7. Good question. All drugs are very frowned upon by the authorities in Israel. From what I gathered, it's the same punishment if you are busted with weed as it is if you are busted with coke. However, people do smoke it, it's just very, very hush hush. I believe that hashish is also illegal. As for quality, I don't smoke because it drives me nuts to do so. I didn't try any.

8. Hebrew is apparently one of the hardest languages to learn. So I guess it's probably quite a hurdle. I have a very small understanding of the language though.

9. I am actually from Canada but regardless, I can't say I really saw a lot of black people while I was there. It's more Arabs and Jews. For the most part there weren't really any rundown areas anywhere that I saw in Israel. Interestingly enough, the segregation and prejudice was more within the Jewish Culture. There is a subgroup of Jews that go by the term Alz for the guys and Frehha for the girls. Basically these people are what we would call Chochy. They have their own groups, cars, bars, and social standards. Typically they don't get along with the other people that I was hanging out with. I am sure there are more subgroups but that was the most prevalent.

10. This is a distinct possibility but it would also be possible for Europe as well. That said, I don't really know. I could see it though.

,"&gt; My Response: Who is going to buy the products produced at those factories? For every shoe factory created in a foreign country, 50 shoe stores must be created in the U.S. to sell those goods (Thus creating jobs).

So your solution is to create what, maybe 100,000 low-wage, no-benefits jobs that does nothing more than encourage dumb consumerism?

If we're lucky?

I'm hardly a leftist here, nor am I very supportive of tax increases (for anyone), but this is just stupid. And I haven't even really delved that deeply.

First, we have to assume that there aren't already enough shoe stores that exist that can absorb all of that retail capacity without actually hiring. I'd be shocked if that were the case. So instead of creating jobs, you're just over-working the guy that gets paid minimum wage at Shoe Carnival.

What we're really looking at is that you want to cut taxes, and you're stretching to come up with after-the-fact rationalizations for doing so.

Second, if Shoe Carnivale does decide (against good sense) to hire 400 people across the nation, their wages won't be nearly enough to account for all the extra shoes you think will be sold. So, within 6-36 months, they'll all be shitcanned, and people who hold their stock will eat that mismanaged budget.

Third, if somehow this fits the old Ford saw ""pay them enough to buy the product"", how does this cascade back into more jobs? Ford had to buy steel from other companies, rubber/tires. People were put to work building roads to drive the damned things on. It's a dead end. Do you foresee some upswing in jogging coach jobs that isn't apparent to the rest of us?

Fourth, you're effectively training an entire generation at that point to be shitty little retail employees. Not that entrepreneurmanship has ever been encouraged, but you're hammering another nail in the coffin every year that goes past without a real and substantial economic recovery.

Fifth, you assume that a foreign shoe factory will even sell to the US. There's a lucrative Chinese market waiting to be born. There's all of Europe. Japan. Australia.

Sixth, don't go trying to sidestep your horrid abuse of logic by picking some other half-assed industry. This holds true for every consumer product, and your scenario falls flat for machine tools or any sort of heavy equipment.

Finally, you're ignoring the fact that we can't be a nation that makes nothing but buys everything that everyone else makes. Even if we score a few jobs selling the things in some sales lobby, that's not enough for the massive quantity of dollars that are flowing out of the country. By allowing that tax cut to happen, you're helping these failfucks sell us all downriver.

If we fail to be a nation that makes things, real actual tangible things... we're fucked. My children and grandchildren have to live with the consequences of that, even if yours will be able to attend the finest parties in Europe with the money your family managed to squirrel away while fucking us over.

You should be ashamed of yourself.

,"**THIS IS PART 2 (PART 1 HAS ITS OWN STARTING THREAD)**

Non-praxeological schools of thought mistakenly
believe that relationships between certain events
are well-established empirical laws when they are
really necessary and logical praxeological ones. And they
thereby behave as if the statement ""a ball cannot be red and
non-red aUÂ· over at the same time"" requires testing in
Europe, America, Africa, Asia and Australia (of course
requiring a lot of funds in order to pay for such daring
nonsensical research). Moreover, the non-praxeologists also
believe that relationships between certain events are well-established
empirical laws (with predictive implications)
when a priori reasoning can show them to be no more
than information regarding contingent historical connections
between events, which does not provide us with any
knowledge whatsoever regarding the future course of
events.

This illustrates another fundamental confusion nonAustrian
schools have: a confusion over the categorical
difference between theory and history and the implication
that this difference has for the problem of social and economic
forecasting.

I must again begin with a description ofempiricism, the
philosophy which thinks of economics and the social sciences
in general as following the same logic of research as
that, for instance, of physics. I will explain why. According
to empiricism-today's most widely held view of economics-
there is no categorical difference between theoretical
and historical research. And I will explain what this implies
for the idea ofsocial forecasting. The very different Austrian
view will then be developed out of a critique and refutation
of the empiricist position.

Empiricism is characterized by the fact that it accepts
two intimately related basic propositions. The first and
most central one is: Knowledge regarding reality which is called
empirical knowledge, must be verifiable or at least falsifiable by
observational experience. Observational experience can only
lead to contingent knowledge (as opposed to necessary
knowledge), because it is always of such a kind that, in
principle, it could have been different than it actually was. This
means that no one can know in advance of experience-that is before actually having had some particular observational experience-if the consequence of some real event will be
one way or another. If, on the other hand, knowledge is not
verifiable or falsifiable by observational experience, then it
is not knOWledge about anything real. It is simply knowledge
about words, about the use of terms, about signs and
transformational rules for signs. That is to say; it is analytical
knowledge, but not empirical knowledge. And it is highly
doubtful, according to this view, that analytical knowledge
should be regarded as knowledge at all.

Any playable lute is going not going to be cheap. Having said that, a modest investment in a student-lute will be worth it for the hours of enjoyment and the re-sell value once you upgrade. The only mass-produced ones are made by the so-called ""Early Music Shop"" and are to be avoided like the plague as they are horrendously bad quality and almost completely unplayable and un-tuneable. 
The most affordable lutes are made by James Marriage of the UK:
http://www.jminstruments.com/ for about Â£800, they are very nice (I've played 2 before) and he is seriously undercutting the market at the moment. 
Anything with any serious carving, decoration or 8+ ribs will cost about Â£3000, but a JM starter lute will give you a nice start. 

&gt;Also, is there anything in particular I should know before I invest myself? How difficult is the learning curve (I don't play any instruments really, so I'm a complete novice).

* **What country are you in?** The UK and USA both have fantastic lute societies that are more than kitted out for beginners. You can turn up to their playing days to plink around on other people's lutes, hire lutes at a very low cost from them etc. There are others for most european countries and even one for Japan. 

* **The recommended starter lute** is the 8-Course (courses are pairs of strings) renaissance lute. This will play anything from the 17th century or before (Dowland, Cutting, Attaignant, Gaultier etc). To go later, to 18th century Bach, Weiss, Kapsberger etc you will need something with even up to 13 courses, which can be very complicated for a beginner.

* **The learning curve** is slightly challenging if you don't play any instruments, but definitely rewarding. The tablature is very simple, logical and intuitive which is nice :) . A good teacher is highly recommended. The lute soc (UK) has a huge listing of teachers. 
Playing a lute can be learned solo however, if you pay alot of attention to the plucking method. 
Playing a lute is somewhat like playing a guitar, but with many more strings. Once you're used to the tablature it will start to really flow. The tablature looks like normal guitar tablature but the standard tablature uses letters instead of numbers for the fingerings. It took me about 2 weeks on-and-off to sight-read near fluently.

,"I just sort of always knew about it. Not the specifics -- for a while, I thought women and men both had penises and they wrapped around each other and hugged -- but I knew people did it, and I knew the basic gist of it. 

This was mostly because a) I watched a shitton of Discovery Channel documentaries and b) my parents are European and only let me watch European indie arthouse movies until I was, I don't know, 13 or 14. To clarify: sex was totally okay, in movies. R-rated? Frontal nudity? Totally fine. It wasn't a big deal at all, really. What they didn't let me watch was violence -- they felt it was crass and American to have violence as entertainment. When I watched Mission Impossible at a friend's cottage my mom freaked out and wondered why I'd ever watch such a thing (even though Discovery Channel would regularly have, say, a lion skinning a zebra *with its teeth* as the zebra ran for its life... but whatever). Even most cartoons didn't pass muster -- and video games? Forget about it. 

The really in depth stuff happened when I discovered the internet at nine or ten or so -- around the time we stopped having dialup. I read a lot, and frequented a lot of online games and chat rooms, and for some reason saying I was an 18-year-old girl (when I was 10) seemed to make everyone else in the chat room start to act really weird, so...

After a guy started telling me how much he wanted to fuck me and how he'd found my other accounts on a different site, I figured out that it was never okay to be a lady on the internet. And then I laughed. A lot. Because here was this grown hairy creepy man somewhere in, I don't know, New Jersey, thinking that shit like that would actually work. It was weird and creepy and kind of hilarious. But I learned about stuff like precum and erections and whatever (I didn't know you needed a boner to fuck.

,"Considering the high cost of an American (ivy-league) law degree, you should go up to the LLM in an education system that is cheap (Denmark, or most other EU countries) and then get a JD from an ivy-league school of law if that's your ultimate goal.

Most EU law schools offer internationally oriented tracks (I don't mean LLM in international law.)

For reference, American JDs are not too strenuous to get for a European LLM. LLDs are a different beast though, similar to European style doctorates of laws.

Considering your implied age (around 18?), I would also advise you to get a Master's degree as quickly as possible, and satisfying your wanderlust with some sort of Erasmus exchanges.

Then start working for 2 or 3 years. That should get you to around 25, where you'll have a much clearer idea of what you want to do with your life (and also, more importantly, a better idea of who you are.)

At this age, then you'll be able to decide correctly what kind of final degree you'll really want.

My students are around 22 at the master level, and most of them have absolutely no idea about what to do with their lives.

If you can and if you're interested, try on the way to your main masters to pick up a side degree in an unrelated field. For lawyers, you'll get the most profit from an engineering or hard science degree.

Also try to pick up a third and fourth language, that helps a lot.

TLDR: do not go too fast and pick a path that'll lead to the most choices when arrived at the Masters level.

,"The key to travelling solo as a woman is to constantly be hyper-aware of your surroundings.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't trust others, but you should always (every five minutes is a good rule) reevaluate whether you're comfortable in whatever situation you're in and whatever company you're keeping.  If you don't feel comfortable, leave IMMEDIATELY - the advantage you have in being a traveller is that you'll probably never see these people again, so don't worry about offending them.  Don't be a dick, of course, but your safety is more important than their opinion of you.  

Alcohol and drugs compromise your decision-making abilities, so consider not drinking/partaking in illegal substances for the duration of your trip.  I realize that one of the main reasons for going to the Netherlands is drug tourism, but relying on people you met at the hostel that day to watch out for you while you're in an altered mental state might not be a good idea.  CONSTANT VIGILANCE!

Also, check out couchsurfing.org.  You don't necessarily have to stay with anyone, but try searching for people under the ""coffee or a drink"" option to talk with some of the most interesting people on earth.  Most hosts are also avid travellers, so they can give you tips on travelling solo, travelling around Europe, or even just a tour around their city.  

Bring a sturdy, non-name brand backpack (if it is, consider cutting out/covering up the label).  Likewise with wallets, camera bags, laptop/netbook bags, specialty shampoos, sunglasses, etc.  Pack everything back into your backpack before leaving the hostel every morning, and invest in a combination lock for lockers.  Figure out what you'll do for laundry - negotiating laundromats in a foreign language could be a great experience, and hostel front desks will direct you to the nearest one.  On the other hand, bringing a clothesline ensures that you'll never run out of underwear and socks.  

If you need to bring meds, store them in ziploc bags (for waterproofing) in two separate places (one in your backpack, one in your daypack).  Place folded clothes in gallon freezer ziploc bags and sit on them for a low-cost vacuum packing system.  Bring duct tape by wrapping it around the barrel of a Sharpie marker.  Bring a notebook for journaling, map-drawing, and pictionary with strangers when you're lost.

The reason is that religion is 100% tradition. It isn't the book, whether it's the Torah, Koran or Bible, it's the accrued body of traditions. The most important traditions are the ones concerning the interpretation, the spin and angle, of the source material.
In pretty much all contemporary flavors of christianity, the Old Testament is pretty much ignored. Only a few select passages are still interpreted as literal and relevant.

In US christianity, but not european christianity, the ban on gays is one such passage, whereas no contemporary christian tradition consider the command to stone adulterers, support of slavery, or ban on eating shellfish, to be literal or relevant.

,"As an Australian who cares about our economy this is bad. This is exactly what the US treasury wanted. The reason why we went back to parity is because yesterday the US fed announced the printing of $600 billion dollars worth of money (to buy US bonds) to purposefully devalue the greenback against other currencies in an attempt to kick start the economy, and flood the world with devalued USD.

The US doesn't have many other financial levers left - with interest rates near zero, one of the only competitive advantages the US can go for is to devalue the USD to make their exports competitive (cheaper computer games for us) and their consumers purchase of imports more expensive.

The fact the US economy has to even move along these lines is a tragedy, and for the Australian economy it's not that fucking great either (unless you're on holidays).

I'm a primary industry exporter from Aus and have already lost export accounts because of this.

There is a currency 'stimulus' war going on in global economies at the moment and Australia is a big loser in all this.

So have a great holiday... enjoy it whilst it lasts and acquire US currency whilst you can because the AUD should not, nor should it ever be at parity with the USD - this is just a complete aberration and due for a correction. It says a lot more about the US economy and their economic policies than it does about the Aus economy and its policies. 

After all the GFC was not global at all, it was a North American and European Financial Crisis.

,"Nope, that was the reason she left. As for her being replaced on *Becker*, I don't think the real reason for Terry Farrell leaving Becker was ever stated. All IMDB has is this tidbit:

&gt;The reason is not exactly clear. Some accounts say that she was fired after she led a revolt against the show since she was unhappy about the direction in which her character was going. Her character, Reggie, realized how pathetic her life really was after a one-night stand with Becker, and decided that if she didn't leave then she never would. She left for Europe to model and was never seen again.

,"You know what I don't get it is, why is ""poverty"" always assumed to be the root cause of problem kids' behavior/attitude issues. Does poverty only exist in America? sweet jesus in heaven the schools I attended in eastern europe would make this underfunded urban school seem like a Hilton to you. 
I do know this - if any kids (including me) in my classes ever disrespected a teacher, they would be in seeeeeeerious shit back home and before even getting home (teachers could actually **discipline**). 

I will never forget the day my geography teacher [a subject that seems to not be held in high regard 'round these parts :-) ] showed us how he dealt with students who chewed gum in glass. He calmly walked over to the kid and extended his hand. The kid put the gum in the teacher's hand, who calmly proceeded to gently massage the gum into the kid's hair, all while continuing with the lesson. 
I don't think anyone chewed gum anywhere for a few days afterwards...

My history teacher, we never got to learn what his method was, but he did carry 2 dice with him that he would roll in complete silence if he saw you talking. People usually quieted down fast. Nobody ever got to find out exactly which dice combinations meant trouble, it'd be dead silent after the first 2 rolls. 

Kids are **not** this porcelain, fragile dolls that will shatter at the first attempt of discipline. Kids can live through some truly horrible stuff and come out OK, I doubt you disciplining them would cause lasting damage. But sure would bring back some quality control. 

I think you have one of the noblest, most under-appreciated jobs. It's sad to me that lawyers get more respect than teachers. You are given the burden of forming these kids' entire mindset, and very few powers to actually enforce anything....

And (shit, someone's gonna play the race card on me...) it's all about culture. Until this ghetto culture of ""getting an education is acting white"" or that ""la familia"" is more important than school-work, is eradicated, nothing will change.

,"A ""living wage"" is a nice theoretical, but to try to put it into place would be tilting at windmills and do more harm than good.

Interestingly, the pre-1982 tax rules actually resulted in the rich paying less. Because there were massive tax shelters and loopholes available. When the rates were lowered in 82, the tax code was also revamped to remove a lot of deductions for the rich. So returning to the 1982 tax rates would actually result in extremely high tax rates that would be higher than all of Western Europe. This would have pretty negative effects on the economy.

This is one example of good intentions that would have negative repercussions.

I favor a policy that tries to maximize efficiency across the general populace with a safety net rather than a policy that tries to maximize social justice and have a higher cluster toward the mean. An important note is that I only favor this because I don't think it's possible for a country to properly provide social justice. If I saw a proposal that would better equalize salaries without reducing the mean and median wage I would be for it.
