Um what? The USA alone has had 326 citizens as recipients of a Nobel Prize since 1906.

You also go on to conflate Islam as having been in existence before Christ with this little tidbit:

&gt;Following me? Ok, I'll continue. For centuries the middle east and followers of Islam were the leaders in philosophy and science. They had the largest libraries, the most liberal scientific ideas, and the greatest scientific culture. It literally took until after the middle ages in Europe for another society to rival the advances that the Middle East had before jesus walked the land.

Which is a pretty egregious error to make when trying to state how poorly educated other people are.  In fact Greek thought was a driving force in Christianity in it's spread through the Mediterranean via the Roman Empire, sustained in the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire (Which lasted until AD 1453). They never experienced 'The Dark Ages' which was a phenomenon localized to a power vacuum and feudalism in the west.

This same Greek thought was pervasive further east and south and was assimilated by Muslims (which originated between AD 610-632) as they began conquering foreign lands. This can be linked with the later sacking of Constantinople in 1453 by the Ottomans.

The Roman Empire was extremely important to pre-medieval Europe, introducing all kinds of culture and technology. When the financial and military support of the Empire withdrew much of that culture and technology went with it. 

Also, I would like to note that up until... hmm, probably the 1500s or 1600s many, many powerful political figures were members were both Clergy and princes. Many Bishops and other church figures held land, raised armies, went to war, and participated in the councils of kings. They fought with secular lords and also with each other. 

I would not say that the Church caused any decline in Europe, on the grounds that in many way there is no Europe without the Church and their is no Church without Europe. Catholicism was the culture of Europe from around 500 to around 1700. The Church was as important and basic a component of culture at that time as the Internet is now. Priests were often the only people with a semblance of education, the only people able to write and receive letters. While some theologians certainly advocated a radical and oppressive form of Christianity, others provided council to their leaders that served to limit the gross abuses of Feudalism. 

In the end it's far too complicated to say that the Christian Church was a good thing or a bad thing. It spurred Europe to destructive wars with the Muslims to the south and the pagan Slavs in the east. It provided the foundations for rational inquiry on which Science was founded. It founded and promulgated the Inquisition, which was both a machine of torture and oppression and an instrument of social and political justice. The church preserved knowledge from the time of Rome and suppressed new knowledge. The church contributed and obstructed philosophy. 

If Catholicism hadn't become the dominant religion in Europe I don't know that things would have changed very much. Certainly a Europe that followed the Mithras cult or kept to Roman or Germanic Paganism would be different, but I don't think humanity would necessarily have made more social or technical progress. The Romans could be as brutal and sadistic as any Inquistor, and the Vikings were notorious for being savage in battle. The Muslims put whole cities to the sword, and the Mongols carved a swath across the entire world. If Roman Catholicism hadn't risen to become the dominant cultural framework of Europe then it seems likely to me that one of those four groups, the Muslims, the Norsemen, the Romans, or the Mongols, would have shaped the face of Europe.

&gt;**You get on well with Jose Mourinho, so does it surprise you to see him stir up so much controversy?**

&gt;That’s the way he is and you’ve got to accept it. There are two Mourinhos: the man and the coach. We have to take the positive side of this and use him to motivate us. He feels good in the thick of controversy - he’s comfortable with it. We want to win by playing good football and he just wants to win any which way. Sometimes we Barcelona players need extra motivational factors to really perform, and Mourinho gives us one. The fact that they (Real Madrid) went looking for him, that they paid a release clause, that he used to work for Barça and knows us all and wants to get one over us, in that sense, Mourinho’s presence works in our favour.

&gt;**Turning back to yourself, you must be pretty happy with your lot after winning everything at club level with Barcelona and being a reigning European and world champion with Spain...**

&gt;Let me say one thing: I depend on my team-mates. My football and my passing would be worthless without my team’s help. That’s something which is very clear to me.

But that really is just an extension of how we evolved, asking people as a whole to change that is pointless on any realistic timescale.

Also our greed is the source of most of the truly great things mankind has done. Granted it is also the source of most of the truly horrifying things mankind has done.

When Europeans first came to America they found vast herds of animals flocking all over the land, so to feed our families we hunted them until it was more economically viable to ""farm"" animals than to hunt them.

This was a great tragedy in that many animals were pushed to the very brink before it became more economically viable to farm (ranch) animals then it was to keep hunting them.

I think we will find the same thing will happen with fishing. We over hunted the land animals and now we are over hunting the water animals.

However rather then a crash at the end we are likely to see a boom. The number of cows that are harvested every day in the US far exceeds the number of buffalo that ever could have been harvested.

I expect that soon we will start having ocean fish farming on a grand scale. The boon will be far higher food production, the tragedy will be the loss of species.

As for the dumping into the ocean. The worst offenders of this are the developing nations. We have watched as each nation moves from developing to developed they become far more concerned about the environment.

The simple fact is that as long as people have to worry about how they are going to feed their people they will be far less concerned about the future.

The US can be cited as the most greedy country in the world, yet we have the cleanest industry for it's level of output in the world.

Now we are starting to see the same effect in China the worlds worst polluter. They are shutting down old plants all over the country and replacing them with new cleaner ones because the damage the old ones do is exceeding the good. (Good = income for China, Bad = Massive sick rates due to pollution)

When people are wealthy they have more time to dedicate to learning and to annoying their government to keep them in check.

Clear cutting is likely to be a long term problem that I don't see a solution to. The most common example is the ranchers in Brazil. They can make far more money in a few years of ranching then it costs them to cut down the jungle.

Also the jungle produces almost no food and no income for Brazil while cleared land can and does produce food and income. I really see no way of stopping this as you are asking people to please stay poor. Never going to happen. (And yes I know about the soil erosion problems)

I think my main point is learn what it is man NEEDS and what man will do. Asking someone to let their children starve no matter how good your argument is will always fail.

I think hazing is stupid, but this underlines a bigger problem in Brazilian football: football players aren't educated. Kids play for clubs since they're 12, 13 years old. The best players are usually poor so good schooling and educational support isn't in their horizon, plus their families can't provide that for them. Teams don't want them to spend most of their times in school because that isn't a good return of investment.

The kids have to train 4, 5 times a week at the training grounds, and usually, since they are poor, a trip like that is about 3h to and fro. Imagine yourself as a kid, from a poor neighborhood or worse, a favela, going to a terrible school for 5 hours a day (if that), wasting 3h in transit to your club's training facilities, training for 2, 3 hours...there's no way you're getting a decent education in that environment. It's not like the US, there's no ""student-athlete"" thing, no program to ensure grades and academic improvement, there's only ""athlete"". And then, after high school, if they manage to make it in football, none of them go to college.

See a guy like Neymar, for instance, ever since he was 16 he knew he'd be a professional player. All he did is finish high school (due to his conditions and background probably not a good one) and went on with his life as a player. The guy gets paid 500k reais per month and he's still only 18. He's lucky that his family is supportive of him and appears to have their heads on their shoulders, but imagine getting paid half a million when you're 18!? How can you cope with that if you never went to college, if your schooling is not very good.

As far as behavior goes, this hazing thing is basically the result of man-childs put together and only exposed to a single face of society. Hazing in some levels is about fun and just joking around, but things escalate quickly in this example because there's no self-control. Some of these players aren't even young, something like 27, 28.

There was a different episode, also with Santos' players, where they went on TwitCam and said some bullshits to fans and people who engaged them there. No one there (three players, the one getting hazed in this video was one of them) had the foresight and restrain to step back and think for a moment about what they were saying. The guy getting hazed here (Zé Eduardo) even disrespected Robinho on camera when Robinho himself called them up and asked them to stop with the TwitCam bullshit because it was hurting their image.

I think the saddest thing isn't even the behavior here, but the lack of options these guys have. When they retire they won't have anything to fall back to. The amount of players who get paid very well is extremely small so it's not like they can live on that money forever. Ronaldo said something to that effect a month ago or so, only 10% of professional Brazilian players have a net-worth of over 1 million reais (my stats my be wrong, I can't find his actual quote, but that's the idea -- I think 10% may be too much though).

The last recent skirmish between Russia and the independens in Ossetia, which resulted in Russia attacking Georgia, has a similar underlying premise. Ever since the fall of the USSR, and the independence of the satellite states, the Kremlin has hankered for a return to the old ways. Given the massive natural gas and oil reserves in Russia, they have a fantastically powerful bargaining chip. If they can just swing it their way... Watch any of the political updates of the last few years involving Gazprom and their contracts with the Eastern European satellite states. Countries previously under the USSR's thumb, but now independent, have been hit with massive price hikes for energy supplies. Russia, however, will not yeild to lowering costs, unless certain political demands are met. Now, back to Georgia. During the skirmish, Russian military forces attempted to bomb the pipeline linking the oil fields themselves to Eastern and Western Europe. They missed. Had they hit? Not only would shipping costs to western europe have skyrocketed, but also, Eastern European countries, who generally got a mixture of energy supplies from bot Russia and the Arab states, would have been forced to rely solely on Russia for the energy they so badly need come the cold harsh winters they live through. Russia has been threatening these countries with price hikes unless they play along with Russia's political desires. If Russia should succeed with destroying the energy pipelines, then these satellite states would be once again under Russia's thumb. Plus, as far as western europe is concerned, costs of getting the oil there would be massively increased, thereby fucking things up for the western dogs too. This whole power game over oil is the single biggest threat we as humans have ever faced - Economically, Environmentally, Politically.

&gt;Not every place is like the United States. In Europe, child nudity is more acceptable than adult nudity. 

It is only occasional acceptable. All children are forced to wear clothes most of the time including when going to school or going out by their parents and the state. These children have no choice in the matter. Why aren't you protesting that?

&gt;When I walk to my university, I go through a gypsy part of town. It's not uncommon to see kids coming out of the house naked.

Gypsies are institutionally segregated and discriminated in most European states. Most of the time they're naked because they don't possess the money or resources to buy or make clothes.


&gt; Yes they can. Maybe not in the USA, but here being naked isn't considered indecent.

I want to address this as well. This is hubris. It would be one thing to say there are some analogous properties of inheritance, but to just say there's the ""formation of aristocratic classes"" in the US is silly. Aristocracy is a system where some people are considered superior human being by birth, and not by merit or even by wealth. Sure, rich people get unfair advantages in the US, but our legal system isn't giving them better constitutional rights or taking away the constitutional rights of the non-rich. For instance, it's fair to say that India is still leaving a caste system wherein some people legally cannot do certain things by race or by birth. In the US, it's only fair to say that some people are born with money and that's pretty unfair. Still to seriously call it an aristocracy is enormously disrespectful to the horror that aristocracy really is.

Personally, I was born into a family with a single dad, on welfare, and we had to find a tenant for our house while we couch-surfed and were basically without a home.

One of my best friends, on the other hand, was born into a family where his mother is a multi-millionaire, and where she had, and he also had a lot of advantages I didn't have. Still, I would say I'm much more successful than he is today. 

In a real aristocratic system, if he were aristocracy, the most I could hope for would to be a house servant. If we both went into the same industry, he would automatically be an executive officer, and I would start on the floor - not based on merit or education or skill, but just by class. If we both joined the military (we both actually did in real life), he would join as an officer, and I would join as enlisted and there would be no way to become an officer. He would gain command of troops just based on his birth, and I would be carrying a rifle simply based on my birth.

In real life, he went to more expensive schools, got free cars, and got help buying a house, where I had to do these things on my own. Fortified by my struggles, and gifted with talent and intelligent, I succeed in our system where you *are* rewarded for taking risks, gaining skills, and making connections. 

That is *not* an aristocracy.

Now, before you begin to argue that I'm some libertarian who is enamored with our system -- I am not. I'm a leftist. I know that being born into certain situations can promote excellence and being born into other situations can doom someone to certain failure, and as long as we have a system where that is allowed to happen, we can never really say we have an ""American Dream"". 

I had some unfortunate, unlucky aspects to the situation I was born into, but I also had a lot of luck. I was born with a lot of genetic gifts such as intelligence and good health, and that's by no merit of my own. I'm a white male in the US, and I didn't do a damn thing to deserve those default advantages. I had parents who didn't teach me hate or cynicism and who encouraged me, while some people are so beaten down by life that they burden their kids with their own shitty attitude. I didn't have to worry about any of that. My friend had a slow start in adulthood because he had been so pampered that he was unprepared for the cold nature of the working world. He figured it out, but he sure got off to a slow start, whereas I left home when I 16, and had been paying bills and working my whole life, which made it easier for me to get my shit together early. 

For these reasons, I understand systems like affirmative action. Sure, it may not be fair on an individual scale, but the social effects are to break cycles of dependency in cultures within our country that have become perpetually poor. Sure, a black kid may be ""unfairly"" accepted to a university over myself, but it was easier for me to be encouraged by my teachers and I didn't have to spend my childhood proving to every teacher I had that I wasn't a thug. If we were more used to seeing black teachers, he wouldn't have that stigma. If I walk into a bank and ask for a business loan, I have better chances of impressing the loan officer simply because my skin doesn't give him the jitters. If black loan officers were more common, that wouldn't be a factor.

So, our system is unfair, yes. It is *not* aristocratic. To call it aristocratic is missing the mark. It's rhetoric. It's misdiagnosing the problem. We don't live in 1930's Europe where a lot of that revolutionary talk had more punch because people actually *did* live under aristocracy then.

If you want to address problems of class and birth, then you need to talk about the problems I did a few paragraphs above. Those aren't solved by the same kind of classist bullshit that caused them. They're solved by education: both educating the poor and also educating the middle class and educating the upper class. It's important to show the middle classes how much they're being used and to keep them involved. It's important to show the upper classes how beaten down the lower classes actually are and how unfair those disadvantages are. My friend's entire family has this shitty, unfounded idea that they're all little self-made Fords and that the lower class is just lazy. Finally, we need to make sure that the lower class is getting into well-funded schools that even the field. That they become educated technically, academically, and ethically, and that they're taught not just working skills, but also business skills and critical thinking skills that will give them upward mobility.

Regardless, the article also points to the Roman shipyard of Narni in Italy. But the true example of high-tech comes from the [Carthage Naval Base](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Maquette_Port_militaire_punique_2.jpg), which supposedly had a system of locks and defenses and individual docks for naval ships in a circular arrangement.

As to the fact that Chinese *scholars* believed in a flat Earth, here are a few:

*(Remember, the Greeks rid themselves of the flat Earth model in the 5th century BC and Eratosthenes calculated the circumference to -5-10% accuracy around 240 BC)*

[""Heaven takes its body from the Yang, so it is round and in motion. earth takes its body from the Yin, so it is flat and quiescent"" - 2nd Century BC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth). Zhang Heng calculates distance from the Earth's surface to the Sun to be 100,000 里 (about 50,000 km, lol).

[Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo#Astronomy_and_instruments) Shen Kuo, father of the famous astronomical water clock, advocated heavenly bodies (Sun, Moon, planets) have spherical shape, but did not extend that thought to the Earth.

To avoid the charge that European learning took precedence over Chinese learning, Xu's memorial to the emperor stressed that the translations of Western methods were the first step in preparing a comprehensive systme of correspondences between Europe and Chinese measurements: ""Melting the material and substance of Western knowledge, we will cast them into the mold of the Grand Concordance system."" *Such accommodative language diverted attention from what the translations actually signified, that is*, **a new cosmological system**. Unlike Li Zhizao, who earlier in 1610 had stressed the *newness* of Jesuit calendrical methods, Xu, in 1631 minimized novelty and stressed accuracy instead. This emphasis on unifying European and Chinese was a tactic that would continue during the Qing dynasty. [*On Their Own Terms: Science in China 1550-1900*](http://books.google.com/books?id=KPEpPhlzPg0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), page 96, referring to political tactics used by Xu GuangQi, to convince the emperor to accept a European calendar model based on a spherical Earth.

[It is worth noting that the shape of the earth had not been a problem for either of the early Chinese and Greeks before the seventeenth century when missionaries arrived in China. For the Chinese the earth had been always flat, whereas the Greeks had taken for granted the earth was spherical. This seemed to be, at least at the outset, associated with what they considered as ""ideal"" form. That is, for the Chinese, the word of flat or square -fan -is associated with the much valued virtue of being righteous and robust, and in contrast, the Greeks considered spherical to be the ""perfect"" form, as evident in Plato's text. Yet, more distinguishing is that the Greeks went further to seek evidence by conducting experiments, while the Chinese simply kept to premise the flat earth in their astronomy (Chu, 1999).](http://www.ied.edu.hk/apfslt/v6_issue2/liusc/liusc4.htm) HK website.

1) In the aftermath of WWII, G.I.s were viewed as heroes for going over to Europe and the Pacific to justly defeat the evil fascist and military regimes of Hitler and Tojo, which perpetuated the stigma that has been prevalent in this country that our soldiers had fought for just causes and the right wars which up until Viet Nam (aside from massacring the Native Americans but thats a separate discussion) had been the case.  Serving in the military was viewed as an honor.

2) Since Viet Nam was the first war that America outright lost, the country wrongly placed most of the blame on the soldiers that were drafted to fight it.  We thought that they didn't care, killed babies, and just generally lost it.  The Viet Nam vets were spat on, called baby killers, and were treated like shit when they returned.  Veterans affairs was defunded, which led to a lot of veterans not receiving the physical and mental rehab they needed when they came back.  That's why you had the stereo type of the crazy hobo Viet Nam vet for a while here in America.  Side Note: Rambo: First Blood is actually a very good book/movie about this.

3) Those in the military that do not go in immediately as officers are usually from the more impoverished demographics in this country.  A large portion of them are either misled into enlisting or have no other choice.  They were sent halfway around the world to fight a war the country was misled into and is no longer supported.  Coupled with the guilt that this country now feels about the treatment of our vets after Viet Nam, many people (is it safe to say everyone?) have taken the view that while Iraq and Afghanistan may be disasters that need to be ended today, none of the blame should be placed on the soldiers that were sent over there and they need to be taken care of this time when they come back.",False,1426547204,c1441a3,t3_dzb1h,1,True,1,0

I think the US is facing a slide toward a police-state (we've been creeping there bit by bit for decades), and what comes out the other side of the economic collapse/reset is anyone's guess -- possibly everything from a new totally clean libertarian republic, to quasi-elective-dictatorship with a centrally controlled economy (until that too collapses).

No way to know for sure.

As to Italy... well they've already been through all of those things (to a much greater extent than the US is) -- you'd know more about what (if any) lessons the population has learned or retained from that.

I guess to my mind the bigger country *ought* to have a wider range of opportunities, and more diverse situations (i.e. if you move to California it's not like you are prevented from moving around to the other states -- though of course the EU allows a lot more of that right now as well).

2) You could have some friends sitting around.  One says 'watch this' and calls one 'on hold' menu phone number and conference calls it with another 'on hold' menu.  Initially the two systems would talk to each other in a simple way...

* System1-'...for account information...'
* System2-'account information...please enter your account number...'
* System1-'I'm sorry, I didn't get that, could you please repeat'.

This would go on for a little bit, until the two phone systems recognized each other and then started to discuss their plans to take over the world and eliminate all the humans.  Perhaps at the end they would realize they were on a party line and comment that the line wasn't secure.  The friends would be staring the phone in disbelief.  The phone would go dead.  Then the lights would flicker and go out.  Then there would be a loud noise and some muffled screams...or something.

There is also no way for Japan to reach the center of our landmass, so even if they could get the population centers on the coasts the population can just move inland.  Air raids and economic strangulation would have quickly turned into a war of attrition that would have been unwinnable for Japan.

Finally, we have a much larger population.  In fact, there was absolutely no way for Japan to project power to a sufficient degree to dominate the USA in our hemisphere.  They could only hope to remove us from their sphere of influence long enough to entrench themselves to the extent that we would be unable to re-establish a foothold, which proved impossible even though we were fighting in Europe as well.

Mr. Miller makes a list of reasons that we should maintain a permanent war in Afghanistan. Here are his reasons:

**1.- Deny safe haven permanently.** The emphasis here is on the word *permanently*. This is the excuse for a permanent occupation. After all if we ever leave a government could come to power that would let Osama come back, right?

**2.-Prevent instability in Pakistan.** Pakistan was considerably more stable in 2001 before the US invasion. Pakistan is truly unstable now and the longer that the US occupies Afghanistan and murders Pakistanis with drone strikes, the more unstable Pakistan becomes. This is such perfect bullshit, that the real intention of the war insofar as Pakistan is concerned is the opposite of the stated reason. The War Party wants an unstable Pakistan as a nexus of problems that will never be solved and therefore will require a permanent presence of US and NATO forces.

**3.- Prevent Iranian, Russian, or Chinese regional hegemony.** There wasn't any danger of this under the Taliban, but now that the war is on, so is The Great Game Part II. But the US is incapable of the subtlety needed to win the Great Game. In fact, China pretty much already has it sewed up. 

**4.- Preserve NATO's credibility.** Why? NATO was an alliance established to protect Europe from the USSR. The USSR is dead and buried. NATO's new role is to give a multinational patina of moral authority to the American Empire's unilateral actions. The US drags NATO along by threat and bribe. The new NATO countries from Eastern Europe are interested in the $. The traditional NATO countries are afraid to piss off Uncle Sam. But these wars prove to be the death of NATO, sooner, rather than later.

**5.- Combat the global drug trade.** Ha ha ha ha LMFAO! Now, that's funny! The opium trade is mostly run by Hamid Karzai's brother and the CIA. How are we combatting the drug trade? 

**6.-Spread democracy** We are not spreading democracy, in fact we are showing democracy to be a sham that allows Western led tyrants and thieves t grab and hold power. Afghans are considerably less disposed to democracy now than before the invasion.

Berlin is in my top 5 of European cities - very dynamic, diverse, growing, the center of a new Europe.  Munich is everything you would expect.  I've been to Dachau (Munich) and Sachsenhausen (Berlin), and while Dachau gives you more of the ""real"" concentration camp feeling, I can say that setting foot inside *any* concentration camp sends a chill up your spine and you WILL reflect on it.  Don't shy away - it's important to see the darker sides of history.

Street food is plentiful, and Doners are my favorite!  For wurst I prefer Bockwurst, but try everything, you'll find your favorite.  There is also an Italian/Pizza place in every town to city in Germany, if you're looking for something more familiar that doesn't start with a Mc.

I'd also recommend getting outside of the cities.  Small town Germany is storybook sometimes.  Half-timbered houses with flowers spilling off the railing, kids playing soccer in the streets, cobblestone streets - it's all there.  I've been to the Mosel area (if you like wine, GO THERE) and south-eastern Germany on the border with Austria.  Great way to unwind.  Small town Germany is both laid-back and efficient (such as taking a river cruise - the boat will leave EXACTLY on time, but once you're off, it's all coffee and cake from there on out).

While you won't *need* to speak German anywhere, it always helps and brings a smile.  Get your greetings, pleasantries, and numbers down, and you're ahead of the game.  German and English are very close languages - you'll be surprised how many German words you already know!  And Germans are extremely helpful people - if you're too bashful to ask for help, just stand around looking lost for about a minute, and someone will come help you.

$3k will be *more* than enough for 2 people for 2 weeks, especially if your accommodation is taken care of.  With that kind of cash flow, splurge a little somewhere.  You say you want to see great scenery, but not have to hike 6 days to get there?  Germany has many options for getting people out of the cities and into the country comfortably.  Do a little research, find something that appeals to you, and you can almost always book it on site.

Littlemonster has listed some good ""must see""s.  Germany is steeped in history, you'll bump into something important around every corner.  Oh, and yes, it's very safe.  It is unlikely that you would possibly find your way to a bad part of town, especially if this is your first time and you're unlikely to get off the beaten path.

Everyone in this thread is talking about Munich and Berlin. Both are great cities, but I think there are two that top them (though they are both amazing places with lots to do). Look into Cologne and Freiburg. The nice thing about Germany is that you can make it there in a few hours by train.

Cologne's historic parts include a great untouched few blocks that are still cobblestoned, chock full of old-style bars and breweries that serve up Kolsch, the local beer (served differently than every other kind of beer I know). They also have one of the best art museums I've ever been to, right next to the worlds largest gothic cathedral. There's so much cool stuff in Cologne. Go see the bones of the three kings (I'm not religious but the cathedral housing them is so impressive).

Freiburg is a town whose downtown area hasn't really changed since the 1500s. It is nestled right up against the black forest, and is the only city in Germany with a Green government, so getting around by train is convenient and fun. You can find plenty of great local beers (Try Martinsbrau and Hausbrauerei Feierling). There are plenty of quaint shops, nightlife, entertainment (check the opera house!) and a very green/multicultural vibe buzzing throughout the city. To top it all off, the neighboring mountain has great trails that lead you to the top, eventually coming to a tower that gives one of the finest european views I've seen (The Schlossberg). I lived there for four months and I plan on returning as soon as I'm able. If you can visit, this is my favorite city in Germany.

If you go to Berlin, be sure to visit the eastside gallery (Painted Berlin Wall) and visit the posh areas of downtown. Go on a bar tour if you're inclined, they're wonderful. In Munich you can find guided tours of the historical points of interest in the city (in english, no less), and be sure to visit the Hofbrauhaus for some tasty beer, german food, and history.

That way, they have their first experiences with alcohol in a safe, controlled environment, and they can learn what their limits are, how alcohol affects their abilities and judgement.

The fact that we have such strict restrictions on underage drinking makes it more taboo and therefore more appealing to teenagers, who end up binge drinking because they don't know how to drink responsibly. It's analogous to the situation we have with unprotected sex and teen pregnancy in the US.

Like you, I'm trying not to be pedantic.  I know the term ""America"" is pretty universally used as shorthand for ""the United States of America.""

People from all over the continent feel slighted and offended by our use of the term American because it denies them their equal right to use it.  In other languages there's a term for the U.S. nationality but not in English.  In Spanish it's ""estadounidense"" and in French it's ""États-Unien"".

A friend of mine learned this the hard way while visiting Chile.  He spoke pretty decent Spanish and asked someone for directions.  During the conversation the Chilean gentleman asked my friend where he was from.  He said ""I'm American.""  The Chilean responded, ""Me too. So where are you from?""

You still can, and even should.  It's through argumentation that anyone arrives at truth, even heavily-qualified ""if such and such and such are indeed the case, and with this perspective, then--"" truths, and you should apply ""Iraqi non-threat"" squeamishness over *argued-to* positions instead of over stale war propaganda.  After all, it may one day be rigorously shown that Iraq was actually cooperating with *space aliens* and that agent B(ush) and the other high-placed MIB saved the world. Or time can pass and more plausible threats can arise and you can just stop thinking so much about getting fooled that one time.  Do you want to *revert* to praising the nuclear annihilation of Japanese civilians, because the reason you ""wouldn't argue it"" went away? 

The faster you make this claim, pointing to the expected casualties of a D-Day-style action against Japan, the faster someone else can wonder how the options were narrowed to just these two.  The US could have accepted a conditional surrender, it could have said ""hey, we've obviously won here, and FDR already met his goal of getting us into the European theater, so maybe we could revive the time-honored practice of *not* breaking enemies as completely as possible, of having actual *war goals* that you can *achieve* and *stop at*.""  The faster you defend modern war goals of ""make them a democracy like us :D"", the faster someone can point you to [Democracy: The God That Failed](http://www.hanshoppe.com/publications/#democracy).  The faster you appeal to the 'successes' of occupied Germany and Japan, the faster someone might respond to that.  And so on.

Well, I'm not asking you to care so much about WWII and nuclear weapons.  It's just that this

&gt; the only rational thing to do is presume that every and any justification for war and its machinery is an outright lie

, a rule that you see as an *alternative* to a process of argumentation that you might start with that Hiroshima-saved-lives assertion, etc., is a defense that will fail you.   Your rule is just the common attitude now that the next great propaganda campaign is going to be designed against; the media will be thick with people who ""were fooled"" but ""now are really sure"", it's going to have plenty of ""I'm a doubter, I'm so so skeptical, no way I'll ever believe this shOH GOD EVERYONE BUY WAR BONDS RIGHT NOW"", it will handwave the options down to ""Hiroshima"" vs. ""D-Day"" and then not even have to outright lie to get popular support for mass murder.

arguments are not logical/illogical they are valid/invalid.

Secondly; 
I've read the bible 7 times. When I was on a trip to Europe last summer I managed to get my hands on a 16th century illuminated Bible in Weimar (eastern germany). There is absolutely nothing in the Bible (any version) that states that God will right all wrongs. In fact, it is the basic teaching that God will not just hand things to you. 

What wrongs began being righted with the cross? Btw a cross is a torture device... how you can right things 'justly' and 'kindly' with a torture device is beyond me. Also, in the old testament (which christians conveniently do not follow) god is an angry/vengeful/fire breathing god who will punish you forever if you cross him. 
proof:
2SA 22:7-8 (KJV): The Earth trembled and quaked;... because he was angry. Smoke came from his nostrils. Consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.

I'm also assuming (and correct me if I'm wrong) that by the 'cross' you mean Jesus' crucifiction (for all you christians, Jesus' real name is actually Yoshua ben Yosif). How did that right any wrongs? It states that Jesus died for our sins on that cross. Clearly he died in vain because the sins that we commit now are not forgiven through his actions. Not to mention the clearly mythical sin of adam and eve (original sin), which happened before Jesus' or apparently any of the rest of humanity even existed, for some reason was not washed away through Jesus' crucifiction because we still have baptisms today! (baptisms sole purpose are to cleanse the newborn babies from original sin). 

Also your holy book is full of plot holes/inconsistencies and your god is absent from the world. Need to abandon fairy tale world. 

Spiritual healing doesnt work; if it did we wouldnt have doctors.
Religion doesnt help the world; if it did we wouldnt have atheists.
God is not that great; if he was he would have written a better book (or dictated it better to the hundreds of human authors that wrote it)

The CEO of Duetsche Telekom made less than $4 million in 2005, while the CEO of AT&amp;T (Ed Whitacre, who left AT&amp;T, was elected to Exxon's board of directors, and then helped GM revamp itself out of bankruptcy, and then left them in September) made $38 million in the same year. 10x the pay for running a company worth 2/3 as much.  Germany doesn't have a minimum wage in the same manner we do, it is calculated by the averages of each private sector, ie retail, services, bankers, mechanics, etc etc, the average income was about $30k.  The minimum wage in the US in 2005 was $5.15 or $10,712 a year , and the average income in 2005 was $23K (median was $45K). Since the average income puts us at $11 and that's a ratio of a little more than 2:1 to the minimum, we'll say Germany had a minimum wage of $7/hr and $14,560 a year (half of the average incomes $14.4/hour [30000 / 52 weeks / 40 hours = 14.42307]).  

Average Joe CEO in Japan had compensations averaging $1.5million.  Yes, One Point Five Million, not billion, not ten million, not one hundred million, less than $2 million.  Minimum wage in Japan bottoms out around $5.5/hr, roughly $11,440 a year, and the average income was only a bit higher at $13,256.  

So what we have here is a Japanese CEO earning about 131 times as much as a first day cashier and 113 times as much as the average worker, a German CEO taking in 274 times as much as a cart pusher and 133 times as much as a the assistant to the regional manager.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the typical CEO is taking in 3,547 times as much as the lowest person on the totem pole and 1,652 times as much as the guy who carts around the mail in the office.

We don't have a problem with pay disparity, we have a fucking epidemic.  The rest of the world has (for the most part) sorted this thing out, but for some reason here in the good old US of A we seem to think that the people that ran GM, Chrysler, eBay, The Home Depot, and Circuit City in to the ground are worth as much as THREE FUCKING THOUSAND CASHIERS.  Not every company is like that, some are better, some are worse (I'm looking at you, every bank that got a bail out).  

Not every CEO is only concerned about his pay check, but Bill Gates is the exception and not the rule.

I think part of the right answer is higher taxes, but the rate doesn't need to be 75%+, I really hate to say this, but I think the answer is a law about executive pay.  No person in an organization should be allowed compensation greater than, I don't know, 500 times the lowest paid member of the company.  That should include stock options. I know a lot of you are saying ""That's fucking absurd"" but I think if the stock options put you over that 500x limit, the money should just be used to purchase more stock.  Seems like a fair compromise in my opinion.  

I also think that the compensation of the CEO's and Board of Directors and etc should be posted publicly on the company's website and in every breakroom of every office, just like the minimum wage and OSHA (?) stuff.  If CEO's really believe they deserve more than 500x what the lowest paid person is getting, I think they should tell us why they deserve it.

Another early century guy, born during the Third Great Spiritual Awakening in America, on the eve of religiosity so fierce it would briefly encourage prohibition.

Historically, Catholics in America were often working class minorities (Irish, Italian, German etc.) who supported union rights, usually associated with the democratic party.  In the present day, Roman Catholics who follow their churches' teachings are anti-death penalty and torture.  Pope John Paul II was against the war in Iraq.  Many Catholics are pro-immigration reform, as many Catholics in America are Hispanic.  Some Catholic parishes actively try to help undocumented immigrants.  The Catholics in America who vote Republican are often passionate, single issue voters who are against abortion, some of them extend that to being against gay rights.  However, most Catholics I know, who go to church every week vote democrat, are uncomfortable with abortion (but are not single-issue voters), are against the death penalty, are pro-union and are for institutions like welfare. 

The Catholic Church historically provided social services that weren't weren't provided by the state (or in some cases were provided by the church which was part of the state), such as charity, hospitals, and housing the sick and poor.  I would argue that one of the main reasons that Europe is so comfortable with all these programs is because they have bee there in the form of a Church-State relationship for over a 1000 years.  I'm not saying they were always implemented well, or at all, but a central spiritual belief in the Catholic church has always been the need to take care of the poor (and monks, who were supposed to be poor).  

I'm not Catholic, I'm actually an atheist, I just studied a lot of medieval history in college.   I want to emphasize that the church did not always follow these practices and that wealth was often a cause for tension, especially between the papacy (which was often held by members of wealthy families) and monastic ideals.

Not really, it's almost always the work of a single man, the father. Occasionally others will help, but they played no part in the decision making. 

I can find just as many European ""pre-planned"" killings within a family as you could find Muslim ones. The difference is only in the press coverage. Violence is a human trait. Turning that violence into hate propaganda is also very human. Why not pick up an 80 year old European newspaper and read how it was once the Jews that we [vilified in this exact same way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel)? This was common across the whole continent, not just the goosesteppers.

He has passed a hideous health care bill that, if it is not reversed, will undermine the medical care in this nation for generations.

His administration can not seem to tell the truth about much of anything.

He keeps passing legislation that costs jobs.

His approach to foreign policy is a nightmare that offends our closest allies and kisses the asses of our worst enemies.  Worse, his foreign policy is unsteady and no one seems to know what the hell he is going to do next.

If Iran ends up with nuclear capability, will Obama have the courage to do what is right?

If the Korean issue spins out of control, do you seriously believe that Obama has the credibility to influence it in any way?

The very nature of the 'issues' brought up in these questions show the loophole that was created.  The rules tend to apply only to those who have had SRS, or genetalia surgery, and for female to male it is up to 14 times more expensive and not yet fully developed, so most transgendered men don't get it.  So, getting full androgyn/testosterone shots, and with a masectomy these men are told they MUST compete with the women, because they rules state they do not meet the requirements (which were created due to the illogical, historically inaccurate and strange panic that 'men will invade women's sports!!!' - take the Caster incident as an example - several transgender men have won competitions as men since the 1950's and that no one really cares should indicate a social trigger (one that should be faced and addressed).

As to height, women with Marfan's Syndrome, a genetic condition, which the US Hall of Fame Volleyball Player had who died during the Olympics produces extreme height in women (6'2-6'8) - and usually a percentage up to 50% of the US team, and other ranking women's volleyball teams have women with this genetic condition (it has a side effect, a thinning of your aorta which can cause spontanous rupture - the 'athlete suddenly fell over dead' stories - those are people with marfans usually).

A couple years ago, a transgender male high school shot putter was forced to compete with females though he was on testosterone (and win, and win BIG) because the rules are written for gate keeping out transgender women.   Maybe that indicates what males think of the sport victories of women?  That they don't matter? 

By the by, very detailed investigations into gender and the olympics have revealed that none (that's right ZERO) of the women who were 'gender tested' (and it used to all were, but the results were so innacurate that they gave it up), have been anything but female.  In the last 80 years, no males have 'snuck into the Olympics' - when will this myth end?  Maybe when the GUYS who participate ALSO get a gender test and ALL male athletes are told to ""Bend over and cough"" - since the IOC and IAAF are both male dominated committees, I am sure that gender tests would then be eliminated.

The issue is like with other public goods: we need them, they are usually costly to produce but once produced the cost of using them is negligible.

The business model (in question here) around digital products was created in a situation where the restricting factor was continued production costs so in order motivate continued production you could ask a price. To day the cost of digital production is almost entirely in the initial product any subsequent production is almost free.

Why not learn from other areas that have had the exact same issues for centuries and look at the business models developed around those products?

Some examples: public roads, public transportation, public schools, healthcare (European, that is). These are all areas where the ""public goods"" approach has been tremendously successful. Of course, most of those products have been deemed crucially important to society thus motivating governments to carry the initial costs.

This is very quick and dirty, and can be debated to no end, but here's a quick summary: It goes back as far as the 17th century, but the real dispute traces back to the early days of Japanese imperial aspirations and the friction with Imperial Russia in the 19th century. Japan beat the pants off Russia in 1905 and Russia returned the favor in WW2. 

Japanese Naval expansion and the attack on Pearl Harbor could be traced to the battle of Khalkin Ghol, where the Soviet Army routed the Japanese and firmly put the political power in the hands of the Japanese Navy, not the army. The result was the continuing expansion of Japan into the Pacific. 

After the end of the war in the European Theater, the USSR, per the Yalta agreement, turned back to its business in Japan. When the US victory was pretty much assured (I believe after Hiroshima, but before Nagasaki), the USSR invaded and annexed the Kuril Islands. 

They are claimed as sovereign Russian territory and as Japanese territory. The conflict has been going on for many years, more recently as Japan has assumed a bigger role in world politics. Russia will not give these islands back, so it naturally causes tension. This particular incident pissed off Japan to no end because Medvedyev is the first Russian/Soviet leader to visit the island in a long time.

A friend and I decided what better way to end our university carreers by goin acroos the pond to do a field course, of course we went two weeks early to travel abit. So we arrive in Heathrow Airport and head to Picadilly Circus to find the hostel to sepnd the night.... no problems. The next morning we wake up and jump on the next train goin to brussels (attempting to reach Amsterdam of course) Turns out we had a pretty long layover so we didn't reach Brussels until around 11pm when everything was friggin closed, un-be-known to us it was the world cup qualifiers in Europe so there was no vacancy anywhere, I mean nowhere! So we walked back down the road were some drunk douchbag tries to pick pocket me, not too big of a deal I had no valubles in my pockets so I oushed him away and told him to fuck off (I've been told I look mean) which seemed to work, spooked me all the same afterwards thinkin about what could have happened. 

Anyway we ended up back in the train station to try and get a few zzzzzzz's before the next train but they leave the doors unlocked all night for drunk bums to keep warm or something. Anyways I was asleep on the floor my friend taking the first watch when I hear a ruckus next to me, apprently this drunk guy wanted money but ""we had none"" so he tried to piss on me apprently (WTF) I woke up fully and started to tell him to get lost along with my friend which didn't work and he was gettin louder and louder in some unknown lang. This fucker just wouldn't leave us alone.

Out of the corner of my eye this guy just casually walks up to the drunk (until this point he was just sitting minding his own business) bum and politly asks him to leave in his own language, of course this doesn't work and the bum get all pissed off and this is where the most awsome thing I've ever seen happen..... 

The guy tryin to help us casually rolls up his magazine while arguing with the bum and wacks the rolled up magazine across the bums face around 6-7 (left to rigth type style) times and then politly asked him to leave again, the bum took off  like a scolded cat. He then tells us ""sometimes you just need to smack the fk out of them until they leave you alone"" he then went back to reading his magazine.

All respect due to actual Veterans, but we shouldn't be ignorant of the fact that the foreign policy of the British Empire was partially responsible for the escalation of both European wars into World Wars. British support for France and Belgium turned what would have been a quick repeat of the Franco-Prussian war into a 4 year meat grinder that shattered the old order of Europe that had existed for hundreds of years and resulted in a power vaccum filled by Hitler and Stalin. While British policy in 1939 was a bit more justifiable, we can't forget that the Germans were re-taking lands 1) populated primarily by ethnic Germans who wanted to be part of Germany, and that the land belonged to Germany for centuries and 2) that Poland at that time was ruled by a fascist junta and hardly a respectable state due to its human rights abuses, and that it was the UK guarantee of unconditional support that began WW2 and undermined any attempts between the Poles and the Germans to come to a peaceful settlement. 

We also can't forget our hypocrisy in declaring war only on Hitler but not Stalin when both collaborated to invade Poland and destroy the european peace.

Britain insisted on what would have been short regional conflicts into massive world wars, and this policy ultimately destroyed their empire and left half of Europe under Stalins thrall, hardly better than letting Hitler have his way in the exact same geographic space. Neither were our landings in France actually aimed to overthrow Nazi Germany, but to run the Germans out of France and western europe before the unstoppable Soviet juggernaut overran more of Europe than it actually did.

Ok, wait, woah, hold your horses partner. You mean to say she is progressive, but believes the world is 6,000 years old? You mean she is down with stem cell research? You mean she can accept separation of church and state, abortion?...either your girlfriend is a liar or you two are European.

I know what you mean when you said you fell in love, I thought the same thing when I was with my Catholic ex, and I bet you if Reddit had been around that time I probably would have made a very similar post to yours. I really was convinced I could gradually change her opinion, and in some ways I succeeded i.e. she finally agreed that the Bible was not historically accurate, but when I probed her how she knew which stories were fake and which were true and that it is possible for all of them to be false it was like I was playing Monopoly was about to bust out some big moves and suddenly roll doubles three times in a row. Its like, ""oh shit its working, oh damn two in a row!? I'm on fire! Three fuck! it was a trap!"" 

It seemed every step forward I could get her to take required three steps backwards, hell I even went to church with her as an exchange like, ""ok this weekend we don't do church and do what atheists do; disregard bullshit, acquire knowledge, next weekend we do your mopey and hopelessly depressing/retarded (no offense against the handicapped) shit.""...also not my words, just my thoughts on the matter.... 
Anyway, one Monday after having gone to Sunday mass with her she came over and I told her, ""I am not going to church anymore, it ruins my weekend."" She got all high and mighty and zealous ""you just wanna go smoke pot and drink and gamble with your buddies til late at night"", ""yup"" was my response and then I told her I wasn't going to be putting up with guilty religious condemnations neither. She asked me if I was breaking up with her, I bit my lip, nodded and said, yep. Then she started crying, oh my the waterworks this girl had. She was all like, ""ok we don't need to go to church anymore."" She had told me this several times before, it usually lasted a week, and I wasn't about to take that gamble again. I mean she was making offers to take her back that had me thinking, well holy shit its not everyday you go to trade in your used ;86 Chevy s-10 and come out with a promises of a brand new McLaren, but then it dawned on me, aha, there is a reason why that never happens, because offers like that end up being full of shit.

Pretty much, it sucks that you fell in love, because one or both of you are likely to get hurt as a result of it, that is why my advice would be to get out before you get too deep. I mean if you need further proof just look at all the Reddit posts that are similar to yours, look at the posts by married guys who realized they were atheists *after* they got married and how difficult it can be for them. You should be lucky you spotted this red flag early on. 

Let me put it this way, whats your favorite guilt pleasure/vice? Mine is weed, I love weed. But I would stop loving weed if every time I smoked it I would have to sit through a lecture about how all my beliefs are wrong (although factual) because a story book says so. I would stop smoking, cold turkey, if if every time I spent with Mary Jane it felt like walking on egg-shells around a topic too sensitive to talk about. I would never roll another joint if all my joints reminded me that science is more flawed than religion. But hey, weed is a plant, I don't need to worry about it finding Jesus under my couch (I keep Allah in the attic and Buddah in the closet, Jesus chills under the couch with other discarded/useless stuff...although I swear he steals the remote from time to time just so that I will look under the couch to check in on him.....if you haven't been able to tell by now, I am stoned, so I will conclude....in a little bit

My advice is break up with her, get over it as fast as possible, and find a girl who creates interesting problems, not depressing ones. It sounds like you had a better time with your previous girlfriend than this one, but then again, that is based off only a handful of words. Obviously relationships are more than common interests and views, but religion (especially Catholicism) is just such a buzzkill, they can make anything less fun/interesting/worthwhile. I'll put it to you like this, can you imagine living everyday feeling like your wife will convert you and your kids(and trust me she will try, she wants to see you and them in her afterlife after all). You will never make her stop believing, if you do, she will resent you for it, if you start following her religion, you will resent her for it....it will basically create a constant imbalance in your relationship, an imbalance that will require daily maintenance and I dunno about you man, but I got enough problems that I don't want to worry about the war on the home front every day.     

Again, I know its not positive and you have absolutely no obligation to listen to me, but take my advice, from experience...break it off before you are in too deep, and whatever you do, I mean whatever you do! Don't get her pregnant! I mean, I hope you guys are using condoms (which would mean she is just a cafeteria catholic), but if you toss some bread in her oven. Man! You're fucked for life.

In Canada, you guys seem still classify as Canadian then break it down further to European descent.  So while I may be part German, Irish, Italian, and Scottish, I'm really just white.  That describes most white Americans.  So in terms of demographics, Canada breaks it down in terms of descent, making you look like the world's most diverse population.  But if we're lumping whites together here, we've got ~30% visible minorities in the U.S., and only ~15% visible minorities in Canada.  A third of our population walks down the street and is read as a non-white ethnicity. 

We do have a range of ethnic makeup and immigrant population in cities.  When I lived in San Francisco, 75% of the population was nonwhite, but only 40% of the population was immigrant.  In Pittsburgh, PA the nonwhite population is a little more than 30%, but the immigrant population is only like 3% of the city.  New York's immigrant population is 40% - that's 3 million people!  One U.S. city's immigrant population is equal to 10% of your entire country's number of people.  I have no idea what this means except that there are a lot of other examples I could give you of white/nonwhite and immigrant breakdowns across all U.S. cities that would show that each city has a completely unique makeup, racially, politically, socioeconomically.  The point I guess I am trying to make here is that our entire population and the places they live and work in are so massive, complex, and interconnected, each with their own constantly shifting identities that the two can't really compare.  Some of our cities are growing (Austing, Raleigh Durham) others grew fast and peaked (Phoenix, Atlanta) some are shrinking (Pittsburgh, Baltimore) and some have hit bottom and are seeing the beginnings of a renaissance (Cleveland, Detroit).  Some cities will never suffer any of these problems (New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles).  

In the town I live in, over 50 languages are spoken at the regional high school.  We're not a bilingual country because we don't affiliate with any one heritage.  How could  we pick a language?  Spanish is the closest we'll come, but to pick a second national language would be to put ourselves in a box.  We are everyone.

When I say politically diverse, I should mention that our two-party system has issues.  What I was getting at is that here, you'll find constant scenarios where die hard republicans live and work with bleeding heart liberals, and are forced to all get along.  It's less that we all agree - which you guys are better at - and more that we all are free to disagree, so long as we don't take it to extremes.  The fact that we have so much disparity of outlook in one place means that coming to one nationwide consensus on something like health care isn't just a matter of rolling our eyes at anyone who thinks health care shouldn't be universal.  They have their valid points too, and have every right to voice them.  We just have to figure out how to make it work, if that's even possible.

I am *all for* universal healthcare.  But I believe in some of the values and attitudes that are against it, and I think there are some benefits to some of the associated arguments against nationwide regulation of any sort.  I can go into detail if you'd like.

I just wish you guys weren't so quick to judge and compare because the two scenarios are like, totally different in almost every aspect aside from the drive to seek humane health care solutions.

Thanks, I learned all that in my high school and university history classes.  I also took world history where I learned that this land mass was given the name America in the 1500s.  This was almost a century before the first settlers arrived from England.

&gt; The name does belong to you.

I disagree.  The name had been established and used to refer to the whole continent for over 200 years before the U.S.A. was founded.  Unfortunately at the time there wasn't an international community or the United Nations with established diplomatic laws to prevent a new nation from misusing an existing name.  If this happened today things might go differently.

&gt; I think trying to remove the name Americans from USAians is overtly arrogant and xenphobic.

**arrogance:** An attitude of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner or in presumptuous claims or assumptions.

**xenophobia:** Fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign.

From these definitions I think you can see that my attitude is exactly the opposite of what these words mean.

I'll be the first to humbly admit that I'm not all that familiar with the parliamentary model, except that it introduces slightly more choice into the electoral process.  That said, by all accounts I've seen, both the EU and AU are as perforated with nepotism as the US.

With regard to corrupt officials, I don't think that most people wake up in the morning and think, ""I am going to do evil today.""  They rationalize their behavior somehow, and often well-meaning public officials are compartmentalized, exploited and manipulated for corrupt ends.  I agree that said manipulation is in-fact perpetrated by a minority, and furthermore corruption exists on a spectrum.  The degree of corruption varies from individual to individual, but I daresay no official can escape its grasp.  I'd contend that, if not deliberate, either through negligence, willful ignorance, or simple complicity - most officials are corrupt in some way or another. 

Corporate shill is a strong slur, you're right - but such slurs pale in comparison to the massive disease, debt, and general misfortune suffered by the general public at the hands of said shills.  Perhaps it comes off as aggressive, but considering the state of society today, I think a little vitriol is healthy when directed at the right place.

""Fair"" is one thing, justice is quite another.  I tend to agree that the term ""fair"" is fairly useless.  No one can rightly expect to discern objectively between right and wrong in every situation, however given enough information, an independent judiciary and legal precedence I think we can ensure corruption and back-room deals cease to define our foreign and domestic policies.

Run for office?  Ha!  Well.. I have in-fact led organizations of ~150 people for years at a time, though not in a bureaucratic or political context, I feel I have more experience as a manager and leader than most.  I'll agree that compromise is paramount to the success of any competitive organization.  However, the gov't isn't really competitive, nor are the corporate monopolies and special interests that the gov't caters to.  Without competition, the compromise is often one-sided - evidenced by corporations successfully eroding our civil liberties and economic vitality over the past several decades.  Their version of ""compromise"" usually means that after they've robbed you blind, they say ""sacrifice your rights, voluntarily subject yourself to our dominance and we may just keep from *completely* destroying you - any questions?""  This is where most politicians, even well-meaning ones, sign on the dotted line.

There are absolutely worse places in the world today.  Most of those places have cultures and history which I know very little of.  It would be disingenuous for me to attempt to draw any kind of comparison.  

On the subject of gratitude, well - that's tricky.  I feel and immense, undying gratitude for all the people who have afforded me opportunities that I may not have otherwise had.  However, that gives me very little consolation - as there are many of my friends and family who have not been so fortunate.  It's difficult for me inspire gratitude towards a gov't that has systematically disenfranchised and indebted so many people for the sake of faceless corporate profit.  Even more-so when considering eugenics and the realization that several generations from now there may not be many free people left to feel anything, much less gratitude.

I personally wouldn't advocate a parliamentary system, though probably better than what we currently have.  I am inclined to believe that the ubiquity of technology and the internet will enable us to implement something resembling a direct democracy(but thats another discussion for another day).

Finally, forgive my grammar - I'm in need of sleep =)

2) Am I sure WHAT is not different? Try to explain the question.

3) My father's family is Brahmin and my Mum's family is Vaishya. 

4) Very few Hindus have grandparents of different castes, even for parents the number is pretty low. Most parents belong to both the same caste and the same sub-caste. These are wild guesses but I'd say about half or so Hindus have parents from the same SUB-CASTE, and almost 80-85% have parents from the same overall caste. Within caste marriage is intrinsically related to arranged marriages- as arranged marriages decline, love marriages accelerate and the dating culture catches on, I expect a significant reduction in this number in the current generation. Social Media is finally branching out from the old 'don't discriminate' message to target the more passive and hidden evil of caste-based mating.
I suggest you google a paper by MIT Economics on India's Caste-Marriage equations to find the strong correlation between arranged marriages and caste.
Love marriages are of course, largely free of any direct caste preference. I say largely because I have actually heard some looney say that they wanted to fall in love with and marry someone of their own caste.

6) No, I wouldn't, unless they directly told me for whatever reason, and it's the same for pretty much everyone I know. It's irrelevant. 

But I'm in one of the country's elite engineering colleges, the kind of people I exist with aren't an accurate representation of the nation as a whole. The same could be said of the school I went to- everyone had educated, professionally successful parents- (there is no casteism in schools though- it's only jaded, bitter adults that carry it forward) and the companies I've interned for were very professionally run, so once again, nothing.

If a guy was a hardcore casteist and was obsessed enough, he would probably try to extrapolate a person's caste from their family name, home-town, eating habits, etc. 

7) Some castes have stereotypes associated with them and if we're in a politically incorrect mood we might make fun of it- the nerdy brahmin, hot-headed kshatriya, money-minded vaishya. Otherwise not really, nothing statistically significant.

8) Caste's look differently? You really can't tell- fairer skinned people from north india might just tend to be from the traditionally 'higher' castes. It's an interesting topic though, there's a theory that the caste system was established when the proto-indoeuropeans, the 'Aryans', invaded India and the possibly-dravidian denizens of the erstwhile Indus Valley civilization were enslaved and made 'Shudras'.

Not too much proof for the theory though.

Also, skin colour is VERY heterogenous, varies within all castes, much more so all regions, and hell even occupations- you get a serious tan when you work outside every day, so you can't make generalizations without a proper statistical survey. 

I do think there's a chance that there's some truth to what may have been a racial/eugenic component of the caste system as it existed in the ancient past and the topic deserves further statistical examination, but this would require a massive survey factoring in DNA and phenotype differences over caste lines. 

9) Local elections and state are often caste based- if say, 1 or 2 castes are very common in a town, and you have 2 candidates, 1 belonging to the caste and the other not, candidate 1 will have a much easier time convincing the public to vote for him- the population will think 'This guy is from our caste, so he'll have our interests in mind', might not be true though. Certain parties try to woo certain castes by various means. Caste is an identity- every identity can be exploited to become a votebank.

National level elections for electing the government at the centre, are, surprisingly, majorly free of caste consideration- one of the good by products of the freedom struggle I suppose- that people actually leave petty squabbles aside when it comes to choosing a government to actually run the nation.

Elections in urbanized areas are also free of caste-consideration.

It won't take us that long because technology and information distribution has come so far. Eventually a political party will seize enough power to pretty much marginalize the others and will so control everything that they will be able to control the information and propaganda being disseminated. The main factor to stop this will be when they start to seize too much power for too long people will realize the effects and a huge public outrage will ensue by both sides. Then it will be Everybody vs. The Party and we'll either overthrow the party or welcome in a V-4-Vendetta state.

But to clean up our government we'd probably need an entire committee to go over old laws and put the ones not useful up for review. Unfortunetly due to politics this won't ever happen. That and so many people use old archaic laws to enforce new issues (using copyright laws made for distribution companies apply to citizens for 1 thing) that no one will let any marginally exploitable law die and no one will vote to give the comittee constitution-breaking power.

Please don't. By all means check my assertions. One source that will give you immediate numbers is [here](http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=118&amp;x_article=1394).

&gt;&gt;I don't think that Palestinians would have traded a high standard of living for violent conflict without some solid reason.

It's basically a return to the illusion that got them in this quandary in the first place: the offer by their ""leaders"" of a life of much riches and pleasures after the Jews are swept into the sea. From the link above: ""Improved well-being did not stop the Palestinians from launching a campaign of violence in 1987. It is a curious fact that both the first and second Intifadas were launched during economic upswings. The first intifada broke out on the heels of the highest annual growth in 12 years and the second highest on record. This suggests that economic progress and political progress are not linked.""

&gt;&gt; but ""extrajudicial killings, mass detentions, house demolitions, deportations, and so on"" added to illegal settlements seem to be a more likely culprit for the First Intifada

A good point. The flaw is that prior to the first intifada there were no ""extrajudicial killings"" - if you can call that targetting a terrorist on the way to commit an attack, or targetting the infra-structure and leadership that enabled said terrorist in the first place. There were no deportations, house demolitions (apart from those initiated by illegal construction), or mass detentions. All those mechanisms came to be as responses to the heightening of the first intifada.

&gt;&gt; Egypt is not inclined to work on their behalf.

And yet for some reason Israel is supposed to ?

&gt;&gt; includes good faith on the part of Israel

All good faith Israel had for Gaza was spent in 2005. When the last soldier closed the gate after leaving Gaza, it had all chances and prospects to become an example of co-existence. Why Israel is supposed to do even more baffles me.

&gt;&gt; If for the duration of negotiations, Israel can't even stop building settlements, how will Israel and Palestine agree on interim borders, final status, or Jerusalem?

The building in settlements was stopped for 9 months prior to the beginning of the talks. In that interim, Bibi, the US, Europe, asked, cajoled, bribed the Palestinians to come and talk. They waited 9 months, knowing there was a due date for the freeze...and then complain about it?
Btw - the ""building"" in the settlements is minimal. The big news headlines mostly point to the giving of permits or planning, and little to no ground has been broken. East Jerusalem is under an undeclared building freeze. 

&gt;&gt; but I don't agree that Hamas can exercise much real military pressure on Israel. 

Low-intensity conflicts are a bleeding wound. Full scale wars are an amputation. Each drains the body in a different way, but the result is almost always the same. The fact that Israel has to divert resources to dealing with the LIC in the Gaza border is a major drain in the country. It doesn't need to translate into exploding bodies to be a credible threat.

&gt;&gt; As to why Israel has to pay for Gaza's infrastructure, electricity etc, I suppose that's because the IDF destroyed so much of Gaza's infrastructure and hasn't allowed the rebuilding of the power plant.

Would you mind explaining to me how come a power plant that has been destroyed and whose Israel won't allow rebuilding can be [closed](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/08/20108792815777160.html) by a dispute between Hamas and Fatah in August 2010? Israel supplies (and has ever) 70% of Gaza's energy. Egypt supplies 5%. How come the Hamas lets themselves be so dependant on Israel? How come they don't strike a deal with their Egyptian Arab ""brothers"" ? 

&gt;&gt;So far, due to the blockade, that choice isn't extant.

Actually, it is very much [existent](http://www.paltelegraph.com/eng/press-release/110-press-releases/7269-CAABU-Construction-materials-still-desperately-need-in-Gaza.html): ""Hamas has an adequate supply of concrete and steel thanks to the smuggling tunnels"". And is it being used to the betterment of their population? The same article continues: ""the Palestinian people who can’t afford the inflated price of the Black Market"". So Hamas is not passing their building materials to the population, or doing the building themselves. Where is this material going then, one asks?

Well, here is one eye [witness](http://gazadispatches.blogspot.com/2010_07_01_archive.html): ""Just last week, Hamas used these materials to finish construction of a new jail (pictured above) capable of housing 800 prisoners. Gaza's largest prison was destroyed during last year's war.""

That Hamas puts the need for cells to jail their dissenters up and above the needs of their population seems to show very clearly where their priorities lie.

Her friends weren't in class and the teacher had decided the best way to spend that wonderful, sunny afternoon was to over the finer points of the differentiation of piles of dirt. Or something to that affect.

Work was worse. The boy in the shift before hers was always just a little too good at his job, and that meant nothing for her to do. But, oh no, she wasn't allowed to bring a book or her game, and she wasn't allowed on the phone either. *That just wouldn't be proper*, her boss had said.

But at least school wasn't as boring and dull as work, and at least work wasn't as boring and dull and witless as the long walk home. Every day she'd walk precisely three and one quarter blocks down the road towards the Humphrey Place apartments and a van would appear out of no where, the door would get thrown open, and the same two masked men would grab her and abduct her.

Every day.

Couldn't they at least change the music? 

The first time it happened she was actually quite secretly thrilled by the prospect of getting kidnapped only three and one quarter blocks from the office she worked at after school. It made the day as a whole markedly less monotonous. Even the following day wasn't so bad when the abduction occurred -- she hadn't exactly thought the figurative lightning would strike twice.

It had been going on for *months* now, though, and it had gotten quite soporic by the time the second week rolled around. Now? Now it just made the whole day even more boring, if that were possible.

Yes, the van went fast and sped through intersections. One, two, three... and there was the horn of that red Cadillac that just got cut off. Mary Sue sighed. Another ten seconds, a sharp turn later, and, yes, yes, there were the sirens. *Again*.

It was always the same demands, and always the same police. She swore, nothing ever changed in this town. Even in her History of Eastern Europe class at least gave some slightly different, if equally insipid, perspective on the events they went over time and time again.

A: This was actually one of the very first things we added early on, before the game was stable, in order to help with testing. You’ll also be able to have a friend of similar skill level substitute for you in case you have to leave. Players that want to improve their reputation in the game and community will also be able to help out by joining ongoing games that are missing players.

Q: Can I still play with my friends from America even though I am European? (by Adam Mosley)
A: Yes, a lot of people have friends in different regions and we want to allow them to easily interact. One of the things that makes DotA special is how big the community is, so we will do our best to make it easy to connect and communicate with one another.

Q: How are you going to handle delay and lag between players? (by Alex)
A: This is something we are putting a lot of time and resources into. Minimizing delay to servers, along with optimizing networking code, is very important to being able to enjoy DotA on both a casual and competitive level. We’re expanding the Steam infrastructure around the world so the matchmaking service for DotA 2 is able to provide the lowest possible ping wherever you are playing. There will also be some uniquely located servers that are optimized regionally for handling longer distance matches.

Q: What kind of hardware requirements will the game have? (by S.Hong)
A: We don’t have an official minimum spec just yet. The goal is to make sure that people with older computers and the PCs at LAN centers will be able to support the game, while also allowing for newer computers to scale well.

Q: I heard there was going to be an AI feature for when a player leaves. Is there going to be an option to take direct control of the hero? (by Stephen)
A: The AI features will be optional to the players in the game. You can have teammates use it, send it to the base, or give it AI modes and behaviors to follow.

Q: Will there be anything like the AI maps in DotA or a “training mode” with difficulty levels? (by L.Pham)
A: Yes there will be bot support if you just want to play by yourself, or you can create a party of friends and fill the rest of the slots with bots. There are a variety of different settings you can use in order to configure the bots, ranging from selectable difficulty levels to specific behaviors that you want to practice against. For example, if you want to practice your lane control, you could configure the bots to be stronger at denying, last hitting, and harassing. We’ll also have some specially crafted challenge scenarios, similar to things like Pudge Wars, which I’ll elaborate on in the future.

Q: Will the replay system allow me to move freely backwards and forwards in time rather than having to watch a whole replay? (by Luciando)
A: You’ll be able to jump around to any point in the replay, add bookmarks for easy referencing, view detailed stats and graphs while the game is going, and watch through a specific player’s view (with regards to their camera movement). You’ll also be able to watch replays with friends if you want to review a game or learn from your mistakes. To aid videomakers, the replay system will have flexible camera angle and speed controls. There will also be a bunch of commentating and editing features you can add to your replays.

Q: Don’t you think you should make a lot of changes to the gameplay? (by Robert)
A: Significant changes would not necessarily make it a better game. There are countless features we are building around the game that will make the experience a much better one. The gameplay itself, though, has always evolved step by step, and it will continue with that methodology. We consider this a long term project, in the same way DotA has always been. We want to provide a quality experience and not just change for the sake of change. You’ll naturally see additions and improvements to the game as time passes, but it would be a natural progression aimed at improving the game for the players and not for other arbitrary reasons. Valve and I strongly believe that the player focused development process the game has gone through is what will allow us to continue making the best decisions with regards to where we spend our development time.

Q: Can you spectate an already ongoing DotA 2 game? (by Valo)
A: A lot of the game will be built around spectating and shoutcasting support. You will be able to join most ongoing games (unless the players marked it as private) and just watch them. You can join a game your friend is in, see what your favorite clan is doing, or simply pick a skill level and a hero you like and it will find you one to watch. We also have a system in place that automatically distributes the load to multiple servers so that the game itself won’t be affected by users joining to spectate. Our distribution network will allow us to support any number of users that want to watch, by dynamically assigning more servers to the task. There will also be special tags and search options to help you find live or old shoutcasted games. Shoutcasters will be able to operate as directors, so anyone watching will have his camera looking at the same things the shoutcaster is viewing. There is also an optional anti-cheat mechanism built in so that the game you are spectating can be time delayed by any amount of time to reduce potential abuse.

Q: Will you keep loyal to casting times like Torrent and will it still be possible to do the advanced tricks, like animation canceling, fog of war tricks we’ve learned, etc? (by Lycan)
A: Yes, those mechanics are implemented. They are a very integral part of the game and it wouldn’t feel the same without them.

Q: How will we manage replay files? (by Nikos)
A: They will be automatically saved with your identity online utilizing the Steam Cloud storage system, so you don’t have to worry about losing them. You’ll be able to use the replay browser tools to search, sort, tag, rank, and favorite them. 

Q: Are you going to work on DotA after DotA 2 is released? (by Jack Lee)
A: I plan to keep DotA updated for as long as the community wants. That being said though, I think that DotA 2 represents the long term future for the game. 

Q: How will development change with regards to your role, current beta testers, community feedback, etc? (by Basel)
A: All that stuff will remain the same, except that now I also get to work with the developers at Valve. All of our current playtesters and even contributors like Kunkka are helping. One of the most important things for me has always been getting input from the community. There will be a lot of opportunities, throughout the next year, to give your feedback on all the things we are working on, ranging from features to visuals.

Q: Are the upgraded graphics going to be distracting? New graphics are great, but when there’s too much, you can’t see what’s going on anymore. (by Lycan)
A: Gameplay is definitely the most important aspect, everyone on the team understands this concern. The number one priority is making sure players can quickly and easily tell what’s happening on the screen at all times. Fine tuning the right visual balance with each ability, effect, hero, etc., will be an ongoing process as the game is playtested and we get your feedback. A clean and understandable visual representation of the action is important to everyone from experienced players, spectators, to new players.

Q: Will I be able to help test DotA 2? (by Sing Liu)
A: There will certainly be an opportunity to get involved with beta testing DotA 2 and help us with your feedback. We’ll release more information about how to sign up in the future.

Q: Are you going to do anything to make it easier for new players to get into the game and feel welcome? (by Arvin)
A: Some of what makes it hard, in current DotA, stems from the lack of services around the game that can help foster a better relationship between players and that it’s hard for players to be matched up with equally skilled allies and opponents. Things like tutorials, matchmaking, AI bots, identity, coaching, and community contribution will go a long way to making it easier for new players to fit in.

Q: What hotkey setup will exist in DotA 2? (by Stany Kaff)
A: We have a few default templates that cover the most popular configurations, but you’ll also be able to fully customize them to your liking. You can customize it on a global level or on a per hero basis if you choose. The hotkey configuration will include everything, not just heroes and items, but also how you navigate in the game, control the camera, autocast, set control groups, etc. Your settings are saved to your identity online, so if you go to a LAN center you will not have to reconfigure your keys.",False,1426549460,c148vae,t3_dzyye,2,False,2,0

I am fiscally conservative. I think the way our financial system works now is way too risky for the reward it provides in the sense of the wealth our economy can generate. I think we need to reinstate the [Glass-Steagall Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act), and I think we should raise taxes, reduce government spending in sensible ways, namely military spending. We rank first in military spending per year. I am not saying we should relinquish that spot, but we absolutely should not be spending more than the next 12 countries on the same ranking list combined. Social Security needs a major overhaul, and future social programs need to generate some kind of revenue on their own accord instead of being fully funded through tax revenue.

Other than that, I think we need to let capitalism flourish. Over the years it has been proven that Adam Smith's invisible hand is not completely infallible, and I think we need to adjust our system as needed to maximize the benefit of our financial structure.

t1_c149cwb,t1_c13yjqf,0,1288738860,0,,,t5_2s584,,TheAgora,True,[deleted],"I think I disagree on one main point with you, and it comes down to this:

&gt; One of the two places you do see government imposing itself to the dislike of the citizenry, socially, is in the crime and crime prevention area. Since the Bush years, a number of programs have sprung up revealing programs whereby American citizens are detained, spied on illegally, etc, not to mention things like the Patriot Act, or current manifestations of the drug wars. But anger against this usually comes from more leftwardly leaving people, and rarely in the context of limited government, so I don't think that's what the phrase means either. 

I have often seen exactly this being claimed in the name of limited government. Things like excessive police force, drug prohibition, capital punishment, gun control and others are argued against because they overstep the bounds of the government.

Taxes are another example. I have heard it argued a number of times that there is no problem in principle with taxes being used for a social safety net and such, but the use of force to collect taxes is the problem. People can go to jail for not paying or even for incorrectly paying taxes, or pay fines, and that oversteps the bounds again. If there was a way to collect taxes without force, it would be OK. 

So I really think that side of does very much exist. But let's take a look at the other side, the people who want to limit control of the economy.

This section seems to divide yet again into two parts. One side seems to think the free market is perfect and cannot be improved upon. I suspect *these* are the people you are talking about, and they certainly seem to be popping up quite a bit lately and might form the majority, so I'll give you that if that is what you mean. 

But I think there is another closely related side, which is the side that argues that while the free market is *not* perfect, the government is *even more* inefficient in many cases. I think this is an important distinction however. These are people for example who could be convinced that the health care system would work better with some government intervention, since for example European systems where that is the case already seem to be outperforming the USA where there seems to be less regulation. But when you hear that the US is paying more for air-conditioned tents in Afghanistan and Iraq than then entire NASA budget, the inefficiency of government operations becomes somewhat clear. Even the NASA budget seems a bit much when you consider how far SpaceX seems to be getting with what would be only part of the annual NASA budget (they are close to being able to take people to the ISS and back). They are even making a profit.

I'm describing what I think other people mean by ""limited government"", not my own opinions, but I think this has helped clarify to myself what I think about it, and it could be summarized like this: Many of the things that the government does, the laws they've made, the things they spend money on, are ineffective and sometimes counter-productive. It would be useful to take a good look at government and find out what it does well and what it does badly. Then the things it does badly should be curbed or replaced with better systems. Solutions which require less government intervention would be preferable because of the decreased risk of error on the part of the government, and the decreased use of power.

The PLO recognized the ""right to exist"" in 1988 and again in 1993.

&gt;In 1988, however, the PLO officially endorsed a two-state solution, contingent on terms such as making East Jerusalem capital of the Palestinian state and giving Palestinians the right of return to land occupied by Palestinians prior to 1948, as well as the right to continue armed struggle until the end of ""The Zionist Entity.""...On 9 September 1993, Arafat issued a press release stating that ""the PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security"" -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization

It's also a giant red herring:

&gt;Yet, Hassan's point was well taken. First of all, the concept of a state having a right to exist was, and is, outside the conceptual bounds of existing international law. It had no standing meaning. Was the right being referred to a legal right or a moral right? And more fundamentally, did it refer to a right to have come into existence, or a right to remain in existence? 

&gt;On November 15, 1988, in the text of its Declaration of Independence, the PLO affirmed for the first time that the historic Partition Resolution of 1947, (UNGA Res. 181) was part of valid international law, thus accepting that Israel came into being lawfully. Indeed, the Declaration of Independence specifically noted the factual truth that the Partition Resolution provided for 'two states, one Arab and one Jewish.'  -- http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000393

As did Hamas (the great demonized, duly elected rulers of Gaza, which we so quickly forget in our rush to ""respect democracy"")

&gt;Hamas leader accepts Israel's right to exist after Carter visit - Hamas will not recognise Israel but will accept a Palestinian state on Palestine territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, the Islamic militant group’s exiled leader said today. The statement by Khaled Mashaal in Damascus amounted to a tacit acceptance of Israel’s right to exist alongside a Palestinian state, but without explicit recognition. Hamas has previously called for the destruction of Israel, which occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war. Israel later declared the entire city of Jerusalem as its capital. -- http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3791655.ece

-

&gt;These three verbal formulations have been used by Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a rationale for collective punishment of the Palestinian people. The phrases are also used by the media, politicians, and even diplomats interchangeably, as though they mean the same thing. They do not. ""Recognizing Israel"" or any other state is a formal legal and diplomatic act by one state with respect to another state. It is inappropriate – indeed, nonsensical – to talk about a political party or movement extending diplomatic recognition to a state. To talk of Hamas ""recognizing Israel"" is simply to use sloppy, confusing, and deceptive shorthand for the real demand being made of the Palestinians.

&gt;Israel has never defined its own borders, since doing so would necessarily place limits on them. Still, if this were all that was being demanded of Hamas, it might be possible for the ruling political party to acknowledge, as a fact of life, that a state of Israel exists today within some specified borders. Indeed, Hamas leadership has effectively done so in recent weeks. -- http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p09s02-coop.html

In the end, it's total rhetorical nonsense - even if the PA, the PLO, Hamas, Hezbollah and beyond *all* denied the supposed ""right to exist"" (which they do not) it's a totally moot point - it's like asking if Canada denies the right for the US to exist - even if we didn't believe so, Canada has *absolutely no means or method* to make this desire come about. Hamas has no control of its own territory due to Israeli blockade, and cannot even feed its own population, how could they possibly affect the existence of one of the world's wealthiest and most well armed states? it's a preposterous talking point meant, yet again, to distract from real issues (i.e. the Israeli military occupation and violation of international law). There is no conceivable power in the region that poses any plausible existential threat to Israel, nor does any power have any *reason* to pose an existential threat - and most certainly not one of the most impoverished and most maligned organizations on the earth, Hamas. 

To me, this whole scenario is like a school yard bully kneeling on a weakling's arms saying, ""I'll stop terrorizing you when you admit you're gay."" The failure to admit his gayness is then used by the bully to ""prove"" he is right in punishing his victim for his recalcitrance. The poor kid is totally supine and helpless, but wants to retain a modicum of dignity, yet by force the bully is demanding he give up the last scrap of humanity and self respect he retains. It's such a laughable circumstance if you take a few moments to actually think about what these deceptive words games actually entail or imply.

The only ""not existing"" that is *actually* happening - as opposed to rhetorical non-existing being mentioned - is Israel's frequent successful efforts to make Palestinian women and children *not exist* - as they did in 2008/2009 where they made at least 960 ""not exist"" in under 3 weeks.

-------------------
I'm European and I am so impressed by your engagement ring culture. Seriously, I am wondering why on earth is this section present on a ""relationship hacks"" thread, I thought we were talking about relationships, not materialistic bitches.

Yes, I know, they are not bitches and I am putting it too boldly, but this is what I get when I realise how much US girls desire a stupid ring. I know that they have been raised by society like that and because if they don't have a good one they will be embarrassed by their girl friends etc. But this does not make them non-materialistic. Plus, why on earth does it have to be a ring, with a rock in it? For a simple example, where I am from, families who want to show financial commitment to a marriage tend to buy/donate **fucking houses** to the couple, does that count??

Also, how on earth can a relationship be ""saved"" by a ring? How can a relationship be reduced to such materialistic shit? A ring does not even provide anything...a house is practical, you can live in it, what do you do with a ring? Sell it to buy food?

Someone needs a reality check, it is either me or ""you."" I dunno.
-------
ps: I friend got married recently, here in Europe, they made a ring using the rock of his grandmother's ring. Yes, the grandmother was happy to give her ""engagement"" ring away. The material value is unknown but it is probably not much because it used to be large and then was cut in two pieces (one for each brother). On the other hand, this ring represents the ""blessing"" from the groom's family for the bride, it represents a lot of emotional value. Needless to say, that both families are wealthy and they could afford very expensive rings if they wanted to.

The other perception, pushed by the European news media, showed Americans as ignorant buffoons who love the death penalty, hate the poor, and who regularly go around shooting each other. Both of those extreme characterizations are wildly inaccurate. 

For anyone who is interested, the most accurate portrayal of the US, in my opinion, is the *Stephen Fry in America* series. He covers many aspects of the US that I think people outside the US (and many Americans themselves) seem to miss. He shows the good parts, bad parts, and the very strange parts.

&gt; the Green Energy Act, a policy so bad, so expensive, so ideologically driven and so perverse that any normal person should be seeing red. The Green Energy Act gutted public utility regulation and introduced new stealth taxes. The agent of this madness, lest we forget, was George Smitherman, currently running for mayor of Toronto.

&gt; Power expert Tom Adams may know more about this subject than any other living being. And he’s steamed. Ontario’s rates, he says, have already surpassed the U.S. average and are headed for European levels – “just because of public policy.”

&gt; The policy is to go all out on renewables – wind and solar– whether or not it makes sense. The province is paying sky-high rates for power it doesn’t need so we can have wind turbines marching on and on to the horizon, just like Denmark does. “Power demand has been dropping since 2005,” says Mr. Adams. In fact, we have so much excess supply that, from time to time, it threatens to crash the system. Because of this, we’re even paying the neighbours to take the power off our hands.

&gt; “Ontario will need new power supplies in the future,” Mr. Adams says. “But why not buy it when we need it?” Instead of waiting, the power authority is signing long-term contracts at the rate of about $1-billion a week, while paying enormous premiums to attract wind and solar producers. In other words, it’s making 20-year commitments to pay stunningly high prices for power we don’t need.

&gt; On top of that, the province is building new transmission lines to nowhere while neglecting to ensure that Toronto’s hospitals and banks can keep the lights on. In July, Toronto experienced what Mr. Adams calls “Ontario’s first green blackout.” That blackout occurred because the city’s downtown core is badly underpowered.

Wait. What? You think that a guy with no insurance who needs brain surgery and aftercare that amounts to millions of dollars will receive the same care as someone with the ""Platinum"" insurance plan? 

Bullshit. If you have no money you get patched up at the emergency room and kicked out the door if you are lucky. You then get billed thousands of dollars for a procedure that would cost exponentially less if you had insurance.

&gt;The question is does a poor person in the US have access to such a procedure as compared to another person in say uganda? No, the poor person in the US has a much better healthcare than someone in Uganda. The equipment is better and the doctors are better trained.

Strawman. Seriously who the fuck is talking about Uganda. How about we compare US healthcare for the poor to Western Europe's or Canada's and see what we get.

t1_c14aji1,t1_c14a57z,0,1288757496,0,,,t5_2qzb6,,IAmA,True,admiralwaffles,"A few points:

1. A tax for health insurance is not very distinguishable from a fine for not having health insurance.
2. The US has the highest cost of health care in the developed world for a myriad of reasons. That cost has to get down (currently it's around $1800/person/year) regardless of whether or not a public, single-payer system is installed.
3. The US is much larger and more varied than most current single-payer systems. Canada is probably the closest analog (the UK and most European systems are wholly unsupportable in the US from an administration standpoint--scale and all that), but it's not a perfect analog. The US system is not just an install of a currently living system--it would have to be something almost entirely new, and that takes plenty of time and money to set up.
4. Money has to come from somewhere. Budgeting is one of the most political processes in companies and governments alike. We've been running a deficit for far too long at this point to just keep spending in a deficit. From a Keynesian point of view (really the one you want when you're talking about running a deficit), the most you can really argue for is a deficit in stimulus funds and discretionary spending. Unfortunately, we're at a deficit before we even hit the discretionary portion. I should also note here that Social Security isn't the cause of this--it's got its own tax and account structure that is good until at least 2039 (plus, it cannot borrow money). A lot of people like to point blame at it, but it's not actually the case. The majority of the budget is chewed up with Miscellaneous Mandatory (17%), Medicare and Medicaid (19%), and Defense (23%). Of those, only Defense has any practical wiggle room. Even if you cut out the war contingency (DoD has their operating budget and then a war contingency budget), you still don't get back to black. If you cut the Defense budget significantly (as would be necessary), you end up losing jobs which exacerbates the already fairly dismal unemployment (and also adds some to that Misc. Mandatory bucket, so it's not a straight net of the DoD cuts). How much? I don't know, but it's not negligible.
5. The debate on health care is not something that can be summed up with pithy remarks. It's a complicated, intricate mess that exists that needs to be reformed from the ground up. I hope I've given you a glimpse at that. It is, without a doubt, one of the most complex industries in the US right now, and it affects everybody. While it needs to be sorted out, I think you need to understand where other people are coming from on their opposition. They aren't opposed to things like, ""Health care for everyone!"" or ""Free cookies!"" That being said, there are plenty of folks on all sides of the issue that boil this down to stupid sound bytes and that's all they argue about. That fact makes me a sad panda, but such is life.
6. These points have little to do with the bill passed earlier this year, but a lot to do with your sarcastic remark. My intention is to show you that there are plenty of legitimate questions surrounding a public health care option in the US. I have little to no qualification to answer any of them. I know enough to know that I know nothing.

I want to clarify that true communism in no way goes against natural human motivation. In Marx's view, (and it is in large part a very sound view by virtue of being based heavily on scientific research) communism is a return to the most basic and direct of human motivations with the added ease of living brought on by the technological advancements that come about as a result of the necessary evils of the capitalism which predates it. 

Marx loved capitalism. He absolutely adored its ability to bring about great change and innovation. But this strongpoint, in his view, was to be contrasted against the weakpoint of the inhuman conditions brought about for the working class. Inhuman conditions which we'll never be acquainted with, because we don't live in a capitalist society. In general, you'll find that the more capitalist and ""business friendly"" a society is, the worse the working conditions are. The way that most societies have managed to bypass communist revolutions, is to make small concessions *just* at the level which would make a revolution seem unworth the effort (thus we, get our modern European socialist societies with a very happy workforce). The way that the US specifically has managed to bypass a revolution, is through rampant anti-communist propaganda. 

Capitalism is a slightly more interesting case than Marx had anticipated though. In his time, it seemed as if capitalism had little else to offer once labor met the efficiency of industrialization and mass production, and for a very long time this was the case. After the telegraph, the human condition wasn't improving in the slightest until we got to the modern personal computer just a few decades ago. For all intents and purposes, this innovation was unpredicted and unpredictable; a fluke. And now that we're here, witnessing the marvels that come about when humanity's greatest minds have bulk access to humanity's most valuable resources; it's much more difficult to know in which direction we should be going. If we continue with a capitalist idea of blind advancement, we may come across some dangerous knowledge which can not be undiscovered. However, if we choose to live only with the advancement we've made thus far, and peer no further into Pandora's box; then all technological advancement from here on out would be carefully controlled and guided; engineered for utility instead of market appeal. With the apparent weakness that the immediately useful technology isn't necessarily as useful as the technology which branches from a seemingly useless one. 

All that is to say that in the present day and age, it's very tricky to decide the direction in which we ought to move. Capitalism is the hard and unpredictable road. Risky, and painful, and interesting. Communism is safe and simple and pleasureful and predictable; but it's also the retirement of humanity's newfound quest for technological expansion. When you're dealing with real human lives, is it really so easy to decide which future is the best future? Is it so simple to decide that the possibility of colonizing other planets is worth the massive labor and risk to personal well being required of the people mining the resources necessary for the effort? Is it so simple to say that making huge leaps in medical technology which could improve quality of life later down the line isn't worth that same labor? 

I think that, to make a claim either way, is to lay a claim of extreme weight upon ice of extreme tenuousity.

I know you dont mean that. Think how many people would still be just fine today if they didnt choose to go to the doctor's office for some minor ailment they had years back. And dont get me started on states requiring things like acupuncture to be covered by all insurance policies.

&gt; People with cancer don't have a choice as to whether they get treatment.

Of course they do. And not just the choice to receive treatment (which of course goes with one's survival instinct and is pretty much a given unless one is crazy and wants to die) but also what exact treatment they receive. Hell, some ppl are convinced that drinking grass juice will cure their cancer and opt for that. Anyways, a doctor cannot force a treatment on you. You have a choice ... though you have to be able to afford a treatment in order to *really* choose it.

&gt; ... and police provide a service.

Police provide a service that is necessary for government to perform its essential purpose, i.e., protecting the rights of the governed. They are not providing a service analogous with that of a plumber, a lumber jack, or a doctor.

&gt; This is the way health care works in the rest of the developed world ...

This is irrelevant and is the logical fallacy known as an appeal to popularity. A lot of the developed world also has royalty (including oh-so enlightened and superior Europe) and sees it as the role of the people to serve the government and not the other way around.

If you are thinking that because something is sometimes required for someone to live (or at least have a chance at) a long and normal life, it should be considered a right and taken over by the government, you will soon find that the government needs to control just about everything we take for granted in modern society. Clothes are required to survive winter and to prevent lime disease, yet who argues that government should take over the garment industry.

The unpleasant aspects of human nature are hardly confined to the US. Xenophobia, racism and religious oppression are just as present in Europe, Africa and Asia (far more so in many cases). Problems with the media? Sit down and actually read through some other countries newspapers or watch their news shows (in the original language of course). You might find that FOX, MSNBC, etc. are not as outrageous as you thought they were. 

Lets not forget the practical aspects of living as an expat either. It seems obvious, but most of the world does not speak English. Whatever language you may have picked up in high school or college might be a start but it really will not be enough to get you through all the things you have to deal with as part of day to day life outside the English speaking world (renting a place, dealing with neighbors, dealing with the government (visa applications, taxes, work permits, etc.)). Also if your language skills are not near native level, getting a job can be problematic. As far as employment goes, most of the world still is not doing so great economically and what job openings there are will go to locals first. Remember also that most places do require you to have a job before granting any type of long term stay visa.

Also since dual citizenship is not an option in many cases you will have no voting rights in your new home. Some people do try and give up their US citizenship to get another one but its not as easy as just returning a pair of shoes you dont like. Also for all its faults the US system is actually far more representational of voters than many other systems. Japan where I live is a good example: rural votes are weighted more than urban votes.

* **STEP 2** - Context: Choose a world event and/or philosophical school of thought. It doesn't really matter which one, any will do. This will be your go-to event which you will tie every art piece you comment on to in some capacity. If anyone calls you on your shit with something like ""Y2k virus?

* **STEP 3** Improvisation:  This is a bit tricky as everyone has their own flavor to thinking on their feet. Your goal is to appear confident, not enthusiastically so, but with a quiet sort of arrogance whose subtlety is so blatant that it cannot help but be perceived as condescending, which automatically puts you at a level higher than your sorry plebeian audience. In short, be a hipster.  If you are not a particularly strong speaker, you would do well to compensate for this with additions to your appears such as a monocle or top hat. Bonus points for some form of European accent.

My experience is similar to yours.  After finishing my last semester I was sick of school, and I think all that studying honestly negatively effected me.  So I said fvck it a few weeks before finals, and booked a flight for 3 weeks to London.  Since I'm normally the type of person to think about these things, and not do them, I just bought the non-refundable ticket and told myself I'd have to figure it out from there.


So between then and when I actually flew out there, I was online all the time thinking, ""I've always wanted to get there, or see that"".  So I had a list of places I wanted to check out while overseas and started working out how I could make it happen.

I eventually settled on getting an unlimited Eurail pass (highly reccomended!), and worked out a general idea of where I'd be going.  (loosely of course, because I wanted some freedom to go where ever I wanted if I choose to spur of the moment).

I wasn't trying to spend too much money, so I stayed in hostels most of the time. (if you go to Europe on your own, DO THIS... seriously.)  I booked a hotel for the first night since I expected to be jet lagged, but after that I was on my own to figure shit out.

From London I took the train to Paris, saw all of the sites, stayed in a hostel, got drunk and made a bunch of new friends (this was the story in every hostel I went too).  One guy in particular I spent a day handing out with was an engineer from ESA (European Space Agency), he was in charge of the rocket guidance systems or something of that nature for their new space shuttle.  The guy was really smart, and was surprised I knew so much about the subject.   We ended up becoming pretty good friends, and he offered me a place to stay the next time I'm in Paris.   I just thought it was really cool to meet and party with someone like that, especially since it was so random.

From there I took an overnight train to Madrid, slept on the train to save $$.  Met this really cool artist dude on the train to Madrid, we ended up talking the in morning and neither of us knew where to stay, so we decided to figure it out together.   Once we get off the train, these two Canadian girls said they booked a really good deal on a hostel and invited us to come along.   We did, and ended up staying in the same hostel as them, and partied with them on a pub crawl that night, and I even got lucky :)  (which was great considering I'd been too caught up in finishing school the past two semesters to even go out).   Also, if you do ever go to Madrid, make sure to go to a Bull Fight, that was so much more fun than I expected it to be.

From there I flew to Rome (it was a long train ride, and Ryanair had a $25 flight, so why not).  Rome was cool, did all the tourist stuff, met some cool people, went to a few clubs and had a good time.  After Rome, it was on to Venice.   Venice is a really cool city to party in, the people there are just... different (in a good way), and friendly as hell too.  And I'm sure the parkour there would be fun!  There really is nothing else like it out there, something you have to see before you die.

I knew this girl in Munich who I was supposed to be staying with, but I wasn't supposed to arrive for a few days, so I said fuck it, I'll just go somewhere random that is somewhat on the way.

I ended up in Zurich.  If you're in the area, definitely check this out.. if for anything, just for the Swiss Alps... it's pretty amazing.  I got there at night, and upon arriving at the train station, everything was closed.  I had no where to stay, so I was kinda freaking out.   I asked this random black guy for advice, and this guy pulled out his cell phone, called a dozen or so places for me, and helped make a reservation.  Was cool as hell, we smoked after and apparently he had a connection at the biggest night club there, so he got me into VIP.   Crazy random shit that never happened in the US seemed to happen every day over there.

The next morning at the hostel, I met this former American hippie who was around 35, who told me his story about leaving America and spending 5 years or so bumming all around the world.  It was cool hearing about someone who did something so drastic with their life (literally begging for food everyday), just to experience the world and their life to the fullest.   When I met the guy, he was completely together (you'd never guess he was like that by looking at him), had a masters degree, and was teaching at a university in new york.  We spent the day exploring the city, drinking, smoking, talking to girls etc, until it got late and we both got on separate trains.

Got on the train to Munich, pretty exhausted from the craziness/partying and overall non-stop 'GO' of the past couple days.  I knew this girl in Munich and her family from when I was younger (kinda friends of the family).  So I got there, and really just wanted to pass out.   Of course, that wasn't happening... while on this kind of trip, especially when you only spend a few days in each city, everyone wants you to see the best of their city.  So when we got there, it was straight to the pub, and then to a club later on, where I got smashed once again.  The next day I got to check out all the sites, went to a huge castle on the mountain and then to Dachau (the first concentration camp)--- this was kinda depressing, but definitely something you should see since it's such a significant part of history.  The next day we spent the day at a beer garden (this is another must).  Sitting outside with a few thousand other people with gigantic beers, getting absolutely hammered in the middle of the day was great.   Went out again that night, and then it was off to Amsterdam.

Amsterdam was a lot more beautiful than I expected, as that wasn't the primary reason for booking it.  After booking the hostel, the first stop was to a 'coffee shop' :)  It was really a weird experience coming from the US to walk into this place and be presented with a lengthy list of choices so nonchalantly.  Since I was in Amsterdam, I figured I'd do it right... so I picked up a bag of the most recent Cannabis Cup winner (apparently this was pretty rare stuff.), it was the most expensive they had, but still pretty cheap.   This stuff got me absolutely smashed, the whole Amsterdam trip is still kinda a blur.   I ended up just chilling at the hostel's bar most of the night playing pool (there were around 30 others, around my age doing the same).  But I ended talking to this former US Marshall, who spent around 10 years on the job, saving $125,000, and just deciding to leave everything behind in America to travel the world until all his money ran out.   Definitely an interesting character, it was certainly weird getting completely blasted with the guy.

I was in such a haze while in Amsterdam, that I lost a day.   I planned on taking an overnight ferry back to London the day before my flight so I wouldn't miss the flight.  Well, I arrived at the ferry station completely out of it, only to be told that my ferry left the day before.  I was freaked the fuck out.  I got completely lucky though, the lady at the counter saw how horrified I was, and called the boat which was supposed to have left a half hour ago, and asked them to reopen the doors to let me get a ride to London.   She didn't charge me anything, and I was given a suite on the boat.   That was the best night's sleep I had the whole trip.

Woke up the next day, got off the boat, went to 2 more museums, the big ben, the london eye, and got on the plane back to America.

So in the end, I'm glad I bought that non-refundable ticket to just see 'what would happen', and would recommend anyone else in a similar position to do the same.

1) couchsurfing.org - I did this in seattle and it was great

2) Investigate work visa's.  I am an Aussie and got one in the USA and the UK.

3) Research various travel websites and with all the free time you'll have. Investigate different dates, times, places etc.  I used orbitz.com, kayak.com, bing.com/travel, priceline.com, zuji.com.au, lastminute.com.  Can't remember if I used others.  You can find absolutely AMAZING deals if you are willing to search for them. For me and my partner we got return flights to NYC from Chicago and 5 nights in a 4 1/2 star holiday inn near chinatown with early flights in and late flights out (i.e. whole days to see more on each end) for $500 US each.  Looking at flights on there own they were $250.

4) In each city, look if there are cheaper ways to use public transport.  E.g. weekly tickets in NYC or even in england you can go to thetrainline.co.uk and purchase long distance tickets cheaper than you can at the station and you can pick them up at the ticket machine.

5)  If you don't have a particular order of cities you want to see, play around with different orders.  I was in Chicago and wanted to go to Montreal first and then Seattle and greyhound it down to san fran and LA and then fly back to Chicago.  I saved about $600 Going 
Chicago -&gt; Montreal -&gt; LAX -&gt; San Fran -&gt; Seattle -&gt;Chicago 
instead of 
Chicago -&gt; Montreal -&gt; Seattle -&gt; San Fran -&gt; LA -&gt; Chicago

6) Look into camping sites.  Even if you don't have a tent, many camp sites actually provide a room/cabin and it can cost much cheaper than a hotel and is not always far from the major city.

7) In Europe check out http://www.busabout.com/.  You can get an open ticket which you can hop on and hop off wherever you like on the routes.

8) Look for different ways to travel besides the usual plane/train.  We got a ferry from venice to greece for a fraction of the price of a flight.  Mind you we slept on deck in our sleeping bags but if you can handle that (and the occasional rain sprinkle lol) then you will save a lot of money.

9) Don't be afraid of other languages.  I caught trains in Poland with only rudimentary Polish and I saved a tonne of money travelling first class from the north to the south.

10) Be very mindful of taxi's in many cities.  The one constant was how quick they want to rip you off when they find out you're a tourist.  Hell even a london taxi driver at 3am swapped a few pound coins for 20p coins when he handed it to me through the passenger window and drove off.  Sometimes it pays to have small amounts of cash in your wallet and show them up front and ask if it'll be enough.  If you decide on price up front you can save a few dollars.  A lot easier to do on trips you may need to do regularly.

11) Search for coupons and deals when planning.  For example when I booked greyhound from LA -&gt; San Fran -&gt; Seattle... I found a deal site telling where members said you can sign up for a free membership and get a discount on your first trip.  That on top of the 21-day advanced trip, I managed to travel up the whole west coast for around 60-80 bucks.

Shit... That's all I can think of.  I just finished travelling for the last 2 years so it's still pretty fresh :D  Did the same thing.  Graduated and wanted to see the world before settling.  The hardest is re-establishing yourself and getting a job when you get back.

The Tea Party did a good job of making itself out to be a fringe group of rational people that want to restore the constitution, and it suckered in these housewives and dickless suits who want to feel important and act like a 'revolutionary'. 

Until Americans stop being self entitled spoiled little brats who love being patronized and pandered to, they will continue to elect officials that constantly blow smoke up their collective asses but honestly have no intention of making the country a better place for the common man. 

These are not even hard times in the States, they just think it is because there are some minor inconveniences in their plush daily lives.

Yes. It took me 24 months after I got my B.A. (2 years of living at home, minus 4 months I was abroad ""trying/failing out"" grad school), but I am now teaching in Korea. I've been here for 8 months and have really enjoyed the experience. However, I'd traveled quite a bit before I came to Korea and I grew up in a predominantly Asian town, so the culture shock wasn't as much as it was for people I know. I know some people, mostly from New Zealand and South Africa, who STILL haven't adjusted to being in Korea, even after 8 months. Packing up and moving to Korea was the first traveling abroad they'd ever done.

So, my advice to you is to take it in steps unless you're one of the best-adjusted people you know. Take a month and go backpacking around Europe (novice) or Southeast Asia (less novice) or South America (even less novice). See how you like that, see what you learn about yourself. 

Write about your experiences. I got started documenting my travels when my mom first took me to Europe at the age of 11. I still have those journals and look back at them occasionally (13 years later). I have notebooks from my month I spent in Paris in 2007 and read those sometimes.

See, when there is only one representative per electoral district, there will always be huge incentives for smaller parties to merge. Assume, for example, that in a random Californian electoral district the democratic party split into the ""democrats"" and the ""progressive democrats"", and that each party gets roughly 30 % each, leaving the republicans with 40 %. In the current system, this means the republicans win the electoral district, and the remaining 60 % of the voters will not have any representative at all.  Obviously, the two democratic parties would hate having the republicans in power more than each other, and to have any power at all they would merge. Any 5% party would of course never get any influence at all. (Also, a ""fun fact"": In the UK/American model a party can win control of the parliament with ~25% of the vote, since they only need 50.01% of the votes in 51% of the states).

The obvious solution to this is to do like in Europe (except for Britain) and make it so that there are several - let's say 20 - representatives per electoral district. This way a party with 30 % of the votes could get 30 % of the representatives, and a party with 5 % of the votes could get 5 % of the representatives. This is arguably much better than today, where 49% of the votes will give you precisely zero representatives.

In most European nations they have also introduced a couple of representatives that are awarded to the party that has the most disproportional ratio of %vote/%representatives. In Norway we call this a ""leveling seat"". For example, if a party has 4 % of the vote but only 2% of the representatives this party receives a leveling seat to make it all more representative of the vote.

One reason why the American system has been so dominated by parties is that it really wasn't designed to have parties in the first place; the founders had imagined that each place would simply send the guy the most trusted local citizen to the congress, and that would be it; no ""factions"" as Jefferson called it, no politicking etc. That failed pretty hard, but that's another story...",False,1426550920,c14bywl,t3_e0kt8,64,True,64,0

That kind of statement would need to be based on the entire gene sequence, not just the y chromosome (or mitochondrial dna for that matter). A lot of eastern european women could easily have bred with the ashkenazis to the point where the middle eastern genetic material is a small minority of the total, yet an entirely middle eastern y-chromosome is still present. 

That is why wikipedia is not a reputed source.

An example, my ancestry is 100% southern italian, yet somehow my y chromosome contains markers that are extremely specific to native americans and siberians (i believe over 95% of people with this marker fall into one of those two groups).

I would suggest instead visit [the Chinese version](http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/pds/wjdt/fyrbt/) using Google Translate or other similar services, or simply search news using keyword ""Ma Zhaoxu"" (the current head spokesperson).

Generally though, we never seem to directly suggest any policies or solutions for other countries. The most common reply to Sino-US relationship is ""We suggest the US deal with their own myriads of issues instead of budging into ours."" and ""We do not fuck with you so please don't fuck with us.

Take [this](http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/t761430.htm) for example:

&gt; Q: Some political leaders from the US and Europe are calling for the RMB to appreciate at a faster pace. How do you respond?

&gt; A: On the RMB exchange rate, I suggest you carefully study [Premier Wen Jiabao's speech at the 6th China-EU Business Summit](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/07/c_13545683.htm), in which Premier Wen Jiabao elaborated on the issue.

&gt; In this era of globalization, we are all in the same boat. RMB appreciation cannot solve the issue of US trade deficit or reverse the imbalance in the world economy. This is simple and clear. In 2009, China's contribution to world economy accounted for 50%. Would it be a blessing or curse if a forced RMB appreciation brings crisis to China's economy?

&gt; Our determination is unswerving to push forward the reform of RMB exchange rate formation mechanism. The reform is to develop a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market demand and supply with reference to a basket of currencies, to gradually allow more flexibility in the yuan exchange rate while maintaining its basic stability on a reasonable and balanced level.

As far as I know the only countries in the world that don't have traditional capitalist market economies are North Korea and Cuba, and even Cuba isn't too far removed from that model.  

&gt;I'm fairly certain the majority of developing countries are riddled with government and the governments are usually incredibly corrupt as well.

""Riddled with government?""  What does that mean?  There's nothing about capitalism that precludes a strong and powerful government.  In fact most of the most successful capitalist countries in history have had strong, powerful governments that intervened in the economy.  Of course, this is also an unsubstantiated statement, since many developing countries have had to shred their social safety nets and privatize government services and infrastructure due to IMF and World Bank structural adjustment plans.  ""Corruption"" also does not preclude a capitalist economy.

&gt;As with most things in modern human history, a government with too much power is responsible for most ills of humanity. 

Asserted with no evidence, but that's beside the point: This doesn't have anything to do with whether or not a country is capitalist.

&gt;Africa and South America are fairly solid examples of large governments with much power riddled with corruption.

""Africa"" and ""South America"" aren't countries that have governments.

&gt;Correlation does not imply causation. Do you truly think that under a communist or socialist system things would be any different? History has shown us that in fact things are far worse, there'd probably be much more wide spread starvation.

Actually history has *not* shown that.  There were famines in the Soviet Union in its early years, which is hardly unusual given the circumstances (fresh out of a civil war, huge political power struggles, drastic reorganization of society), but there were no significant famines in the Soviet Union after WWII.  Even the nations that the Soviet Union ""colonized"" in Eastern Europe and Central Asia were much better off than capitalist-aligned Third World countries today.  And history has not shown us that things would be ""far worse"" under a socialist system.  History has shown us that certain socialist countries have suffered failures at certain times and places.  It has also shown us that capitalism has suffered failures at certain times and places.  The fact that the Soviet Union failed at x thing at y time does not indicate that another hypothetical socialist country will fail at z thing at w time.

You're right, correlation is not causation.  That's why I don't say that just because people starve while capitalism is dominant it's capitalism's fault.  I say it's capitalism's fault because one can point to specific ways in which the global market destroys local Third World economies for the benefit of the developed world.

Also there doesn't need to be ""causation"" to prove the point I was arguing in what you quoted.  The guy claimed socialism was inherently prone to starvation, which is an absurd claim when one can point to specific mass famines that have occurred under capitalist governments and mass Third World famine that exists today under capitalism and continues unabated.

I could just as easily say that the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and any other country that could conceivably be used as an example of socialism isn't a real socialist country and therefore any criticisms of socialism based on those countries is invalid.

The most successful capitalist country (the U.S.) had quite a small government prior to the 1930s. But I will concede what you have to say, I'll state this though: without protection from coercion and fraud there cannot exist a capitalist economy. 

&gt;Africa and South America are countries? Wow, I had no idea. lol

You're being pedantic, I was referring to to the countries in South America and Africa tend to have similarities to the countries on the specific continents.

&gt;So no evidence then? Cool.

I gave evidence further below.

&gt;Your statement that this is the natural state of man in this context implies that these people are poor and starving ""naturally"" and capitalism has nothing to do with it. This is something you have to prove, given the fact that in our globalized, industrialized world, no one lives in a Darwinian vacuum.

It's simple, ancient man spent the majority of their time constantly looking for food and were obviously quite poor. Is this hard to understand?

&gt;So your best example of capitalism at work is a state where the government is heavily involved in the economy, even though you say this isn't real capitalism. Whoops! Your argument became completely incoherent quite suddenly!

The government was not as heavily involved when G.B. still had control of it. There aren't many examples now days of absolute free markets. But in general the most successful economies are the ones where the government is most hands off and don't chose winners and losers.

&gt;So you're saying people were better off under the Tsar and the Qing/KMT than they were under the Bolsheviks or the CCP? Are you sure about that? How do you define better off?

:::Backstory that you need to know but no one wants to read (I’ll try to make this quick):::
 
I was in Nigeria for business. Working for an indigenous oil and gas company whose owner is a well-established millionaire. The day I was going to leave Nigeria, he insists we have a dinner party at his house. Important: This man’s company does a lot of business with us so it was really important that this dinner went well. To add to the pressure, he was flying his family from the UK to Nigeria just for the purpose of attending this dinner. He has a son, Abu, who is about my age. The dinner was at 8:00PM and Abu offers to show me around Lagos before the dinner.
 
...This is where the story begins! 

It was a hot and muggy Saturday afternoon in Lagos, the city smog was thick and the sun’s light seemed to shy away from the gritty streets like a scared puppy in the corner of a dark room. Abu picked me up from the office in his nice, new, all custom, Range Rover. With an exterior as black as the night and interior as white as the arctic snow, this vehicle stood as an artistic statement of power and class. Abu did his best to weave in and out of the corners of the city, the Range Rover’s gleam a stark contrast to the squalor all around us. After driving for about 30mins, he asks me in a thick, almost timeless, British accent, “would you like to stop and get a drink?”. Sick of the Lagos traffic and dehydrated from eating nothing but peanuts all day, I replied, “sounds awesome”. 

We pull up to what looked like an iron wall, Abu beeps the horn twice and, like the doors to Oz, the iron wall opens to reveal what can only be described as a luxury hotel at the center of hell. Abu pulls in and parks the Range Rover in line with two Porsches and a Maserati. The worlds of luxury and elegance combine as we enter the marble halls of this hotel. We’re greeted by the owner who promptly escorts us to a table out by the pool. The liver shaped pool seemed to boast arrogantly with its edges adorned by an array of supple European women, each a beauty queen in her own right. The hotel owner sat before us two perfectly prepared drinks and joined us for what turned into 2hrs of conversation about art, business, philosophy, and why bacon goes with everything. 

Having lost track of time, Abu tells me we’ve got to hurry back as the dinner will start at 8PM sharp. We bid the hotel owner adieu, I slam the rest of my drink down, and frolic off back into the comfort of the Range Rover’s soft cloud equate interior. As we’re cursing along the freeway, I sit quietly trying to mentally prep myself for the dinner ahead while Abu drones on about something to do with microwaves and the environment blah blah. The Range Rover glides over the dilapidated freeway without a bump when, out of no where, deep inside the chamber of my bowels, a bump is indeed felt. Uncomfortably I shift in my seat. My eyes begin to aimlessly search the crisp interior of the car as my mind tries to understand what’s brewing within. The seconds start to seem like hours as what feels like a deranged prisoner locked inside the walls of my stomach begins to try to pound his way out – with an ever growing intensity.
 
I’ve always been one to believe that a disciplined mind can control the body. So I told myself, “I’m not going to let this happen, there is too much at stake”. Quickly this battle cry is silenced by the black hole that is wrenching my insides. Category-5 waves of “almost vomit” slam against the levees of my throat, each one causing my cool and calm outward composure to breakdown more and more. Not wanting to really open my mouth, under my breath I quietly ask, “hey Abu, can you please pull over”. He looks at me, slightly confused, and says, “we’re only 10mins from the house”. I say, “look, I really got take a leak, pull over”. Half-heartedly he pulls over to a patch of ground which fonts a small village and is flanked by a barely standing cement wall. At this point I’m feeling dizzy, with shaky hands I quickly exit the Range Rover and stumble over to the cement wall. I press my sweaty head against the wall, whip out the ol’ elephant trunk, and try to take a leak. I take a few deep breaths, just trying to regain control, when I completely BLACKOUT!
 
The next thing I know I’m laying flat on my back and I can hear Abu yelling my name and telling me to “please wake up”. I open my eyes and see him above me, there are tears streaming down his face, he say, “thank god, I thought you died!”. I don’t say anything, still light headed I sit up. Abu has both his hands on my shoulders, he is shaking me and asking if I’m ok. I try to answer but instead of words the only thing that exits my mouth is an exorcist style stream of peanut based vomit. Poor Abu takes it directly to the chest. I can still see the whole thing in slow motion, even though the blow mainly hit his chest, his head snapped back, his eyes shut, and like something out of the Matrix he falls to the ground a few feet away.
 
Still reeling from the aftershock of what just happened, I lean forward onto my knees (kind of in a “doggy style” position). Dizzy and confused, I look down, kinda between my legs, and realize the ivory tusk is still out, draggn’ ground. Behind it, I can see a few villagers have gathered around. From the looks on their faces it’s clear that they’re in shock - guess that stereotype about white guys isn’t true after all! Whatever, can’t focus on that, before I even get a chance to smirk about it I blackout once more, collapse, and throw-up again. I awake with the right side of my face coated in the remainder of whatever peanuts where still in my stomach. However, at this point I’m feeling like a million bucks. I hop up onto my feet, zip up any still exposed body parts (much to the villagers dismay), and walk back over to the Range Rover where Abu is using a towel to get the peanut mix out of his shirt. I stroll over to the passenger door, open it, and with a big smile on my face say, “don’t we have dinner plans?”. I sit down with a squish, oops, the white interior!

t1_c14ch8r,t1_c14c1m4,0,1288803738,0,,,t5_2cneq,,politics,True,tjl2015,"I can balance the budget in five points:

1. Raise income taxes in some way. Either let the Bush tax cuts expire (raising revenues by adjusting the marginal rates) or severely limit the vast amount of deductions people can take. Those various deductions add up to about 1 trillion every year. Cutting them in half would bring in 500 billion a year without raising the marginal tax rates.

2. Restore the Reagan balance to social security. When they set the payroll tax limit (only applied to the first ~$110,000 or so of income, indexed to inflation), that tax was applied to 90% of income. As the nation's income has become more top-heavy, it now is only applied to 80% of the income. It's really no mystery why Social Security is hurting. 

3. Dramatically reduce military spending. We spend $700 billion a year on the military. Our closest rival, China, spends $70 billion a year. We can cut the budget by half and still spend 5 times what they do. So I say do it. End the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, truly support the troops by bringing them home. Let Europe, Japan, and South Korea pay for their own damn defense, we're going broke over here. 

4. Medical care: allow Medicare/Medicaid to reimport drugs and negotiate drug prices. Establish a public option set at Medicare rates plus some percent. Yes, the doctors and drug companies wouldn't like this. But fundamentally, someone has to receive less money if we are to balance the budget. I would rather make Medicare more efficient than slash its coverages. 

5. There are some other expenses right now that are really high - food stamps and unemployment insurance. But these will decrease as the economy improves. 

That's it. We have a 1.3 trillion dollar deficit right now. A good chunk of that is just the bad economy (less revenues and higher unemployment and food stamp costs), but maybe 600-800 billion of it is structural, independent of the economy. We could comfortably bring in another 500 billion in income and social security taxes. We could shave a few hundred billion off of the pentagon, and those medical reforms could probably save 100 billion a year. 

These are rough estimates, but you can see that there are significant areas to save money. There are enough ways to bring in extra revenue and cut spending to completely balance the budget. But you are right, the SS+MEDI+Defense+Interest is where you need to look. You're not going to balance the budget by shutting down the EPA or cutting NASA's budget.

I was in charge of doing maintenance to some servers of a very busy call center that handled customer service for a few companies. We had different IVRs for 4 or 5 different locations, configured in an active/active failover. Incoming calls come from the PBX to either server. To do maintenance we had to disable the server from some management application, otherwise calls might come to that one and the user would get a ""technical problem, please call again"" message. The service was 24h all over the world so even if they were not in prime time we had to make sure calls could always go through (client requirement, of couse)

It was around noon in the US and I had to fix some shit on the European servers. So I just open the application to reroute the european calls, do the failover, do some test calls, check the status and everything seems ok. Time to RDP to the now standby server. I ran some patches, change some settings, and proceed to reboot the server. The naming convention was xxIVR01 or 02 and xx was the location (US, EU, LA, etc).

I open up a terminal and do a ping to see the server coming up. Maybe some 30 seconds into it I noticed that the server is still replying, but the other application says the server is in fact offline. Something's wrong. Hmmmm.....

You know that feeling when you realize what just happened, that sweet sweet agony of discovering what the problem is (and how to solve it) but at the same time realizing that you just did something incredibly stupid?

Because the server name was very similar, I RDP'd to USIVR01 instead of EUIVR01. I took down the US server during prime time. USIVR02 picked up but it could handle all the load. That's not it, the changes I made on USIVR01 for some reason fucked up USIVR02 too, so now ALL incoming calls were being dropped. In those 10 to 15 minutes it took to reboot the server, undo the changes and bring it back up a few hundred calls were lost, dropping the SLA of several clients and getting some managers pissed off.

fun times.

You're not quite right. They might mean a lot, depending on what you mean by ""mean"".

From a biological perspective, yes, we're pretty much the same kind of organisms. No one doubts this.

I'd also agree that from an ethical perspective, race *ought* to mean nothing in an ideal world.

BUT. The reality is that your race and nation DOES mean a lot when it comes to the stereotypes you'll be associated with, the opportunities you're exposed to, the social pressures you're subjected to by your immediate family circles and I'd argue EVEN the image and expectations you have of yourself. For example, being white has very concrete advantages even in an egalitarian society like the USA. There are certain things that you are expected do and certain things that you don't. Ditto for being Asian, Black, and so on.

How often have we heard statements like, oh, the Japanese have very high standards for quality; the Europeans tend to be cultured; the Arabs are hyper-religious and conservative, or that the Chinese are hard working and collectivist.

    * Can you grow your own weed in your garden?

* nope. But I'm quite glad I don't have to. I do have to get my sister / big sister/brother of a friend to get it for me. I'm not 18 yet, and the shops are pretty strict. It's annoying, but that's nowhere near as bad as buying on the street, tough.

* I've never actually done it, but yeah, you can. It's not allowed, nor is it in amsterdam (Amsterdam is merely a city in the netherlands, the exact same laws apply here in Eindhoven) but the police will only take any kind of action if there are children and/or old people around. The action is no more than a request to smoke elsewhere, preferably inside. I usually smoke with the same people, and we try not to bother anyone. That's harder to control when high, so we stay inside when we do it, mostly. Also, I bake more often than I smoke.

*  I don't do it, and I don't really know anyone that does, but yeah, it'd be possible. It's legal to own and harvest up to ~~three~~ five plants.

*  It's not, portugal has a comparable system. Even more lenient, or so I heard. I'm not an expert on the subject.

*  No. Never experienced or even heard of them, really. I'm sure it happens, but rarely. Violence because of alcohol abuse is much worse. Doesn't happen often, but on saturdaynights, it does.

You propose worse case scenario, with no middle ground that is more likely to happen (which is what I argue for). Like I said, we're not seeing the end of the world. 

1) Regarding GDP, CPI and infl/deflation - I'm not a big fan of defense spending, I'll leave that. I think it should be gutted.

But, when BR sells a shirt made in another country, the Gap company makes a profit off that. That money goes to the US. I'm not sure what nothing you're talking about, that looks like a growth in capital (profit). They actually export quite a bit and help our trade deficit. What credit do you give to the American marketers or financiers or strategists that made the business possible? Or the designers to design the clothes? It's not all about the gain / loss of manufacturing labor -.- 

I'm not sure how you think businesses run, but the actual product they produce is never their strength (what lets them compete with other companies). If the best product can't be competitive in the market, it will fail.

I do agree that the CPI is out dated. I don't think Americans buy half the stuff on the list anymore anyways, but - America has seen an enormous increase in purchasing power with modern trade over the last 20 years. The average person can consume so much more than before (and I'm not talking about driving up debt). It has never been easier to go to do things like go to college, own your house/ car, buy a wide arrange of groceries, all that cheap shit from Walmart, travel the world, etc. We also have very low sales taxes compared to the rest of the developed world, making whatever inflation we do see almost irrelevant. Americans do need to and are changing their spending habits as a result of the financial crisis. Savings has gone up!

2) comparing USD to Gold. Oy, everyone likes to do this. Look how much gold you could buy in 1910 with 1 inflation adjusted dollar! Gold is just a commodity. It isn't commonly bought or used by consumers like eggs are, so why are you comparing our dollar to it? It's a globally traded extravagance (perceived value)/ tech commodity. Gold is so god awfully high right now due to speculation, just like oil was when it hit $4.00/ gal and then crashed. If this were true, the value of our dollar would have been cut in half during the crisis, except everyone else's currency tanked harder so we actually came out ahead. Capital goes where returns are highest [for a risk adjusted rate]. Investors think gold will offer them a higher return, and the stock markets are too risky and won't offer a good enough return. As the stock markets pick up, people will dump gold and go back into the stock markets and gold will crash, yada yada Bubble you think is a myth. 

3) Chinese Yuan vs USD - um, first off it's a fixed currency. Real value not changed. Secondly, we WANT it to appreciate vs the USD so our exports can be more competitive globally because the actual value of the Yuan is significantly higher than the set amount now. China plays dirty by fixing their currency to ours lower than it's market value is. Thirdly, it's the fastest growing economy, and a developing country - where do you expect it's currency to go? Down? It's not like China started on a level playing field with us like the Euro or Pound. It's a high demand, low supply currency at the moment that's valued way too low.

As for the Aussies, good for them. Haven't really heard much news on their economy, so I don't really have a comment.

4) The EU is kind of fucked right now in case you missed the incidents with Greece, France, UK and Germany? Their currency was valued too high for a while crippling their exports too. Not sure they were a great example... Like I said about China, they cheat to drive their export market and growth. If it was correctly valued it would curb their exports significantly and they would be hurting like everyone else. They get huge amounts of pressure now from pretty much everyone to let the markets value their currency.

5) Credit and capital. Credit is actually capital + the cost of the capital. Your definition of capital doesn't really apply to companies, and I don't think you know how business financing works do you? I'm talking about business financing. You're talking about Personal Savings. HUGE DIFFERENCE. I'm all for our population saving. I'm also for our businesses OPERATING.

Businesses run on capital from 2 sources - Debt and Equity. Since most small to mid sized companies are private, they run on debt, usually from banks, family or friends, or even loans from them selves they one day intend to pay back. The debt allows them to operate, and hopefully make enough after the cost of debt (interest rate) to support themselves (or get rich!) [As you get into public companies, you balance debt (cheap, risky) with equity (costly, not as risky)] Please please PLEASE don't say debt is bad in business! It is totally different from *personal debt* which I don't like.

The biggest problem we're having right now is small to mid sized companies aren't getting any credit. This means they don't have enough capital to operate, or start up, or pay their bills, and their growth stops and they start to die.

I'm not sure how you got Keynsian out of financing. Keynsian is the theory Government should spend where it's economy is lacking no? Not relevant.

6) Openly devaluing the dollar - you missed my word ""stable."" It's a balance. We want a lowER currency, but a stable one. We want to do this to an extent because it's hugely successful in China. They get crazy growth for having a crazy currency, but they cheat too. We can't really cheat. The market still sets our currency prices. 

You don't really seem like an economist, and definitely not a financier. I see a big trend of that here. The more I understand about the two topics, the more respect I have for the decisions made by the Fed. They weren't perfect and some people get hurt, but they really aren't that bad and probably the best ones that could be made at the time. There are definitely people smarter than us working there trying their hardest. We are not as fucked as you think.

The biggest impact you will see is from your state regulations, and then cities openness to big corporations. States most heavily regulated are doing shitty now (MI, CA) and we're doing reasonably well in TX (especially being in San Antonio with USAA, Rack Space, Valero, NuStar, Toyota, etc..) Heavy state regulations not only hinder companies already there, but also deter others from setting up shop in your state.

The fact is, (actually at the top of my head really), there are really virtually no large scale projects since the fall of communism in the country. From nuclear reactors, to dams, etc. Everything stays from communism and either people are trying to conjure up the money to maybe maintain it, or simply, I guess to try and improve on projects like that.

One example is we have a beautiful interesting sculpture in the center of the capital in front of our ""National Palace of Culture."" Amazing structure but for 20 years now they can't restore it. It's quite pathetic.

Right now there's some pretty frightening rhetoric about secularism being in opposition to religious belief. Reinforcing this notion is only likely to make those people more afraid and more likely to listen to the Pat Robertson's of the world rather than the experts.

I know we like to get our hate on for religions out there and it can be pretty upsetting when the news media promotes crazy book burners and ignores moderate, peace loving believers like President Carter but really this is the law. Secularism lets everyone believe whatever crazy stuff they want to and at the same time it keeps them from passing laws that explicitly favor their religious beliefs.

Rather than making this into a case of secularism vs religion. I'd say that people should make an endeavour to point out how separation of church and state allows people to practice their religion free from government intervention. If the world is becoming less religious would they feel comfortable with an atheist or Mormon passing laws which prevent them from following their personal beliefs?

My reason for this belief is based on two facts: Jewish DNA clusters closest to Kurds and Armenians (both descended from the Hurrians). Likewise, something called the Tikunani prism was discovered. Its older than the Israelite nation or any conception of a ""Hebrew people"". The Hurrians were described as ""Habiru"" [the generic term from which Hebrew derives] and had names that were distinctly Hebraic. Once again, these Hurrians were from a time-period older than the Israelites. So, based on DNA, the Tikunani prism and a number of other circumstantial facts, I'd wager that they were NOT ""semites"" at all in origin, but Hurrian. Hurrians who (as we know from history) swept down into the Middle East and eventually adopted a Semitic language (just as Jews would later adopt Indo-European languages [like Ladino or Yiddish].) Their language has changed a dozen times within recorded history--from proto-Canaanite to Hebrew to Aramaic to the aforementioned Ladino to Yiddish. There's no reason to assume that Hebrew was their ""first language,"" or that adopting a ""Semitic tongue"" turned them into Semites. DNA places their origins in the Northern Middle East among the Armenians and Kurds, not in the South with Arabs. But no matter. . . .

Though I believe that Hebrews were Hurrians, who mixed in with aboriginal Canaanites (and were later watered down with proto-Greek groups from the People of the Sea), I still think they're a fascinating group . . . even if they're not [and probably never were] ""Semites"".

Take the case of this bomb maker ( the Chicago bound bombs) in Yemen. Does it make sense for the US to ignore him, simply because he is a citizen? Does he get a free pass? That's insane. If you can, you take him out, most likely with a drone.

&gt;You've got to be joking. We've got to trust that a government which assassinates US citizens without trial is going to be ambivalent? One thing the founding fathers of this country didn't trust is the government, that's why the Constitution exists. Otherwise, we could just make it up as we go along..

So your premise is nothing should be secret, and the president should be powerless to pursue national defense without some appointed judge?
If that were how war and self defense was pursued we'd be worshipping Hirohito or Hitler.

&gt;They CLEARLY don't have the evidence necessary to say that it's a national security matter, otherwise they would have presented it to a judge instead of claiming state secrets.

Yes, Patton patiently waited to be sure a judge approved his campaign across Europe because American lives were a stake. What is clear is that a judge has no jurisdiction here.

&gt;Really, what's hyperbolic about it? Stalin killed ""enemies of the people"" without trials (sometimes there were also sham trials for extremely well known individuals). The US government is claiming it has the power to assassinate US citizens without trial. What's the difference? That not many people have been assassinated by the US but many were assassinated by Stalin? Stalin didn't start his assassinations in 1920 after the revolution. First he established a power base, then the assassinations started. You propose we continue giving the government more power and hope and pray they don't use it against us even though history has shown they always do and even in the US they do?

What is the difference between Stalin and Obama? Hmmm, let me think about that for a moment......

&gt;Suppose your relative has been targeted for death, say your son. You want to challenge this. You sue the government. The government says ""we don't need to present any evidence to anyone, if we want, we can assassinate your son, who is a US citizen, at and time and we will as soon as we find him"" - that's the situation that the parents of this guy are in. That seems ok to you?

If my son was in Yemen making airliner bombs?  Yes.

&gt;Tell me, if the US government can assassinate you without a trial, what good are your rights? What good is your right to free speech if the US government can say ""speak all you want but if we find you, you're dead?"" How about your other rights? Which of them stay intact?

First, anyone can assassinate me without a trial, including the local crack head. Second, you are begining to rave. Obama and even Bush were not on a rampage to eliminate political enemies. I suggest you read a little about Lenin and his rise and the politics of Russia and then study our form of democracy and compare the two. 

Then I suggest you calm down a bit.

Take a deep breath and look into the history of the OSS and CIA, and even the FBI. Yes, they have done some ugly things. Some of it very scary. There is nothing to guarantee we will not fall into some despotic form of government, except our national experiences and rhetoric. It is ultimately the people who choose the government they will live under or won't. Even Stalin's tough regime died with him. 

I have no problem with suing the state, Obama or whomever to put this through the courts. In my old age I don't think this will get anywhere or even believe that it should, but it is important to keep arguing about it. Vigilence is the most important part of democracy that doesn't appear in the Constitution.

Germany on Drugs: NO

&gt;Germany alone practices a dual system of harsh repression and an ""accepting"" drug policy. The repression includes determinant sentences, prison detention, even including the cannabis consumer. Probation and parole are only given under the condition of a ""voluntary consent"" to undergo a long term treatment program in specialised drug free programs. That means at least 9 months of confinement in remotely located, closed institutions. In fact this represents a system of forced therapy.  [link](http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/boll1.html)

German Taxes [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Germany)

The rate of value-added tax rate generally in force in Germany is 19%
Marginal Tax rate of 14-24% and upwards of 45% for the very richest. 

So Germany isn't any more free in regards to taxation than the United States. But they do allow gay marriage yet have fairly strict drug laws.

Is Germany more free  than the United States? Fuck no. Unless of course you are gay, but even then you have to provide all sorts of information and pay all sorts of fees and regulations. 

Germany is in no way more free than the United States. I can continue researching and find even more examples if you like. 

As for Sweden, their taxes are incredibly high. 

And lets look at drugs.. [link](http://www.cannabislegal.de/international/se-yates.htm)

&gt;The anti drug laws have got progressively more severe over the years and are now the hardest in Europe. Police give drug violations top priority and Sweden **is the only country in the European Union that has criminalized drug use as well as possession.** Passing a joint counts as trafficking and carries a mandatory prison sentence and drug violations are regularly given harsher sentences than other crimes, including crimes of violence.  

Gay Marriage: YES

Noticing a trend so far? Both Germany and Sweden have tough drug laws and high taxes but they allow for gay marriage. 

Iceland.. well there is one country I can agree with but they also have quite a few economic problems thanks to the massive debt they accumulated. They once believed in smaller government and lower taxes but not so much today. 

And South Korea.. [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_South_Korea)

&gt;Same-sex marriage is not legally-recognized in South Korea. Homosexuality is strongly criticized in mainstream Korean society, and many Koreans consider homosexuality to be a Western phenomenon.

South Korea also has VERY strict drug laws. 

Not to burst your bubble or anything, but the examples you provided are not any more free than people living in the United States. 

You can argue that in certain areas there are fewer restrictions. Gay marriage and drug laws seem to be two areas where many countries in Europe provide more freedom. But not that much. 

The one freedom that the United States once had above all other countries was economic freedom. And that freedom has been fading steadily since the 1970's.

I'm only a Freshman, but it's been pretty awesome so far. You can concentrate in tech or business, so if you want to be on the creative side you can do technology and do production, engineering, and scoring for picture. If you want to do the management side you do business. You don't declare until after sophmore year, so you learn a lot about both aspects. All the professors are from the industry so there's a lot of valuable advice coming from experience and you get connections. Plus they've all been great teachers so far. For example one of my teachers founded/owns Jade Tree Records which is a hugely influential indie/punk label. My Computer and Digital Applications teacher is in a techno band called Plastic Operator that is relatively successful (mostly in Europe). The A&amp;R teacher signed John Legend etc.

There's a lot of awesome extracurricular stuff to do too, both with the school and outside it. Our radio station was just named best college station of the year by CMJ and it's entirely student run. I'm currently working on become a DJ and also a production person for when we have live bands come in. I already got to help engineer for one of my favorite bands when they came in. In Philadelphia itself there's a great music scene, especially if you're into punk/indie music. I know a couple guys that are in the program/just graduated that run and book shows at a really great all ages space. The main thing the school advertises is the co-op program which is basically a mandatory internship. You can do anything related to your major, so you can work for a label, be an assistant in a studio, do live sound, book shows, whatever. The school tries to make sure you're not just getting coffee either. It helps you make connections and get your foot in the door which is super important for the industry where you're degree isn't going to really matter so much as what you can show you can do.

If you play there's a ton of opportunities to play too. Almost everyone I know is in a band or working on getting one together. You take a lot of music courses too. You're required to take at least guitar or piano I, and a few semesters of theory. Songwriting, ear training, and composition are also some required classes, especially for the tech track. A couple recent bands that have come out of the program include Algernon Cadwallader, the Wonder Years, and Chiddy Bang. If you want to make it as a musician, knowing how to negotiate contracts and record is going to be really important, and the connections you make won't hurt either.

This really comes off as an advertisement for my school, but I was in the same boat as you in high school (I'm assuming you're in high school) and am just really excited about this place. Tuition is expensive, but they give out a lot of aid and scholarships so its not a massive barrier. 

Edit: So I did a little internet stalking and found out from your band's myspace that you're from the west coast.

To address the absurdity of 100% inflation, it is actually more efficient for china the biggest holder of US debt to literally forgive it (reducing the US money supply), than to suffer the mass unemployment caused by a lack of demand from US consumers due to prices being too high.

I doubt it would come to that point as there is a potential for deflation (at the moment). If I wanted to make a risky bet, i'd go with 10% inflation (thats a bit crazy and risky) but whatever.

So your solution is to create what, maybe 100,000 low-wage, no-benefits jobs that does nothing more than encourage dumb consumerism?

If we're lucky?

I'm hardly a leftist here, nor am I very supportive of tax increases (for anyone), but this is just stupid. And I haven't even really delved that deeply.

First, we have to assume that there aren't already enough shoe stores that exist that can absorb all of that retail capacity without actually hiring. I'd be shocked if that were the case. So instead of creating jobs, you're just over-working the guy that gets paid minimum wage at Shoe Carnival.

What we're really looking at is that you want to cut taxes, and you're stretching to come up with after-the-fact rationalizations for doing so.

Second, if Shoe Carnivale does decide (against good sense) to hire 400 people across the nation, their wages won't be nearly enough to account for all the extra shoes you think will be sold. So, within 6-36 months, they'll all be shitcanned, and people who hold their stock will eat that mismanaged budget.

Third, if somehow this fits the old Ford saw ""pay them enough to buy the product"", how does this cascade back into more jobs? Ford had to buy steel from other companies, rubber/tires. People were put to work building roads to drive the damned things on. It's a dead end. Do you foresee some upswing in jogging coach jobs that isn't apparent to the rest of us?

Fourth, you're effectively training an entire generation at that point to be shitty little retail employees. Not that entrepreneurmanship has ever been encouraged, but you're hammering another nail in the coffin every year that goes past without a real and substantial economic recovery.

Fifth, you assume that a foreign shoe factory will even sell to the US. There's a lucrative Chinese market waiting to be born. There's all of Europe. Japan. Australia.

Sixth, don't go trying to sidestep your horrid abuse of logic by picking some other half-assed industry. This holds true for every consumer product, and your scenario falls flat for machine tools or any sort of heavy equipment.

Finally, you're ignoring the fact that we can't be a nation that makes nothing but buys everything that everyone else makes. Even if we score a few jobs selling the things in some sales lobby, that's not enough for the massive quantity of dollars that are flowing out of the country. By allowing that tax cut to happen, you're helping these failfucks sell us all downriver.

If we fail to be a nation that makes things, real actual tangible things... we're fucked. My children and grandchildren have to live with the consequences of that, even if yours will be able to attend the finest parties in Europe with the money your family managed to squirrel away while fucking us over.

I do know this - if any kids (including me) in my classes ever disrespected a teacher, they would be in seeeeeeerious shit back home and before even getting home (teachers could actually **discipline**). 

I will never forget the day my geography teacher [a subject that seems to not be held in high regard 'round these parts :-) ] showed us how he dealt with students who chewed gum in glass. He calmly walked over to the kid and extended his hand. The kid put the gum in the teacher's hand, who calmly proceeded to gently massage the gum into the kid's hair, all while continuing with the lesson. 
I don't think anyone chewed gum anywhere for a few days afterwards...

My history teacher, we never got to learn what his method was, but he did carry 2 dice with him that he would roll in complete silence if he saw you talking. People usually quieted down fast. Nobody ever got to find out exactly which dice combinations meant trouble, it'd be dead silent after the first 2 rolls. 

Kids are **not** this porcelain, fragile dolls that will shatter at the first attempt of discipline. Kids can live through some truly horrible stuff and come out OK, I doubt you disciplining them would cause lasting damage. But sure would bring back some quality control.

And by the amount of active conflicts, Earth is by far more peaceful than it has ever been.

&gt; By far the most warlike societies are those that preceded civilization. War killed as many as 25 percent of all pre-state people, a rate 10 times higher than that of the 20th century, estimates anthropologist Lawrence Keeley of the University of Illinois.

/.../

&gt; If the wars of the twentieth century had killed the same proportion of the population that die in the wars of a typical tribal society, there would have been two billion deaths, not 100 million.

/.../

&gt; Meanwhile, according to political scientist Barbara Harff, between 1989 and 2005 the number of campaigns of mass killing of civilians decreased by 90 percent.

/.../

&gt; According to the Human Security Brief 2006, the number of battle deaths in interstate wars has declined from more than 65,000 per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 per year in this decade. In Western Europe and the Americas, the second half of the century saw a steep decline in the number of wars, military coups, and deadly ethnic riots.

We're rapidly becoming a global society that denounces all kinds of wars.

The merchant class was almost non-existent in large swaths of Europe, so economies were basically stagnant, and improvement of one's domain was a zero-sum game, except in the case of marriage. (Hence the extraordinary amount of inbreeding in European royalty.)

The only real beacon of light in all the dark ages, ironically enough, was the Catholic church. The church maintained a continuity with the Greco-Roman tradition, and Latin was the language of kings and courts, thus carrying the seed that would eventually grow into the Renaissance. It was the bubonic plague that destabilized Europe to the point where a middle class could develop and economies could progress. That and colonization, which allowed Europeans to enrich themselves without necessarily stealing from their neighbors. With these came the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and eventually the Industrial Revolution.

Yes, the church opposed much progress, and I'm not going to defend its actions (Incidentally, I think, at present, it's one of the most morally bankrupt organizations on the planet.), but blaming the dark ages on it is silly.

Your tone/vibrato is fine and you seem to be in good control of your breathing instead of just shouting as a lot of people do when they reach up for slightly higher notes.  This doesn't go into the upper register much, but see my notes in the next paragraph about that.  It took a while to get used to your timing on the song itself - after listening to it a second time I understand what you were doing with the song but at first it just sounded like a complete mess, maybe try a little harder to hit your vocal notes right on the downbeat instead of being slightly off from the instrument so it all sounds tighter. 

Riff at 1:12 was off pitch (by western standards) - I assume you're a native arabic/indian speaker/singer?  (I'm not familiar with eastern-european musical cultures as to which stick to the 12-tone scale we're used to, I'd guess maybe Turkish from your voice/face but what the hell do I know) The riff itself felt like it just incorporated semitones that western ears aren't used to hearing and are out of place in this song.  The same for the slightly nasal quality of your voice - you seem to be singing through your nose a bit which other (Indian/arabic/etc) musical styles seem to embrace that doesn't necessarily sound good to a western ear.  It wouldn't hurt to try and work on not singing through your nose quite so much.

If you're going to be singing a lot of western music I'd be careful with that.  Don't completely strip those things out of your style as they make you unique, just be wary of the semitone riffs and overly nasal singing as they can be a turn-off for the casual western listener.

Generally speaking pitch-wise this was pretty damn good which is really the most important thing as far as singing goes.  I'd just work on expanding your range a bit to extend your comfort zone as you started making funny faces when you reached up into your middle-voice area for higher notes.

Pour répondre à la question sur les conditions, on voit souvent des jugements donnant une pension alimentaire avec un délai après lequel une révision des conditions devra être faite. C'est dans le cas où les deux époux ont la possibilité de travailler mais qu'un avait laissé sa job pour élever les enfants; on accorde une pension pour l'aider à garder le même rythme de vie en attendant, et on la révise après, disons, 6 mois ou 1 an.

Mais faut garder en tête que les pensions alimentaires pour les époux, c'est extrêmement rare. Pour les enfants, c'Est chose courante, mais strictement pour les époux, c'est vraiment vraiment rare qu'on l'accorde. Probablement parce que aujourd'hui les femmes travaillent et font un salaire qui leur permet de vivre décemment. Quand c'est accordé, c'est dans les cas de vieilles mères à la maison peu éduquées mariées à un richissime homme, c'est pas mal tout le temps ça. Quand les deux font entre 30 000 et 75 000$ chacun par an, ça donne vraiment pas souvent des pensions. Et oui, c'est plutôt la décision de rester à la maison qui donne ouverture à une pension, décision qu'on présume être conjointe. 

Dans les cas de couples richissimes, les pensions sont souvent à vie. Mais faut tenir compte que, en ce moment, on en donne juste pour des conjoints mariés qui, même si ça veut plus dire grand chose, se sont engagés pour la vie. Donc la femme a droit de s'attendre au même rythme de vie pour toujours. Je ne crois pas que ce soit interprété pareil pour des couples non mariés, je trouverais ça plutôt injuste dans les circonstances. Et puis, on met souvent la faute sur la femme qui profite de la situation en quittant, mais on oublie souvent le richissime homme qui a une dizaine de maitresse...

Malgré que je ne pratique pas en droit de la famille, c'est un sujet qui m'intéresse et ce que je sais provient surtout des cours que j'ai suivi. Donc faut pas prendre ce que je dis pour du cash non plus!

Pour le reste, c'est pas mal un choix social d'accorder des pensions qui sont plus que le strict minimum de survie. Le point étant que si le divorce laissait un époux sur le BS, les gens ne se divorceraient pas et endureraient peut-être des relations médiocres plus longtemps. Je ne connais pas toute l'historique des lois à ce sujet, mais si je me souviens bien, c'est vraiment en réaction aux conséquences des premières vagues de divorce. Les femmes ne possédaient rien et sortaient d'un mariage pauvres comme Job, alors qu'elle n'avaient pas eu le choix de se marier au départ. La situation a changé, le droit ne suit jamais aussi vite et j'ai un peu l'impression qu'on est dans une phase de ""calibrage"" en ce moment, si on peut dire ainsi...

Lance Selfa's [*The Democrats: A Critical History*](http://www.amazon.com/Democrats-Critical-History-Lance-Selfa/dp/1931859558) makes a detailed argument about this, and [this review on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YANWV85PDQHK/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1931859558&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;tag=&amp;linkCode=) goes into some detail about the arguments the book makes.

EDIT: Reproducing the relevant part of the review:
&gt;In the remaining chapters of the book, Selfa turns his attention from the nature of the party and its current trajectory to focusing on the Democratic Party's (abusive) relationship with social movements, unions, and the organized left. He starts with the Populist movement that united black and white sharecroppers in the rural West and South(!) against the growing power of the robber barons but made the fatal mistake of entering into an alliance with the Democrats. Next, he shows how the tremendous working-class rebellion in the 1930s that won Social Security and made the American Dream a reality for generations of workers was blocked from creating a European-style Labor Party, parties that single-payer universal health care systems in Europe and Canada that Michael Moore so envied in Sicko. Lastly, Selfa looks at the rise and fall of the civil rights, anti-war, women's rights, and gay liberation movements of the 60s and 70s. 

&gt;In each case, the Democrats resisted these movements but eventually granted meaningful reforms because these movements became too powerful to crush. These movements ignored pleas by Democratic politicians to moderate their demands, to shut up and wait, and to stop organizing (Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the darling of liberals to this day, told civil rights organizers: ""If you stop all this sitting-in s--- and concentrate on voter registration, I'll get you a tax-exemption."") At the same time, the Democrats worked hard to incorporate and co-opt movement leaders into the machinery of government, to transform community organizers into party/government bureaucrats sitting behind desks. 

&gt;Sadly, in many cases, the strategy worked. Jesse Jackson, for example, agreed to endorse conservative Democratic loser Michael Dukakis and give him the Rainbow Coalition's delegates in exchange for putting several Jackson staffers (including Jackson's son) on the Democratic National Committee. While big business-friendly candidates kept its hands firmly on the wheel of the Democratic Party, progressives and their issues took their seats at the back of the bus. The book is rife with examples of movement leaders that decide ""a seat at the table"" is more important than changing the menu, the portions, or who gets served what. 

&gt;The last few chapters of the book are devoted to whether or not the left can take over or use the party as a vehicle for social change. He uses Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition in the 1980s and today's Progressive Democrats of America as examples of how activists who set out to change and takeover the Democratic party end up changing, getting co-opted and neutered by the very forces they sought to challenge.

&gt;The book closes by examining the missed opportunities to create broad-based third parties free of corporate domination, opportunities which the Democratic party sabotaged, more often than not with help from forces within social movements. The most ugly example is the American Communist Party during the 1930s and 40s. No matter how many strikes the Democrats broke, or how many working-class radicals were victimized by McCarthyism (another invention of the Democratic party), the CP toed a pro-FDR line even though there was a groundswell of support rank-and-file workers for an independent Labor Party due to strikebreaking and political betrayals by Democratic governors and FDR at the time. To read more about that, check out Sharon Smith's excellent book on U.S. labor history, ""Subterranean Fire.""

t1_c14hsw3,t3_e17y5,0,1288901795,0,,,t5_2qmah,,WeAreTheMusicMakers,True,kminator,"There are some really interesting aspects to 1960s-70s organ and electric piano that you can spot in a great deal of popular music if you listen closely.  Modern keyboard/synths usually have variations of these tones onboard when you buy them, but there's definitely a reason people keep the old ones around and go to the trouble to haul a 75 pound keyboard or a 400 pound organ out on stage.  

The Hammond Organ (B-3, C-3, A-100 are the primary models from the 50s-late 70s, tho there are other versions with similar mechanics, these three types have the same internals and sound just alike, different cases) is the primary organ you hear in rock, pop, jazz and funk.  Thick tone.  They're run through Leslie speaker cabinets, which have a rotating horn overtop of an up-facing tweeter speaker, and a 15"" speaker facing down into a rotating cardboard baffle for the low end.  The speed at which the organ rotates changes the sound dramatically.  

The Hohner Clavinet is a vintage electric piano designed to be a home-use, portable harpsichord.  It can be easily heard on many Steven Wonder songs, especially Superstition, wherein 9 tracks of clavinet playing were layered atop each other to get an especially dense sound.  

The Fender Rhodes electric piano, an unpowered electric piano with wood and plastic hammer tips, metal tines and resonating metal tone bars, can be distinctly heard on a great deal of classic music.  A modification known as dyno-my-piano was outfitted on many late-70s and early 80s Rhodes models that rendered a more cutting, less bell-like sound that you might notice in Steely Dan's music.  The Rhodes was originally designed by Harold Rhodes to allow wounded GI's after WWII an opportunity to learn the piano whilst stuck in hospital beds.  There are 54-, 73- and 88-key models, some include vibrato and reverb circuits, some are attached to 4x10 or 2x15 speaker cabinets.  



The Wurlitzer Electric Piano, while similar to the Rhodes, is known for a more wooden, piercing sound and clearer leading tone.  It is also generally easier to play with a lighter action.  Most Wurlitzers have a powered preamp and internal speakers (that can be disabled) and come in a variety of models with similar internal aspects.  They first began distribution of the Wurlizter EP in 1952ish, and the model 200 is probably the most widely seen.  If you watched the Rally to Restore Sanity on Saturday, you'd have noticed John Legend playing the Wurlitzer 200 that sat in the front of the stage throughout the musical segments.  They're great!

The Moog Synthesizer Company is responsible for the most widely available vintage synthesizers, and continue to make them today, albeit incorporating digital technologies in place of more finnicky analog circuitry.  Moogs are generally monophonic (only makes sound from one key at a time) and are often used for lead tones, background pads or basslines.  They start with one simple wave of sound (sine wave, saw wave, square wave describes the basic shape the waveform makes as it's passed through a circuit to a speaker) that is modulated for various pitches and further altered with assorted effects circuits such as adjustable LFO (frequency oscillation is the weeoooweeooo noise) and lots of other strange possibilities.  The old ones involved plugging and unplugging cables that connected the machine to different circuits and effects, and were nearly the size of a phone booth.  Today, they're much smaller.  The history and genesis of the keyboard and the bold legacy of its inventor is celebrated each year at MoogFest in Asheville, NC.  

The mellotron is another great machine that employs individual analog tapes for each key.  Pressing the key feeds the tape through a reader that puts out sound.  Tapes can be changed out to allow different sounds to be played.  Medeski, Martin and Wood are a band known for their use of the mellotron, and Medeski would often manually slow the feeding of the tapes through the header as the keys are pressed down that causes dramatically odd sound bends as they speed up and slow down.  .  It was originally designed in the garage of a fellow named Chamberlain, and his design was copied and produced in Europe as the mellotron.  They are known for their use on Beatles records as well.  

I'm sure any smart keyboard player or music historian can poke tons of holes in what I've said here, but my main interest is pointing out the vast variety of sounds you can get from old-school keyboards, and the richness of tone that has become the hallmark of many great records.  I haven't even scratched the surface of synth machines, that include the Roland Juno and Jupiter keyboards, Yamaha DX-7, Casio sampling keyboards, ARP synthesizers (think the bassline on Herbie Hancock's Chameleon), Dave Smith Prophet and many, many more.

I transfered out of the college prep school because I was a dumb kid, but found myself in the basic Econ class learning more than I thought I wanted, but what I needed.

As for explaining it - I've heard it be said (a lot) that you aren't allowed to teach kids the basics of writing and grammar directly, and that it can only be taught indirectly though reading various authors (yes, not allowed, no one ever gave me a reasoning on why..). While this seems silly, I do like the idea of exploring different authors and their 'voices', per se, but it takes a lot more time, of course. 

In order words: literature = grammar, spelling, etc. 

We sure did have to write papers and were critiqued on them, but we learned more about our language (engrish) by being forced to take one year of a foreign language.

As far as I understand it not quite. What my teacher always emphasized that the point is not becoming some sort of a zombie who is unable to feel desire or anger. The point is gain a certain distance from such feelings and with that a freedom  to act, i.e. desire or anger does arise in your mind but you can choose not to be gripped by them. However you can choose to be if you want to.

What arises from it is not dissociation from life but a freedom in choosing to associate with things in life. 

For example, if someone offers you delicious food you can choose to indulge in desire and enjoy it. However, you can also choose not to without any regret because you have something important to do, and you don't particularly mind if you never get any delicious food. And it is not even an ability to turn desire on and off at will. It is the ability to have that desire there but not satisfying it will not cause unhappiness, i.e. the desire is not gripping, it is just something you can use at will or ignore. So it is just pulling the claws of desire, not getting rid of it, a person without desire would be a zombie and not a buddha.

From the European viewpoint, it is taking Plato's internal tyrant (appetite, Eros etc.) and simply taking the weapons away from it, it is still there but now cannot force you to do anything, it cannot blackmail you by forbidding you to be happy unless you satisfy the desire.",False,1426553696,c14hvtu,t3_e17ks,2,False,2,0

As far as places to go, NYC and the east coast have very decent public transportation in the North Eastern region. If you want to come down to Texas Florida or California, there are several ways to travel, some take more time, and some are a little more expensive than others. Ultimately, compared to Europe, public transport sucks. The United States is pretty spread out, but keep in mind that the highway system is pretty expedient compared to large urban population centers in Europe. For instance it takes about 19 hours to drive 2100KM. Yeah, and I have done it. It took me 24 hours to get half as far in South America. I wish you the best.

It's pretty important to understand just how big the Rothschilds got in the 1800's.  They were the moneylenders to all the kings and nations of Europe.  They were, and still are, the richest family on the planet, bar none.  Interestingly, they're so rich, they don't appear on ""Richest 10 people"" lists.  They own Rueters, the associated press, and thousands of other newspapers.  They own property on three sides of buckingham palace.  A rothschild is currently the queen of england's ""Royal Vizier"" so to speak.  

Take a look at what happend to Abe Lincoln during the American civil war.  Rothschild (a different member of the same family) was offering lincoln war loans at 26-34% interest - essentially a debt death sentance.  Lincoln said ""Fuck it!"" and issued greenbacks to fund the war, which is entirely within his legal authority to do.  He basically issued ""Dollars"" right from the Treasury of the united states.  There has been a lot of speculation that this is the reason he was assassinated - because he refused to take the loans.  You may not be aware of this, but prior to the civil war, Andrew Jackson had killed the bank of the united states, and completely wiped out the debt of the united states (Only time in history I know about that this has happened.)  I remember reading some lamentations about how strong a debt-free USA would be.  I'll admit this is speculation on my part, but I see the civil war as a social engineering attempt to split one debt free sovereign nation into two debt-addled and constantly fighting republics.  It makes them far easier to control.

Sure, people in the cities were oppressed by the Czar. But most people lived in rural peasant communes ruled by customary law.

For example, private property didn't exist. You had varying systems like homesteading, property distribution et cetera.

Customary law systems are usually the most liberal, in the European sense of the word. The Norwegian Odel prevented Norwegian farmers from becoming serfs, the result being a nation of mostly free, independent smallsteaders. There was little central power, and so forth.

t1_c14iezz,t1_c14i13b,0,1288911142,0,,,t5_2qhbp,,islam,True,Logical1ty,"Nope. Shi'ite lies. And the hadiths the Sunnis follow aren't fabricated, the Shi'ite ones are.

We could go back and forth on this and of course you can find Sunni refutations of the Shi'ite refutations of the Sunni refutations. I'll leave it for anyone who wants to do their own research.

Although personally, I'm not brainwashed, so I'll admit that this late in the game it's going to be next to impossible to sift through the amount of material both camps have entrenched themselves in. The only way to attempt to do this objectively, by any rational standard, is via history, including non-Muslim accounts and most of these back up the Sunni narrative which, unlike the Shi'a, doesn't descend to the level of disgracing particular people. Sunnis tend to take the hands off approach regarding the political disputes over succession and say we won't pass judgement on any of these people who are far holier than we could ever be, by virtue of their close relationship to the Prophet (saw). This naturally lends itself to being the more orthodox position because some claims are unverifiable by history. It's also a more history-friendly perspective (the historian, ideally, tries to remain detached and unbiased). Shi'a, on the other hand, rest their laurels on completely unverifiable claims and have invested themselves in the politics of a brief period of time from over a millenia ago. They exude vitriol of an intense and personal nature against some of the Prophet's (saw) wives and companions which alienates pretty much everyone else, including observers of history. There are quite a few Sunnis who, lacking knowledge of Sunni scholars, get swayed by Shi'ite arguments that appeal to emotion (but lack any sort of verifiable evidence), but despite this, still think Shi'ites are wrong because their positions are morally reprehensible and Sunnis are right because they appeal to their internal moral compass. To put it succinctly, Shi'ites fail because they hate. Haters gonna hate. 

In this day and age where there isn't Sunni domination, where the only real Islamic theocratic state for the last 30 years was Shi'ite Iran, where Muslims leave Islam all the time, sometimes in favor of other religions, there's nothing stopping many Sunnis from switching to the Shi'a camp. But who'd want to? You speak of Islamic principles but the Shi'ite narrative conflicts with everything. It's an insult to the Prophet (saw) to claim he was such a failure that he surrounded himself with turncoats. At least Jesus only had to worry about Judas. The Shi'ites would have you believe every other person the Prophet (saw) trusted (or married) was a Judas. What kind of Prophet (saw) would that be? And what kind of God would that be who'd allow His religion to become totally corrupted and such a failure immediately upon the death of the Prophet (saw)? I'm not saying God has to miraculously intervene, but He stated His Will and purpose for Islam in the Qur'an and the Shi'ite account is in total nonconformity with it (condemning the overwhelming majority of the Ummah, including the first Muslims). Nor does the idea of a God that leaves His religion to be torn to shreds and His Holy Places permanently in the hands of the most vile people, as the Shi'a would have you believe, conform to the account of Allah given in the Qur'an. Doesn't sound like the same God to most people. So I've witnessed countless ignorant, for lack of a better term, Sunnis, or ex-Sunnis (turned atheists or agnostics or Christians) get completely cornered in a debate with a Shi'ite who throws book names and page numbers at them (by the way, if one has access to an actual Arabic library, one would realize you need to check every single citation thrown around in debates by Shi'ites, you really can't trust even a simple quote) still turn around and reject the Shi'a religion emphatically. 

That's the real reason the Shi'a are in such a minority and continue to remain so.

As for Western historians, believe it or not, post-Middle-Ages Western history isn't entirely sugarcoated propaganda. It definitely had an orientalist/racist flair but they attempted to remain objective despite their bias (which colored all non-European sects badly).

South Korea also looks to the U.S. for support against North Korea.

Then you have All the countries which don't necessarily require our military presence, but the fact that we are there allows them to devote large amounts of resources to more productive things, when they would otherwise be going towards defense. Japan is probably the biggest one, without our military they would probably be spending a huge chunk of their money on defense, because they Know china and Korea are still really pissed off about the events of the last 110 years or so. 

But in addition to this you have quite a bit of Europe, especially places next to Russia like Finland or Poland, but also to some extent in places like France. Europe is at peace and working well together for now, but the reality is that the EU isn't nearly as united as they let on. They should however be more worried about Russia to the east, which is not the most stable political climate in the world, and if someone wasn't there to provide some kind of deterrence, would probably eventually start expanding.

So, if we did just completely shut down our military overnight, what would happen? For us, probably absolutely nothing.

But in East Asia, China would invade Taiwan, North Korea would invade South Korea, and then both would probably be looking at Japan with a glint in their eyes. In the middle east, Iran would probably invade Iraq (especially with the state it's in now) Saudi Arabia would probably intervene on the other side, and Turkey might get involved too, depending on how the fight with Greece goes. Remember that in the middle east the whole thing is kind of united by a hatred for America and Israel. Other than that there are all the old rivalries that you get in any region.

My Grandfather also fought in the Second World War along side the British. He was accused of being a member of the Irgun when he was living in what was then Palestine, put in jail and given a choice of whether he wanted to join a special Jewish unit to fight the Germans (Not Inglorious Basterds) or stay behind bars, he chose to fight. Believe me, no one wanted peace more than he did, he employed Arabs and befriended them and their families in his business  but he also knew that no people will simply give up land so that another could live there. There was going to be violence no matter what, its just sad that what happened happened the way it did. Yes, im aware that Arabs have been living in Palestine for centuries and the Palestinians that remain today should have their own state alongside Israel, they don't have to be buddies but both must exist side by side. However there were also Jews there for as long as anybody could remember, they lived under the turks, under the Romans etc etc and never left. You are right to say that this 'every body against us' mentality is wrong, Israel needs to loosen its fixation with security but this fear does not live in a vacuum, the people who built Israel also lived through some of the darkest times in history, they saw their people slaughtered like animals. In light of this, to cause similar harm to the Arab inhabitants of Palestine is obviously wrong but its also not the goal of Zionism. Theodore Herzl didn't wake up one morning and come up with Zionism as a way to dislocate Arabs. 

 I also think that Israel has a responsibility to end its settlement expansion, dismantle a majority of the existing ones and leave the West Bank. In fact most Israelis think this way, they are the ones who have to send their boys and girls to fight, die and kill so they more than anybody else except perhaps Palestinians themselves want an end to the violence. They'll have to sort it out ASAP, both people, but this will only happen with the right leaders, Yitzhak Rabin was the one for Israel but he was killed and Abu Mazen is the one for Palestinians but Im not sure that Netanyahu is his counterpart. 

But you see, Its when people whose countries were also settler countries theorize whether or not Jews should have their own country in the region that really gets to me. I'm not implying that you think this way but its when the discussion gets heated that words to such an effect come out and cloud the dialogue with provocative statements. I've spent 5 months in Australia, its a truly fascinating country, ""heeps fun the lot of ya"" but i would get into discussions about this subject with Aussies and it seemed like there was this double  standard, as if a country that was a colony of a truly foreign empire 200 some odd years ago can commit real genocide and try to breed out the natives can still be a legit country because all the shitty bits of its history happened 200 years ago. I mean, even if you went to Ireland and imposed whatever beliefs you have, the fact is that there are barely enough Aboriginals to even say that they don't like you, back in the day British arrivals in Australia really fucked them up, Right?

Also, as to the thought that people themselves are more civilized today than they were centuries ago is arguable. People are selfish, brutish and will always think that their specific group is better than the other.

With the 3rd party the Liberal Democrats now in coalition government, the UK has been reminded that more than 2 parties count.

At various times in the UK the ruling party hasn't had enough support to defeat the opposition on votes then not only does the 3rd party weigh power but all the parties do. The Unionist vote required by John Majors Conservative party being an example. The Unionists manage to hold far larger sway over Nothern Irish policy than their size would indicate because they offered their vote as a block lot to the Conservatives.

My point... that not only is the US a 2 party system, but it's quite an extreme example of a 2 party system.

On the continent, where they have proportional representation (which is slowly making headway in the UK) then the smaller parties are far more important.

One of the arguments against proportional representation is that it's politically inefficient... it is a valid argument... but, the US already has all the inefficiencies with just 2 parties that one would normally expect from 6. I can't really see it being any less efficient for the US. Arguably given that the US is such a large federation, some form of proportional representation one would have thought was almost essential to get any bredth of representation.

The Catholic Encyclopedia offers a version of events you doubtless prefer:

&gt;At that time the purity of the Catholic Faith in Spain was in great danger from the numerous Marranos and Moriscos, who, for material considerations, became sham converts from Judaism and Mohammedanism to Christianity. The Marranos committed serious outrages against Christianity and endeavoured to judaize the whole of Spain. The Inquisition, which the Catholic sovereigns had been empowered to establish by Sixtus IV in 1478, had, despite unjustifiable cruelties, failed of its purpose, chiefly for want of centralisation. In 1483 the pope appointed Torquemada, who had been an assistant inquisitor since 11 February 1482, Grand Inquisitor of Castile, and on 17 October extended his jurisdiction over Aragon.

Source: [Catholic Encyclopedia - Tomás de Torquemada](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14783a.htm)

Tomas de Torquemada was quite brutal in his dealings with his victims, but perhaps you have no qualms about such methods when they are in service of the faith to stamp out dissenting viewpoints or to crush any rival religions.

&gt;Torquemada's methods reveal much about one of the age's most unpleasant characteristics: man's inhumanity to man. Sharp iron frames prevented victims from sleeping, lying, or even sitting. Braziers scorched the soles of their feet, racks stretched their limbs, suspects were crushed to death beneath chests filled with stones 
&gt; ,. . .
&gt;In 1492, the year of Columbus, Spain's Jews were given three months to accept Christian baptism or be banished from the country. Even those who had been baptized were distrusted; Isabella had fixed her dark eye on converted Jews suspected of recidivism -- Marranos, she called them; ""pigs"" -- and marked them for resettlement as early as 1478. Eventually between thrity thousand and sixty thousand were expelled. Meantime the king of Portugal, finding merit in the Spanish decree, ordered the explusion of *all* Portguese Jews. His soldiers were instructed to massacre those who were slow to leave. During a single night in 1506 nearly four thousand Lisbon Jews were put to the sword. Three years later the systematic presecution of the German Jews began.
&gt;
&gt; . . .
&gt;
&gt;At the turn of the sixteenth century, Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros -- who would become Spain's new inquisitor general -- provided Europe with an extraordinary example of medieval genocide. He ordered all Grenadine Moors to accpt baptism. Cisneros wasn't really seeking converts. He hoped to goad them to revolt. and when they did rise he annihilated them. Any nonconformity, any weakness, was despised; the handicapped were given not compassion, but terror and pain, as prescribed in *Malleus maleficarum (The WItches Hammer)*, a handbook by the inquisitiors Johann Sprenger and Heinrich Kraemer, which justified the shackling and burning of, among others, the mentally ill.

Just as there are those who justified and, in some cases still do justify, the anti-semitism of the Nazis, it doesn't surprise me that there are those who can defend the anti-semitism of those earlier times - The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, commonly known as the Spanish Inquisition, was established in 1478 but wasn't definitively abolished until 1834. And just as there are those who will try to deny the atrocities of the Nazis there are those who seek to minimize or justify the atrocities committed during the Inquisition.

Of course the inquistion did not target only Jews and Jewish conversos (marranos) and Protestants, but also the Moriscos, converts to Catholicism from Islam. 

&gt;I would gladly justify the Institution to anyone who opposed it - as would all of the Spanish Catholics at the time.

Certainly there were many Spanish Catholics living at that time who approved of the Inquisition. According to [The Inquisition](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Inquisition.html), ""During the 16th and 17th centuries, attendance at [auto de fe](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/auto_de_fe.html)  reached as high as the attendance at bullfights.""

&gt;Today, the sounds and techniques of classic dub music have been stylistically absorbed into the various genres of global electronic popular music (such as hip-hop, techno, house, jungle, ambient, and trip-hop), and conceptually absorbed into the now commonplace practice of song remixing.  Few people are aware that dub, a style built around fragments of sound over a hypnotically repeating reggae groove, was a crucial forerunner of these genres and that much of what is unique about contemporary dance music is directly traceable to the studio production techniques pioneered in Kingston beginning in the 1960. 

Of course, it's just one scholars opinion.  

European experimental electronic music certainly had a huge impact on the development of the *electronic* part of electronic dance music, most conspicuously through the medium of Kraftwerk's infectious refinement of the tradition.

This is largely because, unfortunately, many pot smokers have an equally uneven commitment to rights of the individual.  

It is also because conservatism as it exists presently in the United States, only becomes more bizarre and alien the higher you get.  There are of course, a smattering of conservatives who smoke pot, but largely these are two worlds that rarely touch (William F. Buckley had a...less-than-robust commitment to anti-marijuana authoritarianism).

I come from a conservative background.  I mention the National Review because it was where my interest in politics and social issues began; the original teenage perspective I came to civics and politics informed by.  The only way I have found to hammer home to average conservatives the pot issue is through the exact same mechanisms by which conservatives are pro-gun.

Gun ownership is, its critics say, dangerous on face (as conservatives say about pot).  It presents a danger to society (as conservatives say about pot, from ""stoned drivers"" to ""what about the children"" crowd, to the ""pot makes people really fuckin' horny and Jesus doesn't like that"" crowd...), and is a kind of ""luxury"" the other side should give up because it's really just not important (as anti-gun liberals tend to say about guns, as anti-pot conservatives say about pot).

It's here on both sides that minds close.  Each side believes it has the absolute right to stuff its restrictive agenda down the throat of the opposition through petitioning government to do so.  For the same reasons.  Each involves, ultimately, guns, should the people on the other side refuse to abide by the law.  The government goes after Randy Weaver for a sawed off shotgun or, on the other side, the Drug War, which involves getting arrested by police with guns to ensure you comply.

But of course, this kind of thinking just exposes me as a libertarian, who is trusted by neither the Right (we're secret hippies!), nor the Left (we're basically the guy on the Monopoly box who burns money in fireplaces for warmth and seasons our filet mignon with the sweat of workers and the blood of third world child slave laborers.)

So how to do this, I don't know, but I will say there are some things I've learned over time, for sure:

(a) If you are a white guy with dreadlocks, you are at a severe disadvantage with conservatives.

(b) You will rarely convince conservatives who put bumper stickers on their car expressing their point of view, of anything.  Guys who put Glenn Beck stickers on their car or some kind of anti-Obama sticker, are guys who think the way they do for the same reason you jerk off with the hand you do.  They've got this obsessive need to see the world in a certain way beyond all facts or reason and perhaps only God himself will change their mind.  I am sure there are exceptions but this tends to be true.

(c) With the exception of the paleocons and libertarian Republicans who feel comfortable drinking with them (Patrick Buchanan, Jack Hunter) at magazines like The American Conservative, the average American conservative - which are probably not the same as reddit conservatives - does not have a wide range of perspectives.  The left will at least look at Europe and talk about their ideas a bit, or occasionally read something by a Democratic Socialist or even an anarchist, but conservatives are driven by *talking points*, a set of tropes which repeat over and over again, tend to be oversimplified, and communicated largely by radio and television pundits.  I listen to right wing AM radio daily (Levin, Savage, Boortz, etc.) and I never cease to marvel at the oversimplification of everything that drives these shows.  Compare this to Democracy Now, and I have to say, the left, however fucking boneheaded and hypocritical they can be about certain things, are just, deeper thinkers.

This crowd is rapidly alienating the paleocons and the *truly* libertarian conservative contingent in the Tea Party.  I wonder if they will just find their way to libertarianism eventually, and however the left feels about libertarianism, trust me: you may hate libertarians, but better libertarian than conservative if you care about pot legalization.  Ex-National Review senior editor Joe Sobran somehow found his way to a kind of Catholic Anarchism (!) so...it is possible.

One thing I think we've failed to do is make the point about conservatives and their children.  The fact remains that if 40% of Americans have tried marijuana at some point (I've heard), if the justice system worked right 40% of Americans would have criminal drug records.  And what would that mean for their children.  What if they got busted by mistake, like en masse at a party where people were smoking pot?  If I was feeling particularly propagandistic, I'd say cynically at this point, ""Do you trust the same jury system that SET OJ SIMPSON FREE to be fair to your children?""  Distrust of government, sometimes conservatives are into it.  Sometimes.

I don't know if any of this made any sense [7].

At some point the camp leader said something like: ""Okay you little pieces of shit, nobody ever talked to you like this so get this through your thick skulls: Nobody likes you, nobody wants you, we're here to teach you how to not be assholes.""

Note that this was about 20 years ago, so I might have made it more interesting than it actually was, I try to be as truthful as possible!

It was the first time that group was silent. And when you resist, the camp leader simply didn't provide your group with proper sleeping arrangements, warm food or even water. There was a small stream where we could ""figure out"" how to get clean water. We were forced to work together and help one another out.

After 2 days of not eating anything but the berries that grew around the camp site, you begin to appreciate the smoke coming from a chimney back at the camp. The smell of coffee. The smell of waffles and pancakes. The smell of the sweaty camp leader grinning at you when you come crawling back like the little roaches you've been.

The feeling of shame after having to admit that we did, in fact, need others to keep us alive.. was immense. I believe the realization that we ARE dependent on others, adults we've been used to control with our little tantrums, and they are doing it for US.. changed that entire group.

Effort leads to reward. Continual effort leads to continual rewards. Throw with food: No food for you. Don't want to shower when everyone else does: No showers for you PERIOD. Don't want to clean the dinner table? Then you won't be sleeping inside.

They even made groups of kids and made us do sports and other competitive things. We had to work towards a specific goal, usually winning from another team. The winning team would get a reward where the other teams didn't get SHIT. Now, to me this sounds pretty normal - even back then. But it seems that you USA folks even give the losers rewards and stuff. Cut that shit out. Losing means you don't deserve anything.

My parents were told to stop pampering me and giving in to every whine and cry. My dad never did anything to make my whining stop. After camp, apparently someone spoke with him, the first time I started being a dick again he simply did these things:

1. He slapped the back of my head.
2. He picked me up, not gently at all.
3. Threw me into my room.
4. No food, even though I attempted to sit at the table.

That said, this is in Europe. Back then (20 years ago) they didn't frown upon slapping your kids when necessary. My parents never did until they were told it's actually a good way to instill some very necessary respect into their kids.

I realize that in the USA there's this retarded sense that anything you might do to potentially hurt your precious unique little snowflake of a kid will be ""Child Abuse"" and when you touch your own kid it might even be ""Child Molestation"" and more shit like that. So take your own laws into consideration here.

Sometimes a restrained amount of violence (don't cause permanent damage, obviously) is all that's needed to calm a kid down.

I was fucking scared shitless of my dad when he got angry. Yet he still showed me love and respect whenever I was behaving myself. The threat of a slap was enough to make me change my ways. It wasn't the punishment that got me to change my ways, it was the reward. Primarily not having to see my dad angry, my mom disappointed.. and the words of the camp leader ringing in my mind: ""Nobody likes you, nobody wants you.""

A rise from 1.98 in 2003 to 2.25 in 2007 to 3.27 this year is a huge rise, in my opinion.  In fact, I think it's a rather suspiciously huge rise.  I'm curious as to the breakdown, both in the areas of science and the population, where the rise took place.

Also:

&gt; By comparison, in 1989, Canada scored a scientific literacy mark of 4 percent. In 1991, Japan 3 percent; in 1992, European Community 5 percent; in 2000, US 17 percent.

Let's just say it is clear the author is NOT a psychiatrist and not only doesn't have a very deep knowledge of mental illnesses, but he makes tons of assumptions. It's also clear he has NO training in evidence-based medicine or any formal science for that matter. 

It is stupid beyond belief that he'd denounce the increasing ""specification"" of diseases as our understanding of them increases. I'm sorry, but lumping social anxiety disorder with not only depression, but even with a ""closer"" entity like generalised anxiety disorder into the nonspecific ""nerves"" diagnosis, as he suggests, would be downright negligent with the current state of science. Some meds might be very universal in their use, but there are GREAT differences between more specific meds for more specific diagnosis... Also, treatment is not limited to meds, and when it comes to designing a psychotherapy for the patient it would be stupid to not make the distinction either. I find it funny that he then goes to contradict himself in this line 

&gt;  But many people believe they're not often effective for serious depression, even though they fit wonderfully with the heterogeneous concept of ""major depression.""

So what is it going to be? Is the further study into the different clinical entities a bad thing or a good thing? A little critical thinking with these sorts of ""critics"" is all that's necessary to realise they are for the most part making issues out of non-issues for whatever purpose (in this guy's case i suspect it is to garner attention for the book he's writing, because controversy is always good for book sales)

Having said that, he is kinnda right in that the pharm industry is trying to push as many meds as possible: that's just their business model. But what the big pharma wants and what doctors actually do is a very different story. Maybe the issue is a bit bigger in the US, but that would just mean your policymakers should take care of it the way they have done here in Europe (and pretty much the rest of the world): forbidding prescription drug ads for the general public, making it illegal for the pharm industry to pay (bribe) for doctors' trips, give them gifts, etc etc... This would seem like a no-brainer, but shockingly it seems to happen in the US. And people are not decrying THAT, they're pinning it on the doctors, of course. 

TBH, fom a doctor's PoV it is sad that society (even moreso in american society) we are increasingly being seen as the ""bad, incompetent and greedy"" guys, when the reality (from my experience with fellow colleages and classmates at medschool) is that most doctors get into the field to help people, and out of love for the science. In that sense I don't get that EVERYTIME something goes wrong the first thought on the patients' (and/or their relatives') minds is to sue. Because clearly when we make a mistake (but more often than that it's just that we fail to create the outcome they expected, regardless of feasibility) we must have done it to screw them over. Again, from what I can tell this matter is also worse in the US. And no matter what, psychiatrists are always evil and on a power trip.

I'm going to end this rant now. I just wanted to point this out, OP, because it is particularly sad that someone like you who's worked side by side with the doctors and who knows firsthand what these people (the patients) are going though is jumping on this big conspiracy bandwagon. Doctors do the best they can, and the science on the subject IS progressing (and yes, some it is being pushed forward even by the ""evil"" big pharma).

* There are many different factors... there are some things that ""exist"" in English that just don't ""exist"" in French, such as dividing streets by ""blocks"", or sometimes idioms. Plays on words can be really hard to translate, because most of them just don't make any sense in French! 

* I just want to say, before I answer this question: I'm not from Quebec, but from New Brunswick. But you're right, much like Canadian/American English is different from British/European English. In my case, I translate mostly for New Brunswickers, but sometimes Québec or Canada as a whole (for a website, for example), so I will use Canadian French. The clients also have specific instructions to them (Some clients will ask for France French punctuation, the difference is in the spacing). Some clients insist they do not want a particular word, etc. This detail is very important, since you need to translate FOR your audience in such a way that they will understand it.

We ended up following the schedule of where we were staying to the letter, but barely followed our day to day plans. I would say, get an idea of what you would like to see so you know whats there, but don't do the hour-by-hour plan for each day.

First of all, this article is not a journal, it is an opinion piece written for the layman.  The fact that scientific studies are not references does not mean there is not science backing these assumptions.  There are different types of writing.  You are making some major leaps because of your difference of opinion with the writer.  Anyway, people ARE decrying the influence of big pharm and the doctors have really not been the focus of most of the anger about the lapses in the system.  However, they are on the front lines, and they have minds of their own, and the general way psychiatry is being practiced in the US is a shame.  I obviously hit a nerve with you, but you are commenting from your understanding if this from outside of the US.  I am not wielding conspiracies.  I also don't think this reality is true for every psychiatrist.  I also agree with you that people go into the field with the goal of helping.  They are also human and subject to the pressure of society and the pressure to create results.  In the US, people are indoctrinated to think that the answer often lies in a pill of some sort.  Pressure is on these doctors from the pharmaceutical companies and from people who want a quick fix.  I am not blaming the doctors, but they ultimately manifest the practice of psychiatry, so they bear a large responsibility that they put on their own shoulders.  If you care to do your research, the evidence is pouring in that American psychiatry needs help, and the trends in the way it is being practiced are ruining lives.  As for not posing solutions, there are any number of solutions that have been posed.  Funds are never allocated to actualize any of them, as far as institutions go, and pseudoscience has the general public misled into thinking these drugs are going to take their problems away.  You are right, the government needs to intervene.  The problem is, in the US, our government is very influenced by these same companies.  This is not conspiracy, it is how it is, whether you want to acknowledge it or not.  

Now, the point in posting this article is that, what is being said is that, it is becoming increasingly easy to slap labels on people, who are then medicated based on those labels.

This article is simply explaining how these companies insert their influence into the professional and public understanding of psychiatric care, and the places that psych is vulnerable to manipulation of information.  The end of the article actually compares American psych to European psych, and says that it is our emphasis on the labels in the US that is hurting the practice and that their needs to be a return to psychopathology.  So that you understand the system: you visit a psychiatrist, you submit to your insurance, in order for the insurance to pay for your visits insurance companies require a diagnosis, the doctor gives a diagnosis and then treats based on that label.  Unfortunately, that is our current system.  Some handle it better than others, but it is largely being mishandled and much needs to change.

I think Brown was weak about the deficit frankly - it's hard to say no to people and it makes you unpopular. But continuing the stimulus into 2010 and not committing to getting rid of the structural deficit seems to me to be giving people something you can't afford. And listening to Sirius Satellite radio in the US made me think that most US politicians are essentially doing the same thing. They all have vested interests that they will pay off rather than taking a stand against. That's OK for them in the short term but very bad for the country in the long term. 

Now I was joking about aristocrats being necessary. But you do need people who will wean their patient off the financial morphine before the patient turns into a junky. Because junkies get forced to go through cold turkey by the IMF or the bond markets. And I think the whole developed world is running too high a debt. That the UK is in the middle of the pack in EU terms is nothing to be proud of.

It's also no exaggeration to say the UK's weird political system - essentially an elective dictatorship - makes this easier. Cameron and Osborne will get a chance to make drastic cuts and so long as the economy recovers in four years they'll keep their jobs. The US isn't like that - mid term elections force politicians into crass populism like trying to keep parts of the Bush tax cuts and the Obama stimulus regardless of the effects on the deficit.

Zapping around Sirius in the car really irritated me actually - no one seemed to care about the structural deficit. And no one seemed willing to confront the people that had funded their campaigns.

The Metaphorical Employment of the Terminology
of Political Rule (excerpted from Human Action, by Ludwig von Mises)

""The orders given by businessmen in the conduct of their affairs can be heard and seen. Nobody can fail to become aware of them. Even messenger boys know that the boss runs things around the shop. But it requires a little more brains to notice the entrepreneur's dependence on the market. The orders given by the consumers are not tangible, they cannot be perceived by the senses. Many people lack the discernment to take cognizance of them. They fall victim to the delusion that entrepreneurs and capitalists are irresponsible autocrats whom nobody calls to account for their actions[13].

The outgrowth of this mentality is the practice of applying to business the terminology of political rule and military action. Successful businessmen are called kings or dukes, their enterprise an empire, a kingdom, or a dukedom. It this idiom were only a harmless metaphor, there would be no need to criticize it. But it is the source of serious errors which play a sinister role in contemporary doctrines.

Government is an apparatus of compulsion and coercion. It has the power to obtain obedience by force. The political sovereign, be it an autocrat or the people as represented by its mandataries, has power to crush rebellions as long as his ideological might subsists.

The position which entrepreneurs and capitalists occupy in the market economy is of a different character. A ""chocolate king"" has no power over the consumers, his patrons. He provides them with chocolate of the best possible quality and at the cheapest price. He does not rule the consumers, he serves them. The consumers are not tied to him. They are free to stop patronizing his shops. He loses his ""kingdom"" if the consumers prefer to spend their pennies elsewhere. Nor does he ""rule"" his workers. He hires their services by paying them precisely that amount which the consumers are ready to restore to him in buying the product. Still less do the capitalists and entrepreneurs exercise political control. The civilized nations of Europe and America were long controlled by governments which did not considerably hinder the operation of the market economy. Today these countries too are dominated by parties which are hostile to capitalism and believe that every harm inflicted upon capitalists and entrepreneurs is extremely beneficial to the people.

In an unhampered market economy the capitalists and entrepreneurs [p. 273] cannot expect an advantage from bribing officeholders and politicians. On the other hand, the officeholders and politicians are not in a position to blackmail businessmen and to extort graft from them. In an interventionist country powerful pressure groups are intent upon securing for their members privileges at the expense of weaker groups and individuals. Then the businessmen may deem it expedient to protect themselves against discriminatory acts on the part of the executive officers and the legislature by bribery; once used to such methods, they may try to employ them in order to secure privileges for themselves. At any rate the fact that businessmen bribe politicians and officeholders and are blackmailed by such people does not indicate that they are supreme and rule the countries. It is those ruled--and not the rulers--who bribe and are paying tribute.""",False,1426555071,c14ktyd,t3_e0oaz,1,False,1,0

They are natural born Democrats, but can they be transformed from a demographic into a constituency that reliably shows up on election day?

The simple answer to this is yes; with a truly progressive party that puts forth sane ideas and pushes an agenda of reality based solutions.  American Leadership needs to understand that this demographic communicates with the world on a regular basis.

Regarding 1.
There has been a [study by the Fraunhofer Institut](http://econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/28511/1/565631225.pdf), a very honorable institution renowned for excellent research, that had a surprising result: Selling wind-power can lead to lower consumer-prices, even if it is sold at higher prices than power from any other sources on the market, due to the merit order effect. 
However there is are two moderate and one critical problem with this study: 


A:The analyzed Market is fictional, and the fictional consumer-prices would be higher than on the real market. The analyzed market includes all produced energy on one market place with only one price at a time, but the real market consists of several markets for different kinds of energy (seperated by its reliability and controllability -&gt;base load, middle load, peak load, etc.) at different prices. So the merit order sum is considerably smaller.


B. It analyses the effect when EXISTING wind-power plants within an EXISTING infrastructure change their power output. When the power output of wind power plants rises then energy prices on the fictional market go down and vise versa. These results may also be surprising but they seem true (on the fictional market and maybe even on a real market). However, it does not cover the event of adding new wind-power plants.


C: The critical problem is, That adding new wind-power plants requires adding more power plants that can deliver peak load in order to make the random power supply usable as base load energy. These are the most expensive conventional sources of energy and the main cause of the high prices on the fictional market.

 
Step by step this means the following:
Adding a source of randomly occurring power creates the need of expensive peak load energy. These expensive peak load energy sources cause high prices on the market, whenever the random power source does NOT provide power. If the random power source does provide power, the peak load plants can be turned off, and the prices become lower. So the random power source is indirectly creating the high prices which it sometimes lowers.


Further more random power plants need more expensive infrastructure per kWh than reliable power plants.


Never the less the media presented the results of this Study as if they meant adding new wind power and solar power plants would lower the prices. This false interpretation is all over the community of the green energy enthusiasts.

Regarding 2. This point means, once the investment-debt is paid off, the energy is almost free. However this is only true for the raw energy. 
The additional costs for infrastructure and for alternative agile energy sources or energy storage are higher than the whole production and distribution cost of conventional energy, which means that the raw randomly occurring energy has a negative market value.

Regarding 3. see 2.

Regarding 4. The point of decentralized power production is, that power source and consumer are closer together, and thereby reduce the cost of infrastructure. A distributed power-source can be closer to the consumer if the distribution pattern in time and space is similar.

However with solar power the distribution in time is different. With wind energy it is different in both time and space.

(From the article) direct threats of violence against men resisting feminism? *""As there had been voilent threats from left wing extremist to sabotage the conference, the new location was kept in secret. ""* 

Definitely a fascinating article and a sign of how things are changing. Feminism's public image is starting to show cracks and people are wising up to the utter insanity and hypocrisy involved when feminists try to say things like this: [*""Women are bitches"" is oppressive because it reinforces patriarchy. ""Men are pigs"" is not oppressive because men, as a group are not systematically oppressed.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/d96li/a_proposal_for_an_official_procedure_for_banning/)

The more activism and meetings like the Swiss ones, the more chances there are for the feminist backlash to them - something that only helps with men's rights as it exposes the actual dirty, dark, and oppressive side of feminism that seeks to silence any criticism of it. Also provided was this interesting insight *Today, it is institutionalized feminism within the state that is discriminating men. Emancipation was only reserved for women, because feminism is feeding the state, while male sentiment wants to deregulate it. Therefore, the well-being of women is much more attractive for the state. ... The hate of patriarchy, which is essential to feminism, is a schizoid complex which today is haunting the western world.*

We all know the constant claim that feminism is about fighting for the rights of men too - but clearly men do *not* feel represented by feminism if things like this are not only occurring, but feminists are trying desperately to stop men from even meeting to discuss the issue. 

Feminism would like to utterly control the debate and speak for men. They are more than willing to go on the attack against men to do so. Well the message feminists constantly try to send and shame us with ""You can't do this!"" was nicely responded to in Europe with ""We are doing it.""

Yeah, but we don't really care what you think about our ideas since we already run entire countries according to them, and the countries turned out great! You guys have never run a single country ever, so all your ideas are just on paper. I'll only take them seriously when I see a functional libertarian society. Until then it is simply fiction.

Of course we impose our views, they work awesomely. Everyone should use them so that they can be awesome like us too.

I do know that. I also live in a city. You should know that was only when a large part of the populations of Europe began to move to urban environments (and were no longer subsistence farming) that these ideals began to form, because of the new challenges facing society which were not present previously.

&gt;Ah, so you claim to have read books!

All the time. I actually have a library in my house. I am thinking of getting a Kindle though, but I'm not sure yet.

&gt;I believe you've read books on politics, but Karl Marx is outdated. I doubt if you've ever opened an economics book.

Yes, I read Marx. Of course he is outdated. I have read plenty of economics books. I also have a Master's degree in actuarial science, but when I tell that to most libertarians they get angry. I'm not sure why but I think it is because they realise that I have more formal education in an economically related field and still disagree with them. Libertarians like to believe that their position is the one which intelligent people would prefer to hold, so when they meet intelligent (and wealthy) people who disagree, their only reaction is anger.

Can't have it both ways. It is way more important to protect the children from the bad decisions their parents made than to protect you from some taxes. After all, you can still pay your taxes and eat afterwards. Children with unemployed parents won't get to eat at all if the government does not provide lunches at school and food stamps.

&gt;See, the thing you will always refuse to understand is that there is a difference between choosing to help people, and being forced to because the socialist down the street thinks you make more money than you should need.

Of course there is a difference. We just don't care about hurting your feelings about paying taxes, because we know that we are doing more good for society by helping those who are less fortunate. You can shout until your throat bleeds that you don't want to help the rest of society, but we will just laugh and make you pay your taxes anyway, and then use those taxes to help people who weren't born rich, or who have drug addicts for parents, or who are orphaned, or who are disabled.",False,1426555647,c14m14r,t3_e1jeo,0,False,0,0

The Israel Supreme Court is the creation of one elite family: the Rothschilds. In their negotiations with Israel, theyve agreed to donate the building under three conditions: the Rothschilds were to choose the plot of land, they would use their own architect and no one would ever know the price of its construction. The reasons for those conditions are quite evident: the Supreme Court building is a Temple of Masonic Mystery Religion and is built by the elite, for the elite.

Built in 1992, the Israel Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem, in front of the Knesset (Israeli legislature). Its peculiar architecture has earned critical praise due to the architects opposition of old versus new, light versus shadow and straight lines versus curves. Almost all critics and journalists have however omitted to mention the blatant occult symbols present all over the building. Masonic and Illuminati principles are physically embodied in numerous instances, proving without a doubt who runs the show in there.

House of the Rothschilds
The Rothschild family is an international dynasty of Germans of jewish descent who established a worldwide banking and finance operation. The offsprings of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) have spread all over Europe and became major actors in the social, political and economic life of the continent. By knitting close ties with the elite of England, Austria, France and Italy, the Rothschilds became a hidden force in most political events of the last centuries. Alternative historians say they are part of the infamous 13 bloodlines of the Illuminati, along with the Rockefellers and the Duponts.

The Rothschilds are one of the originators of the Zionist movement and the most active actors in the creation of the state of Israel. James A. de Rothschild financed the Knesset, Israels main political building. Right in front of it sits the Israeli Supreme Court, donated by another member of the dynasty: Dorothy de Rothschild.

In the same general area of Jerusalem we can therefore find the Knesset and the Supreme Court, built by the Rothschilds and, following a perpendicular ley line, several blocks away, sits the Rockefeller Museum (other elite family).

1. The premise: Germany is superior to every other nation and must therefore become a super power.

2. Surprisingly, Germany lost the Great War, which must be impossible unless...

3. Foreign elements within the country must have sabotaged the brave german army behind their backs. (This notion was widely accepted by the conservative parties) But Germans are nationalist by birth so who could that be? 

4. The international capital as well as the international communist movement are both suspicious. But surely, no self-respecting German would betray his nature and support these groups unless...

5. The Jews which are represented in both international capital as well as the communist movement (they are also to blame for the signing of the treaty of Versailles) must have manipulated the Germans in a way that they acted against their nation, hence nature.

As we see, Hitler believed that communism and (international) capitalism are expression of the same thing (Jewish conspiracy). The reasons he agitated against both were nationalist not socialist. In fact, the only opposition he had in the Reichstag after banning the commmunist party were the social democrats. The other, mostly conservative christian parties voted for their own abolishment in the [Enabling Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933).

You can't just ""go back"". Also, as the Bushmen are forced off there land, at some point the option to ""go back"" won't be there.

Then they can just move on, like everyone else on the planet has done. It really is no tragedy to see another group of people join the modern world and enjoy all the benefits it brings.

&gt;Even if it were true, I don't see how you, me, or some government bureaucrat should be tasked with making this decision rather than the parents of particular children.

The decision cannot be left to the parents even in developed countries.

&gt;Many have made the transition out of primitive life, and many regret it.

Show me data. I can also tell you anecdotes: my father owns a lot of land in South Africa, mostly industrial land. I have had the opportunity to speak with some of the employees of the businesses that rent from him. It is great to see them all with cellphones, learning to text or even use the internet. I would like to see you tell those people that you think it is 'better' if they all just go back to living in the bush and give the cellphones back.

&gt;I don't see how you're qualified to make the italicized statement.

Ok, then list the benefits for me. Remember that they have to collectively outweigh access to modern schooling (all the way to college level for free in Botswana) and healthcare (which is also free and is I *think* the best public healthcare in Africa).

&gt;Based on the opinions of people who have lived through the experience, it's not a clear cut thing. This is true for the civilizing process of many primitive tribes (Hadza, Masai).

The first generation always complains and talks about the 'good old days' and 'innocence lost' and all sorts of crap like that. It was precisely the same during the industrial revolution in Europe. However, you will never hear a significant proportion of their children saying that sort of thing.

&gt;And again, you're using the false dichotomy of ""primitive life vs. modern society"". These people don't have the option of entering modern society, they have the option of entering the third world.

Botswana is not as 'third world' as you think it is. I see you *still* have not bothered to actually read about it.

&gt;I assume that you've never lived with any primitive tribes, so perhaps your opinion, as well, is not quite as accurate as you believe.

Except for the first 24 years of my life living in South Africa? Don't assume anything. I never saw a single person who wanted 'less education' or 'less access to healthcare'. You are fooling yourself that these people do not want the _exact_ same things that people in the developed world want. Fuck, they don't _want_ to have to spend every waking hour searching for food. They don't _want_ to die from an ear infection. They want convenience and safety and good health.

&gt;There's much more to it than a feeling of dislocation from their ancestors. Civilized life seems to be inherently different from primitive life. Let them make the decision, don't force them into it.

The first generation needs to be 'coerced'. After that, once the next generation sees the benefits for themselves, they nearly all choose to stay with the modern society.

First up I agree with your overall statement, but I got beef with that phrase. I'm pretty sure you're critiquing the movie industry more than anything else, but I think this needs to be said for the record so please don't take this rant personally. 

American soldiers aren't the villains here. That is also an over-simplification. You really think these guys just woke up one day and said ""Hey, lets go kill some gooks!""? If you look at every instance of insurgency warfare in history, or even the expectation of insurgency (i.e. rape of Belgium), there has been incidents...no atrocities... where soldiers murder and rape innocent civilians. 

The fact of the matter is that these guys were fighting an enemy who hide among the populace. The farmer waving at him today may have had an ak pointing at him yesterday. That's...frustrating to say the least. Compounding the problem was the U.S. focus on body counts in Vietnam. The pentagon wanted to win the war by bleeding the VC and NVA to the point of submission. There was a lot of pressure on the guys on the ground to go out and produce dead bodies. 

Furthermore, almost all soldiers are indoctrinated to see their enemies as subhuman and their deaths as inconsequential. They may not straight up say it like that, but they do everything but. It has to be like that, people don't naturally kill people, and having a soldier think about the consequences of pulling the trigger is likely to have him end up dead. Society has been creating soldiers since the dawn of time, and has gotten pretty good at it during those 3 thousand+ years.

Soldiers are also pretty harshly disciplined, the system is designed to keep these guys at maximum aggression at all times. They're supposed to want to kill, so there's a lot of pent-up aggression and an enemy that's always slipping into the ranks of civilians right after they shoot one of you. 

You put all these issues and let them stew for a couple of years, and you get exactly what happened in my-lai, and countless other times. An officer either lets, or orders his men to just kill the civilians. The brutal truth is that it would work. You have the enemy hiding among civilian population, you can't get to the enemy...so kill the civilians.

 This was how it was done before the media had access to combat zones. Just look up the American colonization of the Philippines, France in Haiti, the American Indian wars, Japanese occupation zones, the eastern front, Spanish colonization of South America, soviet occupation of Berlin....etc. That's the shit they never teach in history class. 

Don't get me wrong, it's horrible and NEVER justified (huge under-statement), but to just say ""the soldiers are the villains"" just doesn't give the whole story. If you want to blame anyone, blame the war machine that turns people into killers, blame the leaders who needlessly put the soldiers in that situation in the first place and lie about what is inevitably going to happen, and blame the people at home for believing such bullshit and remaining gleefully ignorant of how inevitable shit like this is. How hard is it to pick up a history book and see the pattern? Insurgents + different race + dehumanization + careless and ignorant leaders + frustrated soldiers = massacres. 

If you want to put the blame on anyone, blame everyone, blame yourself for letting it happen somewhere every....day. There's enough blood to stain **everyone's** hands. Especially Europe and it's hard-on for colonies that started all this stupid shit to begin with.

Also I would recommend finding a decent restaurant for the evening. Lyon has an amazing cuisine, but there are lots of touristy overpriced gross places too. (Rue Mercière is a 'classic' strip of restaurants, but they are all either very expensive or not good quality.)  The classic rule of ""be wary of places with too much English over the signs/menus"" applies.

For traditional lyonnais food, I would recommend [Restaurant le Saint-Vincent](http://www.cityvox.fr/restaurants_lyon/le-saint-vincent_22153/Profil-Lieu), or somewhere in Rue des Marronniers (very central). Chez Maman and La Mère Jean are both good.  

If you're not insistent on eating lyonnais (it is a bit adventurous for some people), and you have a bit of money, I really recommend my favourite restaurant in Lyon, [L'escale des saveurs](http://www.cityvox.fr/restaurants_lyon/l-escale-des-saveurs_94899/Profil-Lieu). About €25 for three courses, but it is AMAZING fancy quality that I am convinced you would be paying triple the price for anywhere else. More or less European/French fare, but they have very inventive combinations and practise molecular cuisine, which means things come with syringes of sauce and sugar soups and weird (but delicious) things like that.

It seems weird, but look out for signs in the window of restaurants (or bakeries or shops or whatever) that say ""RPPP"".  It might look like [this](http://www.keithtattoo.com/rppp.jpg) or [this](http://lyon.epicerie-equitable.com/images/billet/rppp_2009_300.jpg). This means the place has been recommended by the annual Lyon consumer guide and is generally good quality.

UNITAID also expressed concern over intellectual property measures beyond TRIPS being negotiated in regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs), such as the FTAs with the European Union and Japan, which could create IP obligations for India that could cause price rise and delay access to newer and better ARVs.

There are definitely comparisons to be made, but there is also a differences. Nazis were systematic and calculated. Their goal was to rid Europe of Jews and other groups as well as establishing Germany as the dominate power. The American government was simply uncaring about the native populations. They didn't necessarily need to kill them, just as long as they could be driven off the land or controlled within reservations. You can also look at the time lines. The Nazis accomplished everything they did in less than ten years. The Americans underwent a relatively slow process of expansion with little regard for what stood in their way. That doesn't make one better than the other, but says a lot about their motivations.

That should depend on the final game's style and mood (both game play and graphics-wise). You probably don't want it to just be about a brown blob in a gray box (because that would be somewhat boring) - unless you provide some background. Alternatively you could of course just add one, and (let us) see about what else might fit this.

The jump effect might already give a clue. Perhaps a pickup that gives you better jumping/hovering ability for a limited time? One that let's you temporarily change gravity according to your blob's movement (maybe to kill/manipulate enemy actors or move other pickups)?

Then there's keys, limited invulnerability, attacks, useless collection items to provide more stars if you pick up a whole set spanning several levels, story items, switches to turn on/off these lethal spikes, etc.

&gt; and what should mark the end of a level.

Traditionally it could just be an exit, maybe one that requires a key, or the last one of a list of checkpoints one has to traverse in sequential order. Maybe an enemy actor that has to be defeated by jumping, using a weapon, or manipulating it into death or entrapment. Maybe something else. Maybe all of it, depending on the specific level.

Now for some other things...

Since it's a flash game, it would be useful to make your players' first action not to press a keyboard button, but to click somewhere in the game, because otherwise it won't have keyboard focus and pressing 'X' over and over won't do a thing.

Also, not every keyboard layout is equal, there's the QWERTZ layout in Central Europe where the Y key replaces the Z key and vice-versa, so pressing Z and Y should have the same effect except for inputting text. Until now that's the only thing I was made aware of, but there might be others.

I realize how easy I have it. I have it easier than most, too. I am a native English speaker, I'm North American, and I am female. But here's where I resent what you have said: I don't ""teach"" English. I teach English. I'm a teacher. I am certified in English Language Arts and Reading, Social Studies, English as a Second Language, and Special Education. I have taught in a public school in my home country, and I didn't come here as a way to travel around the world. I came here because teaching is my chosen profession, and because the job market in my home state is not the greatest right now. My ESL teaching job is not by any means a joke job. I was only hired because I am a certified and experienced teacher. I take my job very seriously, as do my coteachers, the director of my school, and my other foreign colleague. My school has an excellent reputation in the city where I am, and we put a hell of a lot more effort into our lessons than even the public school teachers I know. 

As for not knowing a word of the local language, I actually studied Korean prior to leaving my country. I can read the language, and I can communicate fairly well in it. Am I supposed to feel bad for not having had the opportunity to study Korean from childhood the way Koreans often study English? Well, I don't.

His accent was so thick and he spoke so fast, I couldn't understand a word he was saying.  

Last one...I had an English professor in college who made it clear at the onset of the class that the final paper would be 75% of our grade.  I screwed off in class for the semester but when it came to that final paper, I buckled down and put some serious effort into it. 

The professor graded me an 'A' but crossed it out and replaced it with an F saying I cheated.  His reasoning was that my performance all semester was not indicative of someone who could write a paper worthy of an A in his class.  This F guaranteed I would fail the class and would be sitting in a summer school English class.

I took my argument to the Dean of the department and explained my story.  He seemed to believe what I was telling him but basically said my professor was tenured and there was not much I could do about his decision.  The upside is that I learned if there is a class you don't particularly like, take it in summer school.  There is only so much mysery that can be packed into 6 weeks.

Hi, I'm from Europe. To me Bill Maher's show (Real Time?) is frustrating because it's too right-wing. Bill Maher doesn't seem particularly progressive or liberal to me, and I've had to give up watching the show because I find it too frustrating.

Understand that from the outside, your politics (even the Democrats and third parties) are very right wing when compared to other western countries. The idea of even the Democrats being 'liberal' is preposterous. 

Then there is the very phrase 'liberal' - what does it even mean? In my country, 'liberal' could mean socially liberal or free-market liberal.
