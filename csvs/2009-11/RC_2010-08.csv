When you tunnel or chain a bunch of proxy servers together you can limit the information available about your connection.  This can occur in several ways.  First, the border issues that were already discussed within the comments will play a factor.  The obtaining of information across country lines will undoubtedly make it inherently more difficult for a government organization to obtain data related to the connection.  Additionally, several proxy servers are anonymous in regard to logging.  If you travel through a server that does not log connection information or removes such information on a frequent basis it will effectively remove any traces of you ""bouncing"" through it.  On a third note, proxy servers will identify you as coming from the last server hop which will help in avoiding any scripting on a specific website that might harvest this type of information.  For example, try accessing a site that redirects based upon geographic location using tor.

&gt; How many Japanese people did we gas to death, shoot to death, march to death, send death squads to seek them out? How many?

How many Jewish people do we claim they did this to?  Six million, on the dot, is the widely accepted number.  Do you know where that number comes from?  I suspect not.

&gt; Even without the Holocaust, there is still PLENTY of reasons to declare war on Germany, and PLENTY of reasons why the war was just. For starters, GERMANY FUCKING INVADED THE SOVEREIGN NATION OF POLAND. 

Some people are killed.  Your solution is to kill more people.  How many people died immediately at Hiroshima and Nagasaki?  How about Dresden?  There was one attack suffered one attack during the entire war on American soil, but Europe in its entirety was basically decimated.

&gt; Your argument is flawed in so many ways, and your logic is laced with stupidity. ""Let's declare war on Germany so Eisenhower can get elected"" is basically what you sound like. They declared war, they got beat. Deal with it. They killed mass amounts of Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and other races. Deal with it. There's a reason why the population of Jews suddenly DIPS during this time frame. They didn't all just magically ride a German rocket to Mars.

It doesn't ""dip,"" there were massive periods of emigration.   Some post-war surveys show an almost negligible drop in population, most of it attributable to war-time starvation.

I find that overall Sweden is a very open country towards immigrants. The thing with  the assimilation thing is that lots of immigrants tend to join up with other people from their countries.

That said, there are some suicides that come to mind that take the cake.  The first was caught live on tv during a press conference in the '60s - R. Budd Dwyer. [(still on the 'net)](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=860c9b9f3b)

The second was a 1980's suicide recorded by the guy himself.  Russian/Eastern-European dude in his late 40's/50's stammers about in his garage for about ten minutes in just his boxer shorts while waving a large 10 inch kitchen knife about in front of the camera.  He then lies face down on the floor, does a push-up, puts the tip of the blade to his sternum, then begins to slowly relax on it - it took a while, it wasn't pretty, but in the end he was quiet &amp; done. (never did figure out what his complaint was about)

The next would be ""how to commit suicide"".  At first, I thought, like most I suppose, that it was a joke or some kind of stunt.  It wasn't.  Long video from more than a decade ago - dude rattles off in front of cameras (2 - one near, one far) set-up outside for a while while chugging a nearly a litter of vodka while swallowing all sorts of pills, some kind of bottled poisons, and playing about with a pistol.  Good-n-drunk, he dowses himself in gas, puts a noose around his head, and steps over to a ledge, lights himself up, steps off in flames, part way down, pulls the trigger with the gun to his head, stops abruptly at the end of the rope, all-the-while burning, soon the rope snaps and his body falls another 80 or so feet onto some rough talus.

The last, is ""Asphyxia Suzha"".  This is a staged snuff film.  sort of.  Suzha is hanged by the neck until she stops moving.  her struggle lasts nearly 10 minutes.  This, being professionally done, is a BDSM stunt done at is most absolute extreme - Suzha most definitely dies/is dead - only moments later, off camera, does a professional medical team intervene.  Let's all hope she was paid well for that one! (still on the net: Asphyxia Suzha.mpg - download the torrent)

The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe; when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, **our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation**. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. **They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body**; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.

OK, let's see.  Here is the actual text:

&gt; 'Ich will heute wieder ein Prophet sein: Wenn es dem internationalen Finanzjudentum in und außerhalb Europas gelingen sollte, die Völker noch einmal in einem Weltkrieg zu stürzen dann wird das Ergebnis nicht die Bolschewisierung der Erde und damit der Sieg der Judentums sein sondern die Vernichtung der Jüdischen Rasse in Europa.'

My shitty (but impartial) translation:

' I want to be prophet today : If the international Finanzjudentum [Jewish financial interest] in and outside of Europe should succeed again to plummet the world into war, the result will then separate the peoples, not the Bolschewisierung [Bolshevization] of the earth, and thus the victory of the Judentums, but the destruction of the Jewish race in Europe.'

This is not a statement of intention, in any situation, nor even close to proof that six million people died.  I am concerned with proof.  He words this statement as if the people will spontaneously rise up, not as if he will lead them.  He is actually piggybacking on top of public anger at communists (remember, the bombing of the Reichstag that prompted Hitler's rise to power was blamed on Joseph van der Lubbe, an alleged communist), as well, thus the mention of Bolshevization (Bolschewisierung).  Much like 9/11, as is often noted.

&gt; ""Regarding the Jewish Question, the Führer is determined to clear the table. He warned the Jews that if they were to cause another world war, it would lead to their own destruction. Those were not empty words. Now the world war has come. The destruction of the Jews must be its necessary consequence. We cannot be sentimental about it. It is not for us to feel sympathy for the Jews. We should have sympathy rather with our own German people. If the German people have to sacrifice 160,000 victims in yet another campaign in the east, then those responsible for this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their lives.""-Joseph Goebbels

The same problems with this.  These are just quotes, accurate or not.  

&gt; Europe was decimated. Well, that's what happens when you invade/conquer Poland and France, attempt to conquer Russia, and bomb London to the ground. once again, they DECLARED WAR on the united States. Not the other way around.

Yes, and then we invented the nuclear weapon and killed probably upwards of a million people, many of them civilians.

&gt; Anyways, in 1933, roughly 9.5 million Jews lived in Europe. Over 60% of the world Jewish population today. In 1950 only 3.5 million Jews lived in Europe. And no, they didn't all just ""move away"". I'd say that's quite the ""dip"".

Waterloo is a great campus, and a really amazing city to live in. It's smaller than Toronto, so there's lots of greenspace and you can still see undeveloped land/agriculture, which is nice. Great area to be outside in, bike friendly, etc.  But in spite of being a smaller city, there are lots of cultural events and things to do.  There is no subway or anything, but they just got $ to build a LRT, and the bus system is pretty good.  

Similarly, Montreal was voted one of the happiest cities in the world, and for good reason.  And for some reason food and alcohol is cheaper there than in BC or Ontario (and you're allowed to drink wine with your picnic in the park, so the parks are full on summer nights of people eating/drinking/being merry).

As far as being wary of anything, I had some food that I wasn't terribly pleased with, the quality can be *very* disappointing but I think it's due to the quality of materials available.

You know what I hate about people like you, who don't like the fact that the US is a perfect democracy? You're only against this when it's ""bad"" for you. I bet you think Brown vs The Board of Education is a good ruling, and yet it is exactly the minority, at that time, imposing it's views on the majority in those states. You have no problems imposing your beliefs on others, and you believe your beliefs are the right ones. Your only argument is that your beliefs are the majority, but you give no argument as to why you have the right to impose your beliefs on the minority.

And you are misrepresenting what the power of those senators actually is. They are not ""ruling"", they are preventing what they do not want to happen. That is very different from being given the power to pass whatever they wish, which is what I would say is ruling. As for their ability to block things, no, I see nothing wrong with that.

&gt;The Senate is only bad if you do not agree that individuals should not be considered more or less important by their government based on where they live. If you believe that everyone should be equal, and that someone in Wyoming should not be worth 68 times as much as someone in California, then you should be opposed to the Senate.

Bullshit. If the law, which would apply to the entire states, is so onerous to these states that they will fight so hard to block it, then it should fail. It should, then, become a state matter. They are not making it illegal for you to make it a state matter, and don't bother making the argument that the states don't have the money.

Consider the reverse, what if it was the conservatives in the majority who wanted to pass anti-abortion laws, or wanted to teach creationism in all schools. Would it not then be a good thing to have these blocks? It's called checks and balances for a fucking reason.

I feel safe in stating that my high school had both better faculty and better students. We were in a middle-class suburban area, and there were 500 kids in my graduating class. We certainly had more AP courses (one of my favorites was AP Chemistry, taught by an amazing fellow). Perhaps I can give a little perspective.

&gt; While others sat in class and doodled to later become great artists, I sat in class to take notes and become a great test-taker. While others would come to class without their homework done because they were reading about an interest of theirs, I never missed an assignment. While others were creating music and writing lyrics, I decided to do extra credit, even though I never needed it. So, I wonder, why did I even want this position?

At my public (albeit not inner-city) school, the smartest kids did not fit this profile.

Create your own class. Yes, it was great.), rather than dutifully plowing our way though ""honors"" courses. Sounds like Erica's just bitter she wasted her time. Sorry your school sucked, Erica!

As ""Pat"" said on the comments page,

&gt; You don’t become a great artist by [simply] doodling in class. She likes to think that to explain away her lack of extracurricular talents. She’s not open to the possibility that she could’ve still been valedictorian while developing other talents. Plenty do.

Pretty much. This is why top postsecondary schools put such a large focus on extracurriculars. Anyone can simply work *really* hard and become valedictorian - moreso if your school is weaker. The valedictorian of my class was able to pursue extracurriculars and other interests. He didn't jump at every extra credit opportunity or spend hours on easy projects.

No, it would not. 99% of the Senate is already conservative, this isn't an argument made for or against a particular party or political alignment, it's an argument made for equal rights.

The Council has the same issues as the Senate in the US, but it has very limited power compared to the Parliament. Ultimately I'd like to see the Council removed from the EU, and the EU as an entity grow while also becoming more unified, but its certainly a better and more democratic system than the US as it stands.

I'm sure you know, however, that you are making a rather weak argument.

http://www.slowtrav.com -- more for older people who are going to take their time and stay in one place for a while, BUT there are some great guides and trip reports. This is where I learned how to pay for parking in Italy... stuff like that! Lots of info about phones, too, as I recall. Any info you need about driving restrictions and international phone issues for most of western Europe should probably be somewhere on there. If you don't find it on the actual site, there's a good forum there too.

http://www.hihostels.com -- Hostelling International. 

http://www.raileurope.com -- pertinent info about rail passes and point-to-point tickets. 


(Sorry my suggestions here are all out of order... it's late, and I'm too tired/old/lazy to re-organize them!)

Passport--I always carry mine with me, usually in a little pocket INSIDE my clothes or pinned into one of the pockets of my jeans. Take your passport very seriously... and make sure you have emailed your passport number etc. to yourself in case it gets lost or stolen and you have to get a new one in a hurry.

Hostels--dorm beds are cheapest. Fun, too. Some hostels have huge dorm rooms; others have 4-6 person rooms. I like the smaller ones better. Just make sure there's a safe place to lock up your stuff. Private rooms are OK, but meeting people is half the fun, I think. 

Money: GET a checking account. Make sure your PIN number has the right number of digits to work in Europe. Check with your bank to see what kind of extra fees get tacked on when you withdraw cash. Don't flash money around--keep a little bit close at hand, and the rest zipped away. Oh, and before you go, let your bank know the dates of your trip--that way their fraud alert system won't automatically shut your card down when it sees that it's being used outside your usual area! 

Knife: NO. No way. PLEASE don't even think about this. Just don't travel with anything you value enough that it'll break your heart if you lose it. Documents can be replaced. Don't carry too much cash. Don't wear flashy jewelry of any kind. Have copies of all the phone numbers you'd need to call if your ATM card or passport gets stolen, or have someone at home ready to give you that info at a moment's notice. Travel smart, keep your wits about you, and don't wander down dark alleys at night! Watch out for scam artists, gypsies, and people who ""spill"" drinks or sunscreen on you and then help you ""wipe it off."" They nearly got me with that one... fortunately my wallet was pinned into my pocket. 

Travel as light as possible... they do have laundromats over there. This may sound dumb, but because I always acquire stuff during a trip, I tend to take old t-shirts/underwear along and then throw them out as I go to free up space! Less laundry to worry about, and you always get new t-shirts along the way. And you can buy new and exotic European underwear if you run out! 

Your equipment: can you make the expensive camera look any less obvious--put it in a beat-up backpack or something?? 

Itinerary: If it were me, I'd spend fewer days in Paris and hop a night train to Italy for a couple of days in Florence and/or Venice. Great places for photography, and if you take a night train you aren't wasting a travel day. You'll only get a taste of those places, but it'll make you want to come back for more! Come on... you can't go all that way and not go to Italy!!! (I know a great cheap hotel in Florence if you need one!) 

Language: At least make an effort. Greet people in their own language. Learn how to say ""I'm sorry, I don't speak X. Do you speak English?"" in various languages. Take a phrasebook. As long as you show willing, people will generally help you out. Unfortunately, I found Parisians somewhat LESS helpful in that regard than people absolutely everywhere else!

Paris: PLEASE don't miss Ste. Chapelle. PLEASE. And the Musee de Cluny, if you're into medieval stuff. And honestly, three days in the Louvre isn't necessary, unless you're one of those people who has to stare endlessly at EVERY damn painting for half an hour. Get a guide ahead of time, target the specific things you really don't want to miss, and then just wander through as your interest takes you... stop when you discover something wonderful! There's no quiz at the end. And honestly, I love the Musee d'Orsay more than the Louvre, even though it's way smaller.

Food: Find the local market and pack picnics. Cheap and wonderful. 

Usual disclaimer... your mileage may vary on all this. It's just what has worked for me in the past (many visits, starting in my teens, and most recently in my late 30s!). Have a wonderful trip--I'm so envious! ",0,,1280644800,False,t3_cw14v,t3_cw14v,t5_2qh41,,1426403911,travel,

Packing -- 3 solid days worth of clothes. Be prepared to wash out in sinks &amp; dry on towel rails. Wear comfy walking shoes, pack nice party shoes, but no more than that. Consider rain. Consider that you will likely buy a t-shirt or something on your travels.

Make copies of the ID page of your passport and keep one in your luggage, one at home with a family member (to fax if you lose yours). I used to email myself a colour scan of mine, along with all travel plans.

 Use [this](http://www.tripadvisor.com/) to vet your choices.

Food -- try not to eat out all the time. Go to the market and make simple meals. Eat them on park benches, if you want.

Cellphones -- do you really need this? Seriously, leave them at home. Go have some fun and stay disconnected from the world for a bit.

Join Fodors.com and ask for some advice over there on the European forum, but first search their database of previously answered questions. Better to have something specific to ask when you do go for it.

Lastly, soak in the experience. Life is a banquet, take big bites.

They already did that once.  Palestine used to not be a Jewish state.  European immigrants changed the status to a Jewish state.  So you can't really ask just that one question.  Instead:

Should the immigrants have ever changed the status in the first place?

Would it be wise to change the status again?

I'd be curious as to your answers to the questions.  Mine would be no and no.   

&gt;Why aren't you asking Saudi Arabia not be a Muslim state? 

Saudi Arabia is a despicable nation in so many ways.  If Israel's claim to fame is being less despicable than Saudi Arabia then they must be pretty awful.  

&gt;The Israelis will not change the character of their country.

This is obviously correct.  

&gt;Jews are not foreigners to the Land of Israel.

The ones that immigrated in the 1890's - 1940's were.

Be warned, though. Ferguson is very much a court historian. He eschews real controversey and has written a lenghty three-part *authorized* biography of the Rothschild family.

As I can recall, Ferguson makes it seem as if Bolshevik Russia and the Red Terror were waged by ethnic Russians against minority populations in the USSR. Clearly that's a colossal distortion.

So, Erica's graduating class was only around 125 people, if not less. They offer only ""American History, Art, Biology, Calculus, English, European History, and Physics"" AP courses.

I feel safe in stating that my high school had both better faculty and better students. We were in a middle-class suburban area, and there were 500 kids in my graduating class. We certainly had more AP courses (one of my favorites was AP Chemistry, taught by an amazing fellow). Perhaps I can give a little perspective.

&gt; While others sat in class and doodled to later become great artists, I sat in class to take notes and become a great test-taker. While others would come to class without their homework done because they were reading about an interest of theirs, I never missed an assignment. While others were creating music and writing lyrics, I decided to do extra credit, even though I never needed it. So, I wonder, why did I even want this position? Sure, I earned it, but what will come of it?

&gt; I have no interests because I saw every subject of study as work, and I excelled at every subject just for the purpose of excelling, not learning.

At my public (albeit not inner-city) school, the smartest kids did not fit this profile. Of course, we were busy challenging ourselves with AP courses (taught by very capable faculty) or independent studies (Pick any topic (within reason of course - ""Contemporary Gaming Culture"" or ""Analyzing The Wire"" would be approved while ""Pornography"" certainly wouldn't). Create your own class. Yes, it was great.), rather than dutifully plowing our way though ""honors"" courses. Sounds like Erica's just bitter she wasted her time. Sorry your school sucked, Erica!

As ""Pat"" said on the comments page,

&gt; You don’t become a great artist by [simply] doodling in class. She likes to think that to explain away her lack of extracurricular talents. She’s not open to the possibility that she could’ve still been valedictorian while developing other talents. Plenty do.

Pretty much. This is why top postsecondary schools put such a large focus on extracurriculars. Anyone can simply work *really* hard and become valedictorian - moreso if your school is weaker. The valedictorian of my class was able to pursue extracurriculars and other interests. He didn't jump at every extra credit opportunity or spend hours on easy projects.

&gt;*In 1946, the total population of Palestine was 1,972,0000 inhabitants, comprising 1,247,000 Palestinians and 608,000 Jews, as well as 16,000 others. The Jewish population was composed primarily of foreign-born immigrants, originating mostly from Poland, Russia and Central Europe. Only one third of these immigrants had acquired Palestinian citizenship. With respect to land ownership, it appears from the government of Palestine's Village Statistics that the Jews then owned 1,491 square kilometers (exclusive of urban property) out of a total of 26,323 square kilometers in Palestine. **Thus, Jewish land ownership amounted to 5.6% of the total area of the country**. In contrast, the Palestinians owned the rest of Palestine, including all the areas that were categorised as public domain. Moreover, the territory allocated to the Jewish State included the coastal plain extending from Akka to Ashdod and other fertile lands, while the Palestinians, an agricultural people, were left mainly with mountainous and arid regions.*

This why all land ownership arguments are essentially garbage - despite the Zionists' best efforts, they were only able to obtain a fraction of the total land through legal means.

Rarely did a Jew think it was necessary to learn Polish; rarely was a Jew interested in Polish history or Polish politics. … Even in the last few years it was still a rare occurrence that a Jew would speak Polish well. **Out of three million Jews living in Poland, two-and-a-half million were not able to write a simple letter in Polish and they spoke [Polish] very poorly.** There are hundreds of thousands of Jews in Poland to whom Polish was as unfamiliar as Turkish.

Many Jews who became residents of the reborn Polish state in the aftermath of World War I were in fact opposed to Polish rule and the concept of Polish nationhood. **They would only settle for living in Poland under one condition: full autonomy, which meant separation from the “Other”—their Polish neighbours.**

Zionists, who dominated the joint committee of East European Jewish delegations at the [Paris]Peace Conference and enjoyed the support of the American Jewish Congress,** demanded that Poland … recognize their Jewish residents as members of a distinct nation, with the right to collective representation at both state and international levels.**

This would entail the creation of a separate Jewish parliament in Poland, alongside a state parliament representing all the country’s inhabitants, and it would mean the creation of a Jewish seat at the League of Nations.

In demanding formal, corporate, political/diplomatic status for a territorially dispersed nation, as distinct from a state, the Zionists were challenging traditional notions about the indivisibility of state sovereignty.

The undersigned was connected with Poland for generations, but his father did not know more than two words in Polish. And it never even occurred to him that there was something amiss in that.

Bashevis Singer again returned to this theme in the March 20, 1964 issue of Forverts: “My mouth could not get accustomed to the soft consonants of that [Polish] language. My forefathers have lived for centuries in Poland but in reality I was a foreigner, with separate language, ideas and religion. I sensed the oddness of this situation and often considered moving to Palestine.”

c0vpfzu,t1_c0vpfzu,0,1,0,False,True,juneaud,1,"&gt; I'm hoping to get some ideas on where to go in the major cities (both my friend and I are photographers.) We will probably be staying in the cities and if we travel we'll probably try to get back to where we're staying to avoid moving laptop/clothes often.

read travel books

&gt; How much I can expect to pay for food/lodging (I plan on using Hostels but I don't know how that works besides reserving a spot and going.) I guess I'll be using Hostel.com, I didn't know if this was the preferred way of finding hostels. Also, when a hostel has private rooms for say $30, can you usually find a room with 2 beds for a little more? Do Hostels usually have meals? How far ahead do people usually book hostels? I seriously have a lot of questions.... and I'll probably edit and add another hostel question haha

use hostelbookers.com, or get a hostelling international card (hihostels have kitchens in their buildings, cooking instead of eating out will save you money)

&gt; Travel, I have always been told trains are the way to go, and I don't know how much they cost and how many places they go, trying to figure out a travel/lodging budget if you can't tell

it varies by country, but public transportation in europe is very good, whether it be bus, train, or boat. $1500 - $2000 should be enough to cover everything for a month in europe (food, transport, lodging, anything else you spend your money on)

&gt; Language, my friend and I are both native English speakers, I took a few years of French and can read it, my friend took a few years of Spanish but I don't know how much he remembers. I don't know what to expect in terms of a language barrier. I mean, is it considered rude to try to speak to someone in english at a store, etc? or even immediately greet them in English.

parisians hate everyone thats not from paris (well apparently this is only during tourist season), but yeah try your best to speak french in france though most people will speak at least broken english. 

&gt; Tourist traps? I imagine if anything I'd be ripped off by not knowing the language/area, but it will be in winter so I imagine I'll be able to skip a lot of that. How safe will I be carrying a camera, laptop and clothes place to place?

most of europe is safer than the U.S. just be mindful of your belongings. not that you have to worry about it, just dont be a total idiot with your shit. 

&gt; Is it worth it to carry a knife or something else for protection?

no, europeans are much more civilized than us

Whats traveling light? I know personal effects and the like, but how many days of clothes do people normally take? We'll basically be backpacking, one bag with camera gear and a second with laptop and clothes, but I generally can't wake up and operate without a shower in the morning. Not to mention we'll be wearing coats and everything to stay warm

bring lots of underwear and socks, and two pairs of pants/your coats. buy some fast drying undies meant for traveling at an outdoors store like rei. 

&gt; Passport, how much do I need to worry about it? I know some people that freak out about it and keep it under lock in key (and almost in their underwear.) Day to day, will I need it or can I leave it with wherever I've locked up my laptop?

leave it with your stuff but keep your drivers license/state issued id with you

&gt; Cellphones? We each have an iPhone through AT&amp;T so I imagine even considering using that would get us roaming fees out the ass. Can we purchase a pre-paid phone that will work in the UK/Ireland/France? For international calling we'll get some Skype going. I'd really like to check this out if theres a place online I can look at for european prepaid phones

you can get a pre-paid phone or new sim cards in every country. but you're traveling, let go of your comforts and conveniences and immerse yourself in the culture!!

&gt; Outside of meals/traveling, how much money do you guys take for anything else? And how do you take it? I honestly don't even have a checking account.

ATM card is a must, you'll be fucked with out it. get an ATM card and credit card

&gt; Drinking? What kind of ID works? Not that I want to get drunk, but I figure it's better to know then not.

any kind of ID with your picture and birthday but just have your drivers license on you. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DONT WANT TO GET DRUNK YOURE GOING TO ENGLAND AND FRANCE FOR FUCK SAKES ALL THEY DO IS DRINK BEER AND WINE ALL DAY!!! just kdding. but seriously, take advantage of the drinking laws there, you can't drink for another 3 years here. just dont get too out of hand with it

&gt; Right now I plan on flying into London and spending a week in England, I would like to see the white cliffs of dover. Next stop would be Ireland for probably 5 days. I know I want to see the cliffs over the sea... Randy Olson, a NG photographer took a great photograph but I have no idea where it was... so I'll have to ask him that &gt;.&lt; So that's up in arms at the minute, if it's out of the way, we'll probably just spend a few days in London

consider edinburgh as well. you should buy travel books on the places you're going to visit (a simple amazon search, england 2010 travel or whatever) and check out lonelyplanet.com

&gt; After Ireland I was thinking of heading to Paris and spending 10 days there (I've been told it takes a solid three days to go through the Louvre) and heading to Strasbourg for the award for 5 days or so (I'm getting 3 days of paid hotel rooms there, so I figure I'll stay haha.) 

instead of spending ten days in paris check out spain or north italy for a few days (keep in mind the train rides are fairly short 2-6 hours from country to country) paris is cool, but you're not gonna wanna spend three days in the louvre, unless you have a degree in art history the louvre gets boring really fast. five days in paris is enough to see all the sights plus more

&gt; From there I'd like to go to Switzerland for a few days and then to Paris and fly back from Paris. We may not stay in Paris for the remaining 8 days or so, if we enjoy Paris we'll probably stay there, but I wouldn't mind stopping in Switzerland on the way back.

that would be sweet

&gt; P.P.S. I have a feeling my friend and I will have an interesting schedule when we head out, the best time to photograph is early morning and before sunset, so I imagine we'll be sleeping midday and then staying out at night to shoot (both enjoy night photography.) If anyone has done this, any comments on things that are weird just in terms of going around at odd hours?

i don't know how important its going to be to catch early morning/afternoon light. you're gonna be there during the winter, it might be gray for that entire month

&gt; Additional Hostel question, what is a dorm compared to a private in a hostel? could my friend and I share a room for the dorm price, or would we each have to pay and we'd get a dorm for 2/3 the price of 2 privates?

privates usually sleep 1-2 people, dorms usually from 3+. hostels charge per person and its not as easy as sneaking a person into a room in a hostel since youre in a much smaller space.

The following 3 paragraphs are a summary/paraphrase of what james madison, aka the father of the constitution,  wrote about all this in the federalist papers and in a letter to thomas jefferson:


the primary purpose of the constitution and the federal govt is creates is to preserve wealth inequality by preventing democracy. The senate is the primary way of doing this, along with the enlargement of the voting district and the checks and balances and the separation of powers.


 These aforementioned aspects of the federal govt will keep the people from uniting and discovering their common interests, and this is how the constitution and the federal govt it creates will disable democracy and keep the people from taking the wealth of the rich people (like madison and jefferson and hamilton etc). The way to rule the people is to ""divide et impera."" 


The constitution does just that. It divides by enlarging political districts and thereby increasing the number of factions in each district, and thus the majority will not be able to unite and rise up against the ""opulent minority"" of the rich (the rich like madison, jefferson, etc).

Madison was worth well over 50 million dollars in today's dollars when he came into his inheritance. Jefferson also was worth tens of millions at the height of his wealth. The other influential framers were also quite wealthy.

I agree Turkey will strengthen the EU and garner badly needed points from the Muslim world but I think there would be great negatives too and for both the EU and Turkey.

Turkey in the Crossroads or cross hairs: A model for the middle east to follow or a set-up for additional future middle east crisis? In the 1920s, with the Ottoman Empire in ruins, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk imposed Western laws, replaced Arabic script with the Latin alphabet, banned Islamic dress and granted women the right to vote.

The ruling party, however, has supported religious schools and tried to lift the ban on Islamic head scarves in public offices and schools. Secularists are also uncomfortable with the idea of Gul's wife, Hayrunisa, being in the presidential palace because she wears the traditional Muslim head scarf.''We don't want a covered woman in Ataturk's presidential palace,'' said Ayse Bari, a 67-year-old housewife. ''We want civilized, modern people there.''

With the Religious fervor having been awoken in my mind largely by Bush's attack on Iraq and our intrusion into middle east politics wherever we can and the ever growing call for a return to Islamic values in the middle east and in the entire Islamic world I find it spectacular that Turkey believes it can go its own way and be allowed to be secular and hopefully become a member of the EU.

c0vprtv,t1_c0vprtv,0,-1,0,False,True,kantut,-1,"1). The Roman Catholic Church isn't WalMart or Burger King; it's the Body of Christ.

2). Catholic priests, nuns, sisters/brothers and laity aren't employees; we are members of the Body of Christ.

3). The doctrine and dogma of the Catholic Church are not consumer products that the Church's employees sell to those who want them; Catholic doctrine and dogma express the unchanging truth of the faith.

4). Life in a Catholic parish is not a trip to Disney Land or Target or McDonald's where your consumer needs and whims are catered to by the whimpering clergy and lay staff; parish life is the life of Christ for the local Catholic family.

5). You do not come into the Catholic Church b/c you like the building better than you like the Methodist chapel; or because the priest at the Catholic parish is cuter than the Baptist preacher; or because you heard that the homilies are shorter at St. Bubba's by the Lake than they are at the Unitarian Church. You come into the Catholic Church because you believe that the Catholic faith is the truth of the gospel taught by Christ himself and given to his apostles.

6). Leaving the Catholic Church because a priest was mean to you, or because sister whacked you with a ruler, or because the church secretary looked at you funny is as stupid as giving up on the truths of math because you hate your high school algebra teacher. Why would anyone let a crazy priest or a cranky nun or anyone else for the matter drive you out of the faith you believe is true? My only conclusion: you never thought it was true to begin with; or, you have a favorite sin the Church teaches against and crazy priests and cranky nuns is as good an excuse as any to leave and pursue your sin all the while feeling justified b/c Father and/or Sister are such jerks.

7). Anyone who comes in the Catholic Church thinking that they will find clouds of angels at Mass dressed as parishioners; hordes of perfect saints kneeling for communion; seminaries packed with angelic young men burning to be priests; a parish hall stacked to the ceiling with morally pure people eager to serve; and a priest without flaw or blemish, well, you're cracked and you probably need to go back and try again. Telling Catholics that they aren't perfect makes as much sense as telling fish they're wet. We know already. Move on.

8). Of the hundreds of priests and religious I know, I know two who could count as saints right now. The rest of us are deeply flawed, impure, struggling creatures who know all too well that we fail utterly to meet the basic standards of holiness. For that matter: so do you. Get in line.

9). The Catholic Church owes no one a revision of her doctrine or dogma. She didn't change to save most of Europe from becoming Protestant, why would you imagine that she would change just to get you in one of her parishes?

10). If you want to become Catholic, do it. But do it because you think the Church teaches the true faith. If a cranky priest on a blogsite is enough to keep you from embracing the truth of the faith, then two things are painfully clear: 1) you do not believe the Church teaches the faith; 2) and you care more about expressing your hurt consumer feelings than you do for your immortal soul.

To me China is not good- too much of a real estate/asset bubble in place. US is a rollar coaster. Thailand may be a good bet as it's suffering due to the recent unrest, but I feel the baht is too strong so any gains could be offset by exchange rate losses. I don't know enough about Europe to invest there.

Long term I'd say Indonesia and the China domestic market. Korea looks positive to me, at least I'm impressed by what the folks at Samsung, LG, Hyundai, and others are doing these days in terms of products. 

There are some real estate opportunities. For example in Thailand people put down lots of money to buy units off plan but they don't have the cash to actually purchase the unit- so they need to sell their units to recoup as much as possible from the deposits they've put down.

To give you an example, I know of one building where owners paid 30% of the purchase price in anticipation of prices increasing when the building was completed. Now folks are willing to sell at a discount- meaning they will lose a portion of that money just to get out of the deal (and not lose all of it). 

So units are selling below the original cost- but I still feel in many of these buildings that the current sale price doesn't reflect a good investment over the next few years. It could take 5 years for prices to rebound to where they were before (not where people expected them to be) and in the meantime rental yields are low and it's difficult to find tenants.

Instead I'm looking more into business opportunities. There are definitely some here in Thailand that I'd like to explore- it'll keep me active and it (should) give me a better return than the markets.",0,,1280676258,False,t3_cw1hz,t1_c0vprtj,t5_2qzb6,,1426404176,IAmA,

Second KKK
In 1915, the second Klan was founded. It grew rapidly nationwide after 1921 in response to a period of postwar social tensions, where industrialization in the North had attracted numerous waves of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and the Great Migration of Southern blacks and whites. The second KKK preached racism, anti-Catholicism, anti-Communism, nativism, and antisemitism. Some local groups took part in attacks on private houses, and carried out other violent activities. The violent episodes were generally in the South.[6]
The second Klan was a formal fraternal organization, with a national and state structure. At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization claimed to include about 15% of the nation's eligible population, approximately 4–5 million men. Internal divisions, criminal behavior by leaders, and external opposition brought about a collapse in membership, which had dropped to about 30,000 by 1930. It finally faded away in the 1940s.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_heating#Water_heater_safety

&gt; There are two seemingly conflicting safety issues around water heater temperature—the risk of scalding from excessively hot water, and the risk of incubating bacteria colonies, particularly Legionella, in water that is not hot enough to kill them. Both risks are potentially life threatening and are balanced by setting the water heater's thermostat to at least 50 °C (120 °F).

One can't really say ALL indian people smell, I've been around some whose smell range from nothing to aromatically fragrant.      
At homes, you could most often smell the spices that they use; these aroma (or pungent-ness) stick to clothes and stuff. If the household fancies spices like garlic, cumin, and onion then the home would definitely smell of those and sometimes if they use it very often, secrete off their skin (just like any other person, no matter the race or ethnicity who would eat those in heavy amounts). I've been to homes where they also fancy the use of incense - no, not your typical Cool Waters or Lilac&amp;Lavender but Auroshikha, Darshan and Satya Sai Baba ""Nag Champa"" Agarbatti just to name a few- which to our noses seem foreign (i've grown fond to some of it).

Our citizenry includes people of latin american origin, so I see nothing that indicates the literacy rates will decrease with the injection of immigrants. Evidence: They have increased throughout America's existence, which is an existence of loads and loads of immigrants.

&gt;Not necessarily. There will always be ""poor people"" in an economy with some free market principles; the problem is when there are too many poor people and their job market becomes too competitive.

Give me some evidence that this is the case. Even if I grant the premise, the problem of the poor population increasing has far more to do with natural citizens breeding at higher rates than it does with immigrants. Immigrants are a drop in the bucket compared to reproduction rates for impoverished citizens.

&gt;Which is largely due to all the low tech manufacturing jobs moving away and the ""menial"" job market being over-flooded with prospective workers, thus driving down wages and work conditions.

If that were true, then social mobility would have been higher when manufacturing jobs were more prevalent. I've never seen anything that indicates that. In fact, I'm pretty sure that social mobility has increased with the death of manufacturing like it did with the death of agriculture. Those workers that aren't in those industries are now forced through economic pressures to learn the skills of the tertiary sector of the economy: service jobs. However, we have not kept pace with many European nations and thus our social mobility is low in comparison to other developed nations. Admittedly, this is all a bit beside the point.

&gt;Yes, I understand that. And I'm not saying we don't currently have quite a few useless retards in this country. However, they are a tiny minority; adding tens of millions (see: illegals) more of them seems to be poor nation planning.

I don't know where ""useless retards"" came into it, but what I was talking about was the lower class in America, which certainly aren't a minority. The same class that immigrants would belong to. Immigrants make up a drop in the bucket of social burden on America. If social burden is the problem, in the form of the use of social programs, and we're not simply being xenophobic, then I don't understand why we aren't talking about the larger problem here: natural citizens using social programs.

**Page 1**

KERAVA, Finland— Going by the numbers, Antti Syvajarvi is a loser. He is a prison inmate in Finland -- the country that jails fewer of its citizens than any other in the European Union.

Still, he counts himself fortunate.

''If I have to be a prisoner,'' he said, ''I'm happy I'm one in Finland because I trust the Finnish system.''

So, evidently, do law-abiding Finns, even though their system is Europe's most lenient and would probably be the object of soft-on-criminals derision in many societies outside of the Nordic countries.

In polls measuring what national institutions they admire the most, Finns put their criminal-coddling police in the No. 1 position.

The force is the smallest in per capita terms in Europe, but it has a corruption-free reputation and it solves 90 percent of its serious crimes.

''I know this system sounds like a curiosity,'' said Markku Salminen, a former beat patrolman and homicide detective who is now the director general of the prison service in charge of punishments. ''But if you visit our prisons and walk our streets, you will see that this very mild version of law enforcement works. I don't blame other countries for having harsher systems because they have different histories and politics, but this model works for us.''

Finland, a relatively classless culture with a Scandinavian belief in the benevolence of the state and a trust in its civic institutions, is something of a laboratory for gentle justice. The kinds of economic and social disparities that can produce violence don't exist in Finland's welfare state society, street crime is low, and law enforcement officials can count on support from an uncynical public.

Look in on Finland's penal institutions, whether those the system categorizes as ''open'' or ''closed,'' and it is hard to tell when you've entered the world of custody. ''This is a closed prison,'' Esko Aaltonen, warden of the Hameenlinna penitentiary, said in welcoming a visitor. ''But you may have noticed you just drove in, and there was no gate blocking you.''

Walls and fences have been removed in favor of unobtrusive camera surveillance and electronic alert networks. Instead of clanging iron gates, metal passageways and grim cells, there are linoleum-floored hallways lined with living spaces for inmates that resemble dormitory rooms more than lockups in a slammer.

Guards are unarmed and wear either civilian clothes or uniforms free of emblems like chevrons and epaulettes. ''There are 10 guns in this prison, and they are all in my safe,'' Mr. Aaltonen said.

''The only time I take them out is for transfer of prisoners.''

At the ''open'' prisons, inmates and guards address each other by first name. Prison superintendents go by nonmilitary titles like manager or governor, and prisoners are sometimes referred to as ''clients'' or, if they are youths, ''pupils.''

''We are parents, that's what we are,'' said Kirsti Njeminen, governor of the Kerava prison that specializes in rehabilitating young offenders like Mr. Syvajarvi.

Generous home leaves are available, particularly as the end of a sentence nears, and for midterm inmates, there are houses on the grounds, with privacy assured, where they can spend up to four days at a time with visiting spouses and children.

''We believe that the loss of freedom is the major punishment, so we try to make it as nice inside as possible,'' said Merja Toivonen, a supervisor at Hameenlinna.

Natalia Leppamaki, 39, a Russian immigrant convicted of drunken driving, switched off a sewing machine she was using to make prison clothing and picked up on Ms. Toivonen's point. ''Here you have work, you can eat and you can do sports, but home is home, and I don't think you'll see me in here again,'' she said.

Thirty years ago, Finland had a rigid model, inherited from neighboring Russia, and one of the highest rates of imprisonment in Europe.

 ''Finnish criminal policy is exceptionally expert-oriented,'' said Tapio Lappi-Seppala, director of the National Research Institute of Legal Policy. ''We believe in the moral-creating and value-shaping effect of punishment instead of punishment as retribution.''

He asserted that over the last two decades, more than 40,000 Finns had been spared prison, $20 million in costs had been saved, and the crime rate had gone down to relatively low Scandinavian levels.

Mr. Salminen, the prison service director, pulled out a piece of paper and drew three horizontal lines. ''This first level is self-control, the second is social control and the third is officer control. In Finland,'' he explained, ''we try to intervene at this first level so people won't get to the other two.''

The men and women who work in the prisons also back the softer approach. ''There are officers who were here 20 and 30 years ago, and they say it was much tougher to work then, with more people trying to escape and more prison violence,'' said Kaisa Tammi-Moilanen, 32, governor of the open ward at Hameenlinna.

She conceded that there were people who took advantage of the leniency. Risto Nikunen, 41, a grizzled drifter who has never held a job and has been in prison 11 times, was asked outside his drug rehabilitation unit if he might be one of them. ''Well,'' he shrugged, ''many people do come to prison to take a break and try to get better again.''

Prison officials can give up to 20 days solitary confinement to inmates as punishment for infractions like fighting or possessing drugs, though the usual term is from three to five days. Mr. Aaltonen said he tried to avoid even that by first talking out the problem with the offending inmate.

Finnish courts mete out four general punishments -- a fine, a conditional sentence, which amounts to probation, community service and an unconditional sentence. Even this last category is made less harsh by a practice of letting prisoners out after only half their term is served. Like the rest of the countries of the European Union, Finland has no death penalty.

According to the Ministry of Justice in Helsinki, there are a little more than 2,700 prisoners in Finland, a country of 5.2 million people, or 52 for every 100,000 inhabitants. Ministry figures show the comparable rate is 702 per 100,000 in the United States, 664 in Russia and 131 in Portugal, the highest in the European Union.

Finland's chief worry now is the rise in drug-related crimes that do result in prison sentences and the growing number of Russians and Estonians, who Mr. Lappi-Seppala said were introducing organized-crime activities into Finland.

Finns credit their press and their politicians with keeping the law-and- order debate civil and not strident. ''Our newspapers are not full of sex and crime,'' Mr. Salminen said. ''And there is no pressure on me to get tough on criminals from populist-issue politicians like there would be in a lot of other countries.''

One reason why the Finnish public may tolerate their policy of limited punishment is that victims receive compensation payments from the government. Mrs. Tammi-Moilanen was asked if this was enough to keep them from getting angry over the system of gentle justice.

''My feeling is that victims wouldn't feel that justice is better done by giving very severe punishment,'' she said. ''We don't believe in an eye for an eye, we are a bit more civilized than that, I hope.''

Mr. Syvajarvi, a muscular 21-year-old with close-cropped hair who become a heroin addict at age 14, received a six-year sentence for drug selling and assaults. As a young offender, he will serve only a third of that time, and he is expected to be out in a year.

He is now the appointed ''big brother'' peer counselor to other youths in the jail, must submit to random drug checks to make sure he remains off the habit and has undergone training with anger management specialists that he says has prepared him to rejoin society with a new outlook.

''Before, I wanted to be like those drug dealers in the States,'' he said, adding in English, ''I was a gangster wannabe.'' He went into a boxer's crouch and popped punches in the air. ''I used to think the most important thing was to stand up for yourself.

''Now I've learned that it takes more courage to run away.''

KERAVA, Finland— Going by the numbers, Antti Syvajarvi is a loser. He is a prison inmate in Finland -- the country that jails fewer of its citizens than any other in the European Union.

Still, he counts himself fortunate.

''If I have to be a prisoner,'' he said, ''I'm happy I'm one in Finland because I trust the Finnish system.''

So, evidently, do law-abiding Finns, even though their system is Europe's most lenient and would probably be the object of soft-on-criminals derision in many societies outside of the Nordic countries.

In polls measuring what national institutions they admire the most, Finns put their criminal-coddling police in the No. 1 position.

The force is the smallest in per capita terms in Europe, but it has a corruption-free reputation and it solves 90 percent of its serious crimes.

''I know this system sounds like a curiosity,'' said Markku Salminen, a former beat patrolman and homicide detective who is now the director general of the prison service in charge of punishments. ''But if you visit our prisons and walk our streets, you will see that this very mild version of law enforcement works. I don't blame other countries for having harsher systems because they have different histories and politics, but this model works for us.''

Finland, a relatively classless culture with a Scandinavian belief in the benevolence of the state and a trust in its civic institutions, is something of a laboratory for gentle justice. The kinds of economic and social disparities that can produce violence don't exist in Finland's welfare state society, street crime is low, and law enforcement officials can count on support from an uncynical public.

Look in on Finland's penal institutions, whether those the system categorizes as ''open'' or ''closed,'' and it is hard to tell when you've entered the world of custody. ''This is a closed prison,'' Esko Aaltonen, warden of the Hameenlinna penitentiary, said in welcoming a visitor. ''But you may have noticed you just drove in, and there was no gate blocking you.''

Walls and fences have been removed in favor of unobtrusive camera surveillance and electronic alert networks. Instead of clanging iron gates, metal passageways and grim cells, there are linoleum-floored hallways lined with living spaces for inmates that resemble dormitory rooms more than lockups in a slammer.

Guards are unarmed and wear either civilian clothes or uniforms free of emblems like chevrons and epaulettes. ''There are 10 guns in this prison, and they are all in my safe,'' Mr. Aaltonen said.

''The only time I take them out is for transfer of prisoners.''

At the ''open'' prisons, inmates and guards address each other by first name. Prison superintendents go by nonmilitary titles like manager or governor, and prisoners are sometimes referred to as ''clients'' or, if they are youths, ''pupils.''

''We are parents, that's what we are,'' said Kirsti Njeminen, governor of the Kerava prison that specializes in rehabilitating young offenders like Mr. Syvajarvi.

Generous home leaves are available, particularly as the end of a sentence nears, and for midterm inmates, there are houses on the grounds, with privacy assured, where they can spend up to four days at a time with visiting spouses and children.

''We believe that the loss of freedom is the major punishment, so we try to make it as nice inside as possible,'' said Merja Toivonen, a supervisor at Hameenlinna.

Natalia Leppamaki, 39, a Russian immigrant convicted of drunken driving, switched off a sewing machine she was using to make prison clothing and picked up on Ms. Toivonen's point. ''Here you have work, you can eat and you can do sports, but home is home, and I don't think you'll see me in here again,'' she said.

Thirty years ago, Finland had a rigid model, inherited from neighboring Russia, and one of the highest rates of imprisonment in Europe. But then academics provoked a thoroughgoing rethinking of penal policy, with their argument that it ought to reflect the region's liberal theories of social organization.",0,,1280697556,False,t3_cw6az,t3_cw6az,t5_2cneq,,1426404390,politics,

 ''Finnish criminal policy is exceptionally expert-oriented,'' said Tapio Lappi-Seppala, director of the National Research Institute of Legal Policy. ''We believe in the moral-creating and value-shaping effect of punishment instead of punishment as retribution.''

He asserted that over the last two decades, more than 40,000 Finns had been spared prison, $20 million in costs had been saved, and the crime rate had gone down to relatively low Scandinavian levels.

Mr. Salminen, the prison service director, pulled out a piece of paper and drew three horizontal lines. ''This first level is self-control, the second is social control and the third is officer control. In Finland,'' he explained, ''we try to intervene at this first level so people won't get to the other two.''

The men and women who work in the prisons also back the softer approach. ''There are officers who were here 20 and 30 years ago, and they say it was much tougher to work then, with more people trying to escape and more prison violence,'' said Kaisa Tammi-Moilanen, 32, governor of the open ward at Hameenlinna.

[""Our school is comprised of more than 500 students in grades 9 – 12.""](http://www.coxsackie-athens.org/High%5FSchool/). So, Erica's graduating class was only around 125 people, if not less. They offer only ""American History, Art, Biology, Calculus, English, European History, and Physics"" AP courses.

I feel safe in stating that my high school had both better faculty and better students. We were in a middle-class suburban area, and there were 500 kids in my graduating class. We certainly had more AP courses (one of my favorites was AP Chemistry, taught by an amazing fellow). Perhaps I can give a little perspective.

&gt; While others sat in class and doodled to later become great artists, I sat in class to take notes and become a great test-taker. While others would come to class without their homework done because they were reading about an interest of theirs, I never missed an assignment. While others were creating music and writing lyrics, I decided to do extra credit, even though I never needed it. So, I wonder, why did I even want this position? Sure, I earned it, but what will come of it?

&gt; you only learned how to memorize names, places, and dates to later on forget in order to clear your mind for the next test

&gt; I have no interests because I saw every subject of study as work, and I excelled at every subject just for the purpose of excelling, not learning.

At my public (albeit not inner-city) school, the smartest kids did not fit this profile. Of course, we were busy challenging ourselves with AP courses (taught by very capable faculty) or independent studies (Pick any topic (within reason of course - ""Contemporary Gaming Culture"" or ""Analyzing The Wire"" would be approved while ""Pornography"" certainly wouldn't). Create your own class. Yes, it was great.), rather than dutifully plowing our way though ""honors"" courses. Sounds like Erica's just bitter she wasted her time. Sorry your school sucked, Erica! [Her school wasn't that bad. I am quite certain other members of her class were able to find the time to maintain good grades and still pursue their interests. They didn't do every extra credit assignment or study for hours like she did.]

[This example serves as an easy counter to the ""malaise"" in our secondary educational system everyone thinks is so prevalent. I could've also cited a ridiculously good school like Andover at which the filthy rich educate their children *quite* well.]

As ""Pat"" said on the comments page,

&gt; You don’t become a great artist by [simply] doodling in class. She likes to think that to explain away her lack of extracurricular talents. She’s not open to the possibility that she could’ve still been valedictorian while developing other talents. Plenty do.

Pretty much. This is why top postsecondary schools put such a large focus on extracurriculars. Anyone can simply work *really* hard and become valedictorian - moreso if your school is weaker. The valedictorian of my class was able to pursue extracurriculars and other interests. He didn't jump at every extra credit opportunity or spend hours on easy projects. [Case in point with respect to my earlier interjection.]

Yes, I know that. Some of my ancestors are from Latin America.  

&gt;so I see nothing that indicates the literacy rates will decrease with the injection of immigrants

The people who emigrate from south of the border illegally are typically failures in their own impoverished nations.

&gt;Give me some evidence that this is the case. Even if I grant the premise, the problem of the poor population increasing has far more to do with natural citizens breeding at higher rates than it does with immigrants. Immigrants are a drop in the bucket compared to reproduction rates for impoverished citizens.

Haha are you kidding? Tens of millions of illegal immigrants are flooding our borders and Hispanic Catholics fuck like bunnies. 

&gt;If that were true, then social mobility would have been higher when manufacturing jobs were more prevalent. I've never seen anything that indicates that.

Uh, go read about American history. Lots of people had no education, but learned a trade and worked their asses off, making fortunes. It was hard as hell, but it was doable if you had the determination. 

&gt;In fact, I'm pretty sure that social mobility has increased with the death of manufacturing like it did with the death of agriculture. Those workers that aren't in those industries are now forced through economic pressures to learn the skills of the tertiary sector of the economy: service jobs. However, we have not kept pace with many European nations and thus our social mobility is low in comparison to other developed nations. Admittedly, this is all a bit beside the point.

In our service economy, it is extremely difficult to find work that provides a good wage if you do not have a college education. This is getting worse and worse, largely because of our fucked up education system. 


&gt;I don't know where ""useless retards"" came into it, but what I was talking about was the lower class in America, which certainly aren't a minority. The same class that immigrants would belong to. Immigrants make up a drop in the bucket of social burden on America. If social burden is the problem, in the form of the use of social programs, and we're not simply being xenophobic, then I don't understand why we aren't talking about the larger problem here: natural citizens using social programs.

The problem is that most of the immigrants are lower class. Increasing our lower class by tens of millions is not helpful. In the past, the lower class could get decent wages, allowing their children to get a good education and move up the socioeconomic ladder. 

This is kind of a useless discussion. I believe that adding tens of millions (hundreds of millions if immigration was completely unrestricted) to the lower class is bad for America as a whole. You seem to disagree with this premise. I've tried to show you why I see this as bad for America, but I suppose we'll have to respectfully disagree with each other.

**GENERAL PLAN**: sounds good. Don't try to see all of Europe in one trip; spend a week or so in a few places so you can actually get to know a few places. Some people say to avoid big cities and go to small places, but honestly, Paris/London/etc. are worth seeing and if this is your first time, it's not a bad plan! Also, a bit easier. So go for it.

**LODGING**: Hostels are the way to go. You get to meet other young people who are also travelling cheap, and it's cheap. Check out HIHostels too; major international organization of hostels. Expect to pay $30-40/night for lodging in a dormitory (i.e. in a room with 4-6 bunk beds). It's going to cost you quite a bit more ($60-80) if you want a room with just you and your friend. Some hostels offer free breakfasts; most don't offer food. Some have public kitchens. 

**FOOD**: Sample the local cuisine, but mostly get to know the supermarkets and learn to make a good sandwich and picnic. So many travellers think they have to eat out 3 meals a day, when you can EASILY make at least 2/day yourselves for 1/3 of the price. 

**TRAINS**: You want a **[Eurail](http://www.eurail.com/)** pass, my friend. Take the Eurostar (not covered by Eurail) from London (dozens of departures a day from St. Pancras station) to Paris, and then go from there. 

**LANGUAGE**: In general, it's good to greet people in the local language – you can learn hello! – and people generally recognize very quickly that English is your first language and switch if they're able. It's polite to at least say ""bonjour"" though. 

**THEFT**: Yes there's theft. If you leave your camera somewhere, even for a second, it will probably be stolen, so don't do that. Try to bring as little as possible that you don't mind having stolen. It'll make this easier.

**CLOTHES**: 3-4 days is about right. You'll be washing in sinks and hanging on the end of your bed to dry; don't bring anything glamourous. 

**CELL**: Honestly, I'd advise against it. You'll find loads of internet cafés with Skype, and lots of places where you can make long-distance calls. And there are public phones. DO NOT BRING YOUR iPHONE.

&gt; Shortly after finishing the manuscript, Qutb set off for the United States on a visit that was to last almost two years. The trip affected him deeply. Although he was impressed by America’s material accomplishments (and confessed to liking “Gone with the Wind”), he felt an abiding contempt for the materialism, racism and sexual promiscuity of what he saw as a debased Western culture. Was the encounter with America, as some have argued, the turning-point in Qutb’s radicalisation? Did the sight of scantily-clad women on the dance floors of Greeley, Colorado, turn the sexually repressed Egyptian into an Islamist zealot? Mr Calvert doubts it; the visit, he believes, confirmed the radical turn in Qutb’s thinking, rather than inspiring it.

Look at this quote

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1253796

&gt; ""The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs — and she shows all this and does not hide it.""

You have to be some kind of colossal fuck up to see this as a bad thing.

Or this quote

http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/sayyid_qutb.htm

&gt; Jazz is his preferred music, and it is created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires

In fact  

majalla.org/books/2005/qutb-nilestone.pdf

&gt;  When Islam entered the central part of Africa, it clothed naked human beings, socialized them, brought them out of the deep recesses of isolation, and taught them the joy of work for exploring material resources. It brought them out of the narrow circles of tribe and clan into the vast circle of the Islamic community, and out of the worship of pagan gods into the worship of the Creator of the worlds. If this is not civilization, then what is it?

The problem with this is he's talking about the African slaves, whose conditions were so harsh it led to the [Zanj Rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanj_Rebellion)

So he's not the sort of person to be bothered too much by racism.

The article claimed he was not in favour of violence but look at this 

(from majalla.org/books/2005/qutb-nilestone.pdf )

&gt; Anyone who understands this particular character of this religion will also understand the place of Jihad bi al-sayf (striving through fighting), which is to clear the way for striving through preaching in the application of the Islamic movement. He will understand that Islam is not a defensive movement in the narrow sense which today is technically called a defensive war. This narrow meaning is ascribed to it by those who are under the pressure of circumstances and are defeated by the wily attacks of the orientalists, who distort the concept of Islamic Jihad. It was a movement to wipe out tyranny and to introduce true freedom to mankind, using resources according to the actual human situation, and it had definite stages, for each of which it utilized new methods.
&gt;
&gt; If we insist on calling Islamic Jihad a defensive movement, then we must change the meaning of the word 'defense' and mean by it 'the defense of man' against all those elements which limit his freedom. These elements take the form of beliefs and concepts, as well as of political systems, based on economic, racial or class distinctions. When Islam first came into existence, the world was full of such systems, and the present-day Jahiliyyah also has various kinds of such systems.

The [Jahiliyyah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahiliyyah) bit is important. He believes that all existing Islamic countries are actually in a state of Jahiliyyah or disbelief. That's why the Egyptian Islamic Brotherhood wants to destroy the Egyptian regime. The Islamic Brotherhood also has ties to Hamas in Gaza and Islamists throughout the Arab world. 

The whole point of Qutbism is essentially this - the Arab world has fallen into a state of disbelief, the West is decadent and hostile to Islam. All of these regimes need to be swept away by an Islamic Vanguard, i.e. a small group of violent revolutionaries who will impose Shariah law by force. [Offensive Jihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_jihad#Sayyid_Qutb) is needed.

It's Islamic fundamentalism with a hefty dose of other 20th Century totalitarian movements.

&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'alim_fi_al-Tariq#Non-Islamic&gt;

&gt; Qutb's intense dislike of the West not withstanding, some of his ideas are strongly reminiscent of European fascism:
&gt;
&gt;* the decline of contemporary Western civilization and ""infertility"" of democracy,
&gt;
&gt;* inspiration from an earlier golden age and desire to restore its glory with an all-encompassing (totalitarian) social, political, economic system,
&gt;
&gt;* victimhood from malicious foreign and Jewish conspiracies, and
&gt;
&gt;* violent revolution to expel alien influences and reestablish the power and international domination of the nation/community,
&gt;
&gt;Fascism having made some impact among anti-British Arab Muslims before, during, and after World War II.[13] The influence of particular fascist thinkers (particularly French fascist Alexis Carrel) in Qutb's work is disputed.[14]
&gt;
&gt;The centrality of an Islamic 'vanguard' (Arabic: tali'a) in Qutb's political program also suggests influence from Leninist thinking

This isn't my favorite topic, but here comes (je vais te faire ça en anglais):

I drove West from Rimouski toward ... West in 2005.  I packed all my french canadian crap in my french canadian car and drove West, toward new lands and in the turf of our English ""neighbors"".  

I never came back

...except for Christmas or for a week during summer.  It's always been very clear that I would never move back East to live in the French Canadian Lands of my ancestors.

I've been in Victoria, BC, for the last 5 years.  I have never, EVER experienced any sort of racism or language related insults (that I didn't ask for).  I currently live with a nice girl from BC, got lots of english only (only!) friends and I've been happily living the west coast lifestyle.  I intend to raise kids with my english buddies, with my english wifey (unless shit happen...shit sometimes happen, but it's called life) in my overpriced west coast house on the side of a lake surrounded by massive trees.

I have so many thing to say about this topic it's overwhelming a bit. 

In Banff I hung out with my first ""real"" canadian for a week. He was from Peterborough, born in Columbia, brought west in about the same circumstances than me.  I practiced my somewhat rusty english, he half-understood what I said, we drank beer, hung out with lots of other peep, Australians, Kiwis, Canadians, Americans, Europeans, Russians, all sorts of weirdos and partimongers.  Same thing in Whistler.

I hung out with a ""french canadian only"" downtown Victoria BC, for a while.   He was from the other 50% of french canadians; he HATED english people.  HATED them.   He was such a stupid biggot that he was even mean to Australians, British and anybody else who spoke english.  He felt segregated, hated, stressed, he was getting pissed off at the whole Canada for not being bilingual, using the fact that he cannot get around in french in a ""so called"" bilingual country, and preached Quebec's independence openly. 

He left BC bitter, hated his experience and was more independentist than ever.  That guy helped me realize how badly annoying bigotry could be, so I stayed, and now live here.

Canadians are exactly like us, and like us, they are all different, from different cities and towns, from different provinces, from different neighborhoods, from different administrative regions.  They have all been raised differently, preached their religion differently and none of that variety of Canadian seem to have figured out that onions rings are awesome dipped in honey.

They like smoked meat and poutine but it's strangely hard to find and always overpriced.

They have the same odds of understanding  [Isabelle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Yu19b3aSY#t=1m40s) that you have of understanding an hybrid of [Pure Pwnage and Yahtzee Croshaw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VAhzPcZ-s&amp;feature=related)

The medias from Québec sucks, like all corporate medias.  They are driven by corporations, for investors.  They exploit ignorance in order to make some cash.  They exploit the craze around concepts they bought from somewhere else, like in any ""country"" or ""province"".  What suck about Quebec's medias is their isolation from the rest of the world;  In order to guarantee a certain percentage of French content, they restrain coverage of ""outside of Quebec"" news and events.  They isolate.  Proof?  Try to name some the greatest canadian artists.  The same exercise could be done in the other way and I know my Canadian buddies wouldn't even be able to name one of Quebec's great artists, aside from Mitsou (go figure...).

Quebec's a real canadian province, as Ontario, BC, or IPE (see what I did there??)
We are all different, from province to province, region to region, city to city.

Perhaps you are unaware of the changes in Europe over the last 10-15 years?

There are free factor (labor, capital) and trade (goods, services) movements [as stipulated by EU law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_%28European_Union%29).

I did. The minority is better representative than the majority.

&gt;All judges are appointed by the executive branch. The POTUS selects from the top legal minds in the country. The Supreme Court justices are extremelyu qualified.

Which is... not at all like what I described. Unless the Supreme Court justices are selected on a per case basis, and by 'appointed by the executive branch' you mean agreed upon by the plaintiff/prosecution and defendant, and the justices don't actually decide cases.

If that's what you meant, then yes, that's exactly like what I described, but I don't think that's how it works.

&gt;You mean like the government we have now?

No. We have a Senate and a President, further, the house is relatively low resolution. A legislature with 1 representative per 1000-10000 people would be appropriate.

&gt;I don't know where you get the idea that since the voting doesnt go People -&gt; POTUS, that the POTUS isn't responsive to the will of the people.

Because the structure allows a small ruling party to control the election. Anyone can run for president, but unless they have received the support of one of two conservative political parties, they will never win an electoral vote.

&gt;Negligible is when the minority is so small that the majority can get something to work through this system. That's what it is in practice.

No it is not. Right now it is perfectly possible to move something through the system with less than majority support. It's possible to move something through the senate with 17% representation, through the house with less than 50% representation, and it's possible to elect a president with less than 50% popular vote.

&gt;Your own example is not a 'pure' democracy.

So? I'm not necessarily suggesting a pure democracy. It is a lot closer than the US is, though, and it functions fine.

&gt;About 8 million people in Switzerland, to about 300 Million people in the US. Pure democracies don't scale well.

The EU also operates just fine with a parliamentary system, and a virtually unicameral legislature.

When did you ever witness a christian or a jew walk up to a crowd of people and blow themselves up along with everyone within a thirty yard radius? When did you ever witness a christian or a jew bury a woman up to her neck and then throw stones at her until she died simply because she committed adultery (state sponsored/endorsed stoning by the way)? When did you ever see a christian or a jew enter a house and burn alive everyone inside, including children? When did you ever read multiple stories of christian girls being killed by their own fathers for supposedly bringing shame and dishonor to the family? God, don't you fucking ever read a newspaper? Don't you know what these extremist and non-extremist muslims are doing? Sure, there have been episodes in the past, dating back to the Biblical days, back when ignorance ruled, when all religions at one time or another had their darker moments, that is not debated, but by far, here in this day and age of enlightenment, the violence perpetrated against innocent people in the name of religion and strictly religion is committed by those that proclaim Islam to be the one and only true religion. Call'em what-the-fuck-ever you want, ""movement"" or ""sect"" but they are totally fucking different from christianity and judaism. The examples you give above are examples of government intervention of predominantly christian nations, but not specifically those factions who claim to be christian or jewish and nor were those acts committed solely on the basis of religion as is often the case when a islamic nutcase wantonly kills every-fucking-body. And while we're on the subject, how did that Islamic revolution turn out for the people of Iran? The majority didn't look too fucking happy as the government soldiers began firing on them. I would say, based on news reports thoughout the world, that those nations adhering strictly to Islamic protocols are far worse off than are you, butt-munch. I would bet that the woman who was on the verge of being publically stoned at the Iranian government religious leaders behest for adultery would disagree with you as well. How long do you think you would last blogging against your Islamic country and Islam as a whole if you lived in an predominantly muslim country? Remember that MTV episode of ""True Life"", wherein muslim teens were shown going about their daily lives in Saudia Arabia (which is considered the most Liberal of Islamic nations)? Yeah, they were all arrested by the religion police after the show aired for doing shit such as trying to visit a girlfriend which is forbidden according to their religious law. Ever heard of christians or jews being arrested for dating? Dumbass. (http://infidelsarecool.com/2010/06/01/saudi-youths-in-trouble-for-appearing-on-mtv-exposing-islamic-intolerance-video/.) There are far far more muslim terrorist that will absolutely kill their own and anyone else (even non-muslims) for disobeying islamic religious law than there ever was christians or jews killing people for not adhering. Right now the muslims are working to gain a strong foothold in several non-muslim european nations. Their goal is to eventually gain strength in numbers and ultimately rule, then those inhabitants, muslim or not, will fucking abide by their rules or they will die, plain and simple. They play the game when they enter a host country, slowly developing their plan and yes, they have a plan. Their agenda is to truly integrate themselves in societies throughout the world and eventually take over, forcing you to live under Islamic laws. You're a fucking ideological-everybody-gather-around-hold-hands-and-sing-kumbaya-moron if you think otherwise. Their M.O. is to force everyone, every-fucking-one, to abide via fear, murder and mayhem. Yes, we have isolated incidents of wacko christians in the US shooting someone, such as with the case of the anti-abortionist in Missouri (I think), but by and large most christians harm no one and you fucking know it, jackwad. Want to experience real fear, take your white ass (I just know you're a white liberal pussy retard, or a muslim faggot) to pretty much any fucking place in the mideast, tell'em you're a Canadian Christian (just so you'll know that the death you are about to experience isn't based on the fact that you're American) and see how long you will last. How fucking dare you compare modern day christians and jews to modern day muslims. The main point here is, muslims are by far primarily the only ones to use religion as the ONLY fucking reason for committing their acts of terrorism and murder against others, especially within their own countries, and it's not one crackpot here and there, no, it's a bunch of fucking crackpots (including whole governments) and they're everywhere over there. People are screaming for the world to get out of Afghanistan but as soon as the world withdraws their military forces then the taliban will reemerge in the cities and countryside terrorizing the Afghan peoples, subjugating them under very strict Islamic laws where innocent people are often summarily executed for the slightest misstep. Look, shit-for-brains, there is a whole big ol world out there and it's obvious you are oblivious to most of what is going on.

My mom has 11 brothers and sisters, all living here in the US, California to be exact. Most of the families came over with kids (average of 3 kids per family when they moved) with no money saved up, since they had such a short notice to escape the motherland they didn't have time to sell anything. Out of 11 brothers and sisters, every single family is now in the middle to upper-middle class. I have 4 uncles that pull in $200k+ a year. It has nothing to do with luck or our specific family. 

The church we attend has grown to about 2000 members, 80% of them immigrated from the same exact city that my family lived in the former Soviet Union so they are basically all relatives/friends. There are hundreds of people in the church that make $100k+/year and live very comfortably driving very nice cars and owning $500k+ houses. We don't live in the bay area or LA, so a $500k house is still very expensive, even in California (for those who think a $500k house is cheap in CA).

Now, I know that class mobility has really gone down in the past 50 years, the facts back all of that up. America isn't the middle class country it once was. But my problem is that people have this mentality (most of Reddit) that since they read all of these articles and all this research done that it is impossible.

There does seem to be some ire of ""have-not"" and xenophobia wafting from the province. I have no doubt there are people in Quebec that believe that the rest of Canada is out to get them, so they must ""protect the motherland"" as it were. But I also believe that a lot of people who feel this way are just uninformed, biased by the media. Not just, crazy bigots and xenophobes. But the door also swings both ways, people in the rest of Canada who have a distaste for Quebec are more than likely also swayed by biased media sources, or by their family and peers, who are ignorant, bigoted, or are just blowing things out of proportion.

Quebec does indeed have a unique culture, but so does Newfoundland, so does the Yukon and Nunavut, and so do the rest of provinces and territories, even going deeper into regions therein. This doesn't make Quebec any more unique than the rest of Canada, they are just different.

The problems I have with Quebec are wholly political and legal. I think your language laws are xenophobic, oppressive and authoritarian. I admire your civil code system for its strictness and adherence to the letter of the law, while at the same time I think it is to black and white, although civil code seems to be working for you, and for the majority of Europe. 

I think the entire separatist movement is childish and is just sabre-rattling, ""If you don't give me what I want, I will take my ball and go home"". From the politicians standpoint it was ok for Quebec to separate from Canada, but not ok for the natives to separate from Quebec, and possibly stay with Canada, that was unacceptable, ok there kettle!

I don't like how the BQ were allowed to become a Federal party without representing anyone outside of Quebec, it just does not make any sense how that is allowed. Federal means all of Canada, whereas the BQ's primary objective is Quebec first, Canada second. It reminds me of a Corporation, shareholders first, customers second, and I don't like Corporations either!

I admire, but don't agree with, how you, as a province, throw your weight around to get what you want, regardless of if the rest of Canada thinks otherwise. I also admire how you guys will riot if you see an injustice, something that is sadly lacking in the rest of Canada.

Apathy is rife in Canada, and it seem that Quebec is the outlier. The rest of Canada should learn from Quebecors, if you see an injustice, step up.

All that said, I wish we had a different system of Government in Canada, where the Federal had less power, and the Provinces had more power. Something more similar, but not exactly, to what they do in Switzerland. Quebec would shit there pants with happiness if this happened, lol.

c0vrb60,t1_c0vrb60,0,1,0,True,True,xenofon,1,"&gt;I think you meant Jammu, but not Kashmir.

No, I meant Jammu **and** Kashmir. These were never separate states, they were the same Kingdom, just two different areas of it. That's why it was called ""The Kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir"". As your own URL says: ""Kashmir was governed by the Maharaja of Kashmir, who was Hindu, although the majority of the population were Muslim, except in the Jammu region.""

This is exactly what I said. Kashmir ruled by a Hindu Maharaja? Check. Majority of population Muslim in northeast and Hindu in southwest (Jammu)? Check. Why quote that back to me as if to make a point, that's **exactly** what I said. Look again, this is what I said:

""During the British years, a large number of Muslims started moving to Kashmir, specially the northwest areas. At the time of Independence, they had moved in sufficient numbers that the northwest region had become predominantly Muslim. The southeast (Jammu and surrounding areas) continued to have a predominantly Hindu population.""

Where is the difference? The only thing extra I said was that this Muslim majority in northwest Kashmir is also a recent thing, happening during the British occupation. If they had historically been predominantly Muslim, they wouldn't have had a Hindu Maharaja.

&gt;According to the Indian Independence Act 1947, ""the suzerainty of His Majesty over the Indian States lapses, and with it, all treaties and agreements in force at the date of the passing of this Act between His Majesty and the rulers of Indian States"",[13] so the states were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent.

Again, **exactly** what I said. When India became Independent, the kingdoms were allowed to make the choice which country to join, and Kashmir chose India. Again, quoting what I said:

""At partition in 1947, the Maharaja of Kashmir decided to throw in his lot with India. This was his right, as well as the British mandate, which allowed independent kingdoms at border areas to choose whether to go with India or Pakistan.""

Where is the difference? You quote Wikipedia as if you were correcting me, but you have provided information identical to what I already said. Nothing has changed.

Your own map of the Muslim population **proves my point**. Look at it again. Southeast Kashmir has very few Muslims. Northwest Kashmir has a lot. Exactly what I said. All of western India has a **lot** of Muslims, and guess what, it's now Pakistan. What are you trying to say?

&gt;Same can be said here about Muslims dominating the lands.

But the same **can't** be said. India hasn't cleared out those Muslims, India has 160 million plus Muslims today - [13.4% of the Indian population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India). This is far more than it had at partition. Meanwhile, Pakistan has a [1.6% population of Hindus today](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Pakistan) - far less than at the time of partition, [according to your own map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Muslim_percent_1909.jpg). This is exactly what I said. India, being a secular republic allowed Muslims to stay, where they have grown in numbers and in percentage since Independence. Pakistan became an Islamic republic and killed or drove out the Hindu population, which is why Pakistan today has 1.6% Hindus, while India has 13.4% Muslims. Isn't this exactly what I said?

&gt;You should read this: Based on 1951 Census of displaced persons, 7,226,000 Muslims went to Pakistan from India while 7,249,000 Hindus and Sikhs moved to India from Pakistan immediately after partition.

Again, you should pay attention to the implications of what you've written, because you keep on proving my point. What does this statement show?

It shows that 4 years after partition (in 1951), about an equal number (7 million) of both Hindus and Muslims were displaced in the two countries. So India, which is 4 times larger than Pakistan, lost 7 million Muslims, but Pakistan which is 4 times smaller, also lost 7 million Hindus. The number may have been the same, but the proportion of Hindus leaving Pakistan was **four times higher** than the proportion of Muslims leaving India. In other words, a very large area such as India, lost 7 million Muslims, who migrated to Pakistan. But an area **four times smaller**, which is Pakistan, also lost 7 million Hindus. They must have **really** emptied out a lot of Hindus. Does this say something to you?

And remember, this is from 1951, very soon after the partition. What has Pakistan done with the Hindus who remained? It's killed them, coerced them into conversion, or driven them out. This is why Hindus are only 1.6% of Pakistan's population today. What has India done with the remaining Muslim population? It's increased tremendously, both in numbers and as a percentage (8.9% Muslim at partition in 1947, 13.4% Muslims today). Does this say something to you?

&gt;But saying all Hindus have been driven off after Muslims reached a ""critical mass"" is wrong.

No, it's exactly right, as I have shown. This has historically been how Islam has worked, not just in India, but around the world. When Muslims reach about 30% - 40% of the population, they drive other religions out. This is why today there are **numerous** Islamic countries (most of which were at one time not Muslims), but only one Hindu country (Nepal) and one secular but with a majority of Hindus (India). Even European countries, which have a near 2,000 year old history of Christianity are mostly secular, with large populations of Muslims living in many of them. But try to find a lot of Hindus or Christians in Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Libya, or Algeria, or Iraq, or Iran, or any number of Muslim dominated countries. You'll find almost no Hindus, and a few Christians, who are now a small minority in countries where they have traditionally lived since before Islam appeared. The fact is that Muslims are largely intolerant of other religions, specially in the last few hundred years.",0,,1280727187,False,t3_cw3qx,t1_c0vr0va,t5_2qh13,,1426404883,worldnews,

And how is that oppression?

&gt;Which is... not at all like what I described. Unless the Supreme Court justices are selected on a per case basis, and by 'appointed by the executive branch' you mean agreed upon by the plaintiff/prosecution and defendant, and the justices don't actually decide cases.
If that's what you meant, then yes, that's exactly like what I described, but I don't think that's how it works.

Ok, but that way sounds retarded. Pick judges on a per case basis? Yeah, how many judges do you think there are? That's a retarded idea, people will pick whichever judges will rule favorably for their side.

&gt;No. We have a Senate and a President, further, the house is relatively low resolution. A legislature with 1 representative per 1000-10000 people would be appropriate.

Low resolution, huh? So every 10000 people need one representative, let's see, that's...300 million divided by ten thousand, 30 thousand representatives. How the fuck would you ever have any discussions about anything in the house?  If every representative got only one single minute to talk about an issue, they would be in whatever football stadium they convened in for 21 DAYS at a time, 24 hour days, with no breaks, JUST to hear everyone's opinion! That's insane. You fail to understand that the limiting factor is not number of people, but number of representatives. You need to limit the amount of people if you want any kind of cogent discussion on any issue.

&gt;Because the structure allows a small ruling party to control the election. Anyone can run for president, but unless they have received the support of one of two conservative political parties, they will never win an electoral vote.

What? That has zero to do with the electoral college. You are talking about the two party system. That's an entirely different discussion, so to paraphrase your own words, let's stay on message here. 

&gt;No it is not. Right now it is perfectly possible to move something through the system with less than majority support. It's possible to move something through the senate with 17% representation, through the house with less than 50% representation, and it's possible to elect a president with less than 50% popular vote.

Citation please? It is definitely not possible to move something through with so few votes, at least not if the other party wishes to stop it. It is not possible for a minority to push through something that the majority opposes, that is a ridiculous idea. You actually need at least 61% in both the House AND the Senate to push things through, and even then it doesn't happen! What is possible is for the minorities to block the majority wishes, but you are just making shit up when you say the minorities can push stuff through. The popular vote thing was a fluke, and an example of the system not working. It is not a solid case for dismantling the whole thing.

&gt;So? I'm not necessarily suggesting a pure democracy. It is a lot closer than the US is, though, and it functions fine.

What the fuck. That is literally what this whole argument is about. You are moving the goalposts, which is a bullshit move on your part. I've been pretty civil so far, but that's a dick move. You are saying pure democracy is good, I am saying our system is not meant to be a pure democracy, nor should it be.

&gt;The EU also operates just fine with a parliamentary system, and a virtually unicameral legislature.

Thus proving my point. There are no true democracies. Parliamentary systems != democracy. they are representative, in the same way our system is.

America leads the world in innovation and is home to the world's most prominent intellectuals and scholars. Great technology, work, advancements, thought and culture have come out of the country, and it is all a result of America's emphasis on individualism and belief in a greater good through individuals pursuing their own goals. Americans are the most suspicious of their government, and don't need a government bureaucrat to give them a shove in order to start something. A lot of phenomenal but controversial work has come out of America, questioning the basis of what we know and the poorly inherited conventional wisdom of the day, without fearing charges like hate-speech or subversion.

Americans aren't afraid to flaunt the uniqueness of their nation and assert the importance and achievements of their country. In America, it seems like ethnic diversity creates and stronger overarching culture, whereas in others, people are afraid of ""offending any sort of minority,"" and create such a weak, pushover-like and victimized attitude towards other races. Americans are still, in general, the most conservative people left in the world who maintain the strongest faith in republican virtue and civic duty.

That is surprising. Who for? I seriously would not have expected any irish politicians on reddit. 

I'd imagine you would like to keep your anonymity here and that's fine... But can you be more specific about being elected in your town? Are you a County Councillor? on one of the Dublin councils?

I'd also like to point out that many people such as me left Ireland because we had no choice. We simply couldn't wait around hoping to find work eventually. I came out of college with an engineering degree (I'll always be thankful for public education in Ireland) and I was 6 months out of work after that. I had been looking for graduate work for the entire year previously. When that starts happening in Ireland we all know what comes next. You pack your shit and leave. It doesn't mean you won't be back, but at times like this the traditional pressure valve needs to open. 40,000 of us last year I read recently. more than twice the relative number of the next highest in Europe. If there's one thing Irish people have an instinct for it's emigration!

Anyway, I think it's at best naive and at worst insidious to act like we emigrants gave up on the old country while you stayed back to stick it out. Life back home would be a lot worse if we didn't leave and you might find it a lot harder to make your home a little nicer. A lot of us will be back again when things pick up and the country can accommodate us. We'll be bringing a few bob back with us too which is always good.

So after 2000 years of living in Europe they were still 'pure blood'. This is just plain denial.

A german Jew in 1945 was definitely not middle eastern, no matter that his ancestors 2000 years ago lived there. 

I can understand the emotional attachment Zionists have to 'that' land, but claiming that they were still middle eastern people after 2000 years of intermingling and living in other continents is a bit much, unless you think they maintained some heterogeneous level of racial purity.

In any case, they imbibed european culture, like I said. A friend of mine is an Australian Jew, but he's definitely Australian, and being Jewish is one part of his identity, even though he's now a practicing buddhist.

The camping public in Europe is quite diverse, different social backgrounds, lots of wealthy middle class households too. Most people are genuinely interested, asking where we are coming from, where we are heading. Partly it's because of the bikes we ride (low racer recumbents), for most people it's their first opportunity to take a closer look and ask how they ride. The funniest experience was in a remote village somewhere in France where upon our arrival the whole camping crowd came out and encircled us, examining the gear and firing questions about everything.

Il panorama delle telecomunicazioni in Brasile, lascia intravedere un evidente cambiamento ed evoluzione delle infrastrutture e dei servizi, che segue in maniera proporzionale lo sviluppo del paese, il merito va' anche ai considerevoli investimenti riguardanti questo settore, tutti questi fattori hanno contribuito a liberaralizzare un mercato,  che sino alla fine degli anni novanta era prigioniero di un monopolio dai tratti fortemente marcati, gestito da governo e istituzioni, cio' che andro' ad analizzare in questo post e' il comparto della telefonia mobile, scrutando gli elementi negativi e positivi, cosi' facendo saro' in grado di orientare le vostre scelte nell'uso dei telefoni cellulari in Brasile. I consumatori dei servizi di telefonia mobile, oggi in Brasile, hanno la possibilita' di scegliere un piano telefonico che soddisfi al meglio le proprie esigenze, valutando l'offerta dei vari operatori esistenti  attualmente nel mercato; voglio pero' precisare che il sistema, evidenzia ancora evidenti falle sotto il profilo economico del servizio e gestionale delle informazioni che arrivano al consumatore, in poche parole non c'e' ancora una sufficiente trasparenza nei confronti dell' utilizzatore.
Raccogliendo alcune informazioni, sono venuto a conoscenza di una ricerca effetuata dalla ""Bernstein Research"" azienda europea spacializzata in statistiche , la quale afferma che il Brasile avrebbe la seconda  tariffa  telefonica piu' cara al mondo , piazzandosi dietro al Sudafrica, infatti la spesa media dei brasiliani quando parlano al cellulare ammonterebbe a 24 centesimi di dollaro il minuto. Vediamo quali sono gli imputati  offerenti di questi servizi cosi' cari, e cercando di conoscerli il meglio possibile.




L'azienda che detiene la lidership attuale nel merato e' la "" OI "" con cira il 30,3 %  dei clienti dell'intera torta, nata nel 2002, opera una buona strategia comunicativa, subito dopo troviamo la ""Claro"", la prima azienda brasiliana ad aver chiuso un accordo con la APPLE per L'I-phone, al terzo posto Tim Brasil del gruppo Italiano Telecom Italia, azienda pioniera nel mercato brasiliano con il suo arrivo nel 1998, segue la ""VIVO"" e poi altri operatori relativamente piu' piccoli come la SERCOMTEL di Londrina nello stato del Parana', AEIOU nata nel 2008 opera sopratutto nella citta' di SAN PAOLO coprendo 63 comuni, infine NEXTEL una compagnia di origine statunitense e AMAZONIA CELULAR. Ma quali sono gli operatori che offrono le tariffe piu' vantaggiose? Inanzitutto c'e da fare una distinzione in funzione delle zone del Brasile in cui ci si trova, per esempio nella zona sud -est del Brasile la TIM offre le tariffe migliori per i piani abbonamento con pochi minuti inclusi nel prezzo prestabilito, nella stessa zona chi ha la necessita' di avere tanti minuti a disposizione, riscontrera' delle ottime offerte con abbonamenti della CLARO. A San Paolo e Rio de Janeiro risultano convenienti le offerte della VIVO sul prepagato, se dovete fare lunghe telefonate, mentre se la vostra esigenza e' quella opposta vi conviene acquistare la prepagata della CLARO. Nel sud del Brasile le tariffe piu' vantaggiose per le prepagate sono due: TIM e CLARO. La faccenda si capovolge al Nord-est del paese dove la OI sembra fare le scarpe ai concorrenti. Se usate frequentemente gli sms scegliete CLARO questo operatore ha studiato delle ottime promozioni , dando la possibilita' di accedere nel sito www.claro.com.br ed inviare sms gratis, mentre la TIM ha dei prezzi decisamente piu' cari per gli sms. Se parlate con dei Brasiliani la maggior parte di loro considera la TIM l'azienda piu' qualitativa in generale, considerando i territori di tutto il Brasile, offre piu' copertura, e promozioni piu' vantaggiose, quindi ne prendiamo atto.Una cosa e' certa, e qui sono i numeri a parlare; l'81% dei brasiliani che possiede un cellulare, utilizzano tariffe prepagate, questo ci fa' intuire che le migliori condizioni economiche siano appunto nell'utilizzo delle carte prepagate.
Di seguito vi segnalo un link, attraverso il quale potete consultare una carta geografica dinamica del Brasile , in maniera tale da verificare la copertura offerta dai vari operatori telefonici , www.ucel.com.br/cobertura.asp .
Un piccolo appunto per gli stranieri in transito in Brasile, che intendano aprire una linea telefonica per utilizzare il cellulare, inanzitutto per concludere questa operazione si deve essere in possesso del CPF, poiche' al momento dell'acquisto del chip nel negozio, verra' richiesto dal negoziante per la registrazione, questa prassi e' obbligatoria e stabilita dall'ANATEL www.anatel.gov.br  per ragioni di sicurezza ed un maggiore controllo.Questo puo' essere risolto registrandosi con il CPF di una persona che lo possiede, pratica frequente, specialmente adottata per fornire i turisti di un chip telefonico.
Come dicevo all'inizio del post, in Brasile non esiste ancora, a mio parere una trasparenza tra chi compra e chi vende, mi riferisco al fatto dei telefoni bloccati, quando si acquista un cellulare nel negozio dell'operatore( ad esempio CLARO o TIM )i negozianti manifestano resistenza nello sbloccare l'apparecchio, inventandosi qualche balla, spingedoci ad utilizzare la tariffa del operatore che vende il telefono, negandoci la possibilita' di scegliere una tariffa di un altro concorrente, spesso  piu vantaggiosa , questo non dovrebbe accadere visto che esiste anche una  legge ( normativa n 477 Anatel ) gia' in vigore dal febbraio 2008 che prevede che il consumatore abbia la possibilita' di scegliersi la propria tariffa, inoltre lo sblocco del cellulare nuovo deve essere fatto dal negoziante senza alcun costo aggiuntivo, quindi il mio consiglio e' quello di acquistare il telefono in un negozio della catena C &amp; A o Americanas, facendoci certificare che il telefono funziona anche con altri operatori, prestate attenzione , non fatevi fregare! Altra problematica riscontrata nel sistema di telefonia mobile brasiliano, specialmente qualche anno fa' era la clonazione del cellulare, oggi giorno questa frode sembra essere diminuita, per merito del sistema GSM , anticamente la tecnologia funzionava in analogico, ed era piu facile per i pirati appropiarsi della linea.
Terminando questa nota sull'uso dei cellulari, voglio simpaticamente raccontarvi di alcuni episodi curiosi e grotteschi ai quali ho avuto modo di conoscere vivendo in Brasile, anni fa' tra i  piu' giovani, ma non solo, i brasiliani avevano escogitato un metodo per non pagare le telefonate, consisteva nell'inviare una chiamata e parlare per 1secondo, chi riceveva la chiamta, chiamava a sua volta rispondendo in un secondo all'altra persona, in questo modo i 2 potevano chiamarsi varie volte, montando una sorta di conversazione telegrafica senza vedersi addebitato un centesimo, queste telefonate divenute poi numerosisime, sono state bloccate dagli operatori. Incredibile! Questo e quello che i Brasiliani chiamano jeitinho, cioe' trovare un modo per risolvere i problemi! Altra curiosita' e' la possibilita'( questa volta autorizzata) una volta esaurita la tessera prepagata, di chiedere altri 3 real in prestito, somma che verra' addebitata nell'acquisto della successiva ricarica telefonica, questa e' un opzione offerta dall'operatore OI. Con questo contributo spero di avervi dato un indicazione di massima per usare i cellulari in Brasile, sono graditi vostri commenti, per migliorare e integrare questo post.",0,,1280742098,False,t3_cwcuh,t3_cwcuh,t5_6,,1426405055,reddit.com,

The situation is absolutely horrible.

In Middle/Western Europe you can drink the ground-water or the water coming directly from wells or rivers in the mountains. It gets stored in VERY large reservoirs and doesn't need to be processed. It's prefect.
In regions were you don't have these benefits, the water will be cleaned, filtered and a little bit mineralized before distribution. Only in high-demand regions in high-consumption times of the year you will smell a light portion of chlorine as there is no time to process it differently. 

With our current developement it's horrible that people still don't get perfect drinking water. I can't believe that people wouldn't pay 5 cents more of their money per cubic litre just so it's filtered and isn't poisoned with chemicals to fight the bacteria.

tl;dr: Of course you drink a bit of chlorine if that's what you get instead of getting sick BUT I don't understand why we don't have gigantic water processing plants for drinking water in at least every industrial country.

Is someone who is religious necessarily weak? Most of the Americans and Germans who fought in WWII were Protestants, were they weak? Was the mind of Thomas Aquinas weak?

Religion can make a person weak, because they might attribute to god or gods things which have rational answers which, subsequently, they don't seek to find. For example, if you thought it was the will of the pink unicorn that everyone in the next town over was getting sick, you might never investigate the wellwater. This, in fact, was what early modern medicine was up against. The belief in religious causes for disease is in the old and new testaments (example, Mark 1:29-34) and, for that and other reasons, examining cadavers to learn about the human body was a Church crime.

Christianity served to weaken Europeans because it gave them false answers. Medical science advanced much earlier in the Islamic world, where they didn't have this problem.

We rarely hear the other side. 

Here is a more objective and balanced view of what happened (very concise of course):

1. Britain allowed Jewish immigration into Palestine and promised the Jews a state there. Britain had no right to colonize Palestine with Jews or to promise Jews a state there more than the US has the right to promise mormons a Mormon State in Iraq. 

2. Even with mass Jewish immigration, Jews were only about one third of the population in 1948. That means that in order to create a Jewish state, it was necessary to expel the natives. 

3. As it happened everywhere where colonialists settled in large numbers, friction with the natives led to violence. 

4. The Jewish state was formed through an act of what we know today as ""ethnic cleansing"", a crime against humanity according to international law. This is discussed widely and the entire myth of ""arabs tried to throw the Jews into the sea"" is brought down in **the great book by Israeli historian Ilan Pappe The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine**. What the book explains in excruciating detail is how the act of ethnic cleansing began long before Israel's declaration of independence and Arab states invasion. Jewish forces simply went from village to village and committed many massacres, causing the Palestinian population (which was mostly rural and unorganized) to flee (just like in recent history Milosovich did in Serbia). 

5. The Arabs states sent (insufficient) forces under pressure from their own populace to help the Palestinians who were being ethnically cleansed (thus the myth was born of Arab states trying to throw Jews into the sea)

6. The UN's partition plan would be equivalent of the UN calling to split France between the French and the Muslim immigrants in France who immigrated in the last 50 years. That was understandably opposed by the Palestinians. Would you split your country with recent immigrants, which is what the Jews were in Palestine? Of course the UN decision was motivated by the Holocaust and sympathy for Jews but it came on the expense of Palestinians. 

7. The Jews were widely connected within the west (including the Soviet Union) which ensured them both political and military support in the form of arms sales, they were more organized and had superior fighting forces. Both the British, the Jews and the Palestinians knew what would happen once the Brits would leave Palestine. At the end of the day, (the newly formed) Israel occupied 78% of Palestine and has expelled 80% of the natives in an act of **ethnic cleansing**.

8. One of the basic charters of the Geneva Convention is the right of return of refugees to their homes. In 1949 the UN published UN Resolution 194, calling on Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees ti return to their homes (at the time around one million people). To this day that resolution has been ignored by Israel (like many others), obviously due to Israel's desire to keep its Jewish character and majority - a majority that was obtained by expelling the Palestinian non-Jewish population and not allowing them to return. 

So yes, it is not black and white and every situation has complexities but if you keep in mind that the Jewish settlement in Palestine is a European colonial project (objectively, if you take out religious beliefs), then things become clearer since it is not the first time that a colonial project has displaced the native population.

They have also shown researchers who study birds in Chernobyl's surrounding areas, maybe they are the same as in the BBC article - I don't know. These researchers have shown that animal species that live all year inside the zone and are constantly exposed to radiation adapt rapidly to the fallout over several generations. Animals, such as swallows, that only live there a for a short time because of their travels, cannot adapt and suffer from mutations. This has also been shown in lab studies.

Chernobyl is basically one of the largest natural preserves in Europe and animals are much more resilient to the radioactivity than expected.

For instance, they released several dozen wild horses of an endangered subspecies called Przewalski and expected them to die within years. They chose the weakest animals - yet years later, the population is thriving.

It was based more around the concept of being Levantine, as opposed to distinctly Palestinian/Lebanese/Syrian/etc. I am not well versed in the cultural history of Palestine enough to tell you about any Palestinian art, music, etc from that era.

Amusingly enough until about 1900 it would have been common in Europe to call a Jew a Levantine. And certainly someone from Damascus was a Levantine.

Any modern ""estimate"" of Jewish deaths is not to be trusted, since no meaningful investigation is allowed. In some countries holocaust ""denier"" can even be arrested. Any contrarian views on the holocaust are very forcefully marginalized and repressed.

A few things to ponder:

* Why were prisoners in ""death camps"" given uniforms?

* Why did Auchwitz have an infirmary?

* Why were their Jewish soldier in the German military?

* Why has there been no forensic analysis of the camps? Where is the actual evidence? [Misrepresented, captioned for doctored photos](http://www.germarrudolf.com/work/dth/fndgcffor.html)

1. [Palestine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine#After_the_War) was a British colony after the Ottomans lost the war. Britain could do whatever they want to it.
2. The [immigration was still in the process of happening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah#Early_statehood_.281948.E2.80.931950.29) when Israel was established. The borders were defined based on predicted demographics.
3. The first spats of violence was when Palestinian gangs [murdered 20 people in Hebron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) and 20 in [Safed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Safed_massacre). Actually, [anti-Semetic violence was pretty commonplace](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kinglake/alexander_william/eothen/chapter26.html) even before Zionism. That's why there were so few Jews in Palestine.
4. Israel was formed by consensus of the UN. I suggest reading the excellent book by journalists Larry Collins and Dominique LaPierre, [**Oh, Jerusalem**](http://www.amazon.com/O-Jerusalem-Larry-Collins/dp/0671662414) based on their personal interviews and eyewitness testimony. The book explains how the pre-Zionist Jewish population lived in forts such as [Meah Shearim](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/jerott.html) due to random, wanton antisemetic violence. And how the violence against the Palestinian population was done *exclusively* by unpopular Zionist terror groups who fought with the Hagganah almost as much as they fought the Palestinians.
5. The [Arab forces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#Intervention_by_Arab_League_countries) sent their troops to grab as much land as possible before an independent state can be established in Palestine. They were only successful in preventing the establishment of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel still defeated them.
6. The UN [partition plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) would be the equivalent of the US splitting Florida into two independent countries, The Democratic Republic of Florida and The Hispanic Republic of Florida.
7. The Jews were widely connected within the west (including, briefly until 1955, the Soviet Union) which ensured them both political and military support in the form of arms sales, they were more organized and had superior fighting forces.

Have you ever looked into the [details of the partition plan](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:-5aTl7ZkL6YJ:world-ice.com/Articles/Inequity.pdf+world-ice.com/Articles/Inequity.pdf&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiqXozQlyjjPORYeWOk27RH3hcwMgUGkXjWbbe3GIrtTIeQ66QjW_lmFFxop7Rh7G7ZFkZ-8ZO_orhMiSatAGrhBag4fNdM4vvkETq49DCt2Yq1y4YZmoiX_vQ9ZXovKb1-1fzq&amp;sig=AHIEtbQdrKk-95fv2DT4_20bM2hVDbFNTA) and asked yourself why the Palestinians didn't agree?

&gt;*The Partition Plan was neither just nor fair. Rather, it was oppressive. The Partition Plan granted 55% of
Palestine to the Jews, who at that time comprised only 30 percent of the population, and who owned a mere 6 or 7% of
the land. Within this Jewish State there were to have been 407,000 Palestinian Arabs. The Arab State was to
comprise only the remaining 34% of the land. The UN Partition Plan also ordered that the most fertile region, be given
to the Jewish settlers. The remaining 45% of Palestine was to comprise a home for the other 70% of the population
who were Arab. The major reason the Palestinians rejected the partition resolution was on the grounds of its lack of
fairness: it proposed to give the minority population an exclusive and hegemonic right to the majority of the land. In
1946, the total population of Palestine was 1,972,0000 inhabitants, comprising 1,247,000 Palestinians and 608,000
Jews, as well as 16,000 others. The Jewish population was composed primarily of foreign-born immigrants, originating
mostly from Poland, Russia and Central Europe. Only one third of these immigrants had acquired Palestinian
citizenship. With respect to land ownership, it appears from the government of Palestine's Village Statistics that the
Jews then owned 1,491 square kilometers (exclusive of urban property) out of a total of 26,323 square kilometers in
Palestine. Thus, Jewish land ownership amounted to 5.6% of the total area of the country. In contrast, the
Palestinians owned the rest of Palestine, including all the areas that were categorised as public domain. Moreover, the
territory allocated to the Jewish State included the coastal plain extending from Akka to Ashdod and other fertile lands,
while the Palestinians, an agricultural people, were left mainly with mountainous and arid regions.*

The Zionists had very little claim to the territory. Even after the waves of Jewish immigration ended, they comprised 30% of the entire population and barely owned 7% of the land. It is worth nothing that Jews [never had majority in any Palestinian district except Tel Aviv-Jaffa](http://imgur.com/gKiQm.gif). The Zionists, assisted by the pro-Zionist British and the UN, got the best and largest parts of the territory handed to them on a silver platter. It's no surprise that the Palestinians disagreed to this kind of plan, since no sane human being would've agreed to it. [Count Folke Bernadotte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Folke_Bernadotte) attempted to fix this blatant injustice by revising the plan to allot more Palestinian-inhabited land to the future Palestinian state and Zionist terrorists [thanked him for his efforts by putting a few bullets in his head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Folke_Bernadotte#Assassination).

&gt;That's the end of my little history lesson -- I'm less acquainted with the period from 1967-present. The message I'm trying to transmit is that Israel isn't simply a white patch slowly encroaching on the countries around it. Between every one of these images there is a complex, deep, and many-faceted history involving wars, conquests, wins, losses and compromises. These images just don't do the history justice.

I'm going to have to call you out on your bullshit on this. Israel has been indeed ""white patch slowly encroaching on the countries around it"" since day 1. The act of its foundation alone can be considered encroachment and [it's showing no signs of stopping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement_timeline). This fundamentally racist, apartheid white patch of state-sponsored terrorism and ethnic cleansing will continue to grow while the whole world looks away (and sometimes cheers in support) until the entire Middle East is covered by it and until all Palestinians are relegated to the realm of non-existance.",0,,1280760498,False,t3_cwd7v,t1_c0vrutb,t5_2cneq,,1426405249,politics,

The argument that there are Israeli-Arabs is as meaningful as denying the holocaust based on the fact that there are Jews in Europe.

Put simply: Ethnic cleansing is the use of conflict to remove people of another ethnicity from their homes by violence or by flight, and preventing them from returning.

Any more complex definition still comes back to this elemental truth. There are no overriding concerns like ""but what about our security"" or ""but we won the war so we get to keep the land"" that suddenly mean its not ethnic cleansing.

The decimal notation apparently was invented to deal with Hindu cosmology, which contains large numbers (i.e, kalpa = 4.32 billion years, mahamantavara = 311 trillion years, etc), concept of the void (shunya = zero, nothingness) and infinity.

The decimal system makes a bit more sense when you realize Indians had a name for each place: eka, dasha, shata, sahasra, 

The vAjasaneyi recension of the yajur veda uses several sets of names for numbers arranged in a progressive geometrical series, where each number is ten times larger than the preceding. In the following passage, the names of thirteen decimal places are mentioned: eka (10^0), dasha (10^1), shata (10^2), sahastra (10^3), ayuta (10^4), niyuta (10^5), prayuta (10^6), arbuda (10^7), nyarbuda (10^8), samudra (10^9), madhya (10^10), anta (10^11), and parArdha (10^12):

The place system was also from least significant to higher significant: four and twenty, rather than twenty four. This made arithmetic naturally easy: for example 24 + 29 in their minds was:

{42} + {92} = {35}

When the system was adopted by the Arabs, who wrote right to left, they inverted the order giving rise to the modern higher significant to lower significant digit order. 

When Europeans adopted this, they did not invert it back, hence our current system.

The elephant in the room is that many (or most) Jews support the existence of a country that exists to protect Jews.

Why do they support it?

They left in mass from European countries because, regardless of whether you see them as an ethnic group or just a religion, they were grouped together and killed. And not just including the Holocaust, before and even after the Holocaust Jews were persecuted, excluded from government, discriminated against, and the victims of pogroms. 

They left in mass from Middle Eastern/Arab countries for the same reasons: persecution, pogroms, and never being truly protected from those things.

The fact is, antisemitism is very real. And whether Jews chose to be grouped together as a single group, they are a group now. Because there are people out there who want to hurt them or want them dead, and those people see Jews as a group. And unlike what Helen Thomas said, and even if America, Germany, and Poland are all great places to live today, Jews don't want to go back there. After thousands of years, they decided to protect themselves by creating a country that expressly protects them.

It is a fact [Jews are hated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#New_antisemitism), and Israel's actions aren't helping them.

But it's also a fact that even before Israel existed Jews have been hated and Jews haven't been well protected. That is why Jews believe they should have a country that will protect them.

Plus, when people criticize Israel...good, moral, progressive people...it also draws out the antisemites...horrible people. And they tend to be among the louder critics. If a reddit post is made criticizing Israel, and it gets 800 upvotes, and the top comment is by a poster who, if you look at all of their other posts, is a blatant and obvious antisemitic, most Jews aren't going to agree with that person. And Jews know those people are mixed in there. It's a fact. 

And, there is a big overlap between people who criticize of Israel and people who are against the right for there to be a state that exists to protect Jews at all. Most Jews are not going to be on board with those same people. I will reiterate again: antisemitism is real. There are people who want to hurt and kill Jews. How do you expect Jews to not take action to protect themselves? Creating a country, with an army, that expressly protects Jews, is how you do that.

It's also hard because there are people everywhere across the world, so to create a country it is going to inevitably hurt people. That is a fundamental truth that the world has accepted, that for people to control land, they have to conquer it. And the people who live there, whether it's natives vs. the first Americans, or Palestinians and allied Arab countries vs. Israel, they fight. It's war. And people die. It's bloody. It's sad. The thing is, there aren't too many recent examples of new countries being formed. Israel is one of them. Israel fought, and still fights, to control this land. People died. It was sad for both sides. But Israel has ""won"" their wars. It's hard to say anyone wins a war when people die, on both sides. But the first Americans killed a lot of natives, and British people, to secure their land, as well.  I'm not using this as an example to justify killing or hurting people. I'm just pointing out that it's being critical of a country for something that every country that was formed from people escaping other lands has to go through in order to become a country. To blame Israel on that fact alone is hard for Jews to get behind because they feel it is hypocritical. 

What Jews do find blameworthy is how the Palestinians are being treated. The vast majority of Jews want a one or two state solution where the Palestinians are protected as well.

So, most Jews and most people who criticize Israel share that common ground. But what they don't share is everything I've mentioned above----Jews believe they have a right to have a country that expressly protects them and one thing they won't do is stand side by side with antisemites and people who are against the idea of Jews having a country that protects them. Also, [there are many Jews who make it their day job to scream and yell for peace](http://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/) for Israel-Palestine. Hm, that's the name of a country I can get behind....Israel-Palestine, a country that expressly protects Jews AND Palestinians. ",0,,1280764296,False,t3_cwd7v,t3_cwd7v,t5_2cneq,,1426405323,politics,

Why don't you understand how salary caps work, or how buyouts work before asking such questions? Especially when it's so easy with the existence of sites like [capgeek.com](http://capgeek.com)...

But I will explain it for you:

Huet will be playing in the AHL or Europe no matter what.  A buyout would cost too much against the salary cap.  The cap problems exist even WITHOUT Huet's contract on the books.  Even with Huet gone, the Blackhawks cannot afford Niemi at $2.75MM without making more moves.

$2.75MM is not worth it because it puts the Blackhawks in a position of having to move yet another player (maybe Sharp) if they want to keep Niemi.

Furthermore, if they kept him at $2.75MM, he'd still be an unrestricted free agent for 2011-12, at which point he'd be due another raise alongside Seabrook and Brouwer - both due big raises.  Something has to give - who are we going to lose?  It's either Sharp or Niemi now, or Seabrook and/or Brouwer and/or Niemi later.

Finally, Niemi was just not that amazing.  He was good, but he was not amazing.  He had the benefit of a D that finally became more responsible in its own end in the playoffs and cleared rebounds - his rebound control is downright BAD despite his athleticism and other good qualities.  He's not an all-star goaltender.

I work for an insurance company owned through American Financial Group. Carl Lindner purchased United Brands, formerly United Fruit (Guatemala (1954) - CIA PBSUCCESS), in 1984. The former executive, Eli Black, committed suicide in 1975 by jumping from the forty-fourth floor of the Pan Am building after a federal investigation revealed that the company had bribed the Honduran president to reduce a per crate taxation that was being enforced by the Union of Banana Exporting Countries. Lindner renamed the company Chiquita Brands International and while he was at the helm would have been aware of the payments being made to the FARC and AUC in Colombia beginning in 1997. Even after the groups were designated as foreign terrorist organizations in September of 2001, and against the advice of legal counsel, Chiquita continued payments ultimately totaling about $1.7 million. Approximately 200,000 people have been kidnapped, disappeared, or murdered in Colombia since 1966 as a result of the struggle between the military, FARC, and AUC.

Additionally, Lindner was an associate of Charles Keating (of the Keating 5, S&amp;L Scandal), a donor to Clinton in the early 1990's when the European Union was negotiating terms for the banana trade (in the hopes of securing the Eastern European market), and a donor to Bush Jr's presidential campaign (and to the Swift Boat Veteran's for Truth).",0,,1280776716,False,t3_cwd7p,t1_c0vs5cx,t5_2qh1i,,1426405501,AskReddit,

If anything, it is a disaster and reveals one of the weaknesses of the democratic system.  In my opinion, the West has a responsibility (the US especially) to do whatever it can to avoid another Taliban era in Afghanistan.  The fact of the matter is that the Dutch departure solidifies in the minds of every politically savvy Afghan the reality that working with the westerners will be slow suicide, guaranteeing death when they inevitably depart.  And the departure of the US will be horrifically bloody and violent, much more so than the occupation is, as the various elements opposed to the western forces use the opportunity to solidify gains.  

I fear that the end of this war will look disgustingly like the fall of South Vietnam.  Although largely ignored in the US, the collapse of South Vietnam and the invasion of the North was horrific, and the pictures of people fighting to stay on the helicopters leaving the US embassy to flee the communists is gut wrenching.  The collapse in Afghanistan will be worse.  I guarantee it.  There are not two sides, but two hundred, and the various forces will turn on each other, specifically targeting the civilian support behind their opponents, in an all out brawl to control the last vestiges of the country.  The violence will be staggering, and the destruction even worse than it already is.  It will, of course, be ignored in the West, if only because they could not stand to watch the results of their actions play out.

This is the reality I think the citizens of the various democracies involved in the war are ignoring, willfully, because they don't want to face the fact that the only acceptable solution is to make a continual commitment to maintaining Afghanistan right now.  Of course, Europe feels no such responsibility, because they can easily pass it off as the US's war in a pinch, and they're used to the US taking care of all the ""unsavory backwash"" from the former colonies and subjects anyways. (Israel/Palestine, Pakistan/India, Vietnam, etc.)  Heck, Europe doesn't even feel responsible for it's own backyard - the former Yugoslavia - or it's minority populations - violence against Roma populations in Europe, virulent racism against African illegal immigrants, ghetto-ization of Muslim populations, etc.

Not that simply sitting around maintaining the status quo will do any good.  There is a plethora of other things that need to be discussed, from replacing vast amounts of the government and military structure to combat corruption, to legal uses of the poppy grown practically everywhere (a discussion France certainly doesn't want to have, seeing as how they control the vast majority of the world morphine market, and competition from Afghanistan would destroy that particular export).  But I think it is childish and stupid to believe that simply leaving will solve all the problems and absolve the West from any obligation to do something, anything, to help solve a problem they directly caused.

**TL;DR:**  I feel that the Dutch departure signals to most Afghans that the Western forces are a hollow ally, and that now is the time to back the Taliban/other anti-western group (many of which are incorrectly placed under the Taliban banner).",0,,1280779941,False,t3_cwct3,t3_cwct3,t5_2qh13,,1426405578,worldnews,

on the other end we have fly fisherpeople who are often just as obsessed with gear as the carpers, but their entire experience on the water is about full involvement in the act of fishing, from casting and catching to examining what the fish are eating and mimicking that food source with home made flies.

We'll read about it in history books in a hundred or more years.

This excludes the escalation of violence scenario. From a global perspective (remember the world is larger than just Europe and the US) Israel is ever more isolated, and sympathy for the Palestinians is on the rise. Aside from that progress in technology and globalization means more powerful weaponry will become more easily available. Even though Israel violence is not, Palestinian violence (despite all the noise made) is at the low point of the cycle. The next cycle could be more powerful than the last (certainly within Israel this is the thinking).

On the other end, what can Israel do? (other than settle for peace of course). Can it really take over the land as you say? By kicking even more people out or by effectively legalizing the apartheid state it is running? I'm not sure either option is acceptable even to the people in Israel. Nor will they accept living under ever increasing intensified violence. (even if it's cyclical in nature).

For the marginal external cost of **CO2**, the EU's Environment bureau uses a range of €19-80/tonne CO2. This goes into their external costs of *electricity* calcs, but it carries over directly.

http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/en35-external-costs-of-electricity-production

The [US EPA reports](http://www.epa.gov/oms/climate/420f05001.htm) there are 2.4 kg carbon per gallon gasoline, which combust to form 8.8 kg CO2 (per gallon). So the EU external costs add up to [$0.22](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=19+euro%2Ftonne+*+8.8+kg&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910)-[$0.93](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=80+euro%2Ftonne+*+8.8+kg&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910) per gallon. This looks smaller than the effects on electricity (on *coal*), because gasoline carbon is far more expensive than coal carbon to begin with; the relative cost is lower.

Air pollution looks less destructive. Similarly, using EC external cost figures (from 1998):

**(PDF)** http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enveco/air/pdf/betaec02a.pdf    
[(Google QuickView)](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Uo59KOmTpfQJ:ec.europa.eu/environment/enveco/air/pdf/betaec02a.pdf+marginal+external+cost+air+pollution&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg7QLhJWrJzYIWVHPZw5nve0GiYjUUe1xIv5z71Fb2dIERVj1ZYJu5PxDBFm1LmrpbWnAyKsJ4ItcfYiTGNsRM_gdQgC8SXrSnW5Ety5eP8z7bQehtXdGoizui2A9rvQQImM3wZ&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ4JXJm5IfnfBw8jCoihGn3aF6kyA)

For example, their (E.U. average) marginal external cost for **nitrogen oxides (NOx)** is €4,200/tonne. According to the [EPA](http://www.epa.gov/oms/consumer/f00013.htm), average US passenger car NOx emissions are 29.9 grams/gallon gasoline burned (reported as 1.39 grams/mile at a fleet average of 21.5 gallons/mile). Hence [$0.17/gallon](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=4%2C200+euro%2Ftonne+*+29.9+grams%2Fgallon+in+USD%2Fgallon&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910). (Note that nitrogen comes from air, not gasoline; but I see no problem with attributing NOx emissions to the gasoline combustion which creates them.)

For **volatile organic compounds (VOCs)**, their marginal cost is €2,000/tonne. [EPA statistics](http://www.epa.gov/air/emissions/voc.htm) say on-road vehicles account for 4.1 million tons/year, so averaging over 138 billion gallons gasoline/year (from above) (this excludes diesel, so understates total motor fuel and overstates *specific* emissions) gives [27 grams/gallon](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=4.1+million+tons%2Fyear+%2F+138+billion+gallons%2Fyear+in+grams%2Fgallon&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=m1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910), for an external cost of [$0.07/gallon](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=4.1+million+tons%2Fyear+%2F+138+billion+gallons%2Fyear+*+2%2C000+Euro%2Ftonne+in+USD%2Fgallon&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910).

**Sulfur dioxide (SO2)** is negligible. According to [EPA figures](http://www.epa.gov/air/emissions/so2.htm) on-road vehicles account for ~1% of US emissions, 146,000 tons SO2/year. Averaging that over 138 billion gallons/year of gasoline gives [0.96 grams SO2/gallon](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=146%2C000+tons%2Fyear+%2F+138+billion+gallons%2Fyear+in+grams%2Fgallon&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=h1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910), so (at €5,200/tonne SO2) [$0.007/gallon](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=146%2C000+tons%2Fyear+%2F+138+billion+gallons%2Fyear+*+5%2C200+Euro%2Ftonne+in+USD%2Fgallon&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910) external costs. (This corresponds to an average *sulfur* content of [180 ppm](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=0.96+grams+%2F+(0.7+kg%2FL+*+1+gallon%29+*+(32%2F64%29&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=CAjtIZkNXTL7dDpKKNvGynLcBAAAAqgQFT9B3O2o&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8ee167a337a45910), which is way too high for gasoline. Explanations: we've ignored diesel, and the EPA data is from 2005, while sulfur contents have [changed a lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_emission_standards#Phase_2_-_2004_to_2009) since then.)

In summary: translating EC and EU external cost figures to US vehicle emissions yields

    CO2  -- $0.22-$0.93 per gallon
    NOx  -- $0.17 per gallon 
    VOCs -- $0.07 per gallon
    SO2  -- $0.007 per gallon (probably much less)

2.  Use Couchsurfing.com - Staying in peoples homes gives you two great things: one better food than any hotel, two a tour guide that comes complete with friends.

3.  Map out the festivals - I did San Fermin, a 6 day rock festival in Budapest, La tomotina, Bastille day and the Tour de France.  What you want to experience is as many festivals as possible so plan countries out by kick ass festivals.

4.  Stay in Hostels - for me traveling is about people and if I can't couchsurf then I would stay in a hostel and make international friends.

5.  get a Sat phone

6.  if you cant hitchhike travel by BUS - Bus is always cheaper than train but you sound like you got money so maybe this tip isn't for you.

I'm also assuming you know that its legal to buy knifes

so amusing these things and how you think that guns and evil and for killing then you will fully support for banning knifes as they are used 4x as often in murders as guns, guns which are already illegal.

&gt;many British Citizens or European citizens find the idea of being able to carry a leathal weapon unnerving.

most British Citizens only have Die hard and modern warfare as there only experience of guns.

it is wrong to ban something based on only an idea of bad'ness or evil'ness without even experiencing what they are about.

as for citizens having leathal weapons at there hard you do know that there are 23million cars on the UK roads that is over a tonne of metal that is injurers and kills more people ever year then all weapons put together. simple distraction and someone is dead no need for systematic decision to kill another human being just a simple mistake or drop in awareness that kills.

you accept that there will always be criminals, then surely every legal UK citizen has the right to defend themselves from crime.

Somehow, despite being sacked twice by Hitler for this, he managed to survive the war and actually put a good hurtin' on the Soviets in the process (he was also a staunch anti-communist).  His son, who was an elected official in some capacity in some city, was recruited to be a suicide bomber by the ""underground"".  He asked his father, the general, whether or not he should do it.  His father replied that not only did he think his very own son should blow himself up in the chance that it might end Hitler's reign, but that so should any self respecting German.  I have children and I can't imagine saying that, but then again, I can't imagine what it was like back then.

[There's an article from the Wall Street Journal about it, but I'm having trouble finding it, so here's one in the VERY conservative National Review mentioning the article ¹](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/60049/not-all-bad/rod-dreher).  It was written during the run up to the invasion of Iraq and the pro-war American commercial media machine was in full swing.  During this time Germany was opposed to using German airspace and/or troops to assist in the war, as was France.  As a result, several extreme right wing media outlets and ""personalities"" were incessant in their criticism of Germany and France - this is where ""Freedom Fries"" came from.

The article, from the conservative WSJ, essentially says, hey, not all Germans were bad guys.  Sort of a backhanded compliment.  The thing that struck me as ""funny"" during this criticism of Germans as being ""weak"", was that people seemed to have forgotten that in WWII, the Wehrmacht's technology, strength, and power was unmatched by any other country... not even closely.  Most of my fellow Americans tend to think of WWII in Europe as the US vs ""the Germans"".  This, of course is ignorant of the fact that MANY Germans wanted no part of the Third Reich (my family included), and the fact that many nations fought the Nazi war machine and sacrificed at a much greater level, as well as many Germans and French who gave all to stop Hitler's advance.

I actually had several relatives who were executed for their parts in the famous bomb plot (aka, Operation Valkyrie), and one of them, Ruth von Kleist, was considered one of the chief planners.  In fact she is profiled in the book *Matriarch of Conspiracy*.

america is full of guns. no amount of idealism or european ignorance will change that. 

with that said, there's plenty of gun laws in place. the problem? the VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST majority of gun crimes are committed by people who either have illegally obtained firearms or aren't legally able to have a gun in the first place. don't believe me? look it up. anywhere you want. the facts are there. 

in the face of such a prevalence of guns, the only logical deterrent is... guns. what else would you do? call the police? don't even get me started on the government's increasing pressure on people to depend on the police instead of themselves. but to humor the situation, lets say you do depend on the police for your safety. i can tell you from experience that they'll never respond fast enough, and unless they show up and catch someone in the act, your report will likely never be fully investigated. 

and one more, king tard. let's take the UK for example. relatively no functional firearms as compared to the US, but similar violent crime rates. wait, what? violent crime? but they don't have guns!

exactly. criminals will always be criminals. if you buy into this reactionist bullshit of ""oh my gawd guns are so bad lets ban guns"" then you'll just stop the people who already respect the law from obtaining a gun that they most likely don't plan to use in a crime. the MILLIONS of guns in america will still exist, but now the only people who can get them are the ones willing to commit a crime to obtain them. if you break the law to get it, you're probably more likely to break the law WITH it.

Diesel is usually somewhere around 30 cents more a gallon than 91 octane (which seems a bit ridiculous as diesel is cheaper to manufacture than gasoline but because the government likes to tax diesel more than gasoline it's a sad reality), though it's hard to find a station that has diesel in many areas. Recently I've been looking at ""economy"" cars here and it's astonishing how poor the mileage is compared to European cars, the best mileage you can get in a gasoline non-hybrid car is around 40mpg (yes, even counting the Smart Fourtwo), the ONLY car that is a 3 cylinder, or has less than 100 horsepower is the Smart Fourtwo.

Our only options for diesel are VW TDI cars (Jetta, Passat and Golf), Suzuki Legacy (very, very rare), and then the high end Mercedes, Audi and BMW (which aren't efficient, but are efficient for luxury cars I guess). In America we have this terrible misconception that hybrids are better for the environment than diesels, which is very unfortunate.

Well okay, my paternal grandmother, she didn't do anything.  Skipped around in Canada being a little girl.  Fine.  She's still alive.

My maternal grandmother, in England, was an aircraft spotter and (later) a radio operator.  She had three different homes destroyed during bombing raids, two of them with her in them at the time.  She died about fifteen years ago.  Still, while out walking one night during the War, she met:

My maternal grandfather, a Pole, who interrupted his medical training to join the Polish Infantry, which didn't work out so well for reasons that are fairly notorious.  About three quarters of his family died in Warsaw in various ways.  He fled to England, joining up with a group of mostly Polish Paratroopers serving under the RAF, I guess, and made several drops throughout the War, including both Arnhem and Berlin.  He was shot three times (all different occasions), and was awarded the Virtuti Militari (Poland's highest military honour), the medal being pinned to his tunic by Churchill himself.  He went on to be a boxer, an award-winning polka dancer, a doctor in the US and Canada, and eventually a frustrating son of a bitch to the children and grand-children devoted to his care in his declining years.  A visiting nurse or cleaning person stole his medal, which had been framed and hung on his wall.  He died about ten years ago.

My (Canadian) paternal grandfather, finally, had a mysterious time of it.  During the earliest stages of the War he was a dispatch rider with the BEF, but was evacuated along with everyone else at Dunkirk.  He saw brief and unspecified action with the general infantry in Italy, and then landed in Normandy on D-Day+3, there to resume his dispatch riding.  He served in France and Holland, and on the drive into Germany, apparently playing some part in the liberation of at least one Concentration Camp.  More than this he refuses to say.  We also suspect that he had two or three other ""wives"" (and possibly children) in England and Europe, but we've got no way to prove this.  He died almost thirty years ago.

My Great Uncle was also involved in liberating some of the Camps.  He later drank himself to death.

We flew into Paris - 3 days

Barcelona - 3 days

Nice - 1 day

Venice - 2 days

Florence - 4 days

Rome - 4 days

Naples - 3 days (mostly for the trip to Pompeii, and if you can make it, the Temples at Paestum)

We then took a train to Brindisi and headed off to Athens. We stopped in Corfu and partied our asses off for 4 days at The Pink Palace ... best 4th of July party I've ever been to, they really did it up for the Americans there, no joke!

Athens - 4 days (or longer, there is a lot to see in and around Athens, don't miss Delphi for some spectacular ruins)

After mainland Greece we headed out to the islands for 11 days (Santorini, Naxos and Paros). Don't skip being totally naked on the beach, it was awesome.

Then we took a ferry to Turkey (I really wanted to see Ephesus, but my wife and sister-in-law were done with ruins), we got on a night bus and headed up to Istanbul, not Constantinople. I think we spent about a week there. One of my favorite places. 

After that we made a quick trip up through Bulgaria and Romania, we didn't spend much time there, we were in a hurry for sister-in-law to catch her flight, I'd suggest more time there.

We got to Budapest and spent a few days exploring. Awesome city, I can't wait to go back.

Next we spent a few days in Vienna, where we wished S-I-L happy travels home, and my wife and I ventured on to Prague.

We were in Prague 4 days, we got a room from a person at the station. It was directly on the main square, 3rd floor almost directly across from the old clock tower. An old lady lived there but traveled a lot and rented her apartment when she was out of town. It was just the two of us and only $15USD/night! That was 8 years ago, but maybe she still rents? I have the phone number if you want it. Anyway, Prague is my favorite city. I could spend more time there, but we had to move on (we've been back since, and I plan to go again!).

Next was Berlin, we were only there for a couple days, but we took an awesome walking tour that lasted 12 hours. I was anxious to get to Amsterdam.

Amsterdam. I don't remember how long we were there.

Next was Brugge, Belgium. We spent 3 days there. It was great. A very romantic city. We both fell in love with Belgian beer. My days of cheap drinking ended in Brugge. 

We had a friend living in Heidelberg so we went and stayed with him for a few days. It's a nice small town, so after a couple days exploring we moved on to Interlaken.

Interlaken is a great place for adventure trips. We took the train that offered awesome views on your way in over the mountains. Then I bought a Swiss Army Knife.

Our trip was coming to an end so we decided to head up to London for a few days, with a side trip to Stonehenge. London was pretty cool, and it was nice to be able to understand people for the first time in nine weeks! After a few days there we headed back to Paris.

The last few days in Paris were sad indeed. We started looking for jobs because we didn't want our ~10 week adventure to end. Luckily while we were there, our applications to teach English in Japan were accepted, and as soon as we got home, we were already packing our bags to move to Asia, where we stayed for 18 months ... but that's another story!

So far we've been to 33 countries together (my wife just one-upped me with Vietnam last month, so she's at 34) and our 3-year-old (who just spent his 3rd bday in Vietnam) has been to 10 countries.

No they are not.  Even the unifying currency, the the Euro is in peril of being drop, and the union failing.  

&gt;What differentiates the EU from the US is that the central federal government of the US can control what policies (statutes) states have to adopt and all states must abide by the Constitution.

Only in certain areas.  And in practice even more leeway is given on social programs and taxation.

&gt;A state in the U.S. is not sovereign. 

Not entirely correct, its an ongoing issue.  Read you're rarely enforced tenth amendment.   But at very least they are semi-autonomous.  They have certain powers that are non-negotiable.

&gt;Countries in the EU are sovereign. So, much more than the EU, the US is a single sovereign polity.

Much like the states in the US, the EU member states have handed over authority in certain matter to a higher power.  The only major differences are which powers they have given up, and the maturity of the union.  

&gt;All the things you listed don't amount to much. Labor laws are still very similar. 

I can point to the minimum wage, but I don't have much more to say... it is a general issue in this country.

&gt;Employees there don't get any more significant protections than employees here. No paid sick leave. No paid vacation time. 

That I will take issue with.  Environmental and worker safety is a completely different ball game in California.  They have some of the most progressive policies in the country.   Texas is a big old wasteland when it comes to worker safety.

&gt;The educational system is the same. Students still have to pay tuition.

I think you will find significant differences in the education system across the country.  I can speak to Texas vs Cali in particular - I worked with teachers in both states.  Texas was a fucking mess - complete train wreck.  With the exception of LA, CA was one of the best funded most advanced school systems my company worked with.

&gt;I guess what I'm saying is that while there may be small differences, they aren't significant ones. Texas and California are very much the same.

I can understand that, 'cause I happen to agree that we don't do enough in this country.  I've been in enough states so far to know that you can't discount the differences.  I can see preferring Canada or Europe, but if you aren't leaving the country... then maybe Texas isn't exactly a greatest spot to be in.",0,,1280792761,False,t3_cw89q,t1_c0vt74e,t5_2qh3l,,1426405845,news,

So: 

&gt; in response to the criminal part, yes there will always be those that commit crimes, but surely it would be better to let them commit crimes without such a dangerous device?

I'm assuming you've heard of the black-market? It may sound racist, but it means: The location in which one trades and sell illegal commodity smuggled from an illegal source esp. outside of the location. [citation urbandictionary.com]

Now, I understand that guns can be hard to come by in the UK (I've never visited, or researched your black market) but generally criminals don't need guns, because no one has them to fight back with, and they're expensive. However, you all are sort of an Island, which would make keeping shit out a little easy. 

We have Canada and Mexico that border us, and those borders are **FUCKING HUGE.** Seriously, like hundreds if not thousands of miles (I don't feel like checking). That's hard to stop stuff from getting in, should we decide to outlaw all guns. 

&gt; many British Citizens or European citizens find the idea of being able to carry a leathal weapon unnerving

I believe you are part right, part wrong. First, I know there are organizations in the UK, and Europe, that are similar to the NRA (National Rifle Association; it's an American gun rights group) over there. They have no where near the membership, money, or power that the NRA does, but they're trying. 

Second, the reason you may feel nervous (unnerved?) about this, is because of where you've received your fire-arm knowledge from: the media, the government, and pop-culture. 

**MEDIA:** I know that your media has to way over exaggerate guns and gun crime because OUR media does, and this is in a pro-guns country. When it comes to knowing anything about guns, our media (Fox, CNN, MSN, it doesn't matter) is fucking retarded, excuse my french.

**GOVERNMENT:** You can disagree with me all day, but when it comes to the government, they (any country) would rather have you unarmed, then armed. Since they've already got you unarmed, they want you to stay unarmed. What's the best way to keep you from getting your rights back? Keep your ass scared. If you know little truth about guns, and you're scared of them, there's no way you'd legalize them.

**POP-CULTURE:** I know you guys have rappers over there (though I'm not sure what they rap about), and I know you have action movies and action tv shows. And you have video games. You base your knowledge on these things, and the majority of people will quickly shiver in fear at the mention of a Glock that passes through a metal detector, a .50 caliber sniper rifle designed for shooting down planes, or machine guns with high capacity clips being used to kill police. All that sounds scary, and it's all myths that have terrified the American public in the past (and I'm sure it still scares some people, but so does monsters in the closet, and full moons, so what are you gonna do?).

My paternal grandfather was a Navy signalman who went with the Marines on Iwo Jima after he got there the second day of the battle. He was told that the average life expectancy of a signalman was six seconds. Six. Seconds. He was on Iwo Jima for all but the first day, tagging along with the Marines as they cleared the island.

He was scheduled to be on the first wave in during Operation Downfall (the planned invasion of Japan). They told his group flat-out: you're not coming back. That's how bad it was going to be. Thankfully (for him) Pres. Truman ordered the atomic bombs dropped and Japan surrendered before he had to go in.

I do not believe the Nazi ""killings"" were part of a ""systematic"" plot or genocide as it is currently described. The fact that dissident views are very aggressively marginalized and that little investigation into the matter is allowed should also tell oyu something. A few things:

* Zionists will say that the holocaust was a systematic genocide (targeting the Jews), but also say that diesel fumes created using engines from captured allied tanks were used in gassings. This is not only an inefficient and possibly unfeasible way to gas large groups of people, but certainly isn't indicative of the meticulous planning that is described. Multiple methods at different camps are also often described. The claim that Zyklon B was used in gassings is also highly suspect. ""Gassings"" may have been little more than delousings at labor camps. 

* The 6 million number first appeared as an estimate of the total number of Jews in Europe, it was somehow spun into a the number killed. The plaque as Auchwitz says 1.5 million.

* Why were inmates at ""death camps"" issued uniforms? Why did Auchwitz have an infirmary?

* Why were their (German) Jewish soldiers in the German army?

* According to Israel's own estimate, [27 million Jews survived the holocuast!](http://www.germarrudolf.com/work/dth/fndgcffor.html)

In part. It is also based on continuity, self-determination, and reality.

One of the cab drivers waiting around the bus station approached me and offered to drive me across the border so I did my best to negotiate with him and we proceeded to leave. 

We walked over to his car, a tiny old red *something*, and he shot the other cabbies a look.  At the time I just assumed it meant ""haha, I got a fare, you didn't.""  We drive along for a good while, probably 45 minutes out into the countryside, really a ""middle of nowhere"" kind of place. He makes a little awkward small talk in broken English with a thick unplaceable eastern european accent here and there. Then he stops the car. He reaches toward me, which startles me a bit, but I realize he's just going for the glove box.  He opens it and pulls out a screwdriver.

He looks me dead in the eye and holds it for just a second, but in that second my head is running wild.  I'm thinking to myself ""Wait, is he robbing me? Is he about to try and fucking *rob* me? What was that look he shot the other cabbies? Fuck me, I'm gonna to have to wrestle this old guy for control of a *screwdriver* now. Is that *really* what's about to happen here?""  Just when I start to brace myself he then abruptly gets out of the car, uses the screwdriver to pop his ""taxi"" sign off the roof and tosses it under his seat. He says, ""If ask, you are doctor, I am guide"" and starts the car.  I'm a little confounded at this point so I mutter something along the lines of ""umm... ok?"" and we drive on.

In fact, when taken as a percentage of GDP, US military spending ranks well behind Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.  And when US military personnel numbers are viewed in comparison to population, North Korea has the biggest military.  Frankly, the reason the US spends so much is because it was (unwillingly) given the responsibility for providing the defensive structure for the non Soviet world, in addition to single-handedly providing for the complete reconstruction of Europe.  So no, the US doesn't want military world domination - it is quite content with cultural and economic predominance :D

And certainly the mujaheddin were extensively funded by the US - *Charlie Wilson's War* is a good Hollywood rendition of the story.  However, the Taliban (a conservative religious group) largely gained power once the funding stopped flowing and the Soviets had left Afghanistan, and the US's stupidity in ignoring regional/internal crises after the collapse of the Soviets (Think Afghanistan and Somalia) came back to bite their asses.  

I would not go so far as to say the war in Afghanistan was profit oriented war - rather an ignored and mismanaged war, hampered by the US's almost legendary inability to pick a favorite that isn't a corrupt asshole - the same thing happened in Vietnam, Korea, Latin America in general, etc.  The facts are that the only real long term option with any chance of success is a continued commitment, allowing time for significant revisions to the plan.",0,,1280802386,False,t3_cwct3,t1_c0vtmnp,t5_2qh13,,1426406047,worldnews,

I do still find some disagreement with your opinion, although I find this a difficult one to deal with.  Go to a wide range of European countries and look at who the toilet cleaners are and you'll find that inevitably there are a high proportion of ethnic minority workers.  In some ways, for an immigrant with no established connections in their new country, the opportunities for work at the start are not that much better in the UK than say in the UAE or Saudi.  The difference comes from the fact that for some immigrants, this can be a starting point to building a better and more prosperous life (although sadly this is probably not true for the majority).

Israel however as a fairly wealthy first-world country could offer this same opportunity.  While it may not be considered desirable from our comfortable middle-class point of view, there are those who given the choice, would prefer clean toilets if there was even a small chance of a better tomorrow, rather than be expelled altogether.  Israel through its policy of ethnic purity is denying them even this chance.

Also, at the risk of invoking Godwin's law, with Israel's own leadership actively promoting the ethnic purity of the nation to the point of expelling non-Jews, this kind of rhetoric is skirting so close to certain WW2 Nazi ideals, it's not even funny.

But the point of guest workers was never to allow people to build a better life.  That was always incidental. The point has always been do dirty jobs the natives didn't want.  Europe came to recognize the invariable contradictions, and grudgingly gave guest workers full residency and citizenship.

What has always troubled me about guest workers is that they are attempt to create a working underclass, for when one's own citizens won't stoop that low.  Maybe a fair deal in this case is the creation of a temporary underclass, with room for advancement.   But any culture with an emphasis on ethnic purity (eg Saudi, or Israel) will never take this route, so their desire for guest workers amounts the creation of a perpetual, rotating underclass.

In the future, try giving that tone a shot from the start. 'K? I *challenge* you.

Now about my personal biases: that's not germane, though I guess you stipulated as much. It's also not an issue. My family history involves persecution from both the Nazi and Soviet regimes -- and, like nearly any non-Jewish family from East-Central Europe -- some amount of collaboration or at least cooperation with both. I have plenty of bias against both, and plenty of sympathy for the plight of the average Russian (which I am not) as for the average Jew (which, also, I am not).

The whole point of my statement about Stalin, which you seem to miss entirely, was that Stone was clearly exaggerating by blaming 25-30 million Russian lives on Hitler. That number represents the entirety of all deaths in the Soviet Union's pre-war borders, military and civilian. Hitler is simply not *solely* culpable the way he is culpable for *all* the deaths of the Jews rounded up in concentration camps and murdered. Stone might be right -- there might well be as much Russian blood on Hitler's hands as there is Jewish, if not more, but the comparison Stone made is simply invalid.

---

There seems to be a legitimate difference in values here. You ask this:

&gt; So which is it - the idea that every Human life is worth the same or emotionally speaking, they are not worth the same?

Well, if that's the limit of the question at hand, then yes, they are all worth the same.

But there are critical distinctions I am making that you refuse to make: There are some deaths that come with greater suffering than others. There are some *murders* that come with greater suffering than others. There are some murders that *cause* (and rightly so) greater moral outrage. There is much suffering that is not death, but is comparable to death -- rape, torture, extended and egregious child abuse, to name a few -- all of which are regularly used as tools of terror in genocides, including Amin, al-Bashir, and Hitler, and many others.

At the same time, I don't find that head-counting is a worthwhile method of tallying human suffering; I doubt that any method is worthwhile. The only way I can make a comparison is the following: If I were given the choice to be dropped into one horrifying situation or another, which would I prefer? Let's say you could be transported into a life as a Polish Jew in 1937 or a Russian Slav the same year. I would take my chances with Russia any day. Can you say you'd choose differently?

---

On the point of anti-Semitism, why you and Stone making this comparison in the first place? If you want to make the point that Western portrayals of WWII tend to overlook the horror of the Eastern Front, then go for it -- we certainly overemphasize the importance of, Normandy in comparison to Stalingrad, whether in terms of bloodshed, human suffering, or just plain military importance.

But the comparison to Jews who died in the camps or at the hand of the Einsatzgruppen -- especially when it's linked to complaints about the ""Jewish control over the media"" and Israeli foreign policy -- do indeed smack of anti-Semitism, in the same way that (as I suggested in my first post) ""alternate"" descriptions of the U.S. Civil War that minimize the importance of slavery smack of racism. I bring up anti-Semitism, because I see it as the likely explanation for making the comparison in this manner. Perhaps it's not, but it's a nasty way to talk about really awful things. You say I'm doing the same? Well, yes, that's part of the point: I can argue the opposite way, and your angry reaction demonstrates how stupid the game is in the first place.

Now, you didn't bring it up -- Oliver Stone did -- so it is he who I suspect of anti-Semitism. But I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, considering his history, and say that he's just a plain old jackass.

Bottom line:

 * Genocide is almost certainly the worst kind of suffering imaginable. Making comparisons to the suffering incurred in genocides -- or indeed, between two different ones -- is in really bad taste; making comparisons between genocide and pretty much any other suffering is worse. That is not to diminish how we view other instances of suffering, but rather to reject any attempt to diminish how we view the suffering in genocide.
 * Body counts are not a useful method of tallying suffering; no method is. You can compare individual suffering (in very loose and unreliable ways; though it's usually best avoided).
 * When talking about the Holocaust, don't go making statements about the control of the Jewish elites over media, etc., as Stone did. That's just really bad form, inasmuch as it's precisely the kind of hate-mongering and scare-tactics Hitler used.
 * I really need to stop wasting my time on this discussion.

This is exactly why the EPL doesn't want to impose a salary cap. If Rooney's salary suddenly dropped from 90k GPB a week to half... he will have Spanish powerhouses knocking at his door offering much much more. You would see a mass exodus of players out of England.

Unless I've been lied to the world over, the Soviet Union practically matched the US base for base around the world until it's collapse (Which is actually one of the stresses that helped collapse the Soviets, they couldn't keep up with US spending - belated yay for capitalism?)

It is public knowledge that the Soviet Union was financed with loans from Western bankers. The Soviet empire collapsed when they couldn't get any more loans from said bankers.
Even the Communist manifest was written for the most part by a Western European banker, so much that Marx' publisher initially refused to publish the manifest under Marx' name.

The West could have stopped financing the Soviet/Russian government and it would have never risen to where it was, but hey it kept weapons sales and production on a high level and all that weaponry needed big loans from commercial banks to get produced and it needed to be bought by governments who loaned the money from the privately owned central banks.

So regarding the US that's where we are now. Hundreds of military bases all around the world. From Spain to Japan. 11 trillion dollars debt and hundreds of billions of yearly interest payments paid by taxpayers to a privately owned central bank.

It was kind of weird because he was very progressive, open minded, and charitable.  Refused to drive cars, only rode transit, vegetable gardened everywhere he could find space and gave most of it away.  Always had poor street people over for dinner and would always buy a homeless person lunch if he went out.  Made sure to take care of all the old widows houses on the street.  Once my grandmother bought him a nice coat for Christmas.  A few hours later riding the street car he saw a homeless man shivering on a vent, he ran out and gave him his coat and all the money in his pocket, including their fare money for the ride home.  Grandma was not happy about that.  He also hated TV and loved music and dancing.  People thought he was nuts because of all the black man’s Jazz he used to crank.  He was also the first to except the gay members of the my family.  When he died the funeral home was rammed with homeless people who had cleaned up as best they could and were wearing what donated good will suits they could find.  Apparently he had been donating his time at the Salvation Army shelter everyday after work for the past few decades and had never ever told anyone.  Didn’t feel the need, it was just what you are supposed to do.

He was in a for a long time.  Italy, D-Day (Juno beach, I am Canadian), France, Holland, and Belgium.  One of our most important family heirlooms is a german flare parachute he had written on every part of Europe he visited.  He would NEVER talk about the bad side of the war.  The only stories he would tell were of the practical jokes they would play on each other, or the places he visited.

My grandfather from the other side was in the Navy.  I have some great pictures of him and a surrendering U-Boat and it’s crew.  The crew of the submarine looked exactly like the crew from “Das Boot”.  They looked really, really bad.  I think they might have seen their share of depth charges in their day.

Him and my grandma took care of a lot of kids over the years.  253 in total according to the plaque from the Children’s Aid Society, plus all the teenage friends of my dad and his siblings whose rotten parents had kicked them out.

The pull is I do like the idea of traveling, living in a different place, seeing the world, etc. I'm not only looking at international, but I'm definitely open to international positions.

The push is that I think there might be better opportunities overseas. The large US engineering firms are becoming increasingly outsourced and dominated by H1B visas. The companies don't have any loyalty to the country and turn down scores of competent, skills graduates to bring in cheap foreign workers. And of course, the government lets them get away with it. There is not a shortage of technical people in the country, but the firms just outsource and bring in foreign engineers left and right.

Yes, it is a bit ironic that I would be seeking a similar situation to H1B visas in this country. The difference is, I'm hoping to find a country with a legitimate shortage of technical people. I get the feeling the countries of Europe are much more protective of their people, and will only allow in foreign workers when there is an actual labor shortage. 

Yes, I would likely end up paying higher taxes in a place like Germany or Norway, but I think it mostly balances out. In Norway the same position pays significantly more than in, say Houston. Plus, you actually get something for your taxes (healthcare, dependable retirement) and I wouldn't have to pay so much to support imperial adventures. 

So yeah, it's a push/pull situation. Yes, the oil industry is doing decently well right now, but not as well as you think. There are a billion postings for 'senior engineer' 'lead engineer' 'principal engineer' 'experienced engineer', etc. It seems everyone has trouble filling these positions because no one is training enough junior people.

Tiger Lager Beer - for full disclaimer I am biased because I have been to their brewery in Southeast Asia (and had an incredible time, I am actually wearing a silk Tiger Beer shirt as I type this), but this is a very decent lager and one of the cheapest beers on the site. Very doable session beer.

Warsteiner Beer - wonderful session beer, but at these prices I'd rather have 2.5 Tiger Lagers

Stella Artois Beer - for this price I would tell them to GTFO, get another Erdinger Weiss Dunkel and pocket the difference

Amstel Lager - get 3 Tigers for the same price

Gulden Dark Beer&amp;Glass Giftset - I don't know if you want to pay for the glass giftset, but this is an amazingly unique and delicious tripel with a dark, roasty malt twist. This is a beer that I immediately order if I see it on an import menu. I actually had one at Monk's in Philly this weekend, to share with dining partners who had lived in Europe for many years. I warned them that I knew of no other beer to compare it to, and they were equally at a loss for comparison. Everyone agreed on how delicious it is. 

Hoegaarden Beer - Holy shit are you in luck (according to your description of preferred beers)!!! Blue Moon isn't a micro my friend, its contracted by Coors. But if you like it, take the opportunity to experience what Blue Moon fantasizes about being. Hoegaarden: Blue Moon:: Making love to your partner: Masturbating in a public restroom. Hoegaarden is an international standard. Any new hefeweiss I try is compared to this. If it comes close, its a hit. 

Lindemans varieties - If you like all the fruity stuff Leinenkrugels puts out, you'll get down on this for sure. I don't do fruit lambics, but if they are your style then these brands are supposedly the bee's knees. 

Kingfisher Premium Lager - compared to the other prices listed from this site there is no way in hell I would get one of these

Asahi, Kirin Ichiban, and Sapporo varieties - I haven't had nearly all of the various styles sold here, but I would not recommend any of the brands from what I *have* had. Rice beers to the fullest.

c0vu91b,t1_c0vu91b,0,0,0,True,True,JudgeHolden,0,"&gt;So you assert that:
There is a Jewish conspiracy that controls ""Hollywood""
the Jewish people don't exist anyway.

Scarcely.  I assert that there are a lot of people in Hollywood who identify as Jews and who have a great deal of influence.  I am not at all interested in positing the existence of some kind of ""Jewish conspiracy,"" and I think that you have unfairly read that intent into my remarks, perhaps because, as is the case with many Jews, you are prone to being overly defensive.  

My rejection of ""Jewishness"" as an ethnicity, on the other hand, does not in any way undermine the concept of ""Jewishness,"" beyond claiming that membership has far less to do with genetics than it does with belief, and therefore is not grounds for the title of ""ethnicity.""  

Since you and I both know it's a little more complicated than that, allow me to elaborate.  In point of fact, the vast majority of North American Jews *do* share a loosely defined ethnicity in that they are overwhelmingly Askenazic and of Central and eastern European descent.  The fact that genetically, they have much more in common with their historical Germanic and Slavic neighbors than they do with Sephardic Jews, is somehow supposed to be trumped by the tiny thread that they share with Sephardic Jews, as if that were a criteria that anyone has ever used to define an ethnicity.  

I am of Irish descent, for example, and recent DNA studies have shown that the Irish share a series of genetic markers that, as far as we know, seem to only occur in Basque, Cornish, Welsh and Irish populations.  Do I somehow imagine that due to this distantly shared genetic heritage, the Irish and Basques are therefore the same ethnicity?  I do not.  In fact, the Irish are much more closely related to their Scots and English neighbors and as such, if they're going to claim a shared ethnicity, those are the people with whom they will do so.  

This in contrast to many Jews who seem to imagine that one common thread, no matter how distant and adulterated, on religious grounds, somehow constitutes an ethnicity.  

Again, pardon me if I don't buy it.

The problem with Judaism is that it's tried to set itself up as an ethnicity, when in fact it's just one more sick and badly twisted religion that continues to poison minds all over the world.

General rule - stay away from James Hansen and his GISS ""data"".  Hansen is the author of the five most famous debunked global warming falsehoods - including your force driver data: 

1) The famous hockey stick theorem

2) Tree ring data stating it was warmer now than the last millennium that flat lined the medieval warming period and the ice ages.

3) The [temperature readings that said the last decade was the warmest on record](http://fumento.com/climate/globalwarming.html) that NASA had to correct.  

4) The Y2K temperature anomaly showing last decade in US as warmest in century.

5)[And then found the IPCC forcing data from solar is drastically undercut in the models.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533290/Climate-chaos-Dont-believe-it.html) NASA and the IPCC has had to correct all these assertions in their reports from Hansen.  They figured out in 2006 that the forcing models we already being ridiculously reduced in the simulations.  Read to the bottom of the article.

**This is NOT historical data. **

&gt;The following figures show effective global climate forcing employed in our current global climate simulations (e.g., Hansen et al. 2007a,b), relative to their values in 1880.

Read the caption under the graph.  It is a simulation.  You can make a model say anything you want it to.  This is 4/5 of your ""horsepuckey"" data sources as debunked models.

I can show you the chart is false in 30 seconds.  Take another look at your chart again.

Take the green line out.  What do you have - you have zero increase in temperature. Actually more negative do to volcanic activity since that he modeled negative forcing is so much greater than anything else besides greenhouse. There is no other forcing function in the model driving the warming.  In Hansen's model ALL of the net forcing warming is from Greenhouse gasses.  Hansen starts his model in the middle of the Little Ice Age and has green house gasses responsible for coming out of it.  You said yourself you thought TSI diverged in 1980. Even by your own admission, solar drove us out of the ice age - so why is his solar irradence not a forcing function?

If you don't believe me - Hansen's model doesn't even stand up to a quick scrutiny - [let alone a review](http://www.appinsys.com/GlobalWarming/HansenModel.htm)

I think you should research the quantity of water moisture feedback and relationship to C02 forcing - Water moisture feedback is 90% more effective in temperature changes than C02 - but keeps getting left out as a driver.  The reason - it doesn't support global warming is man made by C02 theorem.  And water moisture doesn't trade well on a global stock market - no one is creating it and can't be taxed.

Check data - CO2 is far from stagnant - and changes with temperature as a lag - not a forcing function.  [And history is very cyclical.](http://www.grida.no/publications/vg/climate/page/3057.aspx)

Also - everything ""feedback"" and ""forcing"" is solar.  It is all how earth responds to the sun.  Stop throwing the sun out - the Sun is responsible for ALL of the thermal energy.  Nothing else is creating it.  Even forcing is at the mercy of solar - it is not the other way around.

The Medieval Period is far from strawman.  It is real data.  The world did not have massive migrations from warm weather - they flourished.  The world had massive migration in cold weather.  It is not coincidence the middle of Little Ice Age - was the search for other land and the founding of Jamestown - because 1/3 of Europe's population has been wiped out plague and famine do to massive crop failures in the previous 100 years.  Again - you are making assumptions of migration and failure based on models and ignoring real data.  

If it is so real - why all the false models?  It should bother you - that someone like Hansen at NASA is putting out such garbage - but is still employed.  It should bother you - that all these models have such falsehoods in them.  That something you said was so proven - has so many holes in the model.  If you even thought about following the money - you would understand why CO2 taxing stays the driver no matter how false the data they put out.",0,,1280819961,False,t3_cva9z,t1_c0vu00y,t5_2cneq,,1426406333,politics,

c0vugxw,t1_c0vugxw,0,7,0,True,True,IRBMe,7,"&gt; Yes, it does. The OP is asking why I think it is right. Those are my reasons.

Well then your reasons don't answer the question! They might answer the question of why you happen to think Christianity is *better* than some other religions, or why you *like* Christianity, but it certainly doesn't provide any explanation as to why Christianity is *right* over any other religion. For example, the popularity of Christianity have nothing to do with whether or not it is *correct*. That's an argument ad populum - an appeal to popularity.

&gt; You may disagree with them, but why I think what I think is my own to decide, not yours.

You can think whatever you like, but that doesn't mean you've provided a satisfactory explanation that answers the question. You've certainly replied to the question but you haven't really provided any *answers* - that is, you haven't given us any explanations which tell us why Christianity might be correct over other religions. Instead, you've merely distracted us with why you happen to think Christianity is cool. Nobody's interested in that right now.

&gt; And your point is? I said that the answers exist and are self-consistent. I didn't say that you would have to like them, nor that they would be necessarily better than any other. So, you're arguing that the answers do not have properties that I did not ascribe to them, thus I am wrong?

No, I am arguing that the replies you provided do not posses the properties of replies that would actually satisfactorily answer the question that the OP asked. Whether or not *you* ascribe those properties to them is irrelevant. The fact that you can come up with something self-consistent means nothing, but I certainly don't accept the claim that it's self-consistent anyway. Although that's not the sort of thing we should get in to now. There are easily tens of massive debates that could spawn from this, but to mention only a couple of possible inconsistencies:

* God is the epitome of love, the perfectly moral and loving being. Yet Hell exists and there's the problem of evil
* God is omniscient and omnipotent and created us all, yet we all have free will.

&gt; It may be shocking to you, but 'truth' does not care about your opinion. Just because you deem them 'not good' answers in your opinion do not make them false. It is just your opinion.

""That's just, like, your opinion, man!"" Classic. Well truth doesn't care a bout your opinion either, which is really my point, isn't it? You're giving us your opinion of why Christianity is better than other religions. We don't care. We want to know why you think it's *right*. ""*better*"" and ""*right*"" are rather different concepts. You seem to be confusing the two.

&gt; Hardly a special pleading.

It's the very definition of [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading): ""*Essentially, this involves someone attempting to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule, principle, etc. without justifying the exemption.*"" Simply announcing that everything has to come from somewhere, *except God* is trying to exempt God from that first rule without any reason to do so, other than because it helps your case if you do.

&gt; God doesn't exist outside of time.

Prove it.

&gt; Really? You might want to take a look around. The only similarity is 'someone did it.'

Exactly. That's a pretty important similarity. They all posit the idea of a deity creating the universe. The differences lie in who did it and in the particular details of *how* they happened to go about it, but the *how* is of no concern right now. I said they answer the question of where the universe came from in the same way: a deity.

&gt; According to you, nothing has nothing to do with the fact that it is right. You could try to understand the argument for a change, you know? Are you aware that truth does not care about your opinions?

""That's just, like, your opinion, man!""

Nothing *you're saying* has anything to do with the question. You might *think* these are reasons why Christianity is *correct* compared to other religions, but that's just, like, your opinion! You've certainly explained why you think Christianity is cool, and all, but that's not what was asked. You could try understanding the question, for a change.

&gt; ""Clear perspective"" means clear (8) perspective (7). Again, your opinion is irrelevant to truthness.

""That's just, like, your opinion, man!"" Explain how that makes Christianity *right* but not Islam, say.

&gt; I am not talking about how much it has spread, but about its impact. In spite of the fact that Islam is wide-spread, its impact on the world is meaningless, except in the Middle-East region.

That's blatantly false, for a start. Islam is having a huge impact all over the world. In Britain, they are setting up Sharia courts and lobbying to make Sharia law part of common law; in France, the ban of the Burka is causing massive protests; in Denmark, there have recently been huge Islamic protests and killings due to the drawings of the Prophet Mohammed; in New York, the twin towers were destroyed by Islamic fundamentalists believing they were going to be martyrs; ""[Islam](http://pewforum.org/Muslim/An-Uncertain-Road-Muslims-and-the-Future-of-Europe.aspx) is already the fastest-growing religion in Europe. Driven by immigration and high birthrates, the number of Muslims on the continent has tripled in the last 30 years. Most demographers forecast a similar or even higher rate of growth in the coming decades.""

No impact at al? Really? Do you pay attention to world events?

&gt; Christianity has a world-wide impact.

Explain in what way its impact is more significant than, say, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism etc. and then explain how this makes it *right* compared to those others. That was the question asked.

&gt; The strawman arguments started

Asking a question is not a strawman argument.

&gt; Allow me to ignore the rest of your argument.

Nothing new there then.

&gt; Again, your opinion is irrelevant.

""That's just, like, your opinion, man!"" And so is everything you've said, but it's not actually *answering the question*.

&gt; Well, according to your opinion, I haven't.

""That's just, like, your opinion, man!"" Are you a broken record?

&gt; You know, people that don't argue basing their arguments on their own biased and unbased opinions.

You have failed to even address the question of why Christianity is *right* and Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, Jainism etc. are not. How do you know this? You haven't even attempted to explain. All you've done is say how much you like Christianity because X, Y and Z are pretty cool. That is *not* an explanation of why it is right or not. It's all irrelevant.

&gt; Others disagree.

I'm certainly [*not*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/cwer8/im_sure_youll_have_been_asked_this_before_but/c0vs4if) the [only person](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/cwer8/im_sure_youll_have_been_asked_this_before_but/c0vsp31) in this thread to point out that you [haven't answered](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/cwer8/im_sure_youll_have_been_asked_this_before_but/c0vs5ir) the question.

First maybe you should know I'm not from US but from Honduras and that I've lived 1 year in Germany and 7 years in Spain (in both places you have government sponsored healthcare) but I have never used it because I do believe private insurance is better (if you can afford it). I've always supported universal access to healthcare but I used to do it for moral/ethical reasons, i.e. it's a right, the decent thing to do, etc. Now I still support it but for more practicale reasons and I'm careful to distinguish its usefulness/effectiveness depending on the circumstances. 

For instance:

 * I don't think its sustainable in the US under your current budget, however, if you end your wars plus some defense spending like [Ron Paul and Barney Frank](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/107229-why-we-must-reduce-military-spending-reps-barney-frank-and-ron-paul?sms_ss=reddit) suggests...
 * I believe healthcare is flawed in Spain in the sense that it rewards doctors based on the number of patients he/she diagnose not on the effectiveness of the diagnose/treatment plus you also get to wait long time for their services, etc. I've convinced most of my friends to switch to private insurance its worth it at least here. It really paid off when they detected a tumor close to my wife's womb, many doctors just wanted to extract her womb right away, fortunately there is an MD Anderson clinic here which cared enough to try and extract the tumor without damaging her womb (they succeeded!). So basically I'm saying even if everyone agrees on implementing healthcare you need to be careful on how you design it (unintended consequences) and also on how you run costs as Spain is expected to be the next Greece, i.e. default financially since they spent too much and produce too little, basically they've been able to afford their social services thx to EU loans. Now that they have to make cuts everyone is protesting and boycotting the govt. (well, not now cuz its summer... but in september....).
 * and finally, I think healthcare in Honduras is a must given the level of poverty and social discontent going on now. However, do notice that education AND healthcare are already (and have been for some time) the greatest costs in Honduras budget but the effectiveness of the government to actually deliver it efficiently is near zero, so in countries like Honduras you have to deal first with the effectiveness of government officials (yes, there is corruption but I've seen many cases where just pure dumb incompetence and ignorance causes the wastes) then with producing enough for the country to be sustainable (which is not the case now) and only then can we devise a good income redistribution services.",0,,1280825435,False,t3_cv096,t1_c0vozs0,t5_2qh1s,,1426406384,Economics,

Yes, that was a typo. The British promised the Arabs self-rule if they helped them against the Ottomans. After the war they betrayed the Arabs and carved out the middle east with the other European powers.

&gt; Before that, it was the Ottomans, before that, the Egyptians (who went back and forth with the Ottomans). Last time it was under Arab rule was about 900 years ago, but was still a remote colony of larger Caliphates.

It was hardly a ""remote colony"" since the area is Holy to Islam as well and the has been culturally arabised for a long time. It was a central part of the Arab world.

&gt;Last time it was an indepdendent state was 140 BCE, under the Hasmoneans (aka Jews).

Only for a few decades. The Palestinians are also in large part descended of the ancient Israelites who became arabised over time. In fact they're probably much closer related to the ancient Jews then the recent Ashkenazi invaders.

&gt;Palestinian fatalities estimated between 1000-25000. The larger number would far exceed the number directly killed by Israel in the last 60 years. The smaller would be comparable.

So in other words your claim is just speculation. And note that Israel killed more than a thousand people in operation cast lead alone.

&gt;Bush's Tax Cuts Are Unfair ...To the rich.

.

&gt;I know there's a lot of hype to the contrary, but look at the numbers. If you and your spouse have a taxable income of $60,000 a year, you've had almost a 24 percent income tax cut since President Bush took office. (And ditto if your income was just $20,000.) Meanwhile, the folks who make $350,000 a year got a cut of only about 12.5 percent; those who make $1 million a year got an even smaller cut.

&gt;Pre-Bush, the $1 million a year couple paid 33 times as much as the $60,000 couple; today they pay more than 38 times as much. Here's the big picture:
Advertisement

&gt;Overall, the biggest percentage cuts went to the poorest of the poor (those with incomes in the $10,000 range) and the next biggest to those making about $60,000. After that, with some minor dips up and down, the relative size of your tax cut falls off as your income rises. 

http://www.slate.com/id/2108201

And the estate taxes? 

Prior to the tax cuts there was a 55% maximum tax rate on all inherited assets above a $1 million exemption and was brought down to a 45% rate with a $3.5 million exemption.

That stopped some of the migration of the US capitals overseas but the tax is still ridiculously high. Nobody wants to work all his life and give the the Big Govt half of what he owns. Also in may cases, it's a double taxation for the same thing, by the states and by the federal Govt. 

In the ""socialist"" Europe that tax is much smaller and in many countries it has been eliminated altogether. 

And in the campaign Obama said he would even push the exemptions further by exempting all estates under $7 million.

But go on with the stupid propaganda: ""OMG TEH REPUBLICANS LOVE TEH RICH"".

However, getting them to admit that equality doesn't exist is a bit of a stretch. 

You might try asking them if they have a dog or cat. Ask them if they allow their dog or cat to make its own decisions. Ask them if they ever override its will. Ask them if they consider their dog or cat to be ""equal"". 

Then ask them if they abuse their dog or cat. 

The analogy of a pet might be a better fit in their minds for what you are than the analogy of a slave. Now, *we* like the term ""slave"", because, well, it's hot. 

But most of these people's experience of the word ""slave"" comes not from the Greek and Roman tradition of keeping slaves (where slavery was a condition of life in which more or less anyone could find themselves), but from the British and American history of keeping African slaves. This was not really a British idea, since there was no path in English common law for someone to become a slave; but by the same token, since English common law had no tradition of slavery, there was no explicit ban on the importing of slaves from cultures that had such practices... such as those in Africa. 

The slavery of blacks, therefore, was actually an African invention, but when these slaves were imported to Europe and the Americas, it acquired a racial overtone. This is considered a particularly ugly episode in British and American history, especially as these slaves, being distinct from the population they were slaves in, where treated as an inferior race, something that was not, could not be, true in ancient Greece and Rome. 

While it's not unheard of for BDSMers to play even with this (heh, nothing is sacred to us pervs!), it does, in general mean that the word slave has some special overtones in most of the English-speaking world.

No other country on the planet has come close to this ""experiment"" (Europe and its 50 million dead from war in the 20th century is not an ideal model). It's not ""American culture"", it's the political system and what it guarantees people that makes them comes here.

Does that make our ""culture"" better? First, I'm not talking about culture but rather our political system--why you are conflating the two is beyond me. Second, no. Though I would much prefer to live here where citizenship is based on the Constitution and not heritage or antiquated notions like religion and race. 

BTW, since you keep bringing up American culture, care to actually define it?  As far as I can tell, culture in the Northeast is different from the South, which is different from the MidWest. Even culture on Long Island is different from northern Maine. Certainly similarities overlap in regions, but to lump all 50 states under the same ""American culture"" is a gross generalization, lacking necessary nuance. It's like discussing ""European culture""--using such a broad notion is almost useless for serious discussion.",0,,1280838095,False,t3_cwhlq,t1_c0vtyso,t5_2qh13,,1426406478,worldnews,

&gt;Nope, not at all. The OP made a terrible analogy. And used what, to modern Americans, seems like distinct well understood national distinctions. My point is that all of the boundaries and identifications in question have been fluid. Two current Middle Eastern nations existed in 1910. Every single nation in the area has had boundary changes since then. The Palestinian do not lose their rights because their self-identification has changed. But neither do they get automatic rights simply because we name them something distinct.

oops.

&gt;Then it is really sad that they ended up with the PLO and Hamas (and Egypt and Syria) as their champions.

Yes, it is. It's funny how people with no power over their lives become subject to terrorist organizations. Sort of the same excuse Israel used for terrorist acts on the British.

Your other brain has bells on it? OK. How about reading something about various Native American tribes that no longer exist. The means of ridding the US of the ""Indian problem"" was to decimate them and starve them. It worked. Maybe that will ring your bell.

Edit: My point is that Israel contributes to it's own problem with it's attacks and subjugation of the Palestinian people. Israel has become a perpetrator of what it was a victim of in Nazi Germany. I'm currently reading a book about counter insurgency. The trick to defeating it is to coerce the population to trust you more than the enemy. Germany failed in it's attempt to dominate Europe, in part due to it's treatment of the people's it conquered. This resulted in insurgency and a population that helped their enemies.

We have three different homebirth attendants here: Direct Entry Midwives (DEM) who are generally VERY behind on their educational milestones and qualifications, and cannot legally practice in one third of all US states, Certified Nurse Midwives (CNM) who are registered nurses with additional training in delivery and pregnancy, and doulas who... Well, you tell me. Some believe in homeopathy (also found in some DEM courses) and giving birth in kiddie pools, refusing medical interventions even when indicated, etc. 

Many women turn to homebirth to avoid hospital interventions or to make delivery ""less medical"" or ""not a medical procedure"". While I appreciate the sentiment, it's not in line with reality in most cases. Birth is natural, sure, but so is women and children dying in a lot of childbirth. A degree of medical intervention is necessary. Women who go in with the set goal of avoiding interventions may be seeking ""professionals"" who promise and believe in a complete lack of modern medical care in delivery. This can be extremely dangerous, and there are a sad number of cases of women and their babies dying due to reckless homebirth attended by DEMs, doulas, or nobody at all. CNMs are at least legally required to transfer women to hospitals and have a standard education in modern medicine, but since it's very hard to study homebirth in the US, one can't conclusively say their homebirths are safer. Many CNMs don't even do homebirth for fear of being lumped into other statistics or impressions. 

A big problem is the gut reaction some people get when they discuss homebirth in the US. Are you talking about women who irresponsibly seek out pseudo-professionals who believe in homeopathy, aromatherapy and not transferring to hospitals? Are you speaking of an educated woman who understands the c-section rate of hospitals being just as negligent? Who knows.

Many do not operate out of homes, for a variety of reasons. However, they are a nurse, like any other nurse, PLUS the additional birth training. As nurses, their education is more nationally standardized and much more likely to ""mean something"" whether you're talking about a nurse in Texas or a nurse in Vermont. CNMs are required to hold a master's degree as of 2010.

Direct entry midwives obtain a post high school certificate in midwifery from private schools. They cannot legally practice in at least 13 states. Their coursework varies wildly within state and between state, so their certificate does not tell a consumer much about their level of professionalism. Many are competent. Many are far from it. A certified school in Utah, for example, has Chinese herbal medicine, aromatherapy and homeopathy as required courses. Compared to the European standards, they are grossly lacking in hands-on training. They require zero hours of experience with special needs deliveries (what to do if something goes wrong!) and often a third or less of required hours dealing with actual births. Sometimes, again, the programs are fine and they receive adequate medical training and experience, but you can't know from the degree. 

The association in charge of midwives nationally is MANA. MANA does not release their data (and they have the most out of anyone) on homebirth outcomes unless you sign a form stating you will only use the data for the good of advancing homebirth. If they're not hiding anything, why are they keeping their data private and only releasing it to other proponents? This is extremely suspicious, to say the least.

But there's a reason why the Europeans are on top today. You may not like what reality looks like. But it is probably so. Besides you will also find me believing that non-Europeans really are less clever than Europeans (because the Europeans innovated, traded, killed, ensured the survival of the fittest. Ok, maybe the East Asians are included too). So I am not calling the Europeans names blindly. Just observing natural history.

At 23 years old, barely older than I am now, my granddad was a fighter pilot in WWII, which means he would accompany the bombers on their missions to fight off enemy forces trying to attack the bomber.  He piloted a [P-47 Thunderbolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_P-47_Thunderbolt), and was stationed out of England as part of the 61st squadron of the 56th Fighter Group.  In fact, the portrait on that wikipedia page is of Col. ""Gabby"" Gabreski, my grandfather's commander at their base.  My grandfather flew regular missions to Germany assisting bombers until his engine stalled on the way home from Germany and he was forced to bail out over the village of [Mariakerke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariakerke) in Belgium on November 30, 1943.  He quit his plane a short ~500 feet from the ground, hit the ground, and ran - by that time, Belgium was already occupied.  

He encountered two young men, who offered to help him, but with a pointed head-shake from a passerby, realized they were going to turn him over to the local Nazi authorities.  He followed the girl who tipped him off, and she fed him before sewing him up in a potato sack and leaving him underground in her potato cellar for an entire day while the Nazi forces searched for the Allied pilot whose plane they found.  After a day of hiding, the girl found someone who could speak English, and my grandfather was turned over to the men and (mostly) women of the Belgian underground resistance in Brussels.  

For 7 months he was shuffled from safe house to safe house - fed, watered, and cared for by complete strangers who risked their own lives because the people they were helping were the people trying to free their country.  After 7 months in hiding, he and another American pilot were discovered at their safe house in Brussels by the Gestapo, who had been on their tails for a while.  

He was then incarcerated in the [prison de Saint-Gilles](http://www.brusselspictures.com/2009/06/16/prison-de-saint-gilles/), where he spent an entire month straight in solitary confinement (the ""dark cell""), until Brussels was liberated by Allied forces.  In the midst of the chaos, he, along with the other allied airmen and political prisoners were herded onto the [Nazi Ghost Train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Ghost_Train), which was intended to ship them all to a concentration camp in Germany.  The Comet Line mentioned in that article is the same resistance group that helped hide my grandfather for so long.  After days of stop-and-go on the train, they finally escaped and went the very short distance back to Brussels. 

Shortly after the end of the war, my grandfather came home to Texas, where he met my grandmother at the Ty air base, and the rest is history... 

**Edit::**  It might also be worth mentioning that my father and grandfather had the fortune to return to Belgium and excavate his P-47 from where it had been buried in a farmer's backyard for nearly 60 years.  There are a few pictures [here](http://users.telenet.be/airwareurope/en/bergingen/thunderbolt_grosvenor_e.htm) and here's an [entire article about it](http://www.texnews.com/1998/2001/local/hero0729.html) from his hometown.  My father brought home a few trinkets including my grandfather's ripcord from his parachute, which a local woman had found and used as a circular knitting needle for 50 years.  They couldn't bring home the engine or the machine guns (obviously), which now reside the Belgian National Aviation Museum.  They also visited Saint-Gilles prison; my grandfather said that walking through the front doors a second time was one of the hardest things he had ever done.  My father conducted *extensive* research to build a complete timeline of my grandfather's experience, in the process finding many records and documents that many believed had been lost to time.  He also interviewed many members of the Belgian Resistance, some of whom had never really told their story to anyone before.  Then he made the whole story into a full-length documentary [(trailer)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gGplLk-0mI).

Just as professors with degrees in Mathematics are qualified to discuss matters in the parallel field of Theoretical Physics, so too can scientists discuss findings in other parallel fields. I really don't understand where you are getting your skewed view about credentials. Under your view, only a someone with a ""genetics"" degree would be qualified to study DNA, not a biochemist (and as it so happens, you have to be a biochemist before you can even specialize in genetics). A person with a Bachelors in Computer Science can become an expert (and a Doctor!) in Computer Engineering, a person with a degree in Math can become an expert Physicist, and a person with a degrees in Harvard B.A. Science, physiology, and biophysics can develop specializations in geography, evolutionary biology, and ornithology (all subsidized by his physiology degree and numerous expeditions to the Pacific southeast).

There's not really any extra debate over his ideas than there are over competing ideas. The only things which ring controversial are the ideas of natural selection on the tribal level (it's more complicated than his presentation of it), and the European-specific environmental determinism present in G,G&amp;S and Collapse. Environmental determinism (or, when that term is shirked, ""environmental influence"") as a general evolutionary factor is still well-received. 

""But if you've read much scientific literature beyond pop-sci like those books then you realize that some of his ideas are a slightly unconventional (and perhaps even a little ethnocentric) and don't exactly line up with the beliefs of most reputable anthropologists""

Ethnocentric? No shit. Guns, Germs, and Steel is about answering an old New Guinean man's question about why Caucasians came to dominate the world.

Diamond does write popular science books. But there are some issues with the accuracy of labeling him as a ""pop sci author"". He's the Carl Sagan of evolutionary biology because he dumbs down his work and presents it to the masses, as opposed to most Popular Science authors who are dumb people who take smarter ideas and then present the misinterpreted information to the masses. He's not perfect, but The Third Chimpanzee is perhaps one of the books he is most qualified to write, considering his doctorate in Physiology. The positions presented therein have been corroborated by genetic evidence and hominid fossils found in Southern Europe and Africa, backing up his taxonomic assertion that we are essentially a third species of Chimpanzee. His points about sex are well researched and have been corroborated. His assertions about the recent (100 kya to modern day) evolution of our species are also corroborated by the fossil record.

While I can relate to some of your points, I have found out that once you get under the skin (i.e. actually live with people and not just vacate with them 2 weeks and meet them when you order a drink or buy cigarettes) of most nationalities, they have some inherent flaw which will get on your nerves eventually.

I won't comment on each individual point (such as the ""making friends"" thingie ;) ), but I just want to point out that every nationality is different and the Polish people certainly also have their issues (deduced from your comment history, I assume that you are probably Polish and let's just say I've had my share of Polish influence during my life).

I left Denmark myself ten years ago and I lived all around Europe (started out in Spain and worked myself north). I found myself being very happy and feeling very much at home in Germany (in the Ruhrgebiet of all places, but I loved the life there and the people) at some point and I stayed there for 4 years, but in the end I went back to Denmark for various personal reasons.

The Danes are at the same time somehow very proud and yet very ashamed of that Jantelov you mention somewhere in your posts, as if it is something of a Danish trademark, but in fact the very same thing exists everywhere in my experience - it's human nature. Elsewhere they just haven't got a name for it - at least that's my experience. And even in the places where it appears not to exist, it turns out that people are just being shallow and  talking shit behind your back instead of talking shit directly to you.

I'll probably hit the road again myself at some point and settle down in Germany within a couple of years if everything goes as planned. 

Just my two cents.. Wish you luck in Portugal.

BTW.. Never really ""lived"" in Copenhagen - I only worked there. I lived in ""rural"" Denmark, if there is such a thing, and I always found people to be very caring and helpful. The language thing is a universal thing and no matter where you are, you will never truly be accepted in a circle of people until you speak their language.

c0vv7hx,t1_c0vv7hx,0,1,0,False,True,Schmeelkster,1,"The problem is that you speak of a ""THEY"" and the ""WEST"" under what seems to be the assumption that there is a cabal of evil little bankers who for the past several hundred years have been determining the political makeup of the planet, something I have a rather difficult time believing.  Then you add in the idea that the United States has been setting this all up, or that this cabal has decided to use the mechanism of the United States to control the planet.  

I see a history that in no way guaranteed the collapse of the Soviet Union, in large part because the Soviets were plagued with mismanagement, micromanaging leaders, corruption, and simple incompetence.  The infrastructure was neglected and the focus ever since the Second World War remained on heavy weapons and military development, to the detriment of consumer products like food and clothing.  But there is no guarantee that it had to happen in that fashion, and I find it highly unlikely that someone could have controlled the low level incompetence and mismanagement in many areas.  The collapse of the Soviet Union is like the assassination of Julius Caesar - it happened, but there is no reason why it HAD to happen.

The situation of dependence on Western bankers only developed in the last quarter of the history of the Soviet Union, and the idea that the writings of Marx have much of anything to do with the Soviet Union beyond forming the first inspiration for Vladimir Lenin is laughable.  In the same way that saying intent and beliefs of the Founding Fathers have been the driving force for the actions of the United States for the past two centuries is laughable.  Frankly, Lenin took the concepts of communism and adapted them into a rough working sketch that significantly changed the basic tenants of of the ideology, adding vast swaths of ideas and positions.  

And, yes, the US has a vested economic and political interest in being militarily predominant in the world.  The US benefits in many ways from providing the ""Pax Americana"" for the planet.  Part and parcel of this is the intelligence networks the US uses quite extensively.  The United States is very aware of the comings and goings of the planet, and has its ears everywhere it can.  However, it doesn't always get involved, and avoids it if it can, because of the cost (politically and monetarily) of such action.  If you observe the greater south east Pacific region, you will notice that the US largely defers to Australia when acting in the region.  Fiji is a wonderful example of this.  The US would rather have its allies police their surrounding part of the world than do it itself.   

Thus the vice-president of the US knowing at any point in time about the strategic economic locations of a country we have a longstanding conflict with is not unusual.  Quite the contrary, I would be surprised if the US was not aware at all times of the location and activity around the driving force behind Saddam Hussein's economy.  You do remember the US was flying air patrols in an effort to protect the Kurds to the north and that there was already scandal brewing around the corrupt ""Oil for Food"" programme, right?  One of the ways in which the US was trying to keep Saddam in check was to threaten his oil fields.

And do you really believe that there have been more battles and coup d'etats than anyone can remember?  Have you ever looked at the political history of even one European crown during the medieval period?  How about the military history of the subcontinent of India (which includes Pakistan, Bangladesh, and all the surrounding princedoms and countries)?  A single decade of history in Europe or the subcontinent has more wars than the entire past century of the planet.  Frankly, this past century had been the most peaceful century in human history, and politically one of the most stable, which has led to development and scientific advancement on an unprecedented scale.  The result of this is the population explosion, from a world population of less than a billion to nearly 6.5 billion.  The fact that Europe has fought only two internal wars since the Second World War is unbelievable (The only conflicts I can think of that would count as wars - i.e. at least some sustained combat, as opposed to simple repression of the populace - are the collapse of Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflicts and the recent war between Georgia and Russia). 

Now, before I finish, I would like to place the disclaimer that, yes, the United States has pursued imperialist policies in the past (Teddy Roosevelt especially) and there are certainly imperialists today.  This is a fact of life with a superpower.  Superpowers tend to be imperialistic.  However, this century's imperialism has almost nothing to do with imperialism in the past.  Frankly, they look nothing alike and have rather different objectives.  Modern imperialism focuses on projection of power and world stability to provide for the expansion of capitalist economies and somewhat democratic systems (which rarely fight wars with one another).  This is so that the more mature economies can benefit from the opening of new markets.  Old imperialism sought to add territory from which to extract resources and set up mercantilism as the primary means of economic exploitation.  

Finally, you say this:
&gt;Money, resources and control.  All **they** care about.  It's the reason the world is the way it is.
(emphasis mine)

I sincerely wish the world was that simple.  I really do.  That would significantly ease the burden of trying to understand what occurs in the world.  But, unfortunately, the world is not like that.  There is no ""they"".  There is no monolithic ruler, government, hemisphere of the planet.  Often people talk about ""the government"" or ""the west"" or ""the US"".  But these are misnomers, unfortunate conventions of language.  None of these things are monolithic or singular, but made up of enormous numbers of people, all with conflicting emotions and beliefs and ideas and understandings.  And the net result of the organized chaos of each government, and the interactions of each government, is the world as we know it.  It is insanely complex, with far more reasons for things than simply money, resources, and control.  The actions of individuals can be based on any number of reasons, and they are often attributable to more than one reason.  And there is no master control room, or single driving consciousness behind everything.  If there was, the world would be so much easier to stand.  But there isn't.  Sorry.

You may believe whatever it is you want, but let's hear it from the horse's mouth himself. Pay also particular attention to Naomi Klein's remark to Greenspan, that waging wars over resources is illegal due to international law and how Greenspan stumbles over that. He knows it was the Fed that provided the loans for the war and thereby financed the war. Hence the US has a 11 trillion dollar debt today to the privately owned Federal Reserve.
Here's the interview with the man himself:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHNWBysOq7I#t=3m40s

&gt;And do you really believe that there have been more battles and coup d'etats than anyone can remember? Have you ever looked at the political history of even one European crown during the medieval period?

I was referring to the wars and battles waged by the US in the last 100 years or so, those are more than most people can recite _by heart_. You can look up the long list on Wikipedia or Google if you wish. Like you say, the European theater has seen far more wars, if not the most, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the US has been waging a lot of wars, battles and coupes and many of those for unethical and illegal reasons.

&gt;I sincerely wish the world was that simple. I really do. That would significantly ease the burden of trying to understand what occurs in the world. But, unfortunately, the world is not like that. There is no ""they"". There is no monolithic ruler, government, hemisphere of the planet. Often people talk about ""the government"" or ""the west"" or ""the US"". But these are misnomers, unfortunate conventions of language. None of these things are monolithic or singular, but made up of enormous numbers of people, all with conflicting emotions and beliefs and ideas and understandings. And the net result of the organized chaos of each government, and the interactions of each government, is the world as we know it.

It's often the other way around. The world is simpler than you think. Whether it applies or not the current state of the world, the principle of Occam's razor has more truth to it than many are willing to admit.

c0vvlbh,t1_c0vvlbh,0,7,0,False,True,darklooshkin,7,"Palestine is one of those weird little political deadlocks that crop up every so often: it's a massive n-way prisoner's dilemma with two directly discernable outcomes: 


The first outcome is positive to Palestine (restoration of the 1967 borders), but weakens the Israeli's position whilst increasing that of Hamas, Hezbollah and, ultimately, middle eastern terrorism by establishing a rallying point for terrorists a stone's throw away from Europe, the UAE, Kuwait and (perhaps most important of all) the Red Sea. The damage a fully re-enfranchised Palestine with a group of terrorist mercenaries controlling large swathes of an army/militia could do to goods shipping in the middle east is unthinkable. Think Somali pirates with better weapons, logistics, training and funding, with direct access to two of the world's busiest shipping lanes (don't forget the mediterranean).


The second outcome (take-over of Palestine by Israel) is even worse: massive influx of terrorists going into uncontrolled Palestinian borders, waves of refugees and undercover terrorists roaming the middle east and North Africa. This does not even cover a certain war between Hezbollah and Israel, nor the possibility of a replay of Yom Kippur, with nukes deployed by both sides.


Neither outcome is positive for anyone: it destabilises global oil supplies to the point of penury (remember the oil crises?), involves thousands, possibly even millions of casualties and could ignite a world war for control of an unstable region gone off the deep end through either religious or military violence.


The palestinians face total extermination either way: in the first outcome, the palestinians are subjugated by foreign terrorist organisations and get used as cannon fodder in case of invasion. Bombing civilian groups likely to contain terrorist cells is a last-ditch solution in modern conflicts, but whoever invades Palestine will be trying to have as large a demographic impact as possible to make military occupation feasible. This means that, in the case of Palestine, saturation bombing of ""terrorist cells in civilian areas"" makes sense as you are guaranteed to hit a terrorist, even if you kill a thousand civilians as a result, which ""justifies"" the use of this tactic as the method of choice for rooting out opposition.


In the second outcome, they starve in desert refugee camps or get caught in the ensuing wars and atomic weapons discharges. The outcome is the same either way for them: misery, followed by death.


What we are seeing here is a situation that cannot be defused politically: lose Israel, and one of the western world's pet countries is no more, there is a massive influx of zionist refugees into previously moderate jewish communities around the world (guess what happens when middle eastern extremists encounter western-style secularism? Oh wait, you know already) and the certainty of a lengthy and damaging period of instability in the middle east due to strengthened terrorist attacks.


Lose Palestine, and you get a war that makes '80s Lebanon and '90s-noughties Yugoslavia look like an ""it's a small world"" disney ride full of fun and compassion, even before they break out Nukes.


So, until zionism and jihadism acquire renaissance-era rationality and logic, Palestine is stuck in a massive negative-sum game. Neither side can move, lest everybody lose. The Israelis are cheerfully pounding away at the Palestinians, who are happy to blow up infidel teenagers at the drop of the hat, whilst everybody watches everybody else to stop any idea of intervening in this conflict (and nuking the middle east in the process) before it reaches the mouths of local leaders and ruins the game for the rest of the world.

Of course, each of those countries mentioned above has an ""art house"" circuit that will mostly show smaller movies, but I assume that the USA has that too.

I am not an economist or a business strategist, but my guess is that one of the reasons why the Hollywood system works, is because they mostly invest in relatively safe movies (few big name actors, lil' action for the guys, lil' romantic interest for the ladies, etc.), and they will promote the hell out of them so that even if they aren't very good, they will still make lots of money.

c0vvtym,t1_c0vvtym,0,1,0,False,True,blackstar9000,1,"The author's entire argument seems to hinge on the premise at the end of this paragraph:

&gt; And yet the burqa must be banned. All forms of veiling must be, if not banned, strongly discouraged and stigmatized. The arguments against a ban are coherent and principled. They are also shallow and insufficient. They fail to take something crucial into account, and that thing is this: If Europe does not stand up now against veiling — and the conception of women and their place in society that it represents — within a generation there will be many cities in Europe where no unveiled woman will walk comfortably or safely. 

But I don't see any evidential reason to suppose that such a slippery slope exists, and Berlinski makes her argument by doing exactly what she accuses Martha Nussbaum of doing -- ignoring the historical context.  I'm morally certain that there are ""already many neighborhoods in Europe where scantily dressed women are not safe""; realistically, there's probably not a country in the world that doesn't have neighborhoods of that sort.

But how they got to be that way is a matter of some import, because it tells us a great deal about the likelihood of the danger spreading.  Turkey has, for centuries, been subject to recurring cultural tensions that are the inevitable result of its location at the geographical convergence of Europe, Asia and Africa.  As such, anxiety over which cultural and political allegiances it will, at any given time, adopt forms a constant pressure on the development of social, political and cultural responses.

Those pressures don't obtain in most European countries to anywhere near the pitch of intensity that you'd find them in Turkey, so I think it's unlikely that we'll see them spread beyond the neighborhoods Berlinski has in mind.  And if they're still alarmingly intense there, it is, I would suggest, precisely because Europeans have been inclined to treat those areas as ghettos in the original sense of the term -- contained areas officially or informally set aside for marginalizing some undesired element of society.  Addressing the ghetto-ization of Europe's minorities will likely alleviate that issue a great deal.

That isn't to say that there won't still be hold-out enclaves, but Berlinski has, as far as I'm concerned, already addressed that general issue when she writes:

Yes, except your entire post is one long pseudo-equalist fallacy that presumes an equivalent starting point for each claim of inherent superiority and also focuses on individual statements rather than social conditions and ideology.

Put more simply, the claims of racial superiority by some black people did not lead to the following things for any whites they antagonised:

* Being at the wrong end of segregation, de jure or de facto.
* Being assumed to be a criminal, rapist, or other social undesirable.
* En masse lynching.
* Not having the privilege of being seen as normal.
* Slavery. A minor detail, but, you know it counts.
* Vastly underrepresented in the halls of power and positions of authority.
* Culturally stereotyped into a very narrow set of roles.

In many ways the vapid liberalism you express here is exactly what Steinem, whatever you think of the *rest* of the article, was pointing out. Using liberal values (like being anti hate-speech) to support, say, racist and sexist ideologies (such as the fact that one cannot name white people as the beneficiaries of racism in the West).

You then say 'some white people' and 'some black people' as if they are perfectly equivalent in their power in society, which indeed goes right to the point.

Secondly, if you do not believe that we are still living with the after effects of centuries of colonialism wherein the idea that white was right was *openly* and aggressively promoted, you haven't looked very closely or carefully at either the beauty culture in the global North or at cultural conditions right around the world, where adherence to European culture is viewed as modernity and civilisation, and possession of physical characteristics that approximate white ones is seen as desirable. That internalised racism has a very long history that hasn't ended yet.

It is not about conspiracies or a ""white consensus."" If you yourself do not participate in the cultural reinforcement of white supremacy, good on you. The article was not talking about you. But the fact that you unironically call this ""hate-speech"" when I cannot find a single white cis man who has been discriminated against because of its ideas (nevermind white people or cis men as a group) being systematically disadvantaged, ghettoised, disempowered, underrepresented, or historically discriminated against and disenfranchised, leads me to wonder how seriously you considered any of the issues surrounding racism in our world.",0,,1280866210,False,t3_cwui4,t1_c0vv0ze,t5_2r2jt,,1426407010,TwoXChromosomes,

The team has edged closer to the playoffs every year, but some tragic collapse at the end of the season sees them out. End nutshell.

Last season they allowed the most goals in the final 10 mins of the game by a ridiculous margin (it was a stat on our local channel, I can't get you a source for that but I'm sure I can be backed up by anecdotes).  This season has been a bit of a different story, the team has gotten a lot better defensively, especially with our goalie Stephan Frei playing out of his mind.  However, scoring has been an issue (and has always been since our beginnings).


To try and combat this, they signed hometown hero Dwayne de Rosario in 2008. He is our top scorer and captain, and other than Frei, is our best player.


Another big addition occured late last season. The team added Julian de Guzman, another homegrown player who spent all of his professional career in Europe. In typical Toronto fashion, he was hyped up to be the saviour of the team etc., when he is more of a defensive midfielder anyways.  Therefore, there is no unified opinion on him. 


In terms of heros, we have **Danny Dichio**, who scored our first goal (and held the most goals for the club until de Rosario broke that record) and **Jim Brennan**, a decorated Canadian defender. Both players are assistant coaches with the club. 


Our biggest rivalry right now is a fairly artificial one with Columbus. In all other Toronto sports (hockey, football, baseball and basketball) there are serious rivalries. Hockey with Montreal (important to this), Ottawa, Buffalo and there used to be one with Detroit. Football is with Hamilton, baseball with the Yankees and Red Sox, and basketball with anyone Vince Carter plays for. Now, with the exception of baseball and basketball, the other 2 (arguably bigger) sports have these rivalries that have been around for ages. All the cities mentioned are within driving distance, and although Montreal is about 8 hours away, there are a lot of people from Toronto there as well. Columbus comes into this because they are close... and we didn't really have a rivalry so that one was kind of fabricated to just get something going I guess.


Anyways, Montreal was awarded a team for 2012 and that will be a huge rivalry. Toronto Montreal is a rivalry that is usually bigger than sports. They are the 2 biggest cities in Canada, and there is also the Ontario vs. Quebec, English vs. French angle etc. Regardless, it will be pretty crazy.

This also was your comment. Please define ""common street criminal"" because I assume that means rapists, robbers, car thieves and burglars, not murderers. Murderers are less common criminals and typically are known to their victims. The former are not.

I actually chose England as an example because it seems the English are always so quick to call out the U.S. on guns.

I also posted about Australia and Canada because they too like to point fingers at the U.S.

Homicide is not the only crime out there that guns are used for and they are not the only weapon criminals use.

But hey, if you want to nitpick...

How about Germany who has some of the most stringent gun laws in Europe?

*Licenses are required to buy or own a firearm, and to get a license a German must prove his or her ""need"" and pass a government test. Different licenses are required for hunters, recreational shooters, and collectors. It is illegal to have a gun ready for defensive use in your own home. Before being allowed to have a firearm for protection, a German must again prove ""need.""*

The annual number of firearm-related murders in Germany rose 76% between 1992-1995.

Of course I would agree that the homicide rate in the U.S. is higher than many of your beloved European nations but you have to remember that statistics for many of them do not include *attempted murder*. I am not using that as an excuse, just making mention of it. I'm sure even if they did include *attempted murder* like the U.S. does that the U.S. would still have a higher rate.

I understand that the U.S. is on par with many Eastern European countries when it comes to homicide.

At current here are the [latest statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) on homicide.

So it looks like the saying *""Guns don't kill people, people kill people""* actually holds true (and I can't stand that saying) especially in Canada where [stabbings account for one-third of all killings](http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/85-002-XIE/0060585-002-XIE.pdf)

I don't know why you took such offense to my comment and citations. I was just trying to show that the stereotype of everyone in the U.S. carrying guns and killing each other is wrong and that crime happens all over the world.

Okay he ""supported them.""  Who cares?  What did he *do* that made a difference, in regards to the resistance in these countries or anywhere else?  Millions of people supported the resistance in Axis-occupied nations but you don't see all of these people getting a historical blowjob the way Churchill does. And again, this isn't something unique to Churchill.  Moral and material support was provided in the West by the US as well and in the East by the USSR on a much larger scale and to a much greater effect.  Again, what is unique about Churchill here that makes him such a great man?

&gt;As I say, bad bits and good bits. Show me a hero, I'll show you someone who acted well sometimes and other times wanked over pictures of his niece...

I don't expect all great men to be perfectly virtuous, I just expect them to do something great to earn such a title.  I see no evidence that Churchill ever did so.",0,,1280867315,False,t3_cwx37,t1_c0vvupo,t5_2qh2p,,1426407034,atheism,

There came a time when we had a test that I knew I was completely unprepared for.  I tried to fake my way through the first question, realized that there was no way I was ever going to even be able to begin to work out how to do any of the questions on the test, and so inspiration struck instead.

I think there were maybe 10 questions on the test.  For each question, I decided to answer a hypothetical question from each of my other subjects.  I explained in detail the Nitrogen cycle from Biology.  I wrote a history essay on Napoleonic Europe.  I wrote an essay in French all about going to a diner with friends in Quebec.  I did a detailed architectural drawing for Industrial Design, etc. etc.

 When it came time for the tests to be handed back, everyone else by that point knew what I'd done and there was this stifled giggling while we waited to see what my score was.  I didn't get my test back.  Figuring that I was totally screwed and going to fail out of the class anyway, I just continued to sleep my way through the rest of the semester.

At the end of the year, I asked my Math teacher to sign my yearbook.  To my surprise, his message to me was ""I've almost completed grading your test.  While I would much rather see math, it's very clear to me that you're extremely bright and very talented and I hope you do well in life.""  He gave me a D for the year and let me pass out of the class.  One of the coolest moments I had in all of high school.",0,,1280867598,False,t3_cwpmt,t3_cwpmt,t5_2qh1i,,1426407041,AskReddit,

It's not really famous, it doesn't make the headlines, but one looks at what the artistic movement around the Laibach/NSK industrial music achieved even back in the Commie era, it seems to signalize the existence of a really creative underground culture. Plus there is quality everywhere - once I went on a skiing trip to Krajnska Gora, and had better pizza there than in Italy, and some absolutely extraordinary beer called Union which really should be exported.

Having said that I don't like Zizek - he is just hopelessly stuck in the thorougly left-wing explanation of the world and this is something truly getting old. I mean his interpretation of Kusturica movie The Underground was IMHO totally off the mark - I think The Underground was not the celebration of ethnic cleansing but about a much deeper topic which is a core part of the Eastern European existence which I as a Hungarian know well enough, namely, the dilemma between a natural wish to love one's country and between recognizing the fact the country as of now is simply not respectable because it is full of cheaters (Marko), violent idiots (Blackie/Czerny) and so, I think the movie revolves around this dilemma and Zizek totally missed it, didn't even catch a glimpse of it.

I think the hot new thing is to expand our consciousness towards ideas that were 50 years ago written off as outdated/reactionary/premodern/conservative/whatever but yet represent a very high level of intellectual standard, such as The New Science of Politics from Eric Voegelin or Ideas Have Consequences from Richard Weaver.

http://sh3p.ca/hnycq


[...] Why do I find Sarah Palin dangerous? [...] Palin has this week argued vociferously against the building of a mosque near the site of Ground Zero in lower Manhattan. She calls the idea of a mosque there a provocation. But it is her opposition to the building of a mosque that is provocative. The organization that hopes to build the mosque, the Cordoba Initiative, is a moderate Muslim group, striving for better relations between the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds. It is in the direct interest of American national security to strengthen those groups that argue against Islamism. Palin's opposition to the mosque -- and by extension, to the enfranchisement of moderate Muslims -- is a gift to Islamists, proof to their potential followers that America is as intolerant of Islam as Europe is, proof that it is America, not Islam, that wants to see our civilizations clash. We as a society should embrace those Muslims who want to live the American dream; their lives, as free, devout and proud Muslims in a diverse country, are a refutation of the radical notion that the West is forever aligned against the interests of Muslim believers. Opposing the building of mosques by anti-jihadist Muslim groups in this country is perhaps the best way to radicalize American Muslims not otherwise prone to radicalization.

It is true that this country is home to a non-insignificant number of already-radicalized Muslims. There's no point in denying that. But there's a war on -- a clash within a civilization -- and we can affect the outcome of this war by embracing those Muslims who are ready and willing to live in our multi-confessional country, while fighting those who violently oppose American values. Sarah Palin, from what I see so far, views Islam as a monolith, and because of this view, she argues for policies that could do severe damage to American national security. This is a complicated war we're in, and Sarah Palin is, by the evidence at hand, dangerously simple-minded.",0,,1280868838,False,t3_cwt1j,t3_cwt1j,t5_2cneq,,1426407068,politics,

The two major groups, Middle Eastern Jews and European Jews, were timed to have diverged from each other approximately 2500 years ago. Southern European populations show the greatest proximity to Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Italian Jews, reflecting the large-scale southern European conversion and admixture known to have occurred over 2,000 years ago during the formation of the European Jewry.

2500 years ago is roughly 500 B.C., innit?  I think going back to 500 years before *Christianity* even existed is a bit of a stretch, but that's cool if that's your stance.  However, if we have infinite years of history in which to work, then I have a few land claims I'd like to make myself...

&gt; you've merely distracted us with why you happen to think Christianity is cool. Nobody's interested in that right now.

Actually, that's what the OP asked, so while you may not be interested on that right now, the OP is.

&gt; to mention only a couple of possible inconsistencies:

&gt;  * God is the epitome of love, the perfectly moral and loving being. Yet Hell exists and there's the problem of evil

Hell does not exist. The problem of evil steems from the fact that He is perfectly moral. It reinforces the point, not contradict it.

&gt; * God is omniscient and omnipotent and created us all, yet we all have free will.

I don't see any consistency problems here.

&gt; We want to know why you think it's right. ""better"" and ""right"" are rather different concepts. You seem to be confusing the two.

Self-consistency.

&gt; Explain how that makes Christianity right but not Islam, say.

It is not my job to defend Islam, sorry. You should ask on /r/Islam instead.

&gt; Simply announcing that everything has to come from somewhere, except God is trying to exempt God from that first rule without any reason to do so, other than because it helps your case if you do.

Reason offered. God is a supernatural being, and not necessarily subjected to natural laws. Cause and Effect is a natural law. The reason relies on God's inherent supernaturality.

&gt; ""Islam  is already the fastest-growing religion in Europe. Driven by immigration and high birthrates, the number of Muslims on the continent has tripled in the last 30 years. Most demographers forecast a similar or even higher rate of growth in the coming decades.""

It might be shocking to you, but Europe is not the world. Show me that this trend is happening worldwide and I will accept the argument. Specially when there are no conversions happening, but the effects are being caused by immigration instead.

&gt; No impact at al? Really? Do you pay attention to world events?

Yes, focus on **world** events. Like, outside of Europe and USA.

&gt; You have failed to even address the question of why Christianity is right  and Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, Jainism etc. are not. 

It is not my job to defend or fight against them. It might be that they all are right, in the end.

&gt; I'm certainly not  the only person in this thread to point out that you haven't answered the question.

nig·ger
   /ˈnɪgər/ Show Spelled[nig-er]
—Usage note
The term nigger is now probably the most offensive word in English. Its degree of offensiveness has increased markedly in recent years, although it has been used in a derogatory manner since at least the Revolutionary War. Definitions 1a, 1b, and 2 represent meanings that are deeply disparaging and are used when the speaker deliberately wishes to cause great offense. Definition 1a, however, is sometimes used among African-Americans in a neutral or familiar way. Definition 3 is not normally considered disparaging—as in “The Irish are the niggers of Europe” from Roddy Doyle's The Commitments—but the other uses are considered contemptuous and hostile.

–noun
1.
Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive.
a.
a black person.
b.
a member of any dark-skinned people.
2.
Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive. a person of any race or origin regarded as contemptible, inferior, ignorant, etc.
3.
a victim of prejudice similar to that suffered by blacks; a person who is economically, politically, or socially disenfranchised.

They did not say that absolutely this will happen, just that an outfit in the US made a study and this was their conclusion.  They did use an adjective to describe the rise as something more than just 1%.  You may quibble with one man's explosion is another man's miniscule event.

He is asking for the reasons to why I believe. Those may not be enough for you, or may seem wrong to you, but they are still the reasons why I believe.

You're not understanding. Listen carefully. It is not that your reasons are merely unconvincing. It's that they actually do not answer the question. It's like somebody is asking ""Why do you think the sky is blue?"" and you're answering ""Because I like blue"". I'm telling you ""That doesn't answer the question of why you think it's blue"", only to be told ""Well I disagree. You may find my argument unconvincing, but that's just, like, your opinion, man"". Do you see why ""I like the blue"" is not an answer to the question ""Why is the sky blue?"" If you can see that, it doesn't require much mental processing to see why ""Christianity has this property that I like"" is not a reason to think that it's true. It does *not* answer the question, no matter how many times you want to simply state that it does.

There is a rather large piece of missing logic in between ""Christianity is the only religion that doesn't require you to prove yourself to join it."" and ""Therefore I think Christianity is true and other religions are not"". The latter does not directly follow from the former. Where's the missing logic? Where's the reasoning? Where's the explanation that answers the question? It's missing. You're just jumping straight from one to the other, which means that the question - which is looking for the explanation - is left unanswered.

&gt; I was not asked this. I was asked why I believe. While I am willing to dicuss my reasons with you, I was not asked for reasons that would make you believe.

And this suffers from the exact same problem as before. ""I like the colour blue, X, therefore the sky is blue"". Fill in X for us.

&gt; Actually, that's what the OP asked, so while you may not be interested on that right now, the OP is.

The OP asked ""Why is a belief in Yahweh and Jesus any more valid than a belief in Vishnu or Zeus"". ""Because Christianity is the only religion that doesn't require you to prove yourself to join it"" is not an answer to that question.

&gt; Hell does not exist. The problem of evil steems from the fact that He is perfectly moral. It reinforces the point, not contradict it.

The problem of evil is a problem. That's why it's called the *problem* of evil. This is not the place to discuss such things, but inconsistencies - and lots of them - do exist, and plenty of them, even within the Bible.

&gt; I don't see any consistency problems here.

Well I do, although I'll not derail the entire thread with it here. You can [start here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will_in_theology#The_paradox_of_free_will) and go follow the references for further reading. There's plenty of material about the subject - it's a vast debate.

&gt; It is not my job to defend Islam, sorry. You should ask on /r/Islam instead.

That reading comprehension kinda sucks, doesn't it? I didn't aks you to defend Islam. In fact I asked you to do the opposite. Read what I wrote again more carefully.

&gt; Reason offered. God is a supernatural being, and not necessarily subjected to natural laws. Cause and Effect is a natural law. The reason relies on God's inherent supernaturality.

That's just special pleading. The fact that you've given a name ""supernatural"" to the special pleading step doesn't fool anybody. ""Supernatural"" is a pretty meaningless concept, in fact. If you define it to simply mean anything outside of the universe, then there is no reason to assume that cause and effect ceases to exist outside of the universe in such a way that it is still required that the universe itself have a cause.

&gt; It might be shocking to you, but Europe is not the world. Show me that this trend is happening worldwide and I will accept the argument. Specially when there are no conversions happening, but the effects are being caused by immigration instead.

""*Islam is the world's fastest-growing religion. In 1990, 935 million people were Muslims and this figure had escalated to around 1.2 billion by 2000, meaning that around one in five people follow Islam. Although the religion began in Arabia, by 2002 80% of all believers in Islam lived outside the Arab world. In the period 1990-2000, approximately 12.5 million more people converted to Islam than to Christianity*"" -  **Guinness World Records 2003, pg 102**

That's a pretty big impact. Islam remains the fastest growing religion today. In comparison, Christianity is growing at a slower rate than population is increasing.

&gt; It is not my job to defend or fight against them. It might be that they all are right, in the end.

Ah, now we start getting closer to the question. You admit that they might all be right, in the end, so then why do you think Christianity is right but not any of the others right now?

You know, ""Allahuh Akbar!"" over and over.

There is nothing racist or irrational about opposing an ideology that promotes ignorance, irrationality, submission to make believe authority, and submission of the infidels etc. (Along with all the other absurdity.)

And to be clear, I'm no fan of Christianity or other religions either. But this bleeding heart liberal BS (and I'm a liberal myself) has got to stop. It's already wrecking Europe with their Sharia Courts and increasingly self segregated Muslim communities breeding a new generation of radicals etc.

And this isn't just some general mosque we're talking about. It's a giant media campaign for an extremely visible $100,000,000.00 13 story mega mosque pro-Islam center built so close to Ground Zero that the bodies of the victims of that very same ideology were sprayed over very ground where they now want to promote it.

A friend of mine in Sweden who is already dealing with the fallout of this uber-liberal idiocy had a few choice comments to make on Facebook about this issue:

&gt;This may sound a bit rough but, I hate what has become of most atheists and liberals. Most atheists and liberals seem to cling onto the UN declaration of human rights like it's flawless and claim superior moral clarity in a similar fashion that religious people do. They just want everyone to know how ""good and modern"" they are by accepting everything no matter how ridiculous it might be, such as genocidal mass murder cults which promote segregation, intolerance, misogyny and homophobia.
&gt;
&gt;I think being liberal is a great thing since it shows the path to renewal and continuous advancement, but there has to be boundaries even in liberalism. It's become a fad to try to be as liberal as possible and personally advertise yourself as the most ""good and liberal"" person in the world.
&gt;
&gt;Liberalism must be combined with a bit of common sense and boundaries. I consider myself fairly liberal, but you can't tolerate those who don't tolerate you and you can't accept those who don't accept you just because you ""want to be a better person than them,"" because frankly, that is just insane. It's the same thing as going to war and refraining from using your gun against an armed man who is firing his gun against you, simply because you want to be the better person.

&gt;Also, freedom of religion is the biggest piece of bullshit ever. Every freedom that religious organizations need is covered in the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. We can't keep giving people special privileges just because they've been brainwashed as children to believe in ghosts, magical men in the sky, angels, fairies or other ridiculous crap. There shouldn't be any special laws under any premise that give people benefits, unless they're directed towards people with physical and/or mental handicaps.

Frankly I couldn't agree more.

You very much can hold an ideology that is explicitly written out and preached in a way that breeds the most dangerous radicals in the world today. You very much can rationally stand up against that ideology and culture and religion coming here. These people make a choice to believe these things. They're not born Muslims, and even if they're brainwashed into it... that's still the fault of the ideology and just another reason to oppose its spread.

Like my friend said:
&gt;Liberalism must be combined with a bit of common sense and boundaries.

&gt;When competing hypotheses are equal in other respects, the principle recommends selection of the hypothesis **that introduces the fewest assumptions and postulates the fewest entities** while still sufficiently answering the question. It is in this sense that Occam's razor is usually understood. To quote Isaac Newton, ""We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, so far as possible, assign the same causes."" (Emphasis Mine)

Occam's Razor does not mean that the simplest explanations is the best, but that the explanation that assumes the least is the best.  In other words, your explanation, of a large (or small) cabal of humans who have the wherewithal to control the vast mechanisms of humanity through various means of economic and political manipulation, is significantly more complex and requires much more organization and infrastructure than mine, wherein approx. 6 billion humans live their lives (and some simply eat and grow old, while others grub around for power, or fame, or whatever).  Mine looks messy in the end, and yours looks simple, but the reality is in fact reversed.

As for the number of things most people can remember by heart - most people can't recite the first 7 digits of pi, most people can't recite the presidents of the US, or the States and Capitols, or the countries in the world.  The fact that people are ignorant does not mean that the US has fought a large number of wars.  Compared to any other world power at any other time, the US has fought vanishingly few wars, probably rivaled only by the Soviet Union, which was also a remarkably peaceful superpower.  The exhaustive [Wikipedia list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Wars) shows every historical involvement of US soldiers anywhere.  A more succinct list of the major wars the US has ever fought is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_U.S._participation_in_major_wars).  A comparable list from a single century of medieval Europe would take nearly a full day to read through.

Finally, Greenspan is trying to point out that the benefit of the war is that Saddam is not longer able to THREATEN the oil supply.  He never once says anything about attacking Iraq for its oil supply - only Naomi seems stuck on that subject.  His concern revolved around the fact that if Saddam had been able to acquire nuclear weapons, he could have cut off Saudi, Kuwaiti, Iranian, and UAE oil, removing about 1/5th the worlds oil supply.  Every country on the planet, from China to Britain to the US, would have been utterly stupid to allow such a thing to happen.  That was Greenspan's concern.  Unlike Naomi's concern, which seems to be about her fantasy complaint that the US invaded Iraq to secure its oil - we were already getting its oil from the Oil for Food programme.  The problem was that Saddam had already shown a willingness to attack his neighbors to secure others oil deposits, which would have threatened the world economy.  None of that requires a cabal of evil bankers, simply people who could see the potential outcomes.  Whether or not that particular case would have happened, as Greenspan feared, is debatable.

I would LOVE to see an end to all militaries, but human history keeps smacking me in the face.  Periods of relative calm and ignorance about ones enemies, punctuated by absolute disaster.  WW2 was not that long ago.  Just look at the Balkan war and Genocide in the 90’s.  This happened only seven years after hosting the Olympics in Sarajevo, and it occurred on the borders of Italy, Austria, and Greece, which are developed European countries.  Speaking of Greece, they are a heavily armed country and are still on very bad terms with Turkey, another heavily armed country.  The same could be said for South and North Korea, and the entire middle east.  Not to mention the amount of genocides still happening (Rwanda, Sudan, Congo, etc...).

Now, I am no way recommending an offensive interventionist policy and a giant military.  I am just saying the world is still in need of a good peacekeeper without a corporate agenda.  We also have to consider our own defence, sovereignty, and prevention of smuggling and poaching.  We have a very large resource rich country in world of dwindling resources and overpopulation.

Not to mention the amount of dumping of toxic and nuclear waste that would occur, and the poaching of fish and whales by foreign fishing fleets.

These things have to be maintained to be effective.  We can’t put together an effective military quickly.  Jets have to be ordered years in advance, pilots take years of training from other experienced pilots, Sergeants with decades of experience can’t be purchased, etc....

Sweden, often thought of as either a socialist utopia or nightmare, depending upon your perspective, actually has a robust private economy — indeed, almost all production is in the hands of privately held companies, just like in the United States.  Taxes are much higher than in our country — certainly on the wealthy — and are used to fund a far greater array of public goods and services.  But that is only a difference of degree, not kind, from the policies of every developed country from Canada to Australia, and including all of Western Europe.  Indeed, David Cameron, Angela Merkel, and even Mitt Romney might be said to be socialist by this standard because they support government augmented programs to provide universal health insurance.

c0vwnl9,t1_c0vwnl9,0,1,0,False,True,[deleted],1,"I can speak for Switzerland and Germany personally; I've been to both and I've shot in both countries.

In Switzerland, shooting is practically the national sport. It's not only a prized skill, but almost a *mandatory* one, due to their conscripted military. All men are required to perform military (or public, if they are found physically unfit) service, and many women volunteer as well. Every household with a conscripted or professional soldier maintains an assault rifle and a handgun in the home, and you have the option to buy your weapon at greatly reduced cost after your term of service.

Because of this, firearms are practically bred into the population. It's *extremely* gun-centric. That's not to say you'll see guys open-carrying handguns like you do in the States or anything. But it's a pretty safe bet that any given household (not individual) in Switzerland has a firearm in it.

Germany is definitely not as focused on it, but that's a relatively modern shift. Up until the Nazi Party took power, it was an extremely gun-oriented culture; again, almost every household had at least a rifle or a shotgun. Shortly before the Nazi Party took power, the government enacted mandatory gun registration. A few years later, when the Nazi Party took power, they inherited the gun lists, and one of their first actions was to start disarming the populace - Anyone outside of the Nazi Party (and some ""trusted allies"") found their permit requests and renewals denied. Firearms were actively seized from opposing party members, and eventually, legislation was enacted that specifically prevented Jews from owning guns. One day after *Kristallnacht*, the law was revised to prevent Jews from owning *any* weapons, even knives or clubs.

Because of these actions, and the blowback against the Nazi Party (the only people allowed to have firearms during their rule) after WWII, gun culture has shifted dramatically in Germany. They were every bit as gun-centric as the United States, Switzerland, etc up until that.

Both countries regularly hold *Schützenfests*, though, which are huge public shooting festivals. They're basically giant folk festivals with guns, beer, food, music, and dancing. Families bring their kids out, and you'll see 12 year old girls competing shoulder to shoulder with 32 year old military professionals firing military rifles. These are completely open events with not a trace of public contempt; they're just tradition. They might as well be the equivalent of a Fourth of July festival in the US.

So I guess it depends on how you define a ""gun culture."" None of the other countries have it embedded quite so deeply as Americans, but it's important to note the different events that lead in those directions. The Revolutionary War, the frontiersman of the West, and the Civil War are what cemented firearms so deeply into U.S. culture. These were necessary tools for survival in the United States for hundreds of years, far longer than the much older and more established European countries. It wasn't until Prohibition in the 1920's and the rise of gang warfare that there was any disproportionate level of gun violence when comparing the US to any European country. After Prohibition eased, it went down dramatically through the 1940's, 50's, and 60's. It didn't rise again until the emergence of urban gangs in the late 1970's, and reached near critical levels in the 1980's and early 90's as the gangs took over the drug trade.

No-one was saying that Guns caused high robbery rates to begin with. The OP asked if it made you safer not your property. So in my mind we are talking about violent crime and homicides. 

The country most similar in culture and socio-economically with the USA would be Canada which has lower homicide rate (and lower attempted homicide rates) and lower rates of violent crime and has stricter gun laws. Feel free to pose an argument against this as correlation does equal causation and certainly my opinion is not the be all and end all of any subject. 

By only referencing less relevant crime categories with regards to Canada that appear to support your point and not mentioning what in my opinion the more relevant ones it seems like you are being disingenuous. Thats just how I saw it. 

None of your claims refuted what I said btw. Just because someone stole a car does not suggest they had a gun. 

I do think a comparison with maybe parts of Europe would be difficult as there are many social and economic differences.

The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of January 1983, passed in the United States, with lobbying from the National Organization for Rare Disorders,[1] is meant to encourage pharmaceutical companies  to develop drugs for diseases that have a small market. Under the law, companies that develop such a drug (a drug for a disorder affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States) may sell it without competition for seven years,[2] and may get clinical trial tax incentives.[2] The European Union  (EU) has enacted similar legislation, REGULATION (EC) No 141/2000, in which pharmaceuticals developed to treat rare diseases are referred to as ""orphan medicinal products."" The EU's definition of an orphan condition is broader than that of the USA, in that it also covers some tropical diseases that are primarily found in developing nations.[3] The EU's legislation is administered by the Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency  (EMEA). In an effort to reduce the burden on manufacturers applying for orphan drug status, the FDA and EMEA agreed in late 2007 to utilize a common application process for both agencies. However, the two agencies will continue to maintain separate approval processes.[4] Orphan drug legislation also exists in Australia and Japan.[1]

Under the ODA and EU legislation, many orphan drugs have been developed, including drugs to treat glioma, multiple myeloma, cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, snake venom and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, a total of 1,129 different orphan drug designations have been granted by the Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) and 249 orphan drugs have received marketing authorization. In contrast, the decade prior to 1983 saw fewer than ten such products come to market. Nevertheless, some critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase (claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders that were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation), and whether the ODA has really stimulated the production of truly non-profitable drugs; the act also received some criticism for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit off of drugs that have a small market but still sell for a high price.[2]

Television historian and Allmovie contributor Hal Erickson credits two episodes of the television series Quincy, M.E. for helping the ODA pass in the USA: ""Seldom Silent, Never Heard"" (1981) and ""Give Me Your Weak"" (1982).[5][6] The show's star, Jack Klugman, even testified before Congress concerning the orphan drug issue.[7][8]",0,,1280889231,False,t3_cx2vl,t3_cx2vl,t5_2cneq,,1426407458,politics,

This is not unusual or unexpected - if you force a certain group to the ghetto, they will eventually outnumber natives in that ghetto. This is certainly not the situation in the vast majority of German schools, since statistically Germans far outnumber Turks.

They are choosing to focus only on a school where Turks outnumber Germans, and trying to create the impression that this is what German schools are like. That's just propaganda.

As for the school itself, the kids seemed well-behaved, both German and Turks. They say that the groups tend to stay in separate cliques. This is understandable as well. If you want integration, you need to welcome the foreigners, not hate them and barely tolerate them. Anti-Turkish sentiment remains very high in Germany. Most kids are sensitive - if they don't feel wanted, they keep to themselves. 

Germany is a pretty damn racist society, not just today but historically so. They have never learned how to integrate, like the US or England or Canada did. This is mostly why they have a problem with the Turks.

For the record, these are not burka-wearing fundies they are showing. These are Turkish kids dressed pretty much exactly like the Germans, with the exception that a few girls (a VERY few girls) wear scarves. Of all Muslims, Turks ought to have the least problems, since they are about the only Muslim dominant country with a secular government and constitution, and most Turks are brought up pretty secular. Specially those Turks who emigrated to European countries, and have been exposed to European culture for a while.

All I can say is that if they can't fit in the Turks (or some Lebanese, who are also among the least fundie Muslims around) into their society, they are going to scream bloody murder if they ever have to work with more fundamentalist Muslims from some other Arab countries.

The fact is that the Germans have no clue about integration, and their parochial, German-superiority, insular ways make it next to impossible. They should just import workers from Eastern European countries to take care of their population problem. The trouble is, Eastern European countries also have population problems of their own.

Copy Pasta from Wiki:

&gt;Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide. &gt;[8][19][20] Large-scale American and European studies have found &gt;that mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 22.5–25 kg/m2[21] in &gt;non-smokers and at 24–27 kg/m2 in current smokers, with risk &gt;increasing along with changes in either direction.[22][23] A BMI &gt;above 32 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among &gt;women over a 16-year period.[24] In the United States obesity is &gt;estimated to cause an excess 111,909 to 365,000 death per &gt;year,  &gt; [2][20] while 1 million (7.7%) of deaths in the European Union are &gt;attributed to excess weight.[25][26] On average, obesity reduces life &gt;expectancy by six to seven years:[2][27] a BMI of 30–35 reduces life &gt;expectancy by two to four years,[21] while severe obesity (BMI &gt; &gt;40) reduces life expectancy by 10 years.[21]

Lastly, the issue with not staying that way is because after people lose the weight they don't stick to their new found diet.

&gt;The main treatment for obesity consists of dieting and physical &gt;exercise.[62] Diet programs may produce weight loss over the short &gt;term,[123]  but keeping this weight off can be a problem and often &gt;requires making exercise and a lower calorie diet a permanent part of &gt;a person's lifestyle.[124][125]

If you post a link with citations that says that obese people eat less than thin people on average, or in any statistically significant numbers I will change my original post.

Until then you are just arguing against obvious truths. Fat people are fat because they eat too much. They die early because being fat is not healthy.

Wiki on calorie restriction:

A small study of long-term CR practitioners in the US at the Washington University School of Medicine  in St. Louis studied the effects following a calorie-restricted diet of 10-25% less calorie intake than the average Western diet, which is over caloric. Body mass index  (BMI) was significantly lower in the calorie-restricted group when compared with the matched group; 19.6 compared with 25.9. The BMI values for the comparison group are similar to the mean BMI values for middle-aged people in the US.[5]

All those on calorie-restricted diets experienced reductions in BMI after starting their diet. Their BMIs decreased from an average of 24 (range of 19.4 to 29.6) to an average of 19.5 (range of 16.5 to 22.8) over the course of their dieting (3–15 years). Nearly all the decrease in BMI occurred in the first year of dieting. It was found that the average total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels for calorie-restricted individuals were the equivalent of those found in the lowest 10% of normal people in their age group. It was found that the average HDL (good) cholesterol levels for calorie-restricted individuals were very high—in the 85th to 90th percentile range for normal middle-aged US men. These positive changes in calorie-restricted individuals were found to occur mainly in the first year of dieting.[5]",0,,1280899028,False,t3_cvp0e,t1_c0vx573,t5_2qh1i,,1426407637,AskReddit,

It is as safe as a hospital birth and regular studies comparing the two kinds of birthing places are conducted. There are measures in place to ensure the quality of care given and that midwives are on top of things.

PhD students are paid like enough to just about eat and stuff, I don't know if you have enough time to have many hobbies/interests but I doubt they could afford them on such miserly stipends in any case.

Post-doc salaries are abysmal in the US, and still pretty poor in the UK. They are much better in the EU (the UK doesn't pay the same as the EU because we opt out of lots of their policies - yay Thatcherism) but then it is mainly the  small number of post-doc places versus PhD students and the short-term nature of the employment that makes it difficult to have job security.

I think it shows how out of touch the politicians are when you see Willets say that Space and Dinosaurs will enthuse Children with the scientific spirit and get the UK more scientists. But it doesn't matter what reasons we give children to choose to go into science if we give adults even greater reasons to leave.

It evolved out of an older Latin, and it continued evolving into the AD. The Latin of the 1st century BC was preserved as a snapshot in time because it became the standard dialect/language of official imperial documentation and sign making.

Classical Latin was hard, staccato, and militaristic; the V's were w-sounding, the C's were always k-sounding and never ""ch"" or ""s"" sounding.  There were no dip-thongs like ""au"", ""oi"", or ""eu""; all letters were pronounced distinctly and separately.  Even in a word like ""illa"", the two ""Ls"" were not run together, the correct pronunciation is ""Il-la"".  It's subtle, but it's there.

But Latin evolved, and as is the tendency of most evolving languages, it became softer and more pleasing to the ear.  Around the time of Constantine and the subsequent centuries that witnessed the fall of Rome and the flourishing of Christianity, I'm sure that the C's became soft and the V's started to sound like V's.  ""Ae"" started to be pronounced like a long A instead of a long I, ""ay"" instead of ""I"".

That's where the liturgical tradition comes from.  It's likely that the Catholic Church has preserved a dialect of Latin that probably belonged to educated Italian monks and scholars from around the 5th century AD.

Sure, here's a [ZDNet link from back in 2007](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/it-strategy/2007/01/15/european-commission-report-endorses-open-source-39285468/). The [EU report mentioned](http://www.flossimpact.eu/) however focuses mainly of total cost of ownership of open source and not so much the openness aspect.

Let me illustrate that particular point with the case of the Dutch ministry of finance. No way they would put all their privacy-sensitive information on external servers - this is enough for them to not go for GMail flat out. They are also required by law to keep records of all their transactions for a given length of time so they need good back-up tools. As for vendor lock-in, they want to be sure that should they decide to migrate to something else, they can 'get their data out'. Many organisations have been burnt in the past by vendors charging ridiculous amounts of money to migrate their data in an effort to keep the account, or by vendors simply keeling over and leaving them with an unmaintainable piece of software. With OSS, they can always hire a third party to fix bugs, build new features, and so on. It's a much safer long-term option for them.

edit: by the way, I'm not saying GMail isn't any good, by all means if you like it go ahead and use it!

I'll even give you the Qur'an passage, before anyone says I don't know what I'm talking about, which is usually the reaction I get, because that is just the easiest way to continue on our own little path of destruction.

Right, passage: ""Let not the believers take for friends or helpers unbelievers rather than believers. If any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah; except by way of precaution, that ye may guard yourselves from them"" (Qur'an 3:28). Also read up on Ibn Kathir and perhaps the PIG guide to Islam, because I won't be quoting all I've got on the ""Lies are wrong except when they're not"" part.

Why I add this? Because one of the comments says that Muslims who live near Ground Zero said they feel bad, because of the unwanted attention. It's difficult to believe anyone who is part of a religion that literally interprets its Holy Book and is slowly making us destroy ourselves (I hereby again refer to the absolute need for political correctness and every possible consequence).

I also think it's nasty people downvote Millstone, just for telling the truth. It doesn't matter if it's ""only two blocks"" from Ground Zero and it doesn't matter how much has been done about the gaping hole Islam created there. All that matters is: Why do they insist on making a mosque there? What's so important about that particular spot that they'd risk putting their religion in yet another bad light? The question has been asked before in this discussion, but I see few people picking up on it.

I do believe it was Churchill who said it: ""Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytising faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science - the science against which it had vaily struggled - the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.""

To my regret however, the strong arms of science are growing weaker. I don't recall my parents ever doubting the truthfulness of Darwinism.

P.S.: I do believe it's a debate that needs to be held separately from this one, for which I apologise in advance. We're good at apologising lately. Do realise there is a lot left unsaid. This discussion isn't easy to hold.

EU Countries gradually let go of powers but almost all sovereign powers remain at a national level. Some political parties wish a federation is formed, but it's still a distant perspective.

Contrary to what seem to be a common belief in the US, there's no such thing a cultural unity between EU countries. US States had a language in common and a few hundred years before a true Union was formed.

&gt;&gt; ""An immigration restrictionist could easily use HBD to demonstrate why, even if NEAsians have high IQs, they still are going to have a hard time culturally assimilating - in large numbers - into a European civilization because NEAsians and Europeans differ in terms of other important behavioral and personality traits other than IQ.""
&gt;
&gt; However, they don't mind trading shots with ""rioters."" You know, LA style. Koreans will always have a special place in my heart just because of that.

""Epistle to the author of the book, The Three Impostors"".  --  Voltaire

Insipid writer, you pretend to draw for your readers
The portraits of your 3 impostors;
How is it that, witlessly, you have become the fourth?
Why, poor enemy of the supreme essence,
Do you confuse Mohammed and the Creator,
And the deeds of man with God, his author?...
Criticize the servant, but respect the master.
God should not suffer for the stupidity of the priest:
Let us recognize this God, although he is poorly served.

My lodging is filled with lizards and rats;
But the architect exists, and anyone who denies it
Is touched with madness under the guise of wisdom.
Consult Zoroaster, and Minos, and Solon,
And the martyr Socrates, and the great Cicero:
They all adored a master, a judge, a father.
This sublime system is necessary to man.
It is the sacred tie that binds society,
The first foundation of holy equity,
The bridle to the wicked, the hope of the just.

If the heavens, stripped of his noble imprint,
Could ever cease to attest to his being,
If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.
Let the wise man announce him and kings fear him.
Kings, if you oppress me, if your eminencies disdain
The tears of the innocent that you cause to flow,
My avenger is in the heavens: learn to tremble.
Such, at least, is the fruit of a useful creed.

But you, faulty logician, whose sad foolishness
Dares to reassure them in the path of crime,
What fruit do you expect to reap from your fine arguments?
Will your children be more obedient to your voice?
Your friends, at time of need, more useful and reliable?
Your wife more honest? and your new renter,
For not believing in God, will he pay you better?
Alas! let's leave intact human belief in fear and hope.

In vain you raise as an objection to me the hypocritical insolence
Of these proud charlatans promoted to high honors,
Nourished by our work, quenched by our tears;
Of these Caesars tainted by their usurped grandeur;
A priest on the Capitoline hill where Pompea triumphed;
Of these wretches in sandals, the excrement of humanity,
Soaking there detestable hands in our blood;
At the sound of their voice a hundred towns are covered in ruins,
And the horrible matins of bloodied Paris:
I know these awful monuments better than you;
I have unmasked them with my pen for the past fifty years.
But, as the fearsome enemy of this fanaticism,
I have also celebrated God when the devil was vanquished.
I always distinguished between religion
And the misery bred of superstition.
Europe has thanked me; twenty crowned heads
Have deigned to applaud the fortunate labors of my nights,
While Patouillet was insulting me in vain.
I have done more in my time than Luther and Calvin.
They were seen opposing, in a fatal error,
Abuses with abuses, scandal with scandal.
Eager to throw themselves amidst the factions,
They condemned the Pope and wanted to imitate him.
Europe was long desolated by them all;
They troubled the earth, and I have consoled it.
I have told the disputants, hounding one another:
""Cease, impertinent ones, cease, unfortunate ones;
Foolish children of God, cherish yourselves in your brothers,
And stop biting one another for absurd chimeras.""
Good people have believed me: the evil ones, crushed,
Have hurled cries that are scorned by the wise man;
And in Europe, finally, happy toleration
Has become the catechism of all well made souls.

I see from afar that era coming, those happy days,
When philosophy, enlightening humanity,
Must lead them in peace to the feet of the common master;
Frightful fanaticism will tremble to appear there:
There will be less dogma with more virtue.

If someone wants to assume an official position,
He will no longer bring along two witnesses 2
To testify to his beliefs; rather they will swear to his good conduct.

A Huguenot lover will be able to marry
The attractive sister of an important cleric;
We will see poverty clothed and nourished
With the treasures of the Loretto, amassed for Mary;
The children of Sarah, whom we treat like dogs,
Will eat ham that has been cured by Christians.
The Turk, without asking whether the imam will pardon him,
Will go drink with the abbé Tamponet at the Sorbonne. 3
My nephews will dine gaily and with no ill will
With the descendants of the Pompignan brothers;
They will be able to pardon this harsh La Blétrie 4
For having cut short the course of my life.
We will see a reunion of the finest minds:
But who will ever be able to bear dining with Fréron? ",0,,1280929915,False,t3_cx963,t3_cx963,t5_2qh2p,,1426407966,atheism,

Do you have any skills? The only way for a non-EU citizen to get a work permit in Iceland these days is to possess some relevant skill and to be already hired by an Icelandic company. Unskilled workers from outside the EU are not granted work permits in this economic climate.

The only sector that I can think of that is hiring people is IT, software development and such. [CCP](http://www.ccpgames.com/en/jobs.aspx) especially is always scouting for talent.

For me to be schooled, you would have to be imparting knowledge that is a) correct b) relevant to me. This is not the case.

&gt; No one comes up to your bumper that closely if you are not defiant- or have a chip on your shoulder.

Don't forget that I live in the land of americans, where everyone is angry at the world. Perhaps things work a bit different over here than the utopia of europe.

There's no way another driver can tell if I'm defiant or have a chip on my shoulder, short of observing my actions. As I have said before, I typically get over when possible before an overtaking car is even impeded by my presence. I am neither defiant nor do I have a chip on my shoulder. As a case in point, I have remained considerably more civil in this conversation that you have.

Sometimes it is not possible to pull over, due to lack of shoulder or other road conditions. People will still tailgate even in those situations if they want to go faster.

&gt; Once again: you project some sort of sinister intention on the part of the person who is in a hurry.

I have said nothing about a sinister intention. People who tailgate when they want to pass do so either out of habit, or because they are rewarded for doing so (when the car they are tailgating speeds up or moves out of their way).

If they weren't rewarded, and received negative feedback instead, they would be less likely to tailgate.

The actuality of the situation is that when you tailgate someone, you put both them and yourself in a dangerous situation. If the person you are tailgating needs to attempt a panic stop, you most likely won't have time to react so you will run into them. That is a fact - and the motivation for creating that situation does not have to be sinister for it to be considered an issue.

2) Gases released at ground level can and do migrate up to the upper levels of the atmosphere, especially when it's so stable that it sticks around for such a long time.  (While my Goog-Fu was not good enough to find a quick link describing this, you may recall that we have banned CFCs (also heavier than N2/O2) and SF6 is actually a HUGE concern with global warming.)

You may be confusing the weight of a gas molecule with the density of the gas as a whole.  If two gases are mixed at the same temp and pressure, they will mix completely.  Some gases will react away before they get to the upper atmosphere, but not SF6; it's very stable.

Wikipedia:
&gt;ccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, SF6 is the most potent greenhouse gas that it has evaluated, with a global warming potential of 22,800[5] times that of CO2 when compared over a 100 year period. Measurements of SF6 show that its global average mixing ratio has increased by about 0.2 ppt per year to nearly 7 ppt in 2010.[6] Sulfur hexafluoride is also extremely long-lived, it is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere and has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800–3200 years.[7] SF6 is very stable (for countries reporting their emissions to the UNFCCC, a GWP of 23,900 for SF6 was suggested at the third Conference of the Parties: GWP used in Kyoto protocol).[8]
In Europe, SF6 falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its usage for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, SF6 is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high voltage switchgear[9].",0,,1280934278,False,t3_cx5l9,t1_c0vxg67,t5_mouw,,1426408050,science,

However, they're not always the cheapest and most of their instruments will be higher-end than what you're looking for.)

It all depends if you want to play synth-ish music or piano music. I don't know much about playing synth music, so I won't say anything about that. If you want to play piano music, the absolute most important, vital thing is touch-sensitivity, so that the sound gets louder if you press the keys harder. After that, the number of keys is the next most important (a piano has 88, but 61 is plenty for a beginner). The final important thing is the action: a so-called weighted keyboard has keys that feel like a piano's when you press them. This is not important for a beginner but becomes important later.

The Bontempi doesn't have touch-sensitive keys, and as a result I reckon you'd grow out of it after a couple of months. I wouldn't recommend it.

The M-key seems to be a decent instrument, but it only has 49 keys which after a few months will start to get on your nerves. Also, like Synthetic_Jesus says, it's a controller keyboard which means you need to hook it up to a software piano on your computer to get any sound out of it. If you don't mind that, you might try the [M-Audio Keystation 61ES](http://www.thomann.de/de/m-audio_keystation_61es.htm) instead, which has 61 keys. You won't often need more than 61 keys for maybe a couple of years, and the action seems to be good-quality (semi-weighted so it feels more like a piano than your average keyboard does).

Whatever you focus on will be your entire reality. You control what you focus on.

You are a result of what you think. So focusing on the negative and boring aspects of your life, will make your entire life seem negative and boring. The first step you must take is changing the filter through which you see the world. 

Yes there is violence and corruption, greed and hatred. But what about the fact that somewhere, there is a father playing catch with his son, a mother hugging her daughter, puppies being born, a young boy falling in love for the first time. Now we can go on and talk about how all these things don't matter, but that would be passing them through a negative filter again, wouldn't it? There exists both desirable (good) things and undesirable (bad) things. The more you begin to see that and balance out your mind the less depressed you will be. Control your thoughts about things, force yourself to think up one positive thought for every negative thought. Trust me, everything has both.

Secondly, get away from the people who are bringing you down, the people who are bitching and talking bad about you, both physically and mentally. You are going through your quarter-life crisis and many of us are experiencing the same thing: no clear goal, excessive boredom, lack of true purpose. The solution to this for you is simple: Travel. You are bored because you have been in the same place your whole life, meeting the same people, doing the same crap.

Backpack through Europe, Fly to Thailand and live there for a while, go to Australia, The Andes Mountains or a South American rainforest. The problem is you aren't thinking big enough... once again your staring at this tiny part of the world and saying ""this piece of shit sucks!""... stop staring at a piece of shit then. What is stopping you from exploring the world? Fear? Fuck that.. fear is what is going to keep you at your grandmothers house for the rest of your life because you never felt like doing something you werent comfortable doing. You'd rather stay in the same situation and feel sorry for yourself then take a chance and do something incredible. 

Don't have money for a vacation? Start working. It sucks, I know. Work is boring and monotomous, but mostly because you had no goals to work towards. Set a date on the calendar. the day you leave for __________. Do everything in your power to make that happen, then do more. [Couch Surf](http://www.couchsurfing.com) your way through your vacation if you have to. The point is: you need to expand your horizons, you probably feel like shit because you have stopped growing. 

People don't get ""turns"" at enjoying life, it is a choice a conscious effort that is worked towards and forged by one's own willpower. I think you have let the words of the people around you define you.

What I would like to see if much better transit, especially commuter trains, which seem to to be almost non-existant here (Canada) and the U.S..  I traveled to Europe a few years ago and I was blown away by the train systems I saw there.  Amazing high speed trains, light commuter, metros, etc...

I also noticed the layout of cities and towns was totally different.  Even small towns had condos in their core and all the amenities you would need.

I would like to see a similar model here in North America.  Lots more trains, and the redevelopment of suburbs to have more condos in their core and much closer amenities.  They are doing that where I live, more train stations popping up, lots of Condos in the old downtown to revitalize it.  I am fortunate, even though I live in the suburbs, I lived in a planned community.  There are bike paths everywhere, and bike lanes(since the 60’s!) on the roads, all connecting to close by recreation centres, schools, and shopping.  I think once we get good cheap solar panels, and heat/cooling pumps to heat/cool from the earth, more transit, and we rip out some parking lots and parking space to put amenities closer, then we can clean things up.

One. Most watchdogs think that *deflation*, rather than inflation, will be the problem in the next year or so. That means that people who hold US debt don't really mind stimulus measures even if they would ordinarily be inflationary.

Two. The percentage of US debt to GDP isn't that remarkable, from either a global or a historical perspective. This is par for the course, especially after two recessions in &lt;10 years. Modest austerity measures (e.g. letting the Bush tax cuts expire) can/will easily get US federal debt under control in 10-15 years, and the consequent cultural shocks can probably slim down consumer debt as well.

Three. The US has the long-term resources for growth: demographics, infrastructure, rule of law, and natural resources. 

(Three-a) The US will still be a young nation (albeit browner) when the population hits 500 mil, compared to the aging that China (who faces the 4-2-1 problem), Japan or Europe face next. 

(Three-b) The US has the widest and deepest systems of material and financial infrastructure in the globe. We can deliver corn, cars, or credit faster, safer, more cheaply, and across a wider part of the globe with a major population than anyone else. 

(Three-c) The US has corruption, but relative to any other large multicultural society we're as untainted as the Garden of Eden. The balance of rule of law with a diverse population is going to be **the** invaluable resource of the coming world, and the US has been playing at that game for centuries. You can't say the same thing for the bribe-fueled BRIC economies or the increasingly xenophobic Eurozone.

(Three-d) We have resources of every kind, and control of the major environmental impact of these resources better than any other major power. We have water, land, labor, minerals, and bio-diversity. China is faced with massive desertification. Russia is Russia. Africa is Africa. Europe chopped down its forests years ago and built towns on the fertile soil.

Four. The cost of quickly switching to another reserve currency would be immense, and would chill international trade for at least a decade. Despite the rising domestic demand of China, it is still an export economy. The same goes for Germany, the golden goose of the EU. China is gradually trying to get out of the US's canoe, but if a few waves splash that canoe in the process then the splash would be huge.

Five. There are few viable alternatives. 

(Five-a) The proposed ""basket"" of currencies may run afoul of Gresham's law. I see this problem in the IMF's SDRs, especially.

(Five-b) There is no major sovereign central bank with a record of long-term stability to even touch the US Fed. 

(Five-c) The volatility of the currency markets over the past century (see: the current gold craze) demonstrate that an Austrian hard-money central bank would have much greater macroeconomic fluctuations than the US Fed.

(Five-d) Simply put, specialization. Since Bretton-Woods, the US Fed has slowly accumulated a better working knowledge of macroecon than any other single institution in the world.

The comments here are largely negative and make a pretty uniform suggestion that you're wasting your time and money.  If you love the liberal arts, don't let these people discourage you.  An MA is a very useful degree if you're going into business, non-profits, or government work. Loads of very successful people have liberal arts backgrounds.  If you can, try to supplement this program with some statistics, a solid computer background and at least one foreign language (the nice thing about all these skills is you can either do them or you can't-you don't need a formal qualification showing that you can speak multiple languages or that you can do some web-design/computer programming).  Don't underestimate statistics.  That's one of the things social science and business people have over you when they go on the job market.  Prove that you have those qualifications.  Summer internships and some teaching experience will also make a huge difference when you go on the job market.  

Keep in mind that if you don't go on to the PhD and you decide to leave academia for a career in the private sector many people in positions to hire you will think exactly like Steelyheights does and the onus will be on you to show them that you are competent and can compete with the dime a dozen MBA's out there. What liberal arts students are rarely taught is how to sell themselves.  Again, a decent summer internship will go along way towards helping you do this.

I'm a philosophy professor so I'm pretty biased, but I make a good living and the fringe benefits of the liberal arts are pretty nice.  This past summer alone I spent teaching my way across Europe.  Living and travel expenses were covered and I even made a decent stipend for teaching.  Next summer, I'm planning a similar stint in Hong Kong.  There are very few professional jobs that have the flexibility that you'll get from a successful career in the liberal arts.  It's not an easy road but if you love the work you're doing and are willing to stick with it, you can make a nice life out of mere thinking and reading.  I get paid to teach and write books and I wouldn't trade that for anything.

I know some that have taken up postdoctoral fellowships to turn their theses into books, and I know a few that have taken lectureships. I also know a few people that cannot find work in academia at the moment. This is uninspiring feedback, I guess, so I'll stop.

You say you are certain, and I am skeptical of this. Not that I doubt your desire and tenacity, but if there is one notion that has, sort of, saturated my thought, it is that certainty is untenable. That said, plenty of my colleagues say they knew they wanted to be in academia, began their college life with this goal, and are now achieving it. They are the less interesting sorts in my opinion.

If I had to list a few things I wish someone would've told me (and I would have internalized), it would be these:

* get good fucking grades: my grades were slightly above mediocre, and I still managed to get into a world-class program, but *just make it easy on yourself* and get As
* master a language and study abroad in a country that speaks that language: the physical encounter with otherness (or, as other) is when the magic happens
* Find people in the field who are passionate and ask for their input. Find mentors. Listen and evaluate their advice.

I would neither push you toward nor away from pursuing a humanities PhD. I don't want to romanticize this particular pursuit of knowledge as some sort of noble activity, and professors are not quite as glamorous as we like to think. At this early stage, perhaps you see a PhD like a qualification: to be a lawyer you go to law school, to be a professor you got to professor school. That is not a terrible way to look at it, really. I will try not to lapse into wistful thoughts on the caprice of youth, but I started out college very myopically to become an engineer like pops, get a good job, etc. etc. I managed to be both earnest and unserious, which is a terrible combination. Luckily, I was convinced to study in Europe for a semester. It slowed me down, allowed me to be introspective, and made me open to alternatives. Perhaps you, too, should be open to alternatives other than English.

To do my bit for my fellow TAs, take your tutorials seriously. Do the work; be receptive to what they are trying to teach. Be skeptical of the things you are told, but note that you are 're-learning' things many before you have learned. Oh, and make sure you know how to write a topic sentence. Why don't students know how to write a fucking topic sentence? Also, read your papers out loud after writing them. This is how it will 'sound' to the poor grader. I'm fucking serious about topic sentences, though.

First you need to decide whether you want to cycle around in a loop and get back to Amsterdam on the bike, or whether you are happy to get ground or air transportation back. This is often easy enough these days with a bike; I have flown with mine plenty without bother.

As Berlin is roughly due east continuing in that direction you could cycle [all the way to Kiev in Ukraine.](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Amsterdam,+The+Netherlands&amp;daddr=Berlin,+Germany+to:Kiev,+Kyiv,+Ukraine&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FSkpHwMdN6FKAClN_N7pjwnGRzGQdB6NWt4ABA%3BFY1xIQMdSKTMACkBWQM_N06oRzFwO15bRiAhBA%3B&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;sll=48.835797,19.797363&amp;sspn=14.283664,33.815918&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=54.457267,17.644043&amp;spn=12.628911,33.815918&amp;z=6) That is a total of 1,945km, so 648km/week. Do I have any idea whatsoever what that would be like? No. But it would be pretty cool to have cycled all the way to Kiev.

Most Western nationalities don't need a visa to enter Ukraine and Eastern Europe is also substantially cheaper than the West. You would not have the sort of cycling infrastructure you have in the Netherlands or Germany but to be honest I prefer it that way anyway.

[Alternatively you could continue south to Belgrade in Serbia](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Amsterdam,+The+Netherlands&amp;daddr=Berlin,+Germany+to:Belgrade,+Serbia&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FSkpHwMdN6FKAClN_N7pjwnGRzGQdB6NWt4ABA%3BFY1xIQMdSKTMACkBWQM_N06oRzFwO15bRiAhBA%3BFXChqwIdwUc4ASm9P7XXo3paRzHkfhfyXGS4HQ&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;sll=47.724545,14.106445&amp;sspn=14.594493,33.815918&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=48.777913,12.678223&amp;spn=14.299992,33.815918&amp;z=6).

Serbia is a great country and Subotica and Novi Sad in particular are fun cities well worth a visit. I cycled [from Ireland to Istanbul](http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/ireland2istanbul) last month and so was on that route from the Hungarian border.

If you want to do a loop then Prague and back to Amsterdam sounds more than manageable. There are hills between Germany and the Czech Republic but they don't look too crazy. The Alps are spectacular but also tough if carrying stuff on a touring bike. They are also probably too far if you are keeping to that pace AND want to cycle all the way back to Amsterdam.

Lots of nominally Christian nations in Europe are nowhere near as puritanical as us.  Also, the Bible is far from the only source of Christian theology, philosophy, and tradition.

&gt; Sex is condemned as ""dirty and wrong.""

You're reading a different Bible than I've ever seen.  Hello, song of songs?   Also, you might want to look up ""mitzvat onah""; if you're Jewish, you're a bad husband if you ain't putting out enough.  The three big things that I remember that were condemned for Jews sex-wise were cheating on your spouse, fucking animals, and men fucking other men (like everyone else, they seem to like a little girl-girl action).  The latter two, I think, are characterized as ""abominations in the eyes of the LORD"" or something similar.  Also, IIRC, pre-marital sex wasn't so much *wrong* as *risky*; getting caught meant you had to get married or pay a fine to the woman's family.  

And, of course, this is only for Jews; for Gentile Christians, who are very explicitly not subject to Judaic law, what's ""right"" and ""wrong"" around sex is even less clear.  Paul's obviously pro-celibacy, but even he says that getting married and getting laid is better than being horny all the time.  

I'm going off memory on the details of Judaic law (feel free to correct me, if you're bored), but my point is that ""the bible"", nor Judaism, nor Christianity, nor even Islam broadly paint sex as ""dirty"" or ""wrong"".

I've never seriously considered getting one of these. The Tiger is much in the same vein of the Transalp though, if I recall correct. Something they call dual sport. I'm trying to get away from that a bit.

The Transalp is reasonably comfortable, though I feel it has two drawbacks that keep if from being an excellent touring bike.

Due to its aerodynamics, the turbulance hits me straight in the face, causing for an excessively loud ride and a very sore neck after one day or two days of riding. This also happens to my uncle, who's about a head shorter than I am and who bought a Transalp as well (we are planning to travel through Russia and parts of western Asia together at some point in the future).

The other point is that the stock seat is bad. It'll give you a sore bum about an hour and a half into a ride. Again, this seems to happen to more people than myself.

As to where the Transalp is... it's a Belgian reg and currently with me in Ireland where I've lived for the past few months. I guess that probably rules out any sort of chance of you riding it. It is rare in the US, and I read that after an initial period of a handful years late 80s (and maybe early 90s) they stopped selling them completely there. Mine is a '99, and would never have been available directly in the US. It seems it's only sold in Europe these days (and maybe Japan). They did lose all charm in 2001 though when they went to 650cc and an all new, all ugly design.

In terms of medieval culture Berlin isn't going to be the best city for you. Most of the older structures didn't survive the war but thats one of the things that gives Berlin it's particular charm. It's a city thats had to be rebuilt multiple times and that's given it a chance to reinvent its self over and over again. If you're into German culture then the German culture that Berlin can offer is more a mix of reheated cold war kitsch, the remnants of the Berlin wall and the GDR, and then the incredible art, music and theater scene that cropped up in the 90's in the power vactume that was left before the west German government could get set up again the the capital city. 

In the media over here you often find Berlin described as ""Poor but sexy"" and that really describes the vibe in the city. Which as many of the other posts have mentioned lends it to more of a cafe, nightclub, hipster kind of vibe. Berlin is a young, poor (25% of the population is on some form unemployment support), and international (40% of the citys population are either first or second generation migrants )

If you want to see more of a ""traditional European charm"" a daytrip out to Park San Souci in Potsdam might be in order. Potsdam is technically in the Berliner metro area and you can get out there with a day pass and about 45 minutes by train. Its a large part with multiple palaces modeled after French palaces.  

A post below mentions Die Henne def. go there an check it out. It's one of the older Berliner resturants and still has some of the old flair associated with it. I helped produce a piece about the place for a TV station here and the foods really worth it if you're looking for more down home German culture.

First off never admit this.

&gt;I was never anywhere near the American continent and all my knowledge about the US comes from Hollywood movies, Mythbusters and the internets.

You are European, Americans have an extreme inferiority complex and know next to nothing of real life in Europe so they will be in awe of your god-like status. Constantly tell them how much better you are then them at everything, many Americans have only been to Europe for a short time on holiday so they think it's paradise. Mention helth care, culture, tv, music, art mass transpostation, better societites. Alo bring up ridiculously arbitrary things like tipping, tax at the market to flaunt your superiority.

Next you will need a bible and a gun, if you are caught without either of these the average American will try to attack you on sight...they are all armed to the teeth with knives and guns and are alway going on and on about Jesus. I hear the area you're going is very notorious for this.

Make sure to get familiar with handegg and NASCAR, these are the only ""sports"" Americans like and if you don't want to be left out you should know who's who.

To better fit in you might want to also consider gaining 50 kilo. This should be easy because Americans only eat processed fast food (you won't find a proper market with fresh food) and Bud Lite or Coors Lite. I hope you like McDonalds or as USAins call it, MACDONAILDS.

They have no public transportation so you must get a car, they really only sell gaint trucks so that might be difficult. [Here](http://www.monstertruckracing.com/gravedigger/gravedigger47.jpg) we see the typical American SUV.  They also only have automatic ones. They are too stupid to learn to shift. 

DO NOT MENTION EVOLUTION! Americans are not taught science like we are, they are told in school (where they also salute the flag like nazis) that Jesus made the world 6,000 years ago. They will anger quickly if you tell them different and you may be shot and havested for organs (bad healthcare).

Oakland tends to be more affordable than Berkeley; the Temescal and Rockridge regions have a quick (by US standards...) public transit connection to UC Berkeley, a light rail system known as BART which also connects to San Francisco.

You might feel overdressed fairly often. The bay area is mostly about jeans, T-shirts, and athletic shoes, although I think you'll blend in better, at less expense, if you wear what you normally would, rather than wear a European interpretation of local styles.

Summers can have cool weather, especially in San Francisco, and especially in an El Nino year like this one. Bring long sleeves, and try to dress in layers, as if it might turn from autumn to summer and back again over the course of a day.

He said, short distance maps, against protoss every game, against terran 6 pool going to baneling bust, unless he gets proxied. I asked him: ""So if they don't cheese me, I will cheese them is that it?"". He said, yeah sure why not, he wins most of the games like that. I asked what league he is in just out of curiosity, he said platinum and I was like wtf. I said he won because I screwed up, I am not trying to whine or anything, but is he at least aware that he cannot transition from anything with a 6 pool opening, all I needed was to hold of the first wave of zerglings and he would have lost the game within 10 minutes top. He said of course he knows it, but many people are unprepared so he keeps on doing it. I mean that's the mentality I am against. Yeah it's just a game, it's not a matter of life and death, but it's a game a lot of people take more seriously then Call of Duty.

After the game I look him up and he's in platinum, too. I am in the EU servers, I don't know the others, but in EU in platinum, this is how I see the situation right now: 25% of the players are really good, 25% of the players are my level, that is they know the concepts, but they don't have the apm to implement them (yeah I know apm isn't everything, but if you can't multitask at all it effects the game) + they make a lot of mistakes. And the rest, and by that I mean 50% of platinum from my experiences depend on cheese or 1 single tricky build against each race etc. This is the situation even in platinum, I can't imagine how it must be in bronze or silver.

Getting into more action, theres Actraiser, which is a half-side-scroller / half-town-building game that uses a ton of sound effects from Soulblazer. But that's straying from the RPG genre a bit.


Breath of Fire I and II are worth playing, as well. The series has since fizzled out, but it's a classic.

Lastly, the first bunch of Dragon Warrior (JP: Dragon Quest) games were remade for the SNES. Probably the simplest RPGs of the bunch, but classics. Unfortunately, you'll have to find fan-translations, but the ones out are quality as far as I've played.

Oh, my childhood friend was the closest person that I have ever known to being a real miser.

He worked in Saudi Arabia for 20 years.  His contract called for a round trip ticket to his home with one stopover each year.  One year he would fly to Greece and buy the cheapest pants in Europe, the next year he would fly via the Netherlands to buy the cheapest underclothes.  The next year via Morocco where he could get custom made shirts for less than the material would cost in Europe.

The reason that he went to work in Saudi Arabia is because he had been accumulating money for 10 to 12 years after college.  He finally found something that he could invest in for retirement.  He sold up everything and bought an apple orchard in West Virginia.

The first year, he had a bumper crop. So did the rest of the United States. He couldn't recoup the cost of the crop, but he borrowed money and put his apples in cold storage for the next year.

Next year, same thing, now he had two years supply of apples that he could not stand to sell for cheaper than what he had paid for them.

The cold storage company went out of business, his collateral for his loans rotted.

He mortgaged his farm to pay off the loans and put the money in for another crop that year.  Bumper crop of apples.

He worked in Saudi Arabia for 10 years before he finally realized that he had worked for 25 years for nothing.  Sold the farm.  Huge loss.  He asked me to go down and check on a car that he had stored in the town for 10 years, but was too cheap to fly into Washington, DC and hire a rental car to drive over and see what condition it was in.

I bought a throwaway camera and carefully documented the destruction of his prize 240Z.  I just put the pictures in an envelope and sent them to him.  No explanation.  I've never heard from him since.",0,,1280954236,False,t3_cx9r6,t1_c0vyprf,t5_6,,1426408488,reddit.com,

You're golden money wise. I spent about $1000 a week for 6 weeks and didn't skimp on anything. And the exchange rate is better now than it was for me, so you really are fine.

Again, depending on when you are going, try to get your Eurail pass before. There are a whole bunch of different levels depending on how long you are travelling and how many countries you want it to be valid in, I got the Global One.

NewEurope offers free tours in a lot of cities. Do them, perfect for people my age (22 at the time). You can find pamphlets in any of the hostels or tour info centers. They also do pub crawls, cheap, good way to meet people and get drunk.

I was living in a fraternity which was dying, so the rent was relatively cheap.

My roommate had no trouble in terms of cultural barriers.  

In terms of fitting in - don't worry.  No one fits into Berkeley.  That's its charm.  It is so diverse and weird in some respects, and so normal in others, that just being there is good enough.  Also, Berkeley is not America in its general sense.  In fact, as a European, you may find it easier to fit into Berkeley than many people from middle America.  The student body is most Asian, followed by whites - so it doesn't look or feel like any TV show out there.  And the chicks will dig your accent.

Nothing will land you in jail either.  As long as you don't drink and drive or shoot up in front of a cop, you are good.

Tips:
Live on the South Side near Telegraph.  North side is more expensive and dead.  Easy walking distance to school, more happening.  Anywhere is not cheap.  Look into subletting rooms from fraternities.  I don't know, but maybe the International House (the i-House) in Berkeley can offer housing.  The further you have to walk, the cheaper it is.  Find a balance.

Housing in Berkeley is expensive and dilapidated.  Being from Europe, it won't be a huge shock, but the average American would be appalled at what students live in at Berkeley.

Keep the accent.  My roommate got so many girls with his.  In other words, don't try to see ""American"".  It's pointless in Berkeley.

Become friends with someone with a car.  That way, if he or she is going to Target, you can stock up on stuff.

Berkeley is expensive because there are really no big stores or franchises, and the city has set up itself to rip off students.  No special tips in terms of saving money.  Just cook at home, but occasionally go out and have a burrito at La Burrita, or a hot dog at Top Dog.  There is so much diversity in the food that it would be a waste to eat Top Ramen.

Really out-there, crazy, off-the-wall funny. I don't know if it's a strategy that works for men, but it works for me (and for the men I end up messaging), so. WHADDUP.

I like messages that mix commentary on profile/pictures. Calling someone out and telling a joke at the same time are great ways to start a conversation. I called out a well-traveled guy* for saying Antarctica was the only place he wouldn't travel: ""Don't hate. Antarctica is the PERFECT place to go if you want to show-up all of your high school friends who make you react to pictures of their month-long trip through Europe."" Nothing rude, mind, but it's leagues above complimenting someone over and over or, ""You like 'Overboard'? ME TOO! Jeez, Kurt Russel had it goin' on. Man. .....man, can't believe you like 'Overboard'. It is definitely the main thing we have in common. Let's grab coffee sometime.""

Clearly you are a dude who has a lot of friends from a lot of different places in life: you are PROBABLY extremely funny, in person, and totally nice and endearing and cute. The trouble is, it really doesn't come off from your profile! The pictures save it, but it'd be nice if your profile was as much fun to read as you are to hang out with in real life. ""I'm a chemical engineer and work for an air quality testing firm, which means that I'm the FIRST person you want with you after you finish watching 'Breaking Bad' and spend a week seriously considering cooking to pay the bills, and the LAST person you want to bring with you to admire the L.A. skyline."" Make sense?

Like I said, your results may vary, depending on who you're trying to attract. But if you make somebody laugh/smile just reading through your profile, you're already halfway there. :) The worst part I can see is the ""most private thing"" section -- everybody feels this way. Almost EVERYONE chooses to write somewhere in their profile that they're shy at first, but loosen up afterwards/once they get to know you. Take it out. It has no place. It's hampering your ""Listen, you DEFINITELY want to hang out with me"" game!

c0vz8df,t1_c0vz8df,0,3,0,False,True,Diminutive,3,"**Debt:** Debt cannot artificially increase consumption. By definition, debt is just rearranging the ordering of consumption. People can't consume more than they earn in the long run. I don't necessarily agree that people are totally rational about these things, as virtually no one would rationally buy a Navigator, but it does seem rational for most people to take on reasonable debt loads to buy a car of some sorts.

**Economy:** Off the top of my head, you're final cost needs to be divided by 1.8 to reflect that the average car trip has 1.8 passengers. Passenger miles includes, well, passengers, while the driving costs is simply driving. More importantly, every method of transit has costs. For instance, that includes lost time due to congestion. Fair enough, but then you would have to include the time difference between driving and alternatives. Now, it's true to say that driving is probably under taxed given the well known externalities, the solution to this is some kind of carbon tax. Even using generous assumptions though, gas costs would probably just rise to European levels which shouldn't render driving impractical.

**War:** I can't for the life of me understand why people think oil costs are subsidized by wars. There not. You can quite clearly see that whenever war, or even tension, breaks out in the Middle East oil costs rise dramatically. Wars destroy production capacity. Also, as for the US, much of it's oil doesn't even come from the ME. Canada and Mexico are the largest suppliers. It's just a weird statistical quirk: if you examine US conflicts since WW2, most of them don't even involve countries with any oil. Vietnam, no oil. Korea, no oil. Kosovo, no oil. Panama, no oil. Grenada, no oil. Somalia, no oil. Afghanistan, no oil. It doesn't follow that because the US invaded one oil producing country, and seriously crewed global oil markets in the process, that oil is ""cheap"" because of the US military.

**Quality of Life:** The simple answer is that people aren't that upset in their cars.[This StatsCan survey](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2006004/9516-eng.htm) shows that most people view their commute as relatively positive. Cyclists do tend to enjoy committing more, though it's difficult for most people to practically cycle to work. My basic opinion here is that it really is best to let people decide for themselves how to get from point a to point b.

**Health:** I wouldn't say that cars are good for one's health, just that reducing car use isn't an effective way to improve health. I'm not exactly  an expert on obesity economics, but soda/junk food taxes and education seem far more relevant. Reducing car usage absent changes in nutrition will be meaningless.

c0vzcju,t1_c0vzcju,0,4,0,True,True,flossdaily,4,"You should really read one of the millions of books out there written on exactly this (""The Case for Israel"" or ""Israel for Dummies"" even).  Here is the short, short, short version:

At the beginning of the 1900s ultra-religious Jews started buying up land in the middle east because they wanted to start a modern movement to get back their historic homeland.  The land really *was* historically theirs; sure you can read about that in the Torah (old Testament of the Bible) but beyond that, tons of other corroborating evidence proves that *yes*, Jews were their long before Muslims.  Namely, the ruins of Jewish temples and other things are still in Jerusalem, predating all Muslim and Christian holy sites.

So, this movement was growing steadily for decades... then the Nazis came along and slaughtered 2/3 of all the Jews in Europe, and basically displaced the other 1/3 of the Jewish population.  Thats about 3 million Jews that had all their possessions taken, families murdered, homes confiscated.  They needed someplace to go.

So the Jews all said to Britain, ""Hey buddy, See the big hunk of land you control which you call Palestine?  Well, we've been buying a bunch of that land for decades now.  How about you hand over a chunk of it and give us Sovereignty so we can have a modern day state of Israel?""

And all the Arabs on the land said, ""Whoa, this is bullshit.  Why should they get sovereignty when we've had to put up with British occupation for all these years?!  This is our land, and not yours to give away!""

And so the United Nations said: Well, like it or not, Arabs, this *is* British land to give away.  And we all think giving some of it to the Jews is a great idea because we have 3 million refugees that we don't want to have to deal with anymore.  But here's a compromise... we'll give them a state, and at the same time we'll create a new state for you with part of that land.

And the Arabs said: ""Fuck that... we're not giving up *any* of our claim to the Jews.

And the Jews were like, ""Well, to be fair, most of you Arabs didn't have much of a life here until we built up the economy here for several decades.""

And the Arabs said, ""that's cool and all, but this is our land, and we're not giving it up.""

And the Jews said, ""Actually, before you murdered and exiled our ancestors, this *was* our land... so you aren't the only ones with an historic claim.  And right now this is British land, and they've agreed to give it to us.""

And the Arabs said: ""Over our dead bodies.""

And the Jews said: ""So be it.  We just watched 1/3 of our entire population get slaughtered because we were unable to defend ourselves.  We're all homeless and we need a new start.  We're taking this land that Brits and the UN say we can have.  You're just going to have to deal with that, because we don't really give a fuck anymore.""

And so Israel became a State.  And a lot of Arabs decided to attack the new state of Israel, and a lot of Jews decided to force a lot of Arabs out of the new state.  

All the surrounding Arab nations got together and tried to take Israel down, but they found that Israel, funded mostly by France at that time (not the US), had a pretty impressive army, and they were very, very good at fighting.

So then, after getting their asses kicked a few times, all the Arab states decided to team up for one big coordinated strike on Israel.  They lined up all their armies on Israel's borders and prepared to attack.

Israel did a massive preemptive strike and took all the land currently known as ""the occupied territories"".  

They also took some land from Egypt- but they immediately traded it back to Egypt in exchange for a peace treaty which has lasted to this day.

They tried to trade the West Bank back to Jordan in exchange for the same peace deal, but Jordan wasn't having it.

Jordan also wouldn't let in any of its *own* citizens who were trapped in the occupied territories.

And so, all these unhappy Arab refugees were left in the West Bank and Gaza.  Israel ran these territories for a while, and things weren't so horrible... all this poverty wasn't a problem yet.

Then the Israelis handed control of the municipal functions of the occupied territories to the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) under Yassar Arafat.

Arafat became a folk hero to his people, and for the next few decades he was the only leader that Israel could talk to about making a permanent peace with the ""Palestinians"" (the *new* name given to all the Arabs in the occupied territories.  Before the occupied territories, there was no nationality called Palestinian).

Anyways, it turns out that Arafat likely thought that any permanent peace deal would result in him losing some of his power, so while he hinted at peace off and on for 3 decades, he was also funding and supporting massive waves of terrorist attacks on Israel.  He was also personally hording 2 *billion* dollars in aid money that was supposed to go to his people.

Under President Clinton, Israel and Arafat almost reached a peace deal.  Israel offered 97% of the land that Arafat had asked for, as well as municipal control of half of Jerusalem (Israel's capital).  Arafat walked away from the peace talks, saying that there could be no peace without a ""right of return"" for Palestinians.

Right of Return would mean that Arabs would be allowed to flood into Israel unrestricted.  Current demographic trends suggested that if that were to happen, then within 3 generations there would be more Arabs living in Israel than Jews.  And *that* would mean that Israel would eventually be voted out of existence- certainly as a Jewish nation, but possibly also as a free democracy.  Israel was not willing to shoot itself in the head like that, because without a firm Jewish identity and majority, they could not guarantee that they could defend themselves against another genocide like the holocaust.

So... Arafat declares it's time for another round of terrorism.  And Israeli/Palestinian relations (which had been pretty good for a little while) suddenly turned completely to shit.  And Israel decides once and for all that it can never reach a peace agreement with Arafat.  They want him dead, but they also know that they can't kill him because he is a folk hero.

So things basically were put on hold for another decade while everyone just waited for Arafat to die.  Violence on both sides was pretty harsh.  And while the Israelis couldn't *kill* Arafat, they certainly did a good job humiliating him.  They essentially kept him imprisoned in his PLO compound for a long, long time.

So eventually Arafat dies.  And their is a brief hope that this is FINALLY a new chance for peace.  But no pro-peace leaders emerge in Palestine- well, they do, but they don't have the support of the people, so they can't get anything done (they basically don't have the power to call of the Palestinian terrorists).

Eventually Hamas (a terrorist organization) gets elected to power, and Israel refuses to deal with them at all.  Things really get shitty for the Palestinians now, because Israel decides that the Palestinian people are going to get punished for electing Hamas.  So the anti-terrorist attacks get more brutal, the border crossings get more restricted, and the imports get cut back only to the bare essentials.

Palestinians become waaaaay more miserable, but of course, instead of blaming Hamas, they blame Israel. 

Meanwhile Ultra-religious nutcases in Israel keep building settlements in the occupied territories (sometimes with the blessing of the government, sometimes not).

There was a variety of varying African customs regarding slaves. Some societies didn't practice it, while others embraced it. Some societies had slaves as servants, while others allowed slaves to eventually win their freedoms and become warriors of their new tribe. The slave trade practiced by the Europeans was completely different. But yes, oftentimes tribes would wage war on other tribes in order to acquire slaves to sell to the slave traders in return for guns and ammo.

On an interesting note, the first few slaves brought to the New World were actually indentured servants, according to some historians. Only later did they become the slaves in common perception.

And your understanding of the chief and leader positions seem off as well. The son of a chief does not necessarily become the chief. Just like every culture is different in the West, the same is true in Africa. Not every tribe has the same traditions, and to assume that African tribes suffered from poor leadership due to hereditary leadership is simplistic at best.

Why does the Arab League still have a prohibition against granting citizenship to Palestinians? Why do the oil-rich Gulf countries provide little in terms of infrastructure money (which comes mainly from the US and the EU)?

NFFE acts as the exclusive representative of scientific and technical employees at EPA. The NFFE professionals claim that “serious errors were made by the Agency (EPA) in setting the fluoride Recommended Maximum Contaminant Level (RMCL).” The NFFE took serious issue with the EPA’s mandates and wrote

[""The process by which EPA arrived at the RMCL for fluoride is scientifically irrational and displays an unprofessional review of relevant scientific data. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires that an RMCL must be a reflection of the opinion of health professionals as to the level of a contaminant at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons will occur, and which allows an adequate margin of safety. However, the final RMCL for fluoride does not represent a determination made on the basis of scientific and technical expertise.""](http://www.fluoridealert.org/health/epa/nrdc/union-brief1986.pdf)

Prague: One of the top 2 places I visited. Check out the castle, the tours, the modern art museum, the opera house, the Lennon (yes Lennon) wall. Definitely do the free tour here! The exchange rate is hugely in your favor, so you can get a nice five course meal for 3 for about $50 total.

Venice: Stay on the island of Venice NOT the mainland, my friend and I got lost in a bad neighborhood trying to get back to our hostel late at night...language issues, buses schedule confusion etc. Check out the Rialto, Piazza San Marco (and everything located there), the bridge of sighs was under renovation while I was there, but check it out. Take ferries to the smaller islands, they specialize in various crafts, glass, lace, etc. Eat dinner in Piazza San Marco.

Florence: Gardens at the palace, lots of nice clubs and bars around the city. Did not spend too much time here so I dont have too many suggestions except for stay at PLUS Hostel....it was cheap and nice, best hostel we stayed at, pool, sauna, steam room, rooftop bar... and again yes, it was cheap.

Rome: Spanish Steps, Colosseum, Vatican (go early, takes about half a day to a day)

Monaco: Check out the casino and waterfront, just a nice place to relax. We saw a movie being filmed while we were there, car chase down the main street.

Barc: Las Ramblas, lots of bars and clubs, great nightlife, specifically check out the ""fairy"" bar, no, not gay, just decorated like an enchanted forest.....and the shot bar, hundreds of different cheap shots. Another great pub crawl here too.

Madrid: Try and stay at a hostel near Plaza del Sol. I think we stayed at 3 amigos, very centrally located. Check out a bullfight and try a few of the bars during the day for Tapas.",0,,1280964224,False,t3_cxfag,t1_c0vz438,t5_2qh1i,,1426408705,AskReddit,

Let's not pretend like the UN is some impartial body trying to be an honest broker for peace.   The UN has been applying bald-faced double standards to Israel for decades, going so far as singling out Israel as a violator of women's rights.  

Forgetting that Israel is really the only state in the entire middle east where women truly have equal rights, the whole argument was that because Israel ""oppresses"" Palestinians, and some Palestinians are women, they must must be oppressing women"".  Meanwhile, that same UN motion completely ignored all the Muslim theocracies where women get stoned to death as a punishment for shaming their families by being raped.

&gt;Equally, the military victories, regardless of who funded them were means to and end of fulfilling the historical claim to the land.

No at all.  Those military victories were about STAYING ALIVE.  Israel had a brand new state that was under constant attack.  It had everything to do with the present day, and nothing to do with the past.

&gt;Fair enough, and technically speaking the land was the British's to give away but the reasoning behind it is despicable.

How is giving a homeland to 3 million homeless Jews, who were the survivors of the worst genocide in history ""despicable""?  I mean really, I don't care which side of the conflict you come down on, you're really being deliberately obtuse if you can't understand that this was legitimate solution to a crisis that had no perfect resolution.

&gt;""we used to own it, so give it back"". The roman empire covered most of continental europe, do they have a claim to take it back?

It's like you didn't even read what I wrote.  You're just arguing with your own assumptions.  Jews were trying to buy their way into that land for decades because it was their historic homeland.  But ultimately that was just the toe in the door for the real movement.  This was about refugees needing a defensible homeland after nearly becoming extinct.

Is that a good enough reason to displace the people who already lived there?  In a purely number-based, heartless cost-benefit analysis the answer is yes.  A lot more people were helped than harmed.  And it's a whole lot more justified than taking land because of ""manifest destiny"" the way Americans did.

But where the Arabs on that land flat-out robbed... sure they were.

But when you really take a moment to analyze the situation, you'll see that the creation of the State of Israel was actually one of the least bloody examples of the creation of a nation.  The way people talk about it, you'd think it was one of the worst.  People tend to lose perspective about that.

If you're a woman, being topless in public can land you in jail. Drinking alcohol in public/outdoor places attracts trouble from cops unless it's hosted by an organization with a permit to serve. Gently placing your pinky finger on a cop's shoulder will get you a good tasering and jail time for assault and resisting (serious offenses).

* *What are smart, but legal ways to save money?*

Costco (or its lesser competitor Sam's Club). ALDI is also very cheap store. Learn to like Asian and Mexican food, burgers, and bagels.

* *Any thoughts on where it is affordable and interesting to live?*

Nothing in the bay area is affordable. Anything that's interesting will be astronomically priced.

* *What drugs will they put in my sammiches?*

The beef and pork may taste funny to you. This is because of the estrogen pumped into the beef and because American's don't castrate pigs that go to slaughter. You'll find that American bacon is incredibly fatty and salty. And whole raw chickens sold in the stores will be unusually large--almost like small turkeys.

* *What is so obscure that I can't even think of, that might cause trouble?*

Don't criticize ""Amurrica"" while in America. Don't flash your money around or display excessive bling. Don't ride the metro city bus if you have alternatives. Finding a good small time bakery is difficult sometimes.

* *What are importantly trivial differences between the US and european countries, besides what I already know of?*

Start learning Spanish, now. Americans rarely cook at home. When they do it's usually boxed or pre-prepared food. Don't vacation in the southern states for too long; you'll get a headache. For weekend holiday, Seattle, WA has a Europy feel to it.

[Sweden](http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/3083/a/125282) this is damn near a mirror of US Immigration law, few differences at all here, save the policy of EU movement - we let anyone coming here to work for a company here come in as long as their company endorses them, they dont have to come from a specific group of countries.

[Switzerland](http://www.bfm.admin.ch/bfm/en/home/themen/arbeit/nicht-eu_efta-angehoerige/grundlagen_zur_arbeitsmarktzulassung.html) since most argue moving to the US for gainful employment, i direct you to the non-eu citzens section, showing a yearly cap (something the US also employees on immigration) and as well, a 90day cap on EU citzens working in switzerland before they must gain work permits.

 Of course Iran is a threat to Israel, in rhetoric as well as action.  Ahmadinejad’s constant and public threats against Israel and Jews are matched by his material support for Hamas and Hezbollah, and his pursuit of nuclear weapons.  

Your reference to the Israeli’s bombing of the Osirak does little to help your argument.  The Iraqi’s were a threat then as the Iranians are a threat now.  As a signatory of the NPT, the Iran has obliged itself to a degree of nuclear transparency.  Against heavy domestic right-wing pressure, the Obama administration (with support from Russia, China, Europe and Israel) made Iran a generous offer:  “continue your nuclear program out in the open, with a fuel swap arrangement as a safeguard, and face no further sanctions.”  Iran declined the offer, and opted instead to continue its clandestine program, without providing any evidence thats its intentions were benign.  All this at great cost to its economy I should add.  

As for the “reelection” of A-Jad, I don’t think you really understand the concept of democracy.  Elections don’t work if the electorate is terrorized into voting one way or another, and they don’t work if the results are not transparent and verifiable.

Then I enlisted like a good patriot, my semi-fiancée broke off with me. I signed an agreement with the US Army to go to the Army Language School in Monterey, CA to study Serbo-Croatian for a year and then spend the rest of my tour of duty in Europe.

They've earned this money by often abusing the labor force, by giving workers bad working conditions or encouraging and subsidizing others who abuse workers, by treating them poorly, as expendable resources, without respect, abusing competition (Microsoft was convicted in two courts of law, in USA and in EU), etc.

Charity is a *step* in the right direction.  It's a step on the path toward a correction, a healing.  It's not good in and of itself.

Which ones?

&gt;are matched by his material support for Hamas and Hezbollah, 

Don't really care and his support isn't as significant as the fact that these movements wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Israeli belligerence and oppression.

&gt;and his pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Nope.

&gt;Against heavy domestic right-wing pressure, the Obama administration (with support from Russia, China, Europe and Israel) made Iran a generous offer: “continue your nuclear program out in the open, with a fuel swap arrangement as a safeguard, and face no further sanctions.” Iran declined the offer, and opted instead to continue its clandestine program, without providing any evidence thats its intentions were benign. All this at great cost to its economy I should add.

Except Iran has no obligation to abide by the US's demands as it has not been found to be in violation of the NPT.  The US is trying to exert powers it doesn't have, Iran is pointing out it has no right to do so, and the US is being a baby and imposing sanctions.  Sanctions that, by the way, are probably not too economically significant.  Certainly not as economically significant as the consequences of Iran giving into pressure from the US and Europe and not diversifying its energy sources.

&gt;As for the “reelection” of A-Jad, I don’t think you really understand the concept of democracy. Elections don’t work if the electorate is terrorized into voting one way or another, and they don’t work if the results are not transparent and verifiable.

This sort of overly broad definition of ""democracy"" would render most elections in the entire world illegitimate, especially the part about ""terrorized into voting one way or another.""  That point aside, citation that people were being terrified into voting for Ahmadinejad on a wide scale prior to the election?

&gt;Whether he won the popular vote or not (we will never know) any claim to legitimacy he had was completely undermined by his actions.

So basically any elected leader has their election voided by doing bad things.  ",0,,1280971074,False,t3_cxe0t,t1_c0vzjvz,t5_2qh13,,1426408837,worldnews,

Okay, maybe not Wedding... Wedding sucks.  

Although you may not be very interested in WWII, this city forces you to confront its history.  The destruction is *still* evident and you can sense the different moods/periods/ideologies which existed in this city; just spend a few moments to comprehend this while you're there.

Visit the many parks in the city, as it's easily one of the greenest cities of its size in Europe.  Naturally, there's Tiergarten, but every district has at least 3-4 wonderful parks nearby; rent a bike, it's worth it.

Visit a Sunday fleamarket; Mauerpark in P-berg (U2 Senefelderplatz) is a good choice.

Of course, there are many museums and exhibitions here, but I'll let you read the other comments, as they have pretty much given all the information you'll need.

Nightlife:  Yeah, Berghain, Tresor, Watergate (I would go here just to see the hypnotic pulsating light wall of awesome) etc., but there are many smaller clubs with cheaper entry, and arguably better music.  Just ask around.

Jazz clubs: B Flat's probably the nicest (Rosenthaler Platz), but A Trane (Savignyplatz) and Aufsturz (Oranienburger Str.) play more free jazz, if that's your thing.


Considering your interest in older German history, I would suggest:  

Koeln:  Seriously, it's worth the trip just for the cathedral.  If you can, visit Aachen, and perhaps Duesseldorf and Museum Insel Hombroich in Neuss (Contemporary art &amp; architecture) while you're in Nordrhein-Westfalen.

If I were an Israeli I too would be concerned with Iran's support for Hamas and Hezbollah but that in itself doesn't make Iran the threat.  Hamas and Hezbollah are the threat.  If they go away, or the differences with them are resolved, Iranian regional influence goes away.  As it is Iran has stated that it would respect any Palestinian-Israeli resolution if Palestinians are allowed a democratic referendum on it.  Israel sowed the field from which Hezbullah and Hamas rose up; it is more than capable of salting the same field by working properly towards peace and accepting the Arab Peace initiative which would have the Arab world recognise Israel.

There is no evidence of Iran actively seeking nuclear weapons.  None.  I know it's a talking point amongst anchors and political commentators and it is taken as a given but going to the source, the IAEA, tells a much different story.

Ahmadinejad is now well into his second term.  Iran's constitution has a two consecutive term limit.  There's nothing stopping Ahmadinejad from running for President again, he just can't do it next time.  He has to stand down. So not only is the Ahmadinejad problem not so much a problem in that respect - the Iranian president has no say in declaring  or committing acts of war: it's the Supreme Leader that that falls to.   Israel can afford to ignore Ahmadinejad.  His words might as well be written in the wind or carved into running water.  Whilst he has been wrongly attributed with saying some stuff his rhetoric has been controversial in the past but  Israel can afford to take Ahmadinejad's rhetoric with a silo of salt.

&gt;**As a signatory of the NPT, the Iran has obliged itself to a degree of nuclear transparency.**

This is a rather interesting point.  Iran is a signatory of the NPT but not the voluntary additional protocols.  As a signatory of the NPT Iran is legally afforded the right to pursue nuclear technology.  It is also obligated to allow inspectors in.  This they've done.  What the IAEA has called for time and time again is that Iran signs the additional voluntary  protocols into Iranian law to give the inspectors more power.  The only reason why these protocols are voluntary is because that's how the US argued it.  Most of the world didn't think it was a good idea.  The IAEA certainly wanted the additional powers and 
obligations to be compulsory to signatories of the NPT, but, there it is.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional_Protocol#Additional_Protocol

Iran is in complete compliance with the NPT.  On occasion it has even afforded inspectors powers in line with the Additional Protocols without signing it into law.  So they were legally allowed to choose when or if they would withdraw this additional access.  When IAEA reports refer to needing more access or less restriction they referring to the *voluntary* Additional Protocol which was brought in in 1993.  

In October 2008, fifteen years after the Additional Protocols had been written up, of the 189 countries signatories to the NPT 88 had signed the Additional Protocols into their own law to further empower IAEA inspectors.  Not being a signatory of the Additional Protocol in no way invalidates a country's right to enrich nuclear fuel.

&gt;** the Obama administration (with support from Russia, China, Europe and Israel) made Iran a generous offer:“continue your nuclear program out in the open, with a fuel swap arrangement as a safeguard, and face no further sanctions.” Iran declined the offer,**

Well the problem that Iran had with that was that the fuel in the swap was needed to continue its nuclear energy program.  Effectively Iran would have been putting itself on a US leash, which given their history they're obviously not willing to do.  The US could have denied Iran's enriched fuel at any time.  Having said that Iran has since made a deal:

with Turkey and Brazil.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8685846.stm

Only three days ago IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano told Reuters that he had received a 'positive reaction' from the Vienna group and the IAEA for the prompt resumption of talks on the fuel swap deal.

http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-50571720100802



&gt;**without providing any evidence thats its intentions were benign.**

I don't know where you'd get such a misnomer from.  The IAEA inspectors are still present in Iran and provided with all the powers afforded to them by the NPT (if not with the voluntary additional protocols which have not been signed into Iranian law).

Furthermorethe new Director General of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, spoke out about the situation with Iran after his appointment was announced:

[*""The incoming head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday he did not see any hard evidence Iran was trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms.  'I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this.'""*](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL312024420090703)

It isn't even about that.  If it were about that, gay agitators would put up a getyourpowersofattorneyhere.com that established marriage by other means, and then agitate specifically against wicked visitor-restricting hospitals or against the IRS. The real purpose of gay marriage agitation is to make the thin edge of an anti-discrimination axe that will go on to chop to bits every wedding planner, wedding facility, wedding photographer, wedding dress fitter, etc., who weirdly prefers traditional marriage.  The real purpose of gay marriage is *spite*.  ""If you disapprove of my wedding, then by unlibertarian means you shouldn't be allowed to have anything to do with weddings - and you should probably *kill yourself*.""

c0w028a,t1_c0w028a,0,0,0,True,True,Qeraeth,0,"&gt;For one thing, how do you determine whether someone today benefited from the slavery that took place?

You seem to be asking quite a few very odd questions here. You're actually asking how slavery benefited white Americans? Aside from the free labour, the money gained from the slave trade, a race based ideology that divided lower economic classes, blunted criticism of ruling class white men, and so on?

&gt;And then at that point you have to determine why you can group all white people together.

Even lower class whites were not themselves enslaved, and after Slavery began the century of Jim Crow which did not affect even the worst off white American, who at least was understood as American full-stop and had no laws explicitly targeting him or her (at least in their position as white people. As women or workers they were targeted) while many people of colour including blacks, Mexicans, and Chinese immigrants were very often the specific targets of deep seated institutional racism.

Are you seriously asserting that it's hard for you to see how that disadvantages people of colour in relation to whites?

Slavery and segregation as well as its cultural analogues in other countries benefitted whites by ensuring people of colour did not have their interests represented, could not compete for jobs, space in schools, or other cultural resources, and provided an ideology that allowed white people (white men most especially) to feel entirely superior to others by virtue of being white, such that colonisation was justifiable and even seen as necessary (see ""The White Man's Burden"") and it continues to this day by supporting a vastly unequal socio-economic system in which people of colour remain underrepresented and disproportionately poor and marginalised, as well as convenient scapegoats for national problems, see: America's paroxysm about Mexican immigration, ACORN, and black political activists, as well as the insistent race baiting directed at Barack Obama.

&gt;Pretending that it doesn't happen is just plain ignorance. And it's real and actual.

Discrimination happens against heterosexual people? What, are you referring to gay clubs or something? Give me a break, Feuilly.

Also, what systematic discrimination do whites face that disadvantages them as a group, disempowers them, misrepresents them or underrepresents them, leaves them economically segregated or results in systematic stereotyping that leaves them without work, cruelly stereotyped in the media, and a popular scapegoat in Western politics.

You also say a lot about how US-centric I am but these problems are pretty endemic throughout the West and work in very similar ways, whether it's the treatment of Aborigines in Australia, First Nations women in Canada, Muslims in France, Turks in Germany, Muslims in Australia, various Asian immigrant groups in the UK, and so on. Your comments about my Ameri-centrism are, frankly, bizarre since many Western countries were colonial powers and benefitted immensely from white supremacist ideology that leaves toxic residue to this day.

&gt;Last time we had this discussion it was decidedly US-centric, as is the whole 'skin colour as single group' discussions ultimately are

Bad grammar aside, like I said that's pretty erasing to ethnic minorities in several western nations (you can even include Russia in this which has rather severe problems with racism, and white privilege *there* remains very much a legal and social reality as well). Where *do* you live, exactly?

So, if I'm ""trivialising"" the supposed bigotry against heterosexual people and white people it's because it's so rare and so isolated that it *is* trivial and not an endemic social problem. Put another way I'm trivialising it because you seem to be using it to suggest either that people of colour don't have it so bad or that the structural discrimination against them doesn't matter. The reason also that, as you say, 'skin colour as a single group' exists is because *that is how people are discriminated against* and thus it makes sense to identify and combat racism along those lines.

&gt;than there is between the amount of discrimination that these disadvantaged groups receive in the West and the brutal treatment that exists in developing countries.

Not only is it pretty racist to suggest that the immense inequalities faced by people of colour in the West doesn't matter compared to ""developing countries""- it's rather ironic that you hearken to nations whose impoverishment and continued exploitation are the direct result of past colonialism by European powers and the ongoing neocolonialism of Western corporations and governments (again, you may also include the USSR which, while not Western per se, exercised immense imperialist power over decolonising countries along with the US and its Western allies).

I get the distinct sense you've never *been* to an economically depressed area in London, Paris, Sydney, New York, Los Angeles, or Berlin. Nor did you seem to pay much attention to how institutional racism left New Orleans here in the US inadequately prepared for a hurricane and also ensured black communities were heavily concentrated in flood zones.

&gt;and you linked to some article that a person wrote about how seeing people of a similar skin colour in places around society was privilege. 

Peggy McIntosh said quite a few things besides, as did I. There was no ""basically it"" about it. As I recall you continued to shift your perspective from individual to national to ill defined social as suited your need to rebut anything that was said.

But can you demonstrate to me the immense and crippling discrimination suffered by heterosexual people and whites that leaves them at a marked disadvantage in society? Or the lengthy history of oppression they have which echoes in the present day?

Any incident of discrimination is wrong. But if you're asking me to put a single white person who may have in some small way been discriminated against (like say, having to eundure a ""Chinese guy"" saying he's filthy) on a level par with the vast economic inequalities in the West, the onslaught levelled at Muslims throughout the West, America's racist prison industrial complex and its racist War on Drugs, and the culture of racism that makes Fox News, the Daily Mail, the Sydney Daily Telegraph and Bild profitable, as well as the culture that gives rise to small but very active anti-immigrant parties in the West, then yes I'm going to have to say one is trivial relative to the other as a speck of dust might be when compared to The Moon.",0,,1280978421,False,t3_cwui4,t1_c0vyyrh,t5_2r2jt,,1426408981,TwoXChromosomes,

And you failed.

&gt;My point is that all of the boundaries and identifications in question have been fluid. (your previous ""point"")

And we are back to the argument shit happens. There is an old argument in America that is patently false. That Native Americans didn't understand propery rights and therefore lost their land in treaties. This is pure nonsense, as is the boundaries are fluid argument.

The inhabitants had property rights by living there. The few Jews living there had property rights as well. The problems came when European Jews displaced rightful owners of property from their lands. And it continues in Jerusalem and the settlements, today. That is the bullshit put forth by Israel while it continues to go about dispossessing Palestinians.

You can claim that borders being fluid, or Jordan claiming territory makes it right to disposess the Palestinians. You can claim that the Israelis reaped the spoils of war, which of course, the UN and international law does not support.

You can claim that Israels rights somehow by a huge magic wand supersedes Palestinian rights, and even claim you aren't making the argument you are making. All of it is circular and nonsense argument.

First you argue that Nazi's didn't confine Jews to ghettos, then you argue that the Gazans are reasonably confined. Then you argue the Muslims control Jerusalem.  If anyone is denying the Holocaust it appears to be you. You also appear to be in complete denial of the situation in Israel and Palestine.

&gt;You are working to pretend that the death camps don't matter.

Demonstrate that by ANYTHING I said. You sir, are a major Bullshit artist who makes wild claims of whole cloth without any factual support.

The last point I made is that by Israeli's not seeing their strategy in the context of history are setting themselves up for failure. A two state solution is the only solution, but Israel must give up the settlements. Israel must invest in the Palestinian state and usurp the upper hand they have given Hamas and Fatah, by making Palestinians realize they will prosper by eschewing those groups. However, it cannot be made with the phoney attempts, for show, that Israel currently makes to play to a western audience.

This is not the 1800's. Portraying the Palestinian people as terrorists while continuing to deny them equality and stealing their lands will not sell. The Palestinians out populate and will grow faster than Israeli Jews, unlike the Europeans and Native Americans. You cannot destroy them in the manner the US did.

Or its value is depreciated through inflation due to a flooding of the money supply. *THAT* is Keynesianism and *THAT* is what you're defending.
Singaporean economics are easily the best in the world, and that's because its relative economic freedom is *HIGHER* not *LOWER*. Don't you even recognize that economic freedom is directly effective on the living standards of everyone in that country?

They are intimately connected. Disadvantage comes from a lack of privilege. Conversely privilege is the ability to, by dint of group membership, to be far less likely to deal with the disadvantages that are disproportionately experienced by those who are *not* privileged.

&gt;Just because white people weren't enslaved in America doesn't mean that slavery was a universal benefit to white people.

The benefit was that their racial group was not defined by slavery and understood entirely through the lens of the ideologies that upheld it (i.e. they were understood to be civilised, not savage, and so on).

&gt;Does a bunch of black people in Africa benefiting mean that you can say that black people in Africa benefited from the slave trade? Obviously not.

Much mythic status has been ascribed to African and Arabic slave traders, as if the system of slavery instituted by colonial powers would have been impossible without them. They existed yes, but their centrality has been vastly exaggerated. Who began the slave trade? Where did it take place? For the benefit of whom and why?

The relatively small short term benefit of slavery to those Africans would be very quickly outweighed by the onslaught of imperialism.

The same cannot be said of white Europeans, who continued to find themselves exalted as superior by a long running series of cultural legitimations that grew out of a need to morally justify slavery. Such views took on a life of their own and produced a lot of the racism we see today throughout the West.

&gt;Uh, there is discrimination against white people enshrined in law. I'm not sure why you're not aware of this.

No there isn't. If you mean affirmative action, that is not discrimination against white people nor can you or anyone else demonstrate that it has produced immense social disadvantage to whites as a group (Look at who still holds power in government, big businesses, universities, the medical profession, who most college students are and so on) in the West. So no, that is not institutionalised discrimination.

&gt;Also, you're still being insanely US-centric. The whole black-white dichotomy is particularly American. Stop thinking of all Europeans as the same and belonging to the same club.

I have to ask why you keep accusing me of this when I have gone to lengths to demonstrate the transnational implications of race based systems of inequality as well as their consistency throughout the West. It does amuse me, however, that you keep saying ""US centric!"" as if this is the only nation with a black minority, or with any ethnic minority in its borders, or that there is no racism or legacy of colonialism elsewhere in the West.

Can you provide an example of how things are so vastly different in your country? (Canada?)

Also, when you say ""the whole black-white dichotomy is particularly American"" I have to disagree quite strongly with that.

A) Africa.
B) There are black minorities of significant size in several western nations including Australia, the UK, and Canada.
C) I think I made it pretty bloody clear I was not just talking about black people.

&gt;And now I've read through your post and your extreme racism and ignorance has sickened me.

What extreme racism and ignorance?

&gt;I don't like having conversations with you because your bigotry is so extreme.

You seem to be simply making unsubstantiated assertions about my beliefs. How have I been ""extremely bigoted""? I find the charge a little laughable, really. I did ask you for specific examples and you've furnished none, while I've given a very long litany of examples from around the world to support my argument and your continued bizarre assertion that I'm being American-centric.

&gt;Everyone has problems fitting in. Pretending that people don't is not only ignorant but also offensive.

""Having problems fitting in"" is not the same as being the victim of institutional or systemic bias and bigotry. An immigrant can have problems 'fitting in' due to any number of things but *also* has to deal with the specific disadvantages that come with being the target of anti-immigrant sentiment.

So really most of your post has not made any significant point and you instead attack me as a bigot without substantiating anything or answering any specific questions. And you're calling me a bigot after actually asking me ""how did white people benefit from slavery?"" which was quite the howler.

Finally:

&gt;White people are not a monolithic group, and I suggest you learn a bit about that

No, they are not. But white privilege and the disadvantages it gives rise to do, nevertheless, exist and have widespread cultural impacts. Secondly it does **not** mean the following things:

* That white people never suffer or have bad things happen to them.
* That all whites are equally socially advantaged (some may belong to other marginalised groups like the working class, immigrant groups, religious minorities, be persons with disabilities, be transgender, be gay/queer, etc. But it is not their *whiteness* that gives them disadvantages in those instances and even then hierarchies will form. For example it's far more likely that trans women of colour will be forced into sex work as opposed to white trans women.)
* That whites are all guilty of terrible crimes and need to be punished.
* That one cannot be irrationally biased against whites.

Discussions of privilege mean *none* of those things. What you have been imputing to me seems to be a projection of your own fears, and an excuse to not consider what is being said.

We are not talking about America. So I will make my point again so you can stop with the straw: every single country in the Middle East had one or more boundary changes in the 20th century. That is not ""shit happens"", that is ""none of those boundaries are set in stone"". Instead of responding to what I say you make shit up and change the subject.

&gt;The problems came when European Jews displaced rightful owners of property from their lands.

You mean those bad Jews got the right to purchase land and that is evil. And so it was good for the Arabs to turn to violence and destroy 2,500 year old Jewish communities. 

&gt;You can claim that borders being fluid, or Jordan claiming territory makes it right to disposess the Palestinians.

No, I don't. You really need to stop making things up.

&gt;First you argue that Nazi's didn't confine Jews to ghettos,

Never said that either. I said that confining people to ghettos is an old established Christian and Muslim tradition. We know of the Nazis and the Warsaw Ghetto not because the Nazis confined people there but because they either moved the people to the *death camps* or they killed them all in place. To call Gaza like the Warsaw Ghetto is to deny what made the Warsaw Ghetto significant. 

&gt;then you argue that the Gazans are reasonably confined. 

What does that mean? Have you noticed that suicide bombings in Israel are way down? Do you think Israel was wrong for stopping them? Do you oppose all national boundaries? Should Israel ignore that Hamas says they want to destroy Israel? 

&gt;Then you argue the Muslims control Jerusalem. 

What? Is English your third language or did you just fail your logic course? I said that Muslims controll*ed* Jerusalem. Got the *past* tense part? I would not have thought it was controversial to mention that, but if you need an education in the history of the area I can point you to some resources.

&gt;Demonstrate that by ANYTHING I said.

I have, I'll do it again: you keep asserting that Gaza is like the Warsaw Ghetto in some meaningful manner. Either you are claiming that there are death camps right now in Israel or you are saying they did not exist or were not significant to the Warsaw Ghetto. Which is it? 

&gt;A two state solution is the only solution, but Israel must give up the settlements.

A position I have stated many times here. But because I, unlike you, don't accuse Israel of genocide I am called a fundamentalist and a zionazi. 

&gt;This is not the 1800's. Portraying the Palestinian people as terrorists

Wow, only off by about 2 centuries. The Palestinians are today terrorists,not in the 1800's. They use weapons that are inherent war crimes to terrorize Israeli civilians. But you seem blind to that.

c0w0j8y,t1_c0w0j8y,0,1,0,True,True,Seachicken,1,"&gt;Really? This is news to me because i was under the impression that Jesus did advocate that people should stop omitting sins i.e. crimes. 

Sorry this just confused me, are you saying Jesus said that people should stop doing crime? If so, that's exactly the kind of impractical advice I am railing against. If as a politician I ran on an anti crime platform of 'wouldn't it be nice if everyone was nice,' people would rightly condemn me for not offering a useful solution to a multifaceted and difficult problem.

&gt;this also assumes that human nature is stagnant. 

There are aspects of human nature that are either fixed into our chemical make-up or are so deeply buried within our nature that speaking about rooting them out totally in our current state (both societally and in terms of access to resources) is simply absurd. Once again, I very much agree with Sagan's idea that humanity will probably need to alter itself on a genetic level to do away with certain fundamental flaws (just as an aside, but if you haven't seen it, Sagan's show Cosmos, which I have been gushing about to everyone I know for the past few months, is just a wonderful look at the potential of science and of humanity).

&gt;. Its naive to think that we would be the only ones capable of absolute peace. 

It's naive to think that anyone is (currently) capable of absolute peace... 

&gt;It's not as if all of the sudden all the ""lesser"" parts of the world would suddenly attack if we told them we wouldn't resist them

Of course they would (if not right away, then eventually). The West has tremendous wealth and prosperity, which many people in the Third world and other less affluent areas would quite literally kill to have (look at piracy). 

&gt;Saying this is out of touch with reality is true, if by reality you mean the present.

That is exactly what I mean, and it was doubly true back in Jesus' time, a period that was far more violent and less stable than today.

&gt;I might just be an optimist, but I firmly believe a day will come when the earth will be completely peaceful.

I think to 'firmly' believe it is to be out of touch with reality. Certainly, humanity has great potential, and we can hope and strive to improve ourselves, but whether we succeed in surpassing our problems before our natural resources and planetary integrity expires is still up in the air.

&gt;being pessimistic and saying ""well there's too much violence in the world and it will never change so I might as well not even try."" is absolutely benign.

When did I say that? I didn't. I am firmly of the view that humans are on an upward march, I just think we need to focus more on incremental change than on perfection.


&gt;WWII may be a popular case where we see that good clearly won out versus evil, but don't forget the massive amount of crimes that even our own country committed.

Of course, but it was clearly better by far that the Allies won than the Axis, and those who resisted German expansion were very much justified in doing so (despite Gandhi's absurd assertion that they were not).

&gt;I will stick by my belief that violence should never be used even in so called clear cut good versus evil cases. 

So you'd be happier right now if the world were under the control of two brutal and genocide regimes, if all the tremendous advancements that occurred in the wake of WWII never occurred, if almost every Jewish, Roma and other such persons were wiped off the face of the earth, if Eastern Europe and Russia were reduced to slave labour that would be worked slowly to death, if free speech in Europe was all but wiped out, if homosexuality and other 'asocial' behaviour was punished by death and if China was subjugated by the Japanese? 

&gt;The reason being is that once you justify it in some cases where do you draw the line?

The slippery slope argument? Really? Because there is no absolute morality, you'd draw the line as society has always done over the course of human history, again and again, not always getting it right but by and large improving it over time. Although our system of international relations and the use of military force is still far from perfect, we've made tremendous progress over the past few centuries. Look at the rise and development of international diplomacy in Europe from the 1600s onward, the reduction in international anarchy, the rise of structures designed to mitigate and offer alternatives to war, the crushing of secret alliances in the wake of WWII, the stability Europe now possesses compared to the constantly warring factions of the 19th century, etc. 

&gt;I'm in the minority as to what religious and religion both mean, please refer me to the definitions you use.

The commonly accepted definition of a religious text, as I'd imagine you well know, is one that was created as the result of partial or complete divine intervention. There are very, very few religious texts that do not explicitly claim to come from a god or gods. 

&gt;The new testament is very much ""about"" god and the gospels, aka the story about Jesus, and is mainly all I read, which is indeed pretty slim.

But much of the story about Jesus is Jesus directly stating things. This interpretation would mean you'd have to disregard the Sermon on the mount, and every other edict Jesus ever issued.

&gt;In fact I don't think the bible is cohesive document at all, and I don't think its holy either for that matter

But it repeatedly states that it is. If somehow one central message has been mixed up with a lot of chaff, how do you separate it out again without simply picking the bits you like? What logical basis do you have for claiming your bits are the right ones, particularly given the bible was written by followers who disagree with one another all the time, (only one says one of the two criminals on the crosses next to Jesus was saved, just as an example) and who were often writing decades after?


&gt;So you're saying that at no point in your entire life did you ever wonder if there was some sort of meaning to it all? 

Of course I wondered if there was a point when I was younger but over time I came to realise this wondering was kind of childish given the weight of evidence which suggests that the universe is empty and indifferent, and that my thoughts and feelings are simply the result of chemical reactions. Don't get me wrong,  

&gt;And what kinds of evidence would you need? 

Any evidence which stands up to even basic scientific rigour would do. Beyond emotions or feelings, what evidence do you have that allows you to believe that there is some sort of great purpose to the universe and to your life?

&gt;Since a single human life, and i mean a life itself and not what happens in it, is neither repeatable nor observable, by anyone other than the single human, then it is not subject to science. 

Of course it is subject to science (everything is subject to science, that's how it works), and of course it is repeatable and observable (we just don't have sophisticated enough tools to do so). 

&gt;This is where I believe Religion steps in.

But religion isn't really any sort of answer, it's just accepting a non answer. 'Why is this like that?' 'God did it.' 

The other problem with privileging religion in this was is that it is actually a fairly terrible way of imparting morality and information. Given that the teachings of Jesus are no where near sufficient to structure our day to day lives and how we should realistically seek to improve, if we wish for religion to play the dominant role in social interaction, we are by necessity dependant on what individuals and groups say god wishes for us to do. This dependence on humans who believe they speak for god (or claim to believe) leaves us in a tricky situation, how on earth do we tell which ones do and do not? We can't trust our own personal instincts, because everyone believes and feels differently, so we are really left with no option but to try and assess their claims from the perspective of logic. Thus, if we are dependant on logic to divine what is and is not right (or how and why things are and are not), why not cut out the middle man of religion?

You can't drink in public. By public I mean sidewalks (pavement depending on where you're from) and BART and MUNI. Which is sad.

Supermarkets are sometimes ridiculous, in the realm of choice and quality, positive and negative equally. Also you don't slap a euro in a cart (carriage) to use it and many large scale operations bag for you.

People are generally either laid back or ""busy"" in the sense that speaking with them makes you feel like you're wasting their time. Basic knowledge of your country can be an engaging topic for people who haven't traveled and many who have. You then usually talk about what you notice here and the conversation moves away from you being foreign. (that is if simulation is a goal of yours)*

You'll pick up obscure vocabulary quickly and using it makes you feel comfortable as well.

Expect ""hella""...I'll leave it at that.

Going with a local bank may be hard in San Francisco but it's the bank you would want. Better care of customers and they usually have fantastic account opening bonuses since they want your business for a long time. 

Whatever you would want as far as drugs, you'll take plenty without realizing it considering some of the food quality.

I don't know if the city of San Francisco is a must because many neighboring cities are less expensive and very fun suck as Berkley and certain parts of Oakland.

When there is a surplus of land and few people to work it it's in the producers best interest to own slaves. Under those situations and in those societies we see oppression and slavery take root. We see people dehumanized and make property or chattle. 

These days slavery wouldn't be profitable. Our economics are different. Instead we have a small amount of land and a huge number of potential workers. It makes no sense to own a person, have to take care of their shelter, food and clothing when you can pay them a menial wage and then replace them if they're sick or burnt out. 

But race plays an impact in average earnings. I'm Canadian so pardon the fact that my stats are going to shift slightly to women of colour in Canada. Aboriginal Women of colour are our lowest earning wage bracket. The whiter your skin not only the more educated you likely are but some studies have shown the ""whiter"" your name the higher the marks and the more likely you are to get called back for a job interview.  Both those studies submitted the same work, the same resume and the only difference was the name. 


Following the 1868 change to the fourteenth amendment that allowed citizen ship to Black Americans and up until 1871 conservative figures put the number of Klan murders for those years in the 20, 000's with additional tens of thousand other acts of violence being committed against people of colour.In 1871 President Ulysses S. Grant became the first president who suspended the writ of habeus corpus during peacetime and sent federal soldiers in parts of south Carolina. The Klan members brought to trial were community leaders, doctors, lawyers, politicians. And yes whites were killing people of colour before the KKK but it amplified the violence and it timed it to drive voters of colour away from using their rights.   

But by that point the message had been sent and the damage had been done. It just took the mention of a threat to scare voters away. 

It's in these roots of seeming racial superiority and power inequalities that institutional racism took seed. 

It came out of pseudo scientific ideals that were held as truth that caucasians specifically white people of European descent were biologically a different species from people of colour. That whiteness some how meant intellectual, moral and ethical superiority. 

And as a society we're still dealing with the repercussions of that. Many of them so systemic that we're not consciously aware of them with out active thought. 

When it comes to unpacking white privilege I would really heavily suggest checking out Peggy McIntosh [White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nymbp.org%2Freference%2FWhitePrivilege.pdf&amp;ei=9GdaTI35A5TksQO-2-RB&amp;usg=AFQjCNHc4ofQVRK9tZKwkqYpK_hXr1KI3w&amp;sig2=__XmxLRUHgASvesXLKdbdA). It's a really good introduction to the small ways privilege plays a role in our lives. 

If you're still having a tough time wrapping your head totally around it look at your own life. Look at an area where you deal with oppression. Be it class, be it race, be it gender, be it sexuality, be it ability level... etc.

Look at that list with your own life experience and adapt it to fit your own personal struggles. How don't you fit the social ideals that culture and media represent? How does that impact your life? Your access to services? Your resources? Your options? 

If you can make that connection try reading the list but take it from the perspective of ""How would I want someone who approached my own list to think and consider these points.""

IMHO this is highly illiberal and will not go anywhere towards ensuring that religion doesn't enter the minds of jurors, judges, witnesses, lawyers or observers.

&gt;Now excuse my ignorance, do we swear on the bible in Australia? (sorry Ive never broken a law that Ive been caught for and i grew up watching Law and Order)

You must make a choice between a solemn affirmation or a religious oath ([s 21 of the Evidence Act (Cth)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s21.html)) and you must be informed of this choice. If you refuse to make a choice you are forced to make an affirmation. ([s 23 of the Evidence Act (Cth)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s23.html)). Note that substantially similar sections exist in NSW and Victoria too.

There is no need for a religious text to be used when making an oath and, interestingly, if you take the oath there is no requirement that you believe in the particular deity you are swearing to ([s 24 of the Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s24.html)).


Whatever it is all that matters is that it binds your conscience so as to ensure you tell the truth.

&gt;when i say my Atheist pledge

You could make a non-religious, secular affirmation in [this form](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/sch1.html).

&gt;there is possibly some religious zealot on the jury that could use this to automatically judge me a heathen baby eating devil worshiper who is fanatically trying to adulterate his/her daughter...

Unlikely. If they do think that way then there's a chance they'll be excluded anyway.

&gt;the entire ""ban the burqa"" movement reeks of racism...

I respectfully disagree. It has taken a lot of anti-social behaviour on the part of too many Muslims towards Western society in general. The Netherlands for a long time favoured multiculturalism but now is finding the anti-Western backlash from many members of the Muslim community (see the Jyllands-Posten Cartoon Controversy and the butchering of Theo van Gogh!) to be too much and is quickly rejecting that world-view.

I think it is symptomatic of a kind of cultural war between western liberal values (where I stand) and Islamic values including Sharia law and compelling women to dress as they do.

While we should be able to get along Europe is finding that their Muslims can't or won't integrate, the UK is struggling, the USA is doing slightly better but the strain is still there and we are relatively untouched by those kinds of vicious fundamentalists which have damaged if not destroyed Islamic-Western relations.

I actually approach the issue from a different angle and instead ask what has happened to make liberal western democracies like Spain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium seriously consider passing laws to ban the burqa, and what does that say about the rights and wrongs of the situation?

&gt;we don't seem to have a problem with a Nun? If there a little old nun dropping off the weekly tithes to her local bank would we ask her to remove her habit?

The key difference is you can see her face and it is not imposed on her. She makes that choice of her own free will although certainly there was a time when this was not the case.

The problem with the burqa is that is appears to imprison women by shutting them out of the rest of society and it is an item of dress which they cannot freely choose not to wear for reasons of significant cultural, familial and religious pressure.",0,,1280999860,False,t3_cxiel,t1_c0w0o3n,t5_2qh8e,,1426409288,australia,

Amsterdam had a ""borrow-bike"" system years ago, and it failed because (a) everyone already had a bike, and (b) there's quite a bit of vandalism, so they all ended up in the canals.

Regarding your idea -- there was an incredible system where I went to college in Berkeley, called something silly like Subway Guitars (don't ask.)  They recycled old bikes from dumpsters, and put them into working order to sell for cheap.

&gt;A Singaporean friend and I realized that we have both had similar experiences with Westerners in Shanghai. You'll sit down and share a beer with a group of Europeans or Americans, and they'll be friendly enough; but soon you get a definite sense of being gently shunted aside.

It's not a side of myself I relish seeing, and its association with Shanghai does not help my impression of the city.

This certainly does not bear out universally; I've met plenty of awesome expats and locals alike, but I think the 'foreign douchebag ratio' may be a little higher in Shanghai just because of its reputation as a city that plays pretty fast and loose with its morals. For every laid back, intelligent expat I've met, there seem to be two or three frat bros whose main occupation seems to be bragging about how much Chinese tail they get.

In early **childhood**, I can't remember the age, I remember liking [**Roy Orbinson**'s California Blue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmuhPFHEbJo) - but maybe it was just because it was my mom's favorite song. :) 

Then when I grew up a bit, **around 10**, the first song I remember liking a lot, is [**Ace of Base** - All that She wants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjJwqDa1QVI) when it came out it was a huge hit here (I'm in Slovenia, Europe). - Then I listened to Eurodance, but I won't try to remember specific songs now.

Then, **around 12**, I met metal. The first metal song I liked was [**Sepultura**'s Roots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8OF4cZnjg).

The next thing that got me more into ""dark"" stuff was **Marilyn Manson**. I bought Antichrist Superstar, favorite song was [Man That You Fear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rthl_O4_G2o). I still kinda like it.

When I was **13**, I bought *A Deeper Kind of Slumber* by **Tiamat**. This is probably the single ***most important album of my life***. So gentle and sweet! [Teonanacatl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gbegDwCjdA) - Still one of my favorite songs.

** AGE 14 ** - Got more into metal. **Carcass** was my love and obsession! I kept listening to [Corporal Jigsore Quandary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7oGGud2Jk4) over and over and over on the headphones. :) 

** Age 15** - Favorite song I guess was the weird and fascinating [The Chaos Path by **ARCTURUS**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1opjmuiHWw)

** Age 16 ** - Goth period. Friend showed me **Sopor Aeternus** and fell in love with him/her music (transgendered artist). Here's a song: [Tales from the Inverted Womb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TulCA-UVTlg)

Started going away a bit from ""darker music"" ...

**17** was a **Pink Floyd** and **Jethro Tull** period. I adored [Too Old To Rock, Too Young To Die](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80LJTeto8MQ)

At **18** - Favorite song probably [Radiohead - No Surprises](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqsyXdj_p_I&amp;fmt=18)

**19** was a **Grateful Dead** period (my high school philosophy teacher showed them to me). Favorite song [**Althea**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQFeuAbLHro) - Still my favorite Dead song!

**20** - **Bob Dylan** period. I adore the MTV unplugged of my fav. Dylan song, *Desolation Row*.

**21** - [White Stripes - Truth Doesn't Make a Noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs-QkRaocqA) or maybe [Devotchka - We're Leaving](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWWJdEkHajk) or maybe something from Arcade Fire, I'm not sure.

**22** - Back to metal, mostly black metal. I adored **Windir**'s [Arntor, ein Windir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DtHl6F0yCE)

**23** - Short EBM period. Favorite song [**Diorama** - SYNTHESIZE ME](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOYX5vrbnhE)

**24** - A more ... Folk/pagan ""metal"" period. Favorite song the excellent [**Falkenbach** - The Ardent Awaited Land](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrIoEPeNaqQ)

**25** - Apocalyptic Neofolk / martial neofolk period. Probably favorite song is just a cute song from **Rome**. [The Secret Sons of Europe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUv3njJ3nvI)

**26** - Weird obsession with **Miyavi** - I'd never guess I'd like this music. [This song for instance - this version is best](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnPeeDrfus8&amp;fmt=18) my favorite. During this period I also loved Lady Gaga. Surprised myself.

This should be obvious in one sense - no normal male wants their genitalia reconstructed to female. Not even if they're gay.

This is particularly obvious in the case of those who are dichogamous - whose bodies change naturally, giving them a sex change. Usually from female to male, &lt;1% go the other way.

Such external changes do not change the neuro-anatomy, so they can either induce or cure transsexuality, depending on the initial situation.

&gt;Hi Zoe,

&gt;Yes, we gave our presentation to 60 plus psychiatrists from the US, AU, FR, IT, EU, UK, Holland etc.

&gt;We spoke for 2 1/2 hours on why cross gender identity was a normal inherited variation of humans. We showed how Transgender Brains think, smell, and hear like the opposite sex. We presented internationally accepted guidelines for hormonal treatment of transsexuals to be published Summer 2009.

&gt;Here are my slides and with my participants' permission I shall send you theirs. We are now in print in the APA Syllabus and soon in the APA Journal this summer. I am checking if we were recorded.

I can't comment with any degree of authority on the US, beyond what I have seen on recent visits to coastal cities and heard from friends/read online, but it appears to me that a lot of especially staple foods would not be imported, due to the enormous agricultural output of the country.  And particularly in higher-end places, I've seen a strong move toward locally produced high-quality foodstuffs in restaurants and markets as people catch on to farming techniques for things like oysters and sturgeon, and learn to make and sell good bread and cheese.

In Europe, remember that unless you're somewhere like France, with its very very broad range of agricultural production, or the Netherlands, with a strong culture of greenhouse growing, you'll almost have to have some of your food imported from somewhere else.  In its worst form, you have abominations like tomatoes being picked in country A, transported to country B to be peeled and canned, and transported to country C to be sold, sometimes even more than that.  This is the result of (a) interlinked economies, (b) highly variable costs of labor, and (c) really screwed up subsidy and tax politics -- but that's a different story.

Now, it's a question as to whether a given foodstuff is being trucked from 500km away, or from flown in from another continent.  The salmon we're eating tonight will most likely have been raised in a biological farm in Scotland or Norway and shipped down (Paris).  The steak at the great Argentine place down the road comes from, well, Argentina -- that's the whole definition.  But these are exceptions.  Widespread exceptions, but still vastly in the minority.

When the Soviet Union under Stalin promoted Lysenkoism and denounced Dawinism, i.e., when governmental leaders embraced ideas about biology and genetics based on ideology rather than the scientific process, biology and genetics research suffered greatly in the Soviet Union - see [Lamarck](http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/tag/lamarck/). Those ideas led to disastrous crop failures in the Soviet Union. 

While no one is likely to starve today because he or she is a creationist, if enough people holding that belief and rejecting evolution exist in this country, it can result in political leaders also embracing the same belief. Without a basic understanding of the underpinnings of modern genetics, the U.S. lead in many areas of biotechnology is likely to slip away.

Belief in evolution is understandably higher among the more educated populace with 74 percent of those with postgraduate degrees acknowledging its validity compared to only 21 percent of those with up to a high school level of education - see [Gallup 'Darwin's Birthday' Poll: Fewer than Four in Ten Believe in Evolution](http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/02/11/gallup-darwins-birthday-poll-fewer-than-four-in-ten-believe-in-evolution.html).

At the elementary and secondary school level, however, U.S. students do poorly when judged by standard tests of proficiency in science and math. Unfortunately, science education even today in the U.S. at the elementary and secondary school levels doesn't seem to be on a par with the educational systems in many European countries and Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea - see [Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_in_International_Mathematics_and_Science_Study). And what is even worse is that, when U.S. students are asked to gauge their knowledge levels against those of students in those other countries, the U.S. students think they are considerably more knowledgeable than those other students. Most Americans won't have any opportunity to learn about science other than what they receive at the elementary and secondary school lievels, so, I'm not expecting improvements in the general level of scientific literacy in the years ahead.

So, while you may be right that people aren't dying because of scientific illiteracy, it doesn't bode well for this country's future in a time when many jobs that can be done by people with little knowledge of science or technology have already gone overseas to countries with substantially lower wage rates, what happens when the U.S. no longer has an edge in science and technology, either?",0,,1281014064,False,t3_cwujr,t1_c0vw4c7,t5_mouw,,1426409411,science,

So I will make my point again so you can stop with the straw: every single country in the Middle East had one or more boundary changes in the 20th century. That is not ""shit happens"", that is ""none of those boundaries are set in stone"". Instead of responding to what I say you make shit up and change the subject.

I have compared the taking of land by Israel to America. So we ARE talking about America. America claimed there were only European borders in the new world. They completely ignored Native American claims. You say this is not ""shit happens"". You state that the boundaries are fluid. This is true all over the world. So is this a totally unrelated fact or a justification for taking of land by Israel? If it isn't a part of your argument, then why state a random fact? It is the argument that borders change so Israel isn't really taking land. That's a ""shit happens"" argument, and is a dumb argument. Israel is responsible for its actions. How about dealing with the consequences of your statements rather than call any interpretation ""not what I said""?

&gt;To call Gaza like the Warsaw Ghetto is to deny what made the Warsaw Ghetto significant.

No it isn't. That is your argument. They are both acts of confinement. It is confinement in poverty, and Nazi confinement wasn't limited to Warsaw. If you cannot understand confinement in a ghetto as mistreatment and somehow believe based on others doing it, justified, then you are blind to Israel's inhumanity, simply because it hasn't led to death camps. That's another dumb argument.

&gt;I said that Muslims controlled Jerusalem. Got the past  tense part?

 So your argument is that because something happened in the past Israel is justified doing it today? Another stupid argument.

&gt;I have, I'll do it again: you keep asserting that Gaza is like the Warsaw Ghetto in some meaningful manner. Either you are claiming that there are death camps right now in Israel or you are saying they did not exist or were not significant to the Warsaw Ghetto. Which is it?

Lots of modifiers you added there. I never said what you are trying to twist it into. Another phony argument. Very creative, but still phony.

&gt; A position I have stated many times here. But because I, unlike you, don't accuse Israel of genocide I am called a fundamentalist and a zionazi.

I never called you anything, except a troll, when you made snarky remarks rather than respond. While I consider Israel racist and guilty of theft of land, and policies that cause people to die, I haven't accused them of genocide. Ethnic cleansing is something closer to what their policies approach.

&gt;Wow, only off by about 2 centuries. The Palestinians are today terrorists,not in the 1800's. They use weapons that are inherent war crimes to terrorize Israeli civilians. But you seem blind to that.

One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. It's a lame term, mostly propagandist in nature. It's a tactic in which Israel engaged at it's inception. Tell me which is more terrifying small unaimed missiles or large targeted missiles? The uneven killing that Israel engages in is certainly far more terrifying than the Palestinians. I don't support either.

You missed my point about the 1800's and America's ethnic cleansing. It was largely ignored. Israel's ethnic cleansing won't be ignored.

Sword and axe clashed again and again as the fighters struggled to best each other in mortal combat. Arrows rained down on the field of battle as man, elf and dwarf fought at once to win the day. Randar took up the sword for the dwarves. With his mightiness he tried to kill Giltra of the elves, but the champion was too fast. The battle seemed endless. Roars of terror and pain were everywhere. Just then a squadron of dragons appeared, lead by Madnar the Evil. Could there be any hope?

The combatants turned to face the dragons as they landed. Madnar dismounted his towering red monster, followed by a short stranger, his eyes dark and shining. Randar stroked his beard as he observed the young warrior. He carried a sword of strange design. Giltra would not wait. She notched an arrow and fired before anyone could blink. The young swordsman knocked it out of the sky before it could reach Madnar’s chest.

“Fools,” chuckled the villain, “allow me to introduce Lord Strider. His powers are unmatched in this world. Now you see there can be no hope.”

Randar set his heels and charged, sword raised. Lord Strider struck a martial pose and set out to meet his dwarven adversary.

LOL!

&gt;Arab mistakes did not lead to the mass exodus of the Palestinians.

So they made zero mistake? Ok.  

&gt;Again, you can read Ilan Pappe's work called the Ethnic Cleanising of the Palestinians. 

Was Pappe there? No? 

Mohammed Radwan was.  He was a villager who fought back against the Jews at Deir Yassin (which I'm sure you're familiar with).

""There were no rapes. It's all lies. There were no pregnant women who were slit open. It was propaganda that ... Arabs put out so Arab armies would invade,"" he said. ""They ended up expelling people from all of Palestine on the rumor of Deir Yassin.""

Dun dun dun.

&gt;You can also check out the historical archieves in Israel

This brings up a good point. Israel has records but the Palestinians do not.  Sort of hard to say they didn't make any mistakes when they kept either no records or don't make them available to scholars in the cases they did.

&gt;I do not think a European Jew (or Russian, or American Jew) has any right to one inch of Palestine. They are more than welcome to stay if they had not been the colonizers and conquered the land.

So what about the wealthy absentee Arab landowners? They owned land there and it was farmed by the Palestinians.  When war and independence approached, they decided it was smart to sell to European Jews. 

Those particular Jews stole that land how? Explain please.

&gt;Honestly, the Americans are bitching about Mexicans illegal immigrants. Imagine if these Mexicans conquered, and ethnically cleansed certain parts of the US...

That doesn't really make sense to me. The Palestinians have far more in common with the Mexicans than anyone else.  Actually, it is kind of eerie the similarities there. 

&gt;kinda like how the Whities ethnically cleansed the Natives in North America (perhap it explains the ""special bond"" with Israel that American policy makers have with Israel)...oh well

Yeah, that analogy works fine I guess. It isn't an exact replica of what happened though. The Indians didn't broadcast lies on the radio to try and bolster support and then have it back fire by scaring their people off.

And to give the Spaniards a little credit. This was a sleazy kind of meat market sorta place. God knows why were were even there. In most places, they probably would have asked him to leave or something. 

I love the European way of life for the most part, and I respect not turning to violence so quickly. But I'll proudly wear my ""defender of the weak"" American badge. To me, it's not even really about her being a woman, it's about going after someone obviously weaker. Don't pick on the underdog. That's just despicable in my book.

c0w1jns,t1_c0w1jns,0,1,0,False,True,stoned_cat,1,"That's an interesting point, but the destruction of EVERY facility capable of making CPUs is a non-trivial affair. There are many ""fabs"" and most decent universities actually have at least rudimentary fabrication facilities. For what you're suggesting to happen, thousands (maybe tens of thousands) of facilities would have to be destroyed worldwide over a relatively short time frame (before more could be built to replace the ones initially destroyed). I think the same problem exists with the second examples. There are many factories capable of making the necessary equipment. Even if they are ""unlit"", there are things such as backup generators that can power them until the grid is back on.

Further, I'd like to point out that the second example ALREADY HAPPENED. It was called WWII, and Europe's production/electrical/water infrastructure was devastated - BUT it was possible to rebuild, because that war, massive as it was, was not massive enough to take out the entire planet's production facilities.

All these scenarios depend on some cataclysm taking out production facilities GLOBALLY, not just in 1 or 2 regions. Such an event would be an apocalypse in its own right, the destruction of our technological output would be an effect, not a cause.",0,,1281028396,False,t3_cx9fo,t1_c0vygog,t5_2qh1s,,1426409688,Economics,

including ""The health effects of the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident are widely, but not universally, agreed to be very low level.

""Somali sources close to the trade say that the dumped materials included radioactive uranium, lead, cadmium, mercury and industrial, hospital, chemical and various other toxic wastes.

HighScience speaks the truth.  Double boiler, low temperature.  The absolute best way is to do a water cure or steam cure of the bud, dry it bone dry, grind it, then add that to butter in a double boiler with a cup or so of water.  strain, then freeze.  the butter will separate from the water and gritty plant material.  double boil with a cup of water again, refreeze, and repeat this process a few more times.  you will have super potent, clean butter that doesn't taste gritty or earthy.
