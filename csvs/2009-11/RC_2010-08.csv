""Regarding the Jewish Question, the FÃ¼hrer is determined to clear the table. He warned the Jews that if they were to cause another world war, it would lead to their own destruction. Those were not empty words. Now the world war has come. The destruction of the Jews must be its necessary consequence. We cannot be sentimental about it. It is not for us to feel sympathy for the Jews. We should have sympathy rather with our own German people. If the German people have to sacrifice 160,000 victims in yet another campaign in the east, then those responsible for this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their lives.""-Joseph Goebbels

6,"&gt; The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa, or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge of the wants or feelings of the day laborer. The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe; when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, **our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation**. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. **They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body**; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability. Various have been the propositions; but my opinion is, the longer they continue in office, the better will these views be answered.

This is because the economy is walking a narrow path, on one side dangerous deflation, and on the other dangerous inflation.  Letting the tax cuts expire would be a forceful shove, but extending the status quo would buy more time and soothe the markets.  And time is key in this situation.

Importantly, nobody really knows what should be done.  The European governments are leaning towards austerity, and the USG is still in stimulus mode.  What everybody could probably agree is that forceful shoves could be disastrous.

1,"&gt;Would you support a government in which 17% of the population made laws for 100% of the population? That is essentially what the Senate is, where 17% representation constitutes a majority of the seats.

You know what I hate about people like you, who don't like the fact that the US is a perfect democracy? You're only against this when it's ""bad"" for you. I bet you think Brown vs The Board of Education is a good ruling, and yet it is exactly the minority, at that time, imposing it's views on the majority in those states. You have no problems imposing your beliefs on others, and you believe your beliefs are the right ones. Your only argument is that your beliefs are the majority, but you give no argument as to why you have the right to impose your beliefs on the minority.

And you are misrepresenting what the power of those senators actually is. They are not ""ruling"", they are preventing what they do not want to happen. That is very different from being given the power to pass whatever they wish, which is what I would say is ruling. As for their ability to block things, no, I see nothing wrong with that.

&gt;The Senate is only bad if you do not agree that individuals should not be considered more or less important by their government based on where they live. If you believe that everyone should be equal, and that someone in Wyoming should not be worth 68 times as much as someone in California, then you should be opposed to the Senate.

Bullshit. If the law, which would apply to the entire states, is so onerous to these states that they will fight so hard to block it, then it should fail. It should, then, become a state matter. They are not making it illegal for you to make it a state matter, and don't bother making the argument that the states don't have the money.

Consider the reverse, what if it was the conservatives in the majority who wanted to pass anti-abortion laws, or wanted to teach creationism in all schools. Would it not then be a good thing to have these blocks? It's called checks and balances for a fucking reason. Stop trying to change the essential way the US government works, if you don't like it get the fuck to Europe. I hear they have proportional representation there, you can have all the mob rule you want.

http://www2.travelcuts.com --a Canadian student travel site with lots of good info for young travelers.

http://www.couchsurfing.org --might save you even more money than hostels! 

http://www.slowtrav.com -- more for older people who are going to take their time and stay in one place for a while, BUT there are some great guides and trip reports. This is where I learned how to pay for parking in Italy... stuff like that! Lots of info about phones, too, as I recall. Any info you need about driving restrictions and international phone issues for most of western Europe should probably be somewhere on there. If you don't find it on the actual site, there's a good forum there too.

http://www.hihostels.com -- Hostelling International. 

http://www.raileurope.com -- pertinent info about rail passes and point-to-point tickets. 


(Sorry my suggestions here are all out of order... it's late, and I'm too tired/old/lazy to re-organize them!)

Passport--I always carry mine with me, usually in a little pocket INSIDE my clothes or pinned into one of the pockets of my jeans. Take your passport very seriously... and make sure you have emailed your passport number etc. to yourself in case it gets lost or stolen and you have to get a new one in a hurry.

Hostels--dorm beds are cheapest. Fun, too. Some hostels have huge dorm rooms; others have 4-6 person rooms. I like the smaller ones better. Just make sure there's a safe place to lock up your stuff. Private rooms are OK, but meeting people is half the fun, I think. 

Money: GET a checking account. Make sure your PIN number has the right number of digits to work in Europe. Check with your bank to see what kind of extra fees get tacked on when you withdraw cash. Don't flash money around--keep a little bit close at hand, and the rest zipped away. Oh, and before you go, let your bank know the dates of your trip--that way their fraud alert system won't automatically shut your card down when it sees that it's being used outside your usual area! 

Knife: NO. No way. PLEASE don't even think about this. Just don't travel with anything you value enough that it'll break your heart if you lose it. Documents can be replaced. Don't carry too much cash. Don't wear flashy jewelry of any kind. Have copies of all the phone numbers you'd need to call if your ATM card or passport gets stolen, or have someone at home ready to give you that info at a moment's notice. Travel smart, keep your wits about you, and don't wander down dark alleys at night! Watch out for scam artists, gypsies, and people who ""spill"" drinks or sunscreen on you and then help you ""wipe it off."" They nearly got me with that one... fortunately my wallet was pinned into my pocket. 

Travel as light as possible... they do have laundromats over there. This may sound dumb, but because I always acquire stuff during a trip, I tend to take old t-shirts/underwear along and then throw them out as I go to free up space! Less laundry to worry about, and you always get new t-shirts along the way. And you can buy new and exotic European underwear if you run out! 

Your equipment: can you make the expensive camera look any less obvious--put it in a beat-up backpack or something?? 

Itinerary: If it were me, I'd spend fewer days in Paris and hop a night train to Italy for a couple of days in Florence and/or Venice. Great places for photography, and if you take a night train you aren't wasting a travel day. You'll only get a taste of those places, but it'll make you want to come back for more! Come on... you can't go all that way and not go to Italy!!! (I know a great cheap hotel in Florence if you need one!) 

Language: At least make an effort. Greet people in their own language. Learn how to say ""I'm sorry, I don't speak X. Do you speak English?"" in various languages. Take a phrasebook. As long as you show willing, people will generally help you out. Unfortunately, I found Parisians somewhat LESS helpful in that regard than people absolutely everywhere else!

Paris: PLEASE don't miss Ste. Chapelle. PLEASE. And the Musee de Cluny, if you're into medieval stuff. And honestly, three days in the Louvre isn't necessary, unless you're one of those people who has to stare endlessly at EVERY damn painting for half an hour. Get a guide ahead of time, target the specific things you really don't want to miss, and then just wander through as your interest takes you... stop when you discover something wonderful! There's no quiz at the end. And honestly, I love the Musee d'Orsay more than the Louvre, even though it's way smaller.

Food: Find the local market and pack picnics. Cheap and wonderful. 

Usual disclaimer... your mileage may vary on all this. It's just what has worked for me in the past (many visits, starting in my teens, and most recently in my late 30s!).

&gt; While others sat in class and doodled to later become great artists, I sat in class to take notes and become a great test-taker. While others would come to class without their homework done because they were reading about an interest of theirs, I never missed an assignment. While others were creating music and writing lyrics, I decided to do extra credit, even though I never needed it. So, I wonder, why did I even want this position? Sure, I earned it, but what will come of it?

&gt; you only learned how to memorize names, places, and dates to later on forget in order to clear your mind for the next test

&gt; I have no interests because I saw every subject of study as work, and I excelled at every subject just for the purpose of excelling, not learning.

At my public (albeit not inner-city) school, the smartest kids did not fit this profile. Of course, we were busy challenging ourselves with AP courses (taught by very capable faculty) or independent studies (Pick any topic (within reason of course - ""Contemporary Gaming Culture"" or ""Analyzing The Wire"" would be approved while ""Pornography"" certainly wouldn't). Create your own class. Yes, it was great.), rather than dutifully plowing our way though ""honors"" courses. Sounds like Erica's just bitter she wasted her time. Sorry your school sucked, Erica!

As ""Pat"" said on the comments page,

&gt; You donât become a great artist by [simply] doodling in class. She likes to think that to explain away her lack of extracurricular talents. Sheâs not open to the possibility that she couldâve still been valedictorian while developing other talents. Plenty do.

Pretty much. This is why top postsecondary schools put such a large focus on extracurriculars. Anyone can simply work *really* hard and become valedictorian - moreso if your school is weaker. The valedictorian of my class was able to pursue extracurriculars and other interests. He didn't jump at every extra credit opportunity or spend hours on easy projects.

&gt;*In 1946, the total population of Palestine was 1,972,0000 inhabitants, comprising 1,247,000 Palestinians and 608,000 Jews, as well as 16,000 others. The Jewish population was composed primarily of foreign-born immigrants, originating mostly from Poland, Russia and Central Europe. Only one third of these immigrants had acquired Palestinian citizenship. With respect to land ownership, it appears from the government of Palestine's Village Statistics that the Jews then owned 1,491 square kilometers (exclusive of urban property) out of a total of 26,323 square kilometers in Palestine. **Thus, Jewish land ownership amounted to 5.6% of the total area of the country**. In contrast, the Palestinians owned the rest of Palestine, including all the areas that were categorised as public domain. Moreover, the territory allocated to the Jewish State included the coastal plain extending from Akka to Ashdod and other fertile lands, while the Palestinians, an agricultural people, were left mainly with mountainous and arid regions.*

This why all land ownership arguments are essentially garbage - despite the Zionists' best efforts, they were only able to obtain a fraction of the total land through legal means. Still, this subject crops up every once in a while and is frequently used by Zionists as a basis for their famous ""Jews owned the land"" claim to justify disposessing thousands of Palestinians of their property through terrorism.",0,,False,1280653520,t3_cw1lq,t3_cw1lq,t5_2qh13,,1426403999,,worldnews,t1_c0vpexg,c0vpexg,0,0,0,True,True,Ridiculer

They work their asses off, make boatloads of money, but they are so used to an extravagant and unsustainable lifestyle that they can't help but splurge all that money away. They've gotten so used to living _above_ their means that now that they are forced to almost live _within_ their means, it feels like they're destitute. They feel like they simply can't go on living without their two cars, fancy vacations, restaurant visits, air conditioners or whatever it is that burns up $70 000 per year. 

Do the math, paying of a $50 000 mortgage spread out over more than 20 years is not that expensive. Renting a sleep apnea machine costs nowhere near those sums of money, either.  I'd be interested to see what they're _actually_ spending their money on, but it sure as hell isn't the necessities of life.

The middle class today isn't making significantly more than the middle class was making 20 years ago. Know what? They probably won't be making significantly more in 20 years time, either. The US, and western Europe, are mature, developed economies. We can't expect our quality of life to double every generation forever. It's just not sustainable.

They are extremely practical for learning French and appropriate pronunciations, for keeping in sync with what is a very unnatural marching pace (88 paces per minute), as well as passing down the historical values and exploits of the Legion.  In short, for those in the Legion, they sum up everything it means to be a LÃ©gionnaire.  For those outside of it's walls, they have come to represent the Legion in many ways.

from the chant ""La LÃ©gion marche"", of the 2nd REP.  This line can be found on merchandise across the globe that purports to be ""Official Legion"".

I agree Turkey will strengthen the EU and garner badly needed points from the Muslim world but I think there would be great negatives too and for both the EU and Turkey.

Turkey in the Crossroads or cross hairs: A model for the middle east to follow or a set-up for additional future middle east crisis? In the 1920s, with the Ottoman Empire in ruins, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk imposed Western laws, replaced Arabic script with the Latin alphabet, banned Islamic dress and granted women the right to vote.

The ruling party, however, has supported religious schools and tried to lift the ban on Islamic head scarves in public offices and schools. Secularists are also uncomfortable with the idea of Gul's wife, Hayrunisa, being in the presidential palace because she wears the traditional Muslim head scarf.''We don't want a covered woman in Ataturk's presidential palace,'' said Ayse Bari, a 67-year-old housewife. ''We want civilized, modern people there.''

With the Religious fervor having been awoken in my mind largely by Bush's attack on Iraq and our intrusion into middle east politics wherever we can and the ever growing call for a return to Islamic values in the middle east and in the entire Islamic world I find it spectacular that Turkey believes it can go its own way and be allowed to be secular and hopefully become a member of the EU.

US is a rollar coaster. Thailand may be a good bet as it's suffering due to the recent unrest, but I feel the baht is too strong so any gains could be offset by exchange rate losses. I don't know enough about Europe to invest there.

Long term I'd say Indonesia and the China domestic market. Korea looks positive to me, at least I'm impressed by what the folks at Samsung, LG, Hyundai, and others are doing these days in terms of products. 

There are some real estate opportunities. For example in Thailand people put down lots of money to buy units off plan but they don't have the cash to actually purchase the unit- so they need to sell their units to recoup as much as possible from the deposits they've put down.

To give you an example, I know of one building where owners paid 30% of the purchase price in anticipation of prices increasing when the building was completed. Now folks are willing to sell at a discount- meaning they will lose a portion of that money just to get out of the deal (and not lose all of it). 

So units are selling below the original cost- but I still feel in many of these buildings that the current sale price doesn't reflect a good investment over the next few years. It could take 5 years for prices to rebound to where they were before (not where people expected them to be) and in the meantime rental yields are low and it's difficult to find tenants.

Investors are human beings and by the way by your logic since there are countries in Western Europe with low taxes the countries in Western Europe with high taxes those countries with high taxes should be dirt poor by now, especially with the close proximity and small size of European countries.  Oh that's right your arguments don't require evidence do they?  Just simplistic thought experiments is enough?

Dubai has extremely low tax rates so why doesn't the world's businessmen gravitate to Dubai?  It couldn't be that the situation is much more complicated than you make it out to be and your argument ""lower taxes or the rich will flee"" has little to no merit?

2,"There's no double standard. You are just assuming that the entire reddit readership is American, or aligned with American military interests, and would have a huge problem with the danger of American paid moles being outed.

This is not true. There is a large European contribution here, not to mention other parts of the world. Some of them believe that US actions in Afghanistan at this point, after many years of occupation, are unjust. They think that these moles and informers are prolonging an occupation that leads to more civilian casualties every day. They probably don't think that the life of a US paid informer is worth a lot more than the lives of the hundreds of Afghan civilians who die every month as collateral damage. At least with this Wikileaks thing they have fair warning that if their identities have been compromised, now might be a good time to get out of circulation before the Taliban identify them. The Taliban are an incompetent bunch so it will probably take them time.

I think the sentiment on part of these redditors is mostly that the idea of suppressing the misdeeds of occupation forces indefinitely, for fear that revealing them might compromise a few informants, is bad. It simply assumes that the lives of brown people are inherently cheap, and they are only made worthwhile to the point they cooperate with the occupying forces.

 ''Finnish criminal policy is exceptionally expert-oriented,'' said Tapio Lappi-Seppala, director of the National Research Institute of Legal Policy. ''We believe in the moral-creating and value-shaping effect of punishment instead of punishment as retribution.''

He asserted that over the last two decades, more than 40,000 Finns had been spared prison, $20 million in costs had been saved, and the crime rate had gone down to relatively low Scandinavian levels.

Mr. Salminen, the prison service director, pulled out a piece of paper and drew three horizontal lines. ''This first level is self-control, the second is social control and the third is officer control. In Finland,'' he explained, ''we try to intervene at this first level so people won't get to the other two.''

The men and women who work in the prisons also back the softer approach. ''There are officers who were here 20 and 30 years ago, and they say it was much tougher to work then, with more people trying to escape and more prison violence,'' said Kaisa Tammi-Moilanen, 32, governor of the open ward at Hameenlinna.

She conceded that there were people who took advantage of the leniency. Risto Nikunen, 41, a grizzled drifter who has never held a job and has been in prison 11 times, was asked outside his drug rehabilitation unit if he might be one of them. ''Well,'' he shrugged, ''many people do come to prison to take a break and try to get better again.''

Prison officials can give up to 20 days solitary confinement to inmates as punishment for infractions like fighting or possessing drugs, though the usual term is from three to five days. Mr. Aaltonen said he tried to avoid even that by first talking out the problem with the offending inmate.

Finnish courts mete out four general punishments -- a fine, a conditional sentence, which amounts to probation, community service and an unconditional sentence. Even this last category is made less harsh by a practice of letting prisoners out after only half their term is served. Like the rest of the countries of the European Union, Finland has no death penalty.

According to the Ministry of Justice in Helsinki, there are a little more than 2,700 prisoners in Finland, a country of 5.2 million people, or 52 for every 100,000 inhabitants. Ministry figures show the comparable rate is 702 per 100,000 in the United States, 664 in Russia and 131 in Portugal, the highest in the European Union.

Finland's chief worry now is the rise in drug-related crimes that do result in prison sentences and the growing number of Russians and Estonians, who Mr. Lappi-Seppala said were introducing organized-crime activities into Finland.

Finns credit their press and their politicians with keeping the law-and- order debate civil and not strident. ''Our newspapers are not full of sex and crime,'' Mr. Salminen said. ''And there is no pressure on me to get tough on criminals from populist-issue politicians like there would be in a lot of other countries.''

One reason why the Finnish public may tolerate their policy of limited punishment is that victims receive compensation payments from the government. Mrs. Tammi-Moilanen was asked if this was enough to keep them from getting angry over the system of gentle justice.

''My feeling is that victims wouldn't feel that justice is better done by giving very severe punishment,'' she said. ''We don't believe in an eye for an eye, we are a bit more civilized than that, I hope.''

Mr. Syvajarvi, a muscular 21-year-old with close-cropped hair who become a heroin addict at age 14, received a six-year sentence for drug selling and assaults. As a young offender, he will serve only a third of that time, and he is expected to be out in a year.

He is now the appointed ''big brother'' peer counselor to other youths in the jail, must submit to random drug checks to make sure he remains off the habit and has undergone training with anger management specialists that he says has prepared him to rejoin society with a new outlook.

''Before, I wanted to be like those drug dealers in the States,'' he said, adding in English, ''I was a gangster wannabe.'' He went into a boxer's crouch and popped punches in the air. ''I used to think the most important thing was to stand up for yourself.

''Now I've learned that it takes more courage to run away.''

2,"Will try not to be repetitive â I'm 18 too, but have travelled extensively around Europe (although I'm Canadian). 

**GENERAL PLAN**: sounds good. Don't try to see all of Europe in one trip; spend a week or so in a few places so you can actually get to know a few places. Some people say to avoid big cities and go to small places, but honestly, Paris/London/etc. are worth seeing and if this is your first time, it's not a bad plan! Also, a bit easier. So go for it.

**LODGING**: Hostels are the way to go. You get to meet other young people who are also travelling cheap, and it's cheap. Check out HIHostels too; major international organization of hostels. Expect to pay $30-40/night for lodging in a dormitory (i.e. in a room with 4-6 bunk beds). It's going to cost you quite a bit more ($60-80) if you want a room with just you and your friend. Some hostels offer free breakfasts; most don't offer food. Some have public kitchens. 

**FOOD**: Sample the local cuisine, but mostly get to know the supermarkets and learn to make a good sandwich and picnic. So many travellers think they have to eat out 3 meals a day, when you can EASILY make at least 2/day yourselves for 1/3 of the price. 

**TRAINS**: You want a **[Eurail](http://www.eurail.com/)** pass, my friend. Take the Eurostar (not covered by Eurail) from London (dozens of departures a day from St. Pancras station) to Paris, and then go from there. 

**LANGUAGE**: In general, it's good to greet people in the local language â you can learn hello! â and people generally recognize very quickly that English is your first language and switch if they're able. It's polite to at least say ""bonjour"" though. 

**THEFT**: Yes there's theft. If you leave your camera somewhere, even for a second, it will probably be stolen, so don't do that. Try to bring as little as possible that you don't mind having stolen. It'll make this easier.

**CLOTHES**: 3-4 days is about right. You'll be washing in sinks and hanging on the end of your bed to dry; don't bring anything glamourous. 

**CELL**: Honestly, I'd advise against it. You'll find loads of internet cafÃ©s with Skype, and lots of places where you can make long-distance calls. And there are public phones. DO NOT BRING YOUR iPHONE.

**MONEY**: Do not exchange at the airport! Talk to your bank but you're probably best just taking out a few thousand dollars and exchanging it into euros and pounds and just, you know, hiding it somewhere.

91,"Well...

This isn't my favorite topic, but here comes (je vais te faire Ã§a en anglais):

I drove West from Rimouski toward ... West in 2005.  I packed all my french canadian crap in my french canadian car and drove West, toward new lands and in the turf of our English ""neighbors"".  

I never came back

...except for Christmas or for a week during summer.  It's always been very clear that I would never move back East to live in the French Canadian Lands of my ancestors.

I've been in Victoria, BC, for the last 5 years.  I have never, EVER experienced any sort of racism or language related insults (that I didn't ask for).  I currently live with a nice girl from BC, got lots of english only (only!) friends and I've been happily living the west coast lifestyle.  I intend to raise kids with my english buddies, with my english wifey (unless shit happen...shit sometimes happen, but it's called life) in my overpriced west coast house on the side of a lake surrounded by massive trees.

I have so many thing to say about this topic it's overwhelming a bit. 

In Banff I hung out with my first ""real"" canadian for a week. He was from Peterborough, born in Columbia, brought west in about the same circumstances than me.  I practiced my somewhat rusty english, he half-understood what I said, we drank beer, hung out with lots of other peep, Australians, Kiwis, Canadians, Americans, Europeans, Russians, all sorts of weirdos and partimongers.  Same thing in Whistler.

I hung out with a ""french canadian only"" downtown Victoria BC, for a while.   He was from the other 50% of french canadians; he HATED english people.  HATED them.   He was such a stupid biggot that he was even mean to Australians, British and anybody else who spoke english.  He felt segregated, hated, stressed, he was getting pissed off at the whole Canada for not being bilingual, using the fact that he cannot get around in french in a ""so called"" bilingual country, and preached Quebec's independence openly. 

He left BC bitter, hated his experience and was more independentist than ever.  That guy helped me realize how badly annoying bigotry could be, so I stayed, and now live here.

Canadians are exactly like us, and like us, they are all different, from different cities and towns, from different provinces, from different neighborhoods, from different administrative regions.  They have all been raised differently, preached their religion differently and none of that variety of Canadian seem to have figured out that onions rings are awesome dipped in honey.

They like smoked meat and poutine but it's strangely hard to find and always overpriced.

They have the same odds of understanding  [Isabelle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Yu19b3aSY#t=1m40s) that you have of understanding an hybrid of [Pure Pwnage and Yahtzee Croshaw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VAhzPcZ-s&amp;feature=related)

The medias from QuÃ©bec sucks, like all corporate medias.  They are driven by corporations, for investors.  They exploit ignorance in order to make some cash.  They exploit the craze around concepts they bought from somewhere else, like in any ""country"" or ""province"".  What suck about Quebec's medias is their isolation from the rest of the world;  In order to guarantee a certain percentage of French content, they restrain coverage of ""outside of Quebec"" news and events.  They isolate.  Proof?  Try to name some the greatest canadian artists.  The same exercise could be done in the other way and I know my Canadian buddies wouldn't even be able to name one of Quebec's great artists, aside from Mitsou (go figure...).

Quebec's a real canadian province, as Ontario, BC, or IPE (see what I did there??)
We are all different, from province to province, region to region, city to city.

Perhaps you are unaware of the changes in Europe over the last 10-15 years? The EU's member states share a common currency (and with it a [common central bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank) that sets monetary policy for the entire Union). There are free factor (labor, capital) and trade (goods, services) movements [as stipulated by EU law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_%28European_Union%29). They share common regulatory structures, tax structures, and financial accounting requirements. They operate under a common legal system that is founded on a [Charter of Fundamental Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union). There are stipulations in EU law that put limits on fiscal actions by member states. This last one is fairly loosely enforced as we saw in Greece, but that brings us to the next point that you mentioned here:

&gt;Sovereigns have their own budgets, **debts**, trade balances etc.

The latest time that any trait could possibly have evolved and spread among all human would be at the time of the most recent common ancestor of all humans.

1,"&gt;You still didn't say how that is oppressive. Answer the question.

I did. The minority is better representative than the majority.

&gt;All judges are appointed by the executive branch. The POTUS selects from the top legal minds in the country. The Supreme Court justices are extremelyu qualified.

Which is... not at all like what I described. Unless the Supreme Court justices are selected on a per case basis, and by 'appointed by the executive branch' you mean agreed upon by the plaintiff/prosecution and defendant, and the justices don't actually decide cases.

If that's what you meant, then yes, that's exactly like what I described, but I don't think that's how it works.

&gt;You mean like the government we have now?

No. We have a Senate and a President, further, the house is relatively low resolution. A legislature with 1 representative per 1000-10000 people would be appropriate.

&gt;I don't know where you get the idea that since the voting doesnt go People -&gt; POTUS, that the POTUS isn't responsive to the will of the people.

Because the structure allows a small ruling party to control the election. Anyone can run for president, but unless they have received the support of one of two conservative political parties, they will never win an electoral vote.

&gt;Negligible is when the minority is so small that the majority can get something to work through this system. That's what it is in practice.

No it is not. Right now it is perfectly possible to move something through the system with less than majority support. It's possible to move something through the senate with 17% representation, through the house with less than 50% representation, and it's possible to elect a president with less than 50% popular vote.

&gt;Your own example is not a 'pure' democracy.

So? I'm not necessarily suggesting a pure democracy. It is a lot closer than the US is, though, and it functions fine.

&gt;About 8 million people in Switzerland, to about 300 Million people in the US. Pure democracies don't scale well.

The EU also operates just fine with a parliamentary system, and a virtually unicameral legislature.

&gt;Pure democracies don't scale well.

7,"Yes, I would move to the United States. I like people who actually love their country and aren't sad little pacifists who believe everyone in the world is out there to play nice (and so, as a result, neglect their military and expect the United States to be there for them at every call). Regardless of whether or not you agree with my assessment of most other countries, I love patriotism and the sense of belonging patriotism brings me. I used to live in the US; I don't anymore, and miss the Pledge of Allegiance and the American flags flapping about.

America just seems so powerful, and has such a rich and wonderful history. I enjoy how important the Constitution is in American life, and all the basic, traditional values that grew out of the American Revolution, inspired by classical history. Despite what the self-loathers would like to believe, America truly is the final bastion of freedom. It's the only place where Freedom of Speech is upheld so strongly by the judiciary, and where the notions of personal responsibility and individualism still thrive. 

America leads the world in innovation and is home to the world's most prominent intellectuals and scholars. Great technology, work, advancements, thought and culture have come out of the country, and it is all a result of America's emphasis on individualism and belief in a greater good through individuals pursuing their own goals. Americans are the most suspicious of their government, and don't need a government bureaucrat to give them a shove in order to start something. A lot of phenomenal but controversial work has come out of America, questioning the basis of what we know and the poorly inherited conventional wisdom of the day, without fearing charges like hate-speech or subversion.

Americans aren't afraid to flaunt the uniqueness of their nation and assert the importance and achievements of their country. In America, it seems like ethnic diversity creates and stronger overarching culture, whereas in others, people are afraid of ""offending any sort of minority,"" and create such a weak, pushover-like and victimized attitude towards other races. Americans are still, in general, the most conservative people left in the world who maintain the strongest faith in republican virtue and civic duty. I hate to see America become Europeanized; I believe it undermines what made America great and kept America special.

Call me a conservative, because I am.

So after 2000 years of living in Europe they were still 'pure blood'. This is just plain denial. It's like saying most people are still African because their ancestors moved out of africa 10,000 years ago. A german Jew in 1945 was definitely not middle eastern, no matter that his ancestors 2000 years ago lived there. 

I can understand the emotional attachment Zionists have to 'that' land, but claiming that they were still middle eastern people after 2000 years of intermingling and living in other continents is a bit much, unless you think they maintained some heterogeneous level of racial purity.

In any case, they imbibed european culture, like I said. A friend of mine is an Australian Jew, but he's definitely Australian, and being Jewish is one part of his identity, even though he's now a practicing buddhist.

As a rule of thumb i try to avoid large crowded campings, typically those with bars and groups of drinking teenager folk, because those often stay noisy through the night. But even on most of those popular campings you can find some relatively quiet spot as long as you don't need the electricity units.

The camping public in Europe is quite diverse, different social backgrounds, lots of wealthy middle class households too. Most people are genuinely interested, asking where we are coming from, where we are heading. Partly it's because of the bikes we ride (low racer recumbents), for most people it's their first opportunity to take a closer look and ask how they ride. The funniest experience was in a remote village somewhere in France where upon our arrival the whole camping crowd came out and encircled us, examining the gear and firing questions about everything.

The situation is absolutely horrible.

In Middle/Western Europe you can drink the ground-water or the water coming directly from wells or rivers in the mountains. It gets stored in VERY large reservoirs and doesn't need to be processed. It's prefect.
In regions were you don't have these benefits, the water will be cleaned, filtered and a little bit mineralized before distribution. Only in high-demand regions in high-consumption times of the year you will smell a light portion of chlorine as there is no time to process it differently. 

With our current developement it's horrible that people still don't get perfect drinking water. I can't believe that people wouldn't pay 5 cents more of their money per cubic litre just so it's filtered and isn't poisoned with chemicals to fight the bacteria.

tl;dr: Of course you drink a bit of chlorine if that's what you get instead of getting sick BUT I don't understand why we don't have gigantic water processing plants for drinking water in at least every industrial country.

22,"I hate it when people write long blocks of text and get upvoted because they sound knowledgeable, yet they keep repeating the myths that have been propagated by one side of the conflict because they are part of the west (the Jews) and naturally are the ones we hear because they are dominant within the western discourse. We rarely hear the other side. 

Here is a more objective and balanced view of what happened (very concise of course):

1. Britain allowed Jewish immigration into Palestine and promised the Jews a state there. Britain had no right to colonize Palestine with Jews or to promise Jews a state there more than the US has the right to promise mormons a Mormon State in Iraq. 

2. Even with mass Jewish immigration, Jews were only about one third of the population in 1948. That means that in order to create a Jewish state, it was necessary to expel the natives. 

3. As it happened everywhere where colonialists settled in large numbers, friction with the natives led to violence. 

4. The Jewish state was formed through an act of what we know today as ""ethnic cleansing"", a crime against humanity according to international law. This is discussed widely and the entire myth of ""arabs tried to throw the Jews into the sea"" is brought down in **the great book by Israeli historian Ilan Pappe The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine**. What the book explains in excruciating detail is how the act of ethnic cleansing began long before Israel's declaration of independence and Arab states invasion. Jewish forces simply went from village to village and committed many massacres, causing the Palestinian population (which was mostly rural and unorganized) to flee (just like in recent history Milosovich did in Serbia). 

5. The Arabs states sent (insufficient) forces under pressure from their own populace to help the Palestinians who were being ethnically cleansed (thus the myth was born of Arab states trying to throw Jews into the sea)

6. The UN's partition plan would be equivalent of the UN calling to split France between the French and the Muslim immigrants in France who immigrated in the last 50 years. That was understandably opposed by the Palestinians. Would you split your country with recent immigrants, which is what the Jews were in Palestine? Of course the UN decision was motivated by the Holocaust and sympathy for Jews but it came on the expense of Palestinians. 

7. The Jews were widely connected within the west (including the Soviet Union) which ensured them both political and military support in the form of arms sales, they were more organized and had superior fighting forces. Both the British, the Jews and the Palestinians knew what would happen once the Brits would leave Palestine. At the end of the day, (the newly formed) Israel occupied 78% of Palestine and has expelled 80% of the natives in an act of **ethnic cleansing**.

8. One of the basic charters of the Geneva Convention is the right of return of refugees to their homes. In 1949 the UN published UN Resolution 194, calling on Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees ti return to their homes (at the time around one million people). To this day that resolution has been ignored by Israel (like many others), obviously due to Israel's desire to keep its Jewish character and majority - a majority that was obtained by expelling the Palestinian non-Jewish population and not allowing them to return. 

So yes, it is not black and white and every situation has complexities but if you keep in mind that the Jewish settlement in Palestine is a European colonial project (objectively, if you take out religious beliefs), then things become clearer since it is not the first time that a colonial project has displaced the native population.

--- EDIT ---

&gt;5.1 million has been the conservative estimate on Jewish deaths for a while now

*Possibly* if you count deaths due to illness in camps etc., but my point is that it is *very* often misrepresented as **6 MILLION DELIBERATE AND SYSTEMATIC KILLINGS**, which is simply not the case. I again point to the use of diesel exhuast from captured tanks, which is a frankly a stupid and inefficient way to gas large amounts of people, and *certainly* not systematic and well-planned. [The use of Zyklon is also very questionable](http://www.nazigassings.com/zyklondelousing.html). The ""death camps"" were in fact much closer to prison camps. Did people die? Yes, but mostly due to sickness etc., not a grand Nazi genocide.

Any modern ""estimate"" of Jewish deaths is not to be trusted, since no meaningful investigation is allowed. In some countries holocaust ""denier"" can even be arrested. Any contrarian views on the holocaust are very forcefully marginalized and repressed.

A few things to ponder:

* Why were prisoners in ""death camps"" given uniforms?

* Why did Auchwitz have an infirmary?

* Why were their Jewish soldier in the German military?

* Why has there been no forensic analysis of the camps? Where is the actual evidence? [Misrepresented, captioned for doctored photos](http://www.germarrudolf.com/work/dth/fndgcffor.html)

* From analysis of Israel's own statistic, [27 million Jews survived the holocuast](http://www.giwersworld.org/holo3/holo-survivors.phtml)!

3,"I hate it when people write long blocks of text and get upvoted because they sound knowledgeable, yet they keep repeating the myths that have been propagated by one side of the conflict because they are part of the Middle East (the Muslims and Arabs) and naturally are the ones we hear because they are dominant within the liberal discourse. We rarely hear the other side.

1. [Palestine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine#After_the_War) was a British colony after the Ottomans lost the war. Britain could do whatever they want to it.
2. The [immigration was still in the process of happening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah#Early_statehood_.281948.E2.80.931950.29) when Israel was established. The borders were defined based on predicted demographics.
3. The first spats of violence was when Palestinian gangs [murdered 20 people in Hebron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) and 20 in [Safed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Safed_massacre). Actually, [anti-Semetic violence was pretty commonplace](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kinglake/alexander_william/eothen/chapter26.html) even before Zionism. That's why there were so few Jews in Palestine.
4. Israel was formed by consensus of the UN. I suggest reading the excellent book by journalists Larry Collins and Dominique LaPierre, [**Oh, Jerusalem**](http://www.amazon.com/O-Jerusalem-Larry-Collins/dp/0671662414) based on their personal interviews and eyewitness testimony. The book explains how the pre-Zionist Jewish population lived in forts such as [Meah Shearim](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/jerott.html) due to random, wanton antisemetic violence. And how the violence against the Palestinian population was done *exclusively* by unpopular Zionist terror groups who fought with the Hagganah almost as much as they fought the Palestinians.
5. The [Arab forces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#Intervention_by_Arab_League_countries) sent their troops to grab as much land as possible before an independent state can be established in Palestine. They were only successful in preventing the establishment of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel still defeated them.
6. The UN [partition plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) would be the equivalent of the US splitting Florida into two independent countries, The Democratic Republic of Florida and The Hispanic Republic of Florida.
7. The Jews were widely connected within the west (including, briefly until 1955, the Soviet Union) which ensured them both political and military support in the form of arms sales, they were more organized and had superior fighting forces. Both the British, the Jews and the Palestinians knew what would happen once the Brits would leave Palestine. At the end of the day, (the newly formed) [the Palestinians attacked as soon as they had the chance.](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf4.html)
8. One of the basic charters of the Geneva Convention is the right of return of refugees to their homes. In 1949 the UN published UN Resolution 194, calling on Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes (at the time around one million people). [To this day those refugees are granted special status by the UN,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugee#UNRWA_definition) unlike any other refugee group in the world, to retain the status of ""refugee"" until some undetermined time or event.

So yes, it is not black and white and every situation has complexities but if you keep in mind that the Jewish land of Israel is a European refugee/safe haven project (objectively, if you take out religious beliefs, like [70% of Israelis do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_atheism)), then things become clearer since it is not the first time that refugees are denied basic rights and have the tables turned on them as soon as they regain a foothold.",0,,False,1280760451,t3_cwd7v,t1_c0vryub,t5_2cneq,,1426405249,,politics,t1_c0vs3e6,c0vs3e6,0,3,0,True,True,Yserbius
5,"If there is more complexity, then tell me what it is.

The argument that there are Israeli-Arabs is as meaningful as denying the holocaust based on the fact that there are Jews in Europe.

Put simply: Ethnic cleansing is the use of conflict to remove people of another ethnicity from their homes by violence or by flight, and preventing them from returning.

Any more complex definition still comes back to this elemental truth. There are no overriding concerns like ""but what about our security"" or ""but we won the war so we get to keep the land"" that suddenly mean its not ethnic cleansing.

I'm also amazed at how people somehow think this is not so. Israelis are well aware of this.. several of their (later) prime-minister take pride in having participated in this. Almost every Jew will say they can not return because there will be too many Arabs then. 

It's only the Israel white-knights on Reddit that hold the bizarre opinion this somehow did not happen. The only prominent Israeli I know of that held such opinions was Golda Meir who claimed there was no-one living there when they arrived.

Why don't you understand how salary caps work, or how buyouts work before asking such questions? Especially when it's so easy with the existence of sites like [capgeek.com](http://capgeek.com)...

But I will explain it for you:

Huet will be playing in the AHL or Europe no matter what.  A buyout would cost too much against the salary cap.  The cap problems exist even WITHOUT Huet's contract on the books.  Even with Huet gone, the Blackhawks cannot afford Niemi at $2.75MM without making more moves.

$2.75MM is not worth it because it puts the Blackhawks in a position of having to move yet another player (maybe Sharp) if they want to keep Niemi.

Furthermore, if they kept him at $2.75MM, he'd still be an unrestricted free agent for 2011-12, at which point he'd be due another raise alongside Seabrook and Brouwer - both due big raises.  Something has to give - who are we going to lose?  It's either Sharp or Niemi now, or Seabrook and/or Brouwer and/or Niemi later.

Finally, Niemi was just not that amazing.  He was good, but he was not amazing.  He had the benefit of a D that finally became more responsible in its own end in the playoffs and cleared rebounds - his rebound control is downright BAD despite his athleticism and other good qualities.  He's not an all-star goaltender.

Your claim that Israel didn't get most of the fertile land in the partition plan is false. They may have got the negev but they also got most of the fertile lands on the coast and in the north. 

&gt;Secondly, for years coming up to the 67' war hundreds of missiles and artillery were fired from Syria into Israeli farms and towns.

[Citation needed]. Even if this is true, its quite understandable since Israel's creation was an act of war that had required the ethnic cleansing of nearly a million Palestinians from their homes. Israel was pretty much a belligerent, hostile and racist European colony on Arab soil.

This kind of moral equivalence is simple offensive. Were the Nazis and the Jews they slaughtered equally guilty too? Of course not, such an assertion would be grossly offensive.

1.  Hitchhike - I did this through Europe (France, Germany, Amsterdamn, etc) you can't do it everywhere but it allows you to travel and meet people.  It's fun and pretty safe even for women to do in Europe.

2.  Use Couchsurfing.com - Staying in peoples homes gives you two great things: one better food than any hotel, two a tour guide that comes complete with friends.

3.  Map out the festivals - I did San Fermin, a 6 day rock festival in Budapest, La tomotina, Bastille day and the Tour de France.  What you want to experience is as many festivals as possible so plan countries out by kick ass festivals.

4.  Stay in Hostels - for me traveling is about people and if I can't couchsurf then I would stay in a hostel and make international friends.

5.  get a Sat phone

6.  if you cant hitchhike travel by BUS - Bus is always cheaper than train but you sound like you got money so maybe this tip isn't for you.

7.  make loose plans, let the wind blow you around.  If you try to control your trip you will miss out on life.",0,,False,1280785960,t3_cwj6k,t3_cwj6k,t5_2qh1i,,1426405712,,AskReddit,t1_c0vt31x,c0vt31x,0,1,0,False,True,darkescaflowne

[There's an article from the Wall Street Journal about it, but I'm having trouble finding it, so here's one in the VERY conservative National Review mentioning the article Â¹](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/60049/not-all-bad/rod-dreher).  It was written during the run up to the invasion of Iraq and the pro-war American commercial media machine was in full swing.  During this time Germany was opposed to using German airspace and/or troops to assist in the war, as was France.  As a result, several extreme right wing media outlets and ""personalities"" were incessant in their criticism of Germany and France - this is where ""Freedom Fries"" came from.

The article, from the conservative WSJ, essentially says, hey, not all Germans were bad guys.  Sort of a backhanded compliment.  The thing that struck me as ""funny"" during this criticism of Germans as being ""weak"", was that people seemed to have forgotten that in WWII, the Wehrmacht's technology, strength, and power was unmatched by any other country... not even closely.  Most of my fellow Americans tend to think of WWII in Europe as the US vs ""the Germans"".  This, of course is ignorant of the fact that MANY Germans wanted no part of the Third Reich (my family included), and the fact that many nations fought the Nazi war machine and sacrificed at a much greater level, as well as many Germans and French who gave all to stop Hitler's advance.

I actually had several relatives who were executed for their parts in the famous bomb plot (aka, Operation Valkyrie), and one of them, Ruth von Kleist, was considered one of the chief planners.  In fact she is profiled in the book *Matriarch of Conspiracy*.

2,"I completely agree that fuel is too cheap here. $2.59 a gallon for 87 octane $2.79 / gallon for 91 octane, and people complain that it's expensive. Diesel is usually somewhere around 30 cents more a gallon than 91 octane (which seems a bit ridiculous as diesel is cheaper to manufacture than gasoline but because the government likes to tax diesel more than gasoline it's a sad reality), though it's hard to find a station that has diesel in many areas. Recently I've been looking at ""economy"" cars here and it's astonishing how poor the mileage is compared to European cars, the best mileage you can get in a gasoline non-hybrid car is around 40mpg (yes, even counting the Smart Fourtwo), the ONLY car that is a 3 cylinder, or has less than 100 horsepower is the Smart Fourtwo.

Our only options for diesel are VW TDI cars (Jetta, Passat and Golf), Suzuki Legacy (very, very rare), and then the high end Mercedes, Audi and BMW (which aren't efficient, but are efficient for luxury cars I guess). In America we have this terrible misconception that hybrids are better for the environment than diesels, which is very unfortunate.

Until fuel prices rise to at least $5 a gallon here we're not going to change, the lack of public transportation and the amount of highway driving we do are two other factors.

27,"Jeez, what *didn't* they do.

Well okay, my paternal grandmother, she didn't do anything.  Skipped around in Canada being a little girl.  Fine.  She's still alive.

My maternal grandmother, in England, was an aircraft spotter and (later) a radio operator.  She had three different homes destroyed during bombing raids, two of them with her in them at the time.  She died about fifteen years ago.  Still, while out walking one night during the War, she met:

My maternal grandfather, a Pole, who interrupted his medical training to join the Polish Infantry, which didn't work out so well for reasons that are fairly notorious.  About three quarters of his family died in Warsaw in various ways.  He fled to England, joining up with a group of mostly Polish Paratroopers serving under the RAF, I guess, and made several drops throughout the War, including both Arnhem and Berlin.  He was shot three times (all different occasions), and was awarded the Virtuti Militari (Poland's highest military honour), the medal being pinned to his tunic by Churchill himself.  He went on to be a boxer, an award-winning polka dancer, a doctor in the US and Canada, and eventually a frustrating son of a bitch to the children and grand-children devoted to his care in his declining years.  A visiting nurse or cleaning person stole his medal, which had been framed and hung on his wall.  He died about ten years ago.

My (Canadian) paternal grandfather, finally, had a mysterious time of it.  During the earliest stages of the War he was a dispatch rider with the BEF, but was evacuated along with everyone else at Dunkirk.  He saw brief and unspecified action with the general infantry in Italy, and then landed in Normandy on D-Day+3, there to resume his dispatch riding.  He served in France and Holland, and on the drive into Germany, apparently playing some part in the liberation of at least one Concentration Camp.  More than this he refuses to say.  We also suspect that he had two or three other ""wives"" (and possibly children) in England and Europe, but we've got no way to prove this.  He died almost thirty years ago.

My Great Uncle was also involved in liberating some of the Camps.  He later drank himself to death.

When the Islamic Empire was at it's peak, it waged war, raided, and took slaves from all over Europe, but then the tables turned and now the West is on top. Prior to that, it was the various European Empires (Romans, etc), and before that, other empires from the Middle East and surrounding regions. That's just the way it goes...

My maternal grandfather went into the Navy during 1945 just as the war was winding down and was in boot camp when the war ended. Fortunately, he qualified for the G.I. Bill and used that to help him get into school where he eventually became a doctor.

My paternal grandfather was a Navy signalman who went with the Marines on Iwo Jima after he got there the second day of the battle. He was told that the average life expectancy of a signalman was six seconds. Six. Seconds. He was on Iwo Jima for all but the first day, tagging along with the Marines as they cleared the island.

He was scheduled to be on the first wave in during Operation Downfall (the planned invasion of Japan). They told his group flat-out: you're not coming back. That's how bad it was going to be. Thankfully (for him) Pres. Truman ordered the atomic bombs dropped and Japan surrendered before he had to go in. 

(Fun fact: [They made so many Purple Hearts in the build-up to Operation Downfall that all Purple Hearts that have been awarded since World War II are from the stockpile meant for casualties of Operation Downfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall#Estimated_casualties))

The plane he was supposed to go on (the one he usually went on) ended up being shot down with no survivors.

As a rule, you *always* dive with a buddy.  That being said, I dive alone.  As the cameraman in a group of divers I need to be mobile and able to break away to get shots so we're permitted to dive sans buddy provided we have a pony bottle (a mini air tank as a backup for emergencies).  We arrived at the dive site later than usual after all the morning boats had left, so we were alone.  I was filming with a group of 5 or 6 people (who were required to stay with their instructor or divemaster).  We were all in the water waiting for everyone to be ready to go down when the instructor looks into the water, pulls his head up with wide eyes and a huge smile creeping across his face and says ""Whale Shark.""

I look down and see this massive shape passing directly beneath us.  This is the first time I had ever seen one in person and I immediately said ""I'm going down"" and left the group. I descended to its level and it swung wide of the dive site off into the blue.  I followed it, got a few shots and then just swam with it.  At one point it got ahead of me and doubled back and I descended slightly to let it pass overhead and I blasted bubbles up onto its belly (they love bubbles).  It came back to me another time before moving on.  All in all I spent a solid 15 minutes completely alone with the largest species of fish on earth in the wild.

I was in Montenegro and I wanted to get to Greece, but I didn't want to fly so that meant I was going to be going through Albania which, out of all the countries I had been to, I knew the least about.  I got to the southernmost town in Montenegro and found out I had just missed the last bus over. The town, or at least this area of it, looked pretty sketchy and I didn't want to stay there overnight.  One of the cab drivers waiting around the bus station approached me and offered to drive me across the border so I did my best to negotiate with him and we proceeded to leave. 

We walked over to his car, a tiny old red *something*, and he shot the other cabbies a look.  At the time I just assumed it meant ""haha, I got a fare, you didn't.""  We drive along for a good while, probably 45 minutes out into the countryside, really a ""middle of nowhere"" kind of place. He makes a little awkward small talk in broken English with a thick unplaceable eastern european accent here and there. Then he stops the car. He reaches toward me, which startles me a bit, but I realize he's just going for the glove box.  He opens it and pulls out a screwdriver.

He looks me dead in the eye and holds it for just a second, but in that second my head is running wild.  I'm thinking to myself ""Wait, is he robbing me? Is he about to try and fucking *rob* me? What was that look he shot the other cabbies? Fuck me, I'm gonna to have to wrestle this old guy for control of a *screwdriver* now. Is that *really* what's about to happen here?""  Just when I start to brace myself he then abruptly gets out of the car, uses the screwdriver to pop his ""taxi"" sign off the roof and tosses it under his seat. He says, ""If ask, you are doctor, I am guide"" and starts the car.  I'm a little confounded at this point so I mutter something along the lines of ""umm... ok?"" and we drive on.  Just a couple miles down the road we run into the Albanian border crossing and it's relatively smooth sailing.

I do still find some disagreement with your opinion, although I find this a difficult one to deal with.

In some ways, for an immigrant with no established connections in their new country, the opportunities for work at the start are not that much better in the UK than say in the UAE or Saudi.  The difference comes from the fact that for some immigrants, this can be a starting point to building a better and more prosperous life (although sadly this is probably not true for the majority).

Israel however as a fairly wealthy first-world country could offer this same opportunity.  While it may not be considered desirable from our comfortable middle-class point of view, there are those who given the choice, would prefer clean toilets if there was even a small chance of a better tomorrow, rather than be expelled altogether.  Israel through its policy of ethnic purity is denying them even this chance.

Also, at the risk of invoking Godwin's law, with Israel's own leadership actively promoting the ethnic purity of the nation to the point of expelling non-Jews, this kind of rhetoric is skirting so close to certain WW2 Nazi ideals, it's not even funny.

But the point of guest workers was never to allow people to build a better life.  That was always incidental. The point has always been do dirty jobs the natives didn't want.  Europe came to recognize the invariable contradictions, and grudgingly gave guest workers full residency and citizenship.

What has always troubled me about guest workers is that they are attempt to create a working underclass, for when one's own citizens won't stoop that low.  Maybe a fair deal in this case is the creation of a temporary underclass, with room for advancement.   But any culture with an emphasis on ethnic purity (eg Saudi, or Israel) will never take this route, so their desire for guest workers amounts the creation of a perpetual, rotating underclass.

1,"My great-Grandfather was a chemical engineer in a rocket fuel plant (German, obviously) until it was bombed to hell and gone. His job kept him out of the Wehrmacht. He housed a Norwegian engineer in his home, and refused to turn her over to the British when they advanced through Northern Germany. He accomplished this by somehow intimidating the armed young men sent to retrieve her. However, the British eventually forced them out of their home. Fearing looting (and for good reason), he dug up one of his trees, put his valuables in the hole, and planted the tree back on top of it. I own one of the items he hid, a solid silver medal given to him by the Nazi regime for being physically fit. It has a huge swastika across the whole of the medal.

Meanwhile, one of my cousins was a Polish partisan leader who sided with the USSR to end the Nazi occupation of Poland. And the town in Poland where my ancestors originally came from was completely demolished in a battle where the Polish army held the Wehrmacht at a bridge for two days during Blitzkrieg.

1,"Broadly speaking I'm pro-healthcare but with some caveats. First maybe you should know I'm not from US but from Honduras and that I've lived 1 year in Germany and 7 years in Spain (in both places you have government sponsored healthcare) but I have never used it because I do believe private insurance is better (if you can afford it). I've always supported universal access to healthcare but I used to do it for moral/ethical reasons, i.e. it's a right, the decent thing to do, etc. Now I still support it but for more practicale reasons and I'm careful to distinguish its usefulness/effectiveness depending on the circumstances. 

For instance:

 * I don't think its sustainable in the US under your current budget, however, if you end your wars plus some defense spending like [Ron Paul and Barney Frank](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/107229-why-we-must-reduce-military-spending-reps-barney-frank-and-ron-paul?sms_ss=reddit) suggests...
 * I believe healthcare is flawed in Spain in the sense that it rewards doctors based on the number of patients he/she diagnose not on the effectiveness of the diagnose/treatment plus you also get to wait long time for their services, etc. I've convinced most of my friends to switch to private insurance its worth it at least here. It really paid off when they detected a tumor close to my wife's womb, many doctors just wanted to extract her womb right away, fortunately there is an MD Anderson clinic here which cared enough to try and extract the tumor without damaging her womb (they succeeded!). So basically I'm saying even if everyone agrees on implementing healthcare you need to be careful on how you design it (unintended consequences) and also on how you run costs as Spain is expected to be the next Greece, i.e. default financially since they spent too much and produce too little, basically they've been able to afford their social services thx to EU loans. Now that they have to make cuts everyone is protesting and boycotting the govt. (well, not now cuz its summer... but in september....).
 * and finally, I think healthcare in Honduras is a must given the level of poverty and social discontent going on now. However, do notice that education AND healthcare are already (and have been for some time) the greatest costs in Honduras budget but the effectiveness of the government to actually deliver it efficiently is near zero, so in countries like Honduras you have to deal first with the effectiveness of government officials (yes, there is corruption but I've seen many cases where just pure dumb incompetence and ignorance causes the wastes) then with producing enough for the country to be sustainable (which is not the case now) and only then can we devise a good income redistribution services.",0,,False,1280825435,t3_cv096,t1_c0vozs0,t5_2qh1s,,1426406384,,Economics,t1_c0vuhul,c0vuhul,0,1,0,False,True,toxicafunk
1,"&gt; Check your facts, the Brits got it after WW1. 

Yes, that was a typo. The British promised the Arabs self-rule if they helped them against the Ottomans. After the war they betrayed the Arabs and carved out the middle east with the other European powers.

&gt; Before that, it was the Ottomans, before that, the Egyptians (who went back and forth with the Ottomans). Last time it was under Arab rule was about 900 years ago, but was still a remote colony of larger Caliphates.

It was hardly a ""remote colony"" since the area is Holy to Islam as well and the has been culturally arabised for a long time. It was a central part of the Arab world.

&gt;Last time it was an indepdendent state was 140 BCE, under the Hasmoneans (aka Jews).

Only for a few decades. The Palestinians are also in large part descended of the ancient Israelites who became arabised over time. In fact they're probably much closer related to the ancient Jews then the recent Ashkenazi invaders.

&gt;Palestinian fatalities estimated between 1000-25000. The larger number would far exceed the number directly killed by Israel in the last 60 years. The smaller would be comparable.

So in other words your claim is just speculation. And note that Israel killed more than a thousand people in operation cast lead alone.

Never said ""we don't need boarders"" just that ideally, people need to start thinking beyond tribalism (race, ethnicity, religion) in organizing themselves. Doing that under a constitutional republic system, based on federalism is a step in the right direction. Kicking people out of your country because they are not the same race is not.  Israel = fail. But call my bluff, lets see if Israel's policies and citizenship based on blood gains them peace and success. Let the Middle East squalor in its ancient ways and let it not move to a democratic model, where race and religion are absent from a constitution. No sweat off of my brow.

Perhaps someday, people will see beyond such superficial and ultimate BS notions as race, ethnicity and religion for keeping some people in and others out. Because currently, these are awful notions to base your society on, especially if you ""boarder"" (har, har) a country with ""different"" people next to it. I know it has served Africa well [/sarcasm].

The fact that in the U.S. so many different people with different cultures, religions and ethnicities can come here, live, practice their faith and we don't break out in tribal conflict or have genocide is a pretty big accomplishment.  No other country on the planet has come close to this ""experiment"" (Europe and its 50 million dead from war in the 20th century is not an ideal model). It's not ""American culture"", it's the political system and what it guarantees people that makes them comes here.

Does that make our ""culture"" better? First, I'm not talking about culture but rather our political system--why you are conflating the two is beyond me. Second, no. Though I would much prefer to live here where citizenship is based on the Constitution and not heritage or antiquated notions like religion and race. 

BTW, since you keep bringing up American culture, care to actually define it?  As far as I can tell, culture in the Northeast is different from the South, which is different from the MidWest. Even culture on Long Island is different from northern Maine.

What you're talking about is ""creative destruction"", a thatcherite/reaganite idea that as some industries get destroyed, others take their place and everyone is better off.

What actually happened was called (especially by those in the north) ""destruction"". Our industry was decimated, and 30 years on there has been nothing to replace it but unemployment benefits and a life without work.

 * Creative destruction UK = decimated industry, crippled economy based on housing bubble, millions in a lifetime without work

2,"&gt;I made no statement about Palestinian rights.
&gt;    So your argument is if they identify themselves now as Palestinian, they have no legitimate claim because they don't exist.

&gt;Nope, not at all. The OP made a terrible analogy. And used what, to modern Americans, seems like distinct well understood national distinctions. My point is that all of the boundaries and identifications in question have been fluid. Two current Middle Eastern nations existed in 1910. Every single nation in the area has had boundary changes since then. The Palestinian do not lose their rights because their self-identification has changed. But neither do they get automatic rights simply because we name them something distinct.

oops.

&gt;Then it is really sad that they ended up with the PLO and Hamas (and Egypt and Syria) as their champions.

Yes, it is. It's funny how people with no power over their lives become subject to terrorist organizations. Sort of the same excuse Israel used for terrorist acts on the British.

&gt;Annihilated? Pull the other one, it has bells on.

Your other brain has bells on it? OK. How about reading something about various Native American tribes that no longer exist. The means of ridding the US of the ""Indian problem"" was to decimate them and starve them. It worked. Maybe that will ring your bell.

Edit: My point is that Israel contributes to it's own problem with it's attacks and subjugation of the Palestinian people. Israel has become a perpetrator of what it was a victim of in Nazi Germany. I'm currently reading a book about counter insurgency. The trick to defeating it is to coerce the population to trust you more than the enemy. Germany failed in it's attempt to dominate Europe, in part due to it's treatment of the people's it conquered. This resulted in insurgency and a population that helped their enemies.

2,"&gt; countries that do not have guns widely availible have less armed criminals 

That was your own comment.

&gt; Obviously some do, but common street criminals generally do not

This also was your comment. Please define ""common street criminal"" because I assume that means rapists, robbers, car thieves and burglars, not murderers. Murderers are less common criminals and typically are known to their victims. The former are not.

I actually chose England as an example because it seems the English are always so quick to call out the U.S. on guns.

I also posted about Australia and Canada because they too like to point fingers at the U.S.

Homicide is not the only crime out there that guns are used for and they are not the only weapon criminals use.

But hey, if you want to nitpick...

How about Germany who has some of the most stringent gun laws in Europe?

*Licenses are required to buy or own a firearm, and to get a license a German must prove his or her ""need"" and pass a government test. Different licenses are required for hunters, recreational shooters, and collectors. It is illegal to have a gun ready for defensive use in your own home. Before being allowed to have a firearm for protection, a German must again prove ""need.""*

The annual number of firearm-related murders in Germany rose 76% between 1992-1995.

Of course I would agree that the homicide rate in the U.S. is higher than many of your beloved European nations but you have to remember that statistics for many of them do not include *attempted murder*. I am not using that as an excuse, just making mention of it. I'm sure even if they did include *attempted murder* like the U.S. does that the U.S. would still have a higher rate.

I understand that the U.S. is on par with many Eastern European countries when it comes to homicide.

At current here are the [latest statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) on homicide.

So it looks like the saying *""Guns don't kill people, people kill people""* actually holds true (and I can't stand that saying) especially in Canada where [stabbings account for one-third of all killings](http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/85-002-XIE/0060585-002-XIE.pdf)

I don't know why you took such offense to my comment and citations. I was just trying to show that the stereotype of everyone in the U.S. carrying guns and killing each other is wrong and that crime happens all over the world. More specifically I was trying to show that the loudest opponents of the U.S. seem to have it no better with their strict gun control laws.",0,,False,1280866436,t3_cwldm,t1_c0vvppr,t5_2qh1i,,1426407015,,AskReddit,t1_c0vvuh9,c0vvuh9,0,2,0,False,True,cdahlkvist

The Germans might have gone through the low countries and Scando-land like a knife through butter. However, as far as I remember, they failed to invade the UK.

1,"""Why Sarah Palin Endangers American National Security""
http://sh3p.ca/hnycq


[...] Why do I find Sarah Palin dangerous? [...] Palin has this week argued vociferously against the building of a mosque near the site of Ground Zero in lower Manhattan. She calls the idea of a mosque there a provocation. But it is her opposition to the building of a mosque that is provocative. The organization that hopes to build the mosque, the Cordoba Initiative, is a moderate Muslim group, striving for better relations between the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds. It is in the direct interest of American national security to strengthen those groups that argue against Islamism. Palin's opposition to the mosque -- and by extension, to the enfranchisement of moderate Muslims -- is a gift to Islamists, proof to their potential followers that America is as intolerant of Islam as Europe is, proof that it is America, not Islam, that wants to see our civilizations clash. We as a society should embrace those Muslims who want to live the American dream; their lives, as free, devout and proud Muslims in a diverse country, are a refutation of the radical notion that the West is forever aligned against the interests of Muslim believers. Opposing the building of mosques by anti-jihadist Muslim groups in this country is perhaps the best way to radicalize American Muslims not otherwise prone to radicalization.

It is true that this country is home to a non-insignificant number of already-radicalized Muslims. There's no point in denying that. But there's a war on -- a clash within a civilization -- and we can affect the outcome of this war by embracing those Muslims who are ready and willing to live in our multi-confessional country, while fighting those who violently oppose American values. Sarah Palin, from what I see so far, views Islam as a monolith, and because of this view, she argues for policies that could do severe damage to American national security. This is a complicated war we're in, and Sarah Palin is, by the evidence at hand, dangerously simple-minded.",0,,False,1280868838,t3_cwt1j,t3_cwt1j,t5_2cneq,,1426407068,,politics,t1_c0vvyl8,c0vvyl8,0,1,0,False,True,sheps

You know, ""Allahuh Akbar!"" over and over.

There is nothing racist or irrational about opposing an ideology that promotes ignorance, irrationality, submission to make believe authority, and submission of the infidels etc. (Along with all the other absurdity.)

And to be clear, I'm no fan of Christianity or other religions either. But this bleeding heart liberal BS (and I'm a liberal myself) has got to stop. It's already wrecking Europe with their Sharia Courts and increasingly self segregated Muslim communities breeding a new generation of radicals etc.

And this isn't just some general mosque we're talking about. It's a giant media campaign for an extremely visible $100,000,000.00 13 story mega mosque pro-Islam center built so close to Ground Zero that the bodies of the victims of that very same ideology were sprayed over very ground where they now want to promote it.

A friend of mine in Sweden who is already dealing with the fallout of this uber-liberal idiocy had a few choice comments to make on Facebook about this issue:

&gt;This may sound a bit rough but, I hate what has become of most atheists and liberals. Most atheists and liberals seem to cling onto the UN declaration of human rights like it's flawless and claim superior moral clarity in a similar fashion that religious people do. They just want everyone to know how ""good and modern"" they are by accepting everything no matter how ridiculous it might be, such as genocidal mass murder cults which promote segregation, intolerance, misogyny and homophobia.
&gt;
&gt;I think being liberal is a great thing since it shows the path to renewal and continuous advancement, but there has to be boundaries even in liberalism. It's become a fad to try to be as liberal as possible and personally advertise yourself as the most ""good and liberal"" person in the world.
&gt;
&gt;Liberalism must be combined with a bit of common sense and boundaries. I consider myself fairly liberal, but you can't tolerate those who don't tolerate you and you can't accept those who don't accept you just because you ""want to be a better person than them,"" because frankly, that is just insane. It's the same thing as going to war and refraining from using your gun against an armed man who is firing his gun against you, simply because you want to be the better person.

&gt;Also, freedom of religion is the biggest piece of bullshit ever. Every freedom that religious organizations need is covered in the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. We can't keep giving people special privileges just because they've been brainwashed as children to believe in ghosts, magical men in the sky, angels, fairies or other ridiculous crap. There shouldn't be any special laws under any premise that give people benefits, unless they're directed towards people with physical and/or mental handicaps.

Frankly I couldn't agree more.

You very much can hold an ideology that is explicitly written out and preached in a way that breeds the most dangerous radicals in the world today. You very much can rationally stand up against that ideology and culture and religion coming here. These people make a choice to believe these things. They're not born Muslims, and even if they're brainwashed into it... that's still the fault of the ideology and just another reason to oppose its spread.

Like my friend said:

Posting a citation without a link is useless.

Also, the second link is just one example. Obese people live shorter than their slimmer counterparts.

Copy Pasta from Wiki:

&gt;Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide. &gt;[8][19][20] Large-scale American and European studies have found &gt;that mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 22.5â25 kg/m2[21] in &gt;non-smokers and at 24â27 kg/m2 in current smokers, with risk &gt;increasing along with changes in either direction.[22][23] A BMI &gt;above 32 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among &gt;women over a 16-year period.[24] In the United States obesity is &gt;estimated to cause an excess 111,909 to 365,000 death per &gt;year,  &gt; [2][20] while 1 million (7.7%) of deaths in the European Union are &gt;attributed to excess weight.[25][26] On average, obesity reduces life &gt;expectancy by six to seven years:[2][27] a BMI of 30â35 reduces life &gt;expectancy by two to four years,[21] while severe obesity (BMI &gt; &gt;40) reduces life expectancy by 10 years.[21]

Lastly, the issue with not staying that way is because after people lose the weight they don't stick to their new found diet.

&gt;The main treatment for obesity consists of dieting and physical &gt;exercise.[62] Diet programs may produce weight loss over the short &gt;term,[123]  but keeping this weight off can be a problem and often &gt;requires making exercise and a lower calorie diet a permanent part of &gt;a person's lifestyle.[124][125]

If you post a link with citations that says that obese people eat less than thin people on average, or in any statistically significant numbers I will change my original post.

Until then you are just arguing against obvious truths. Fat people are fat because they eat too much. They die early because being fat is not healthy.

Wiki on calorie restriction:

A small study of long-term CR practitioners in the US at the Washington University School of Medicine  in St. Louis studied the effects following a calorie-restricted diet of 10-25% less calorie intake than the average Western diet, which is over caloric. Body mass index  (BMI) was significantly lower in the calorie-restricted group when compared with the matched group; 19.6 compared with 25.9. The BMI values for the comparison group are similar to the mean BMI values for middle-aged people in the US.[5]

All those on calorie-restricted diets experienced reductions in BMI after starting their diet. Their BMIs decreased from an average of 24 (range of 19.4 to 29.6) to an average of 19.5 (range of 16.5 to 22.8) over the course of their dieting (3â15 years). Nearly all the decrease in BMI occurred in the first year of dieting. It was found that the average total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels for calorie-restricted individuals were the equivalent of those found in the lowest 10% of normal people in their age group. It was found that the average HDL (good) cholesterol levels for calorie-restricted individuals were very highâin the 85th to 90th percentile range for normal middle-aged US men. These positive changes in calorie-restricted individuals were found to occur mainly in the first year of dieting.[5]",0,,False,1280899028,t3_cvp0e,t1_c0vx573,t5_2qh1i,,1426407637,,AskReddit,t1_c0vx6hw,c0vx6hw,0,0,0,True,True,lawcorrection

It is as safe as a hospital birth and regular studies comparing the two kinds of birthing places are conducted. There are measures in place to ensure the quality of care given and that midwives are on top of things.

This makes me sad...

PhD students are paid like enough to just about eat and stuff, I don't know if you have enough time to have many hobbies/interests but I doubt they could afford them on such miserly stipends in any case.

Post-doc salaries are abysmal in the US, and still pretty poor in the UK. They are much better in the EU (the UK doesn't pay the same as the EU because we opt out of lots of their policies - yay Thatcherism) but then it is mainly the  small number of post-doc places versus PhD students and the short-term nature of the employment that makes it difficult to have job security.

I think it shows how out of touch the politicians are when you see Willets say that Space and Dinosaurs will enthuse Children with the scientific spirit and get the UK more scientists. But it doesn't matter what reasons we give children to choose to go into science if we give adults even greater reasons to leave.

1,"The Latin that you learn in school is ancient Latin, it is the Latin of Cicero and Cato and Caesar, from the 1st century BC.  It's called Classical Latin, and it was only really spoken in the 1st century BC and before that.  

It evolved out of an older Latin, and it continued evolving into the AD. The Latin of the 1st century BC was preserved as a snapshot in time because it became the standard dialect/language of official imperial documentation and sign making.

Classical Latin was hard, staccato, and militaristic; the V's were w-sounding, the C's were always k-sounding and never ""ch"" or ""s"" sounding.  There were no dip-thongs like ""au"", ""oi"", or ""eu""; all letters were pronounced distinctly and separately.  Even in a word like ""illa"", the two ""Ls"" were not run together, the correct pronunciation is ""Il-la"".  It's subtle, but it's there.

But Latin evolved, and as is the tendency of most evolving languages, it became softer and more pleasing to the ear.  Around the time of Constantine and the subsequent centuries that witnessed the fall of Rome and the flourishing of Christianity, I'm sure that the C's became soft and the V's started to sound like V's.  ""Ae"" started to be pronounced like a long A instead of a long I, ""ay"" instead of ""I"".

That's where the liturgical tradition comes from.  It's likely that the Catholic Church has preserved a dialect of Latin that probably belonged to educated Italian monks and scholars from around the 5th century AD.

Plus, Gregorian chants just sound much better when Latin is softer.",0,,False,1280912066,t3_cw05y,t1_c0vxgai,t5_2qh1i,,1426407796,,AskReddit,t1_c0vxisf,c0vxisf,0,1,0,False,True,Publius12

3,"&gt; I wouldn't bet on a company freeing themselves from Microsoft because of ideology

it's not so much ideology, as not wanting to be dependent on vendor lock-in. 

&gt; Are they? Can you give an example or two of this stimulation?

Sure, here's a [ZDNet link from back in 2007](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/it-strategy/2007/01/15/european-commission-report-endorses-open-source-39285468/). The [EU report mentioned](http://www.flossimpact.eu/) however focuses mainly of total cost of ownership of open source and not so much the openness aspect.

Let me illustrate that particular point with the case of the Dutch ministry of finance. No way they would put all their privacy-sensitive information on external servers - this is enough for them to not go for GMail flat out. They are also required by law to keep records of all their transactions for a given length of time so they need good back-up tools. As for vendor lock-in, they want to be sure that should they decide to migrate to something else, they can 'get their data out'. Many organisations have been burnt in the past by vendors charging ridiculous amounts of money to migrate their data in an effort to keep the account, or by vendors simply keeling over and leaving them with an unmaintainable piece of software. With OSS, they can always hire a third party to fix bugs, build new features, and so on. It's a much safer long-term option for them.

edit: by the way, I'm not saying GMail isn't any good, by all means if you like it go ahead and use it! I'm just saying their model isn't compatible with a lot of companies and especially (semi-) governments.

France's involvement in what is now called ""European Union"" dates back to 1957 (Treaty of Rome).

EU Countries gradually let go of powers but almost all sovereign powers remain at a national level. Some political parties wish a federation is formed, but it's still a distant perspective.

Contrary to what seem to be a common belief in the US, there's no such thing a cultural unity between EU countries. US States had a language in common and a few hundred years before a true Union was formed.
I think that a common cultural background is a pre-requisite for a federal state. Some argue that the current isssues Belgium is facing is due in large parts to a lack of a common background between Flanders and Wallonia. I guess that to some extent it's all true of Switzerland.

""Epistle to the author of the book, The Three Impostors"".  --  Voltaire

Insipid writer, you pretend to draw for your readers
The portraits of your 3 impostors;
How is it that, witlessly, you have become the fourth?
Why, poor enemy of the supreme essence,
Do you confuse Mohammed and the Creator,
And the deeds of man with God, his author?...
Criticize the servant, but respect the master.
God should not suffer for the stupidity of the priest:
Let us recognize this God, although he is poorly served.

My lodging is filled with lizards and rats;
But the architect exists, and anyone who denies it
Is touched with madness under the guise of wisdom.
Consult Zoroaster, and Minos, and Solon,
And the martyr Socrates, and the great Cicero:
They all adored a master, a judge, a father.
This sublime system is necessary to man.
It is the sacred tie that binds society,
The first foundation of holy equity,
The bridle to the wicked, the hope of the just.

If the heavens, stripped of his noble imprint,
Could ever cease to attest to his being,
If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.
Let the wise man announce him and kings fear him.
Kings, if you oppress me, if your eminencies disdain
The tears of the innocent that you cause to flow,
My avenger is in the heavens: learn to tremble.
Such, at least, is the fruit of a useful creed.

But you, faulty logician, whose sad foolishness
Dares to reassure them in the path of crime,
What fruit do you expect to reap from your fine arguments?
Will your children be more obedient to your voice?
Your friends, at time of need, more useful and reliable?
Your wife more honest? and your new renter,
For not believing in God, will he pay you better?
Alas! let's leave intact human belief in fear and hope.

In vain you raise as an objection to me the hypocritical insolence
Of these proud charlatans promoted to high honors,
Nourished by our work, quenched by our tears;
Of these Caesars tainted by their usurped grandeur;
A priest on the Capitoline hill where Pompea triumphed;
Of these wretches in sandals, the excrement of humanity,
Soaking there detestable hands in our blood;
At the sound of their voice a hundred towns are covered in ruins,
And the horrible matins of bloodied Paris:
I know these awful monuments better than you;
I have unmasked them with my pen for the past fifty years.
But, as the fearsome enemy of this fanaticism,
I have also celebrated God when the devil was vanquished.
I always distinguished between religion
And the misery bred of superstition.
Europe has thanked me; twenty crowned heads
Have deigned to applaud the fortunate labors of my nights,
While Patouillet was insulting me in vain.
I have done more in my time than Luther and Calvin.
They were seen opposing, in a fatal error,
Abuses with abuses, scandal with scandal.
Eager to throw themselves amidst the factions,
They condemned the Pope and wanted to imitate him.
Europe was long desolated by them all;
They troubled the earth, and I have consoled it.
I have told the disputants, hounding one another:
""Cease, impertinent ones, cease, unfortunate ones;
Foolish children of God, cherish yourselves in your brothers,
And stop biting one another for absurd chimeras.""
Good people have believed me: the evil ones, crushed,
Have hurled cries that are scorned by the wise man;
And in Europe, finally, happy toleration
Has become the catechism of all well made souls.

I see from afar that era coming, those happy days,
When philosophy, enlightening humanity,
Must lead them in peace to the feet of the common master;
Frightful fanaticism will tremble to appear there:
There will be less dogma with more virtue.

If someone wants to assume an official position,
He will no longer bring along two witnesses 2
To testify to his beliefs; rather they will swear to his good conduct.

A Huguenot lover will be able to marry
The attractive sister of an important cleric;

1,"Hey, I am an Icelandic lawyer who used to work for the directorate of immigration.

Do you have any skills? The only way for a non-EU citizen to get a work permit in Iceland these days is to possess some relevant skill and to be already hired by an Icelandic company. Unskilled workers from outside the EU are not granted work permits in this economic climate.

The only sector that I can think of that is hiring people is IT, software development and such. [CCP](http://www.ccpgames.com/en/jobs.aspx) especially is always scouting for talent. Working in that sector carries that additional benefit that many companys pay wages in foreign currency (USD or EUR) rather than the worthless local currency.

As for the economy in more general terms. It is still bad but the worst is over. Unemployment is slowly starting to crawl back down and GDP is starting to grow again.

EDIT: You should also know that although you don't need a visa to come, you are only allowed to stay for three months. If you want to stay longer, you need a residence permit and in order to get a residence permit there needs to be some specific point to your stay (study, work, au-pair, joining a family member etc.).

Occasionally politicians have to change their view as a result of changing circumstances. In this instance the markets were becoming increasingly concerned about the deficit and if the government failed to present a clear deficit reduction plan then the pound would have taken a hit and the cost of borrowing would have likely increased.

It all depends if you want to play synth-ish music or piano music. I don't know much about playing synth music, so I won't say anything about that. If you want to play piano music, the absolute most important, vital thing is touch-sensitivity, so that the sound gets louder if you press the keys harder. After that, the number of keys is the next most important (a piano has 88, but 61 is plenty for a beginner). The final important thing is the action: a so-called weighted keyboard has keys that feel like a piano's when you press them. This is not important for a beginner but becomes important later.

The Bontempi doesn't have touch-sensitive keys, and as a result I reckon you'd grow out of it after a couple of months. I wouldn't recommend it.

The M-key seems to be a decent instrument, but it only has 49 keys which after a few months will start to get on your nerves. Also, like Synthetic_Jesus says, it's a controller keyboard which means you need to hook it up to a software piano on your computer to get any sound out of it. If you don't mind that, you might try the [M-Audio Keystation 61ES](http://www.thomann.de/de/m-audio_keystation_61es.htm) instead, which has 61 keys. You won't often need more than 61 keys for maybe a couple of years, and the action seems to be good-quality (semi-weighted so it feels more like a piano than your average keyboard does).

* If I'm two inches away staring at the tv, I am going to completely miss the weather outside and the room your sitting in.

Whatever you focus on will be your entire reality. You control what you focus on.

You are a result of what you think. So focusing on the negative and boring aspects of your life, will make your entire life seem negative and boring. The first step you must take is changing the filter through which you see the world. 

Yes there is violence and corruption, greed and hatred. But what about the fact that somewhere, there is a father playing catch with his son, a mother hugging her daughter, puppies being born, a young boy falling in love for the first time. Now we can go on and talk about how all these things don't matter, but that would be passing them through a negative filter again, wouldn't it? There exists both desirable (good) things and undesirable (bad) things. The more you begin to see that and balance out your mind the less depressed you will be. Control your thoughts about things, force yourself to think up one positive thought for every negative thought. Trust me, everything has both.

Secondly, get away from the people who are bringing you down, the people who are bitching and talking bad about you, both physically and mentally. You are going through your quarter-life crisis and many of us are experiencing the same thing: no clear goal, excessive boredom, lack of true purpose. The solution to this for you is simple: Travel. You are bored because you have been in the same place your whole life, meeting the same people, doing the same crap.

Backpack through Europe, Fly to Thailand and live there for a while, go to Australia, The Andes Mountains or a South American rainforest. The problem is you aren't thinking big enough... once again your staring at this tiny part of the world and saying ""this piece of shit sucks!""... stop staring at a piece of shit then. What is stopping you from exploring the world? Fear? Fuck that.. fear is what is going to keep you at your grandmothers house for the rest of your life because you never felt like doing something you werent comfortable doing. You'd rather stay in the same situation and feel sorry for yourself then take a chance and do something incredible. 

Don't have money for a vacation? Start working. It sucks, I know. Work is boring and monotomous, but mostly because you had no goals to work towards. Set a date on the calendar. the day you leave for __________. Do everything in your power to make that happen, then do more. [Couch Surf](http://www.couchsurfing.com) your way through your vacation if you have to. The point is: you need to expand your horizons, you probably feel like shit because you have stopped growing. 

People don't get ""turns"" at enjoying life, it is a choice a conscious effort that is worked towards and forged by one's own willpower. I think you have let the words of the people around you define you. 

They tell you that you are shit, and you believe them. Worse yet, you repeat it to yourself and you call yourself shit. You then start acting like shit, and feeling like shit. Because you have defined yourself as shit, what else do you expect?

Oakland tends to be more affordable than Berkeley; the Temescal and Rockridge regions have a quick (by US standards...) public transit connection to UC Berkeley, a light rail system known as BART which also connects to San Francisco.

You might feel overdressed fairly often. The bay area is mostly about jeans, T-shirts, and athletic shoes, although I think you'll blend in better, at less expense, if you wear what you normally would, rather than wear a European interpretation of local styles.

Summers can have cool weather, especially in San Francisco, and especially in an El Nino year like this one. Bring long sleeves, and try to dress in layers, as if it might turn from autumn to summer and back again over the course of a day.

I'd highly recommend going to The Starry Plough some Monday night at 7, for lessons in Irish (as interpreted by Berkeley) folk dance. Alternatively, look in to Cal Animage Alpha, which holds free screenings of anime every week.

1,"Okay, I lived and went to Berkeley, and my roommate for a while was a guest to UC Berkeley from Austria finishing up his PhD.  So, I am probably the most qualified person to answer this.

I was living in a fraternity which was dying, so the rent was relatively cheap.

My roommate had no trouble in terms of cultural barriers.  

In terms of fitting in - don't worry.  No one fits into Berkeley.  That's its charm.  It is so diverse and weird in some respects, and so normal in others, that just being there is good enough.  Also, Berkeley is not America in its general sense.  In fact, as a European, you may find it easier to fit into Berkeley than many people from middle America.  The student body is most Asian, followed by whites - so it doesn't look or feel like any TV show out there.  And the chicks will dig your accent.

Nothing will land you in jail either.  As long as you don't drink and drive or shoot up in front of a cop, you are good.

Tips:
Live on the South Side near Telegraph.  North side is more expensive and dead.  Easy walking distance to school, more happening.  Anywhere is not cheap.  Look into subletting rooms from fraternities.  I don't know, but maybe the International House (the i-House) in Berkeley can offer housing.  The further you have to walk, the cheaper it is.  Find a balance.

Housing in Berkeley is expensive and dilapidated.  Being from Europe, it won't be a huge shock, but the average American would be appalled at what students live in at Berkeley.

Keep the accent.  My roommate got so many girls with his.  In other words, don't try to see ""American"".  It's pointless in Berkeley.

Become friends with someone with a car.  That way, if he or she is going to Target, you can stock up on stuff.

Berkeley is expensive because there are really no big stores or franchises, and the city has set up itself to rip off students.  No special tips in terms of saving money.  Just cook at home, but occasionally go out and have a burrito at La Burrita, or a hot dog at Top Dog.  There is so much diversity in the food that it would be a waste to eat Top Ramen.

Things are relatively dead at night.  If you are a night time person, you may consider living in SF and taking BART (the subway) to Berkeley.  It's quite common for graduates at the professional schools (Business and Law school).

Really out-there, crazy, off-the-wall funny. I don't know if it's a strategy that works for men, but it works for me (and for the men I end up messaging), so. WHADDUP.

I like messages that mix commentary on profile/pictures. Calling someone out and telling a joke at the same time are great ways to start a conversation. I called out a well-traveled guy* for saying Antarctica was the only place he wouldn't travel: ""Don't hate. Antarctica is the PERFECT place to go if you want to show-up all of your high school friends who make you react to pictures of their month-long trip through Europe.""

Man. .....man, can't believe you like 'Overboard'. It is definitely the main thing we have in common. Let's grab coffee sometime.""

Clearly you are a dude who has a lot of friends from a lot of different places in life: you are PROBABLY extremely funny, in person, and totally nice and endearing and cute. The trouble is, it really doesn't come off from your profile! The pictures save it, but it'd be nice if your profile was as much fun to read as you are to hang out with in real life. ""I'm a chemical engineer and work for an air quality testing firm, which means that I'm the FIRST person you want with you after you finish watching 'Breaking Bad' and spend a week seriously considering cooking to pay the bills, and the LAST person you want to bring with you to admire the L.A. skyline."" Make sense?

Like I said, your results may vary, depending on who you're trying to attract. But if you make somebody laugh/smile just reading through your profile, you're already halfway there. :) The worst part I can see is the ""most private thing"" section -- everybody feels this way. Almost EVERYONE chooses to write somewhere in their profile that they're shy at first, but loosen up afterwards/once they get to know you. Take it out. It has no place. It's hampering your ""Listen, you DEFINITELY want to hang out with me"" game!

3,"**Debt:** Debt cannot artificially increase consumption. By definition, debt is just rearranging the ordering of consumption. People can't consume more than they earn in the long run. I don't necessarily agree that people are totally rational about these things, as virtually no one would rationally buy a Navigator, but it does seem rational for most people to take on reasonable debt loads to buy a car of some sorts.

**Economy:** Off the top of my head, you're final cost needs to be divided by 1.8 to reflect that the average car trip has 1.8 passengers. Passenger miles includes, well, passengers, while the driving costs is simply driving. More importantly, every method of transit has costs. For instance, that includes lost time due to congestion. Fair enough, but then you would have to include the time difference between driving and alternatives. Now, it's true to say that driving is probably under taxed given the well known externalities, the solution to this is some kind of carbon tax. Even using generous assumptions though, gas costs would probably just rise to European levels which shouldn't render driving impractical.

**War:** I can't for the life of me understand why people think oil costs are subsidized by wars. There not. You can quite clearly see that whenever war, or even tension, breaks out in the Middle East oil costs rise dramatically. Wars destroy production capacity. Also, as for the US, much of it's oil doesn't even come from the ME. Canada and Mexico are the largest suppliers. It's just a weird statistical quirk: if you examine US conflicts since WW2, most of them don't even involve countries with any oil. Vietnam, no oil. Korea, no oil. Kosovo, no oil. Panama, no oil. Grenada, no oil. Somalia, no oil. Afghanistan, no oil. It doesn't follow that because the US invaded one oil producing country, and seriously crewed global oil markets in the process, that oil is ""cheap"" because of the US military.

**Quality of Life:** The simple answer is that people aren't that upset in their cars.[This StatsCan survey](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2006004/9516-eng.htm) shows that most people view their commute as relatively positive. Cyclists do tend to enjoy committing more, though it's difficult for most people to practically cycle to work. My basic opinion here is that it really is best to let people decide for themselves how to get from point a to point b.

**Health:** I wouldn't say that cars are good for one's health, just that reducing car use isn't an effective way to improve health. I'm not exactly  an expert on obesity economics, but soda/junk food taxes and education seem far more relevant. Reducing car usage absent changes in nutrition will be meaningless.

No, ""confining people to ghettos"" is not really a Nazi thing.

The Jewish ghettos across Europe were because the Christians forced the Jews to live in locked areas. The Gazans are in Gaza because there is a territorial dispute.

4,"You should really read one of the millions of books out there written on exactly this (""The Case for Israel"" or ""Israel for Dummies"" even).  Here is the short, short, short version:

At the beginning of the 1900s ultra-religious Jews started buying up land in the middle east because they wanted to start a modern movement to get back their historic homeland.  The land really *was* historically theirs; sure you can read about that in the Torah (old Testament of the Bible) but beyond that, tons of other corroborating evidence proves that *yes*, Jews were their long before Muslims.  Namely, the ruins of Jewish temples and other things are still in Jerusalem, predating all Muslim and Christian holy sites.

So, this movement was growing steadily for decades... then the Nazis came along and slaughtered 2/3 of all the Jews in Europe, and basically displaced the other 1/3 of the Jewish population.  Thats about 3 million Jews that had all their possessions taken, families murdered, homes confiscated.  They needed someplace to go.

So the Jews all said to Britain, ""Hey buddy, See the big hunk of land you control which you call Palestine?  Well, we've been buying a bunch of that land for decades now.  How about you hand over a chunk of it and give us Sovereignty so we can have a modern day state of Israel?""

And all the Arabs on the land said, ""Whoa, this is bullshit.  Why should they get sovereignty when we've had to put up with British occupation for all these years?!  This is our land, and not yours to give away!""

And so the United Nations said: Well, like it or not, Arabs, this *is* British land to give away.  And we all think giving some of it to the Jews is a great idea because we have 3 million refugees that we don't want to have to deal with anymore.  But here's a compromise... we'll give them a state, and at the same time we'll create a new state for you with part of that land.

And the Arabs said: ""Fuck that... we're not giving up *any* of our claim to the Jews.

And the Jews were like, ""Well, to be fair, most of you Arabs didn't have much of a life here until we built up the economy here for several decades.""

And the Arabs said, ""that's cool and all, but this is our land, and we're not giving it up.""

And the Jews said, ""Actually, before you murdered and exiled our ancestors, this *was* our land... so you aren't the only ones with an historic claim.  And right now this is British land, and they've agreed to give it to us.""

And the Arabs said: ""Over our dead bodies.""

And the Jews said: ""So be it.  We just watched 1/3 of our entire population get slaughtered because we were unable to defend ourselves.  We're all homeless and we need a new start.  We're taking this land that Brits and the UN say we can have.  You're just going to have to deal with that, because we don't really give a fuck anymore.""

And so Israel became a State.  And a lot of Arabs decided to attack the new state of Israel, and a lot of Jews decided to force a lot of Arabs out of the new state.  

All the surrounding Arab nations got together and tried to take Israel down, but they found that Israel, funded mostly by France at that time (not the US), had a pretty impressive army, and they were very, very good at fighting.

So then, after getting their asses kicked a few times, all the Arab states decided to team up for one big coordinated strike on Israel.  They lined up all their armies on Israel's borders and prepared to attack.

Israel did a massive preemptive strike and took all the land currently known as ""the occupied territories"".  

They also took some land from Egypt- but they immediately traded it back to Egypt in exchange for a peace treaty which has lasted to this day.

They tried to trade the West Bank back to Jordan in exchange for the same peace deal, but Jordan wasn't having it.

Jordan also wouldn't let in any of its *own* citizens who were trapped in the occupied territories.

And so, all these unhappy Arab refugees were left in the West Bank and Gaza.  Israel ran these territories for a while, and things weren't so horrible... all this poverty wasn't a problem yet.

Then the Israelis handed control of the municipal functions of the occupied territories to the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) under Yassar Arafat.

Arafat became a folk hero to his people, and for the next few decades he was the only leader that Israel could talk to about making a permanent peace with the ""Palestinians"" (the *new* name given to all the Arabs in the occupied territories.  Before the occupied territories, there was no nationality called Palestinian).

Anyways, it turns out that Arafat likely thought that any permanent peace deal would result in him losing some of his power, so while he hinted at peace off and on for 3 decades, he was also funding and supporting massive waves of terrorist attacks on Israel.  He was also personally hording 2 *billion* dollars in aid money that was supposed to go to his people.

Under President Clinton, Israel and Arafat almost reached a peace deal.  Israel offered 97% of the land that Arafat had asked for, as well as municipal control of half of Jerusalem (Israel's capital).  Arafat walked away from the peace talks, saying that there could be no peace without a ""right of return"" for Palestinians.

Right of Return would mean that Arabs would be allowed to flood into Israel unrestricted.  Current demographic trends suggested that if that were to happen, then within 3 generations there would be more Arabs living in Israel than Jews.  And *that* would mean that Israel would eventually be voted out of existence- certainly as a Jewish nation, but possibly also as a free democracy.  Israel was not willing to shoot itself in the head like that, because without a firm Jewish identity and majority, they could not guarantee that they could defend themselves against another genocide like the holocaust.

So... Arafat declares it's time for another round of terrorism.  And Israeli/Palestinian relations (which had been pretty good for a little while) suddenly turned completely to shit.  And Israel decides once and for all that it can never reach a peace agreement with Arafat.  They want him dead, but they also know that they can't kill him because he is a folk hero.

So things basically were put on hold for another decade while everyone just waited for Arafat to die.  Violence on both sides was pretty harsh.  And while the Israelis couldn't *kill* Arafat, they certainly did a good job humiliating him.  They essentially kept him imprisoned in his PLO compound for a long, long time.

So eventually Arafat dies.  And their is a brief hope that this is FINALLY a new chance for peace.  But no pro-peace leaders emerge in Palestine- well, they do, but they don't have the support of the people, so they can't get anything done (they basically don't have the power to call of the Palestinian terrorists).

Eventually Hamas (a terrorist organization) gets elected to power, and Israel refuses to deal with them at all.  Things really get shitty for the Palestinians now, because Israel decides that the Palestinian people are going to get punished for electing Hamas.  So the anti-terrorist attacks get more brutal, the border crossings get more restricted, and the imports get cut back only to the bare essentials.

Palestinians become waaaaay more miserable, but of course, instead of blaming Hamas, they blame Israel. 

Meanwhile Ultra-religious nutcases in Israel keep building settlements in the occupied territories (sometimes with the blessing of the government, sometimes not).

7,"I personally see the Palestinians as the ultimate victims in the situation, but not for the simplistic reasons usually debated. In addition to abuse from these ultra-orthodox settler parasites (and those who fund and enable them domestically and internationally), they are used by other governments in the region as a convenient distraction from their domestic problems (Lebanon/Syria/Egypt/Iran), as well as suffering from their own corrupt government that funnels development money (eg Yassar Arafat's $1.3b in wealth).

Why does the Arab League still have a prohibition against granting citizenship to Palestinians? Why do the oil-rich Gulf countries provide little in terms of infrastructure money (which comes mainly from the US and the EU)? Why hasn't the Palestinian, Israeli and other neighboring governments been focusing on building a viable state (a long time ago)? Why does the Israeli government seem unwilling to stop this settlement business, which it obviously hurts their position internationally?

This mess wouldn't be still going on ~60 years later if people really wanted the situation to be resolved. It's important to understand why. Without exploring the nuances of the situation, people seem to end up supporting one of the extremes in this situation (blindly pro-Israel or blindly Free Palestine!) This kind of polarization makes any useful discussion impossible.

I want to support the secular component of Israel, because it is a pretty innovative country that (at least on paper) supports the kind of modern government and legal system that I take for granted in the west, and definitely don't see in many middle eastern countries. However, the government allowing these ultra-orthodox sociopaths to punch above their weight in the political discourse, and other activities that start making the government look no better than despots in the area... well...

2,"&gt;it's not a matter of Israel's military might. It's the big brother effect where the UN is toothless as long as the US has a veto and takes the Israeli side.

Let's not pretend like the UN is some impartial body trying to be an honest broker for peace.   The UN has been applying bald-faced double standards to Israel for decades, going so far as singling out Israel as a violator of women's rights.  

Forgetting that Israel is really the only state in the entire middle east where women truly have equal rights, the whole argument was that because Israel ""oppresses"" Palestinians, and some Palestinians are women, they must must be oppressing women"".  Meanwhile, that same UN motion completely ignored all the Muslim theocracies where women get stoned to death as a punishment for shaming their families by being raped.

&gt;Equally, the military victories, regardless of who funded them were means to and end of fulfilling the historical claim to the land.

No at all.  Those military victories were about STAYING ALIVE.  Israel had a brand new state that was under constant attack.  It had everything to do with the present day, and nothing to do with the past.

&gt;Fair enough, and technically speaking the land was the British's to give away but the reasoning behind it is despicable.

How is giving a homeland to 3 million homeless Jews, who were the survivors of the worst genocide in history ""despicable""?  I mean really, I don't care which side of the conflict you come down on, you're really being deliberately obtuse if you can't understand that this was legitimate solution to a crisis that had no perfect resolution.

&gt;""we used to own it, so give it back"". The roman empire covered most of continental europe, do they have a claim to take it back?

It's like you didn't even read what I wrote.  You're just arguing with your own assumptions.  Jews were trying to buy their way into that land for decades because it was their historic homeland.  But ultimately that was just the toe in the door for the real movement.  This was about refugees needing a defensible homeland after nearly becoming extinct.

Is that a good enough reason to displace the people who already lived there?  In a purely number-based, heartless cost-benefit analysis the answer is yes.  A lot more people were helped than harmed.  And it's a whole lot more justified than taking land because of ""manifest destiny"" the way Americans did.

But where the Arabs on that land flat-out robbed... sure they were.

But when you really take a moment to analyze the situation, you'll see that the creation of the State of Israel was actually one of the least bloody examples of the creation of a nation.  The way people talk about it, you'd think it was one of the worst.  People tend to lose perspective about that.

If you're a woman, being topless in public can land you in jail. Drinking alcohol in public/outdoor places attracts trouble from cops unless it's hosted by an organization with a permit to serve. Gently placing your pinky finger on a cop's shoulder will get you a good tasering and jail time for assault and resisting (serious offenses).

* *What are smart, but legal ways to save money?*

Costco (or its lesser competitor Sam's Club). ALDI is also very cheap store. Learn to like Asian and Mexican food, burgers, and bagels.

* *Any thoughts on where it is affordable and interesting to live?*

Nothing in the bay area is affordable. Anything that's interesting will be astronomically priced.

* *What drugs will they put in my sammiches?*

The beef and pork may taste funny to you. This is because of the estrogen pumped into the beef and because American's don't castrate pigs that go to slaughter. You'll find that American bacon is incredibly fatty and salty. And whole raw chickens sold in the stores will be unusually large--almost like small turkeys.

* *What is so obscure that I can't even think of, that might cause trouble?*

Don't criticize ""Amurrica"" while in America. Don't flash your money around or display excessive bling. Don't ride the metro city bus if you have alternatives. Finding a good small time bakery is difficult sometimes.

* *What are importantly trivial differences between the US and european countries, besides what I already know of?*

Start learning Spanish, now. Americans rarely cook at home. When they do it's usually boxed or pre-prepared food. Don't vacation in the southern states for too long; you'll get a headache. For weekend holiday, Seattle, WA has a Europy feel to it.

[Sweden](http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/3083/a/125282) this is damn near a mirror of US Immigration law, few differences at all here, save the policy of EU movement - we let anyone coming here to work for a company here come in as long as their company endorses them, they dont have to come from a specific group of countries.

[Switzerland](http://www.bfm.admin.ch/bfm/en/home/themen/arbeit/nicht-eu_efta-angehoerige/grundlagen_zur_arbeitsmarktzulassung.html) since most argue moving to the US for gainful employment, i direct you to the non-eu citzens section, showing a yearly cap (something the US also employees on immigration) and as well, a 90day cap on EU citzens working in switzerland before they must gain work permits.

These billionaires are not good.  They are correcting or atoning for their insatiable lust for material possessions.  Hopefully they've learned their lesson.  They've earned this money by often abusing the labor force, by giving workers bad working conditions or encouraging and subsidizing others who abuse workers, by treating them poorly, as expendable resources, without respect, abusing competition (Microsoft was convicted in two courts of law, in USA and in EU), etc.

Charity is a *step* in the right direction.  It's a step on the path toward a correction, a healing.  It's not good in and of itself.  A moral man doesn't need to do charity because a moral man doesn't have any excess to begin with and doesn't mistreat anyone (doesn't seek to maximize profits, doesn't seek to juice the world out of its juice).

5,"&gt;Of course Iran is a threat to Israel, in rhetoric as well as action. Ahmadinejadâs constant and public threats against Israel and Jews 

Which ones?

&gt;are matched by his material support for Hamas and Hezbollah, 

Don't really care and his support isn't as significant as the fact that these movements wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Israeli belligerence and oppression.

&gt;and his pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Nope.

&gt;Against heavy domestic right-wing pressure, the Obama administration (with support from Russia, China, Europe and Israel) made Iran a generous offer: âcontinue your nuclear program out in the open, with a fuel swap arrangement as a safeguard, and face no further sanctions.â Iran declined the offer, and opted instead to continue its clandestine program, without providing any evidence thats its intentions were benign. All this at great cost to its economy I should add.

Except Iran has no obligation to abide by the US's demands as it has not been found to be in violation of the NPT.  The US is trying to exert powers it doesn't have, Iran is pointing out it has no right to do so, and the US is being a baby and imposing sanctions.  Sanctions that, by the way, are probably not too economically significant.  Certainly not as economically significant as the consequences of Iran giving into pressure from the US and Europe and not diversifying its energy sources.

&gt;As for the âreelectionâ of A-Jad, I donât think you really understand the concept of democracy. Elections donât work if the electorate is terrorized into voting one way or another, and they donât work if the results are not transparent and verifiable.

This sort of overly broad definition of ""democracy"" would render most elections in the entire world illegitimate, especially the part about ""terrorized into voting one way or another.""  That point aside, citation that people were being terrified into voting for Ahmadinejad on a wide scale prior to the election?

0,"&gt;For one thing, how do you determine whether someone today benefited from the slavery that took place?

You seem to be asking quite a few very odd questions here. You're actually asking how slavery benefited white Americans? Aside from the free labour, the money gained from the slave trade, a race based ideology that divided lower economic classes, blunted criticism of ruling class white men, and so on?

&gt;And then at that point you have to determine why you can group all white people together.

Even lower class whites were not themselves enslaved, and after Slavery began the century of Jim Crow which did not affect even the worst off white American, who at least was understood as American full-stop and had no laws explicitly targeting him or her (at least in their position as white people. As women or workers they were targeted) while many people of colour including blacks, Mexicans, and Chinese immigrants were very often the specific targets of deep seated institutional racism.

Are you seriously asserting that it's hard for you to see how that disadvantages people of colour in relation to whites?

Slavery and segregation as well as its cultural analogues in other countries benefitted whites by ensuring people of colour did not have their interests represented, could not compete for jobs, space in schools, or other cultural resources, and provided an ideology that allowed white people (white men most especially) to feel entirely superior to others by virtue of being white, such that colonisation was justifiable and even seen as necessary (see ""The White Man's Burden"") and it continues to this day by supporting a vastly unequal socio-economic system in which people of colour remain underrepresented and disproportionately poor and marginalised, as well as convenient scapegoats for national problems, see: America's paroxysm about Mexican immigration, ACORN, and black political activists, as well as the insistent race baiting directed at Barack Obama.

&gt;Pretending that it doesn't happen is just plain ignorance. And it's real and actual.

Discrimination happens against heterosexual people? What, are you referring to gay clubs or something? Give me a break, Feuilly.

Also, what systematic discrimination do whites face that disadvantages them as a group, disempowers them, misrepresents them or underrepresents them, leaves them economically segregated or results in systematic stereotyping that leaves them without work, cruelly stereotyped in the media, and a popular scapegoat in Western politics.

You also say a lot about how US-centric I am but these problems are pretty endemic throughout the West and work in very similar ways, whether it's the treatment of Aborigines in Australia, First Nations women in Canada, Muslims in France, Turks in Germany, Muslims in Australia, various Asian immigrant groups in the UK, and so on. Your comments about my Ameri-centrism are, frankly, bizarre since many Western countries were colonial powers and benefitted immensely from white supremacist ideology that leaves toxic residue to this day.

&gt;Last time we had this discussion it was decidedly US-centric, as is the whole 'skin colour as single group' discussions ultimately are

Bad grammar aside, like I said that's pretty erasing to ethnic minorities in several western nations (you can even include Russia in this which has rather severe problems with racism, and white privilege *there* remains very much a legal and social reality as well). Where *do* you live, exactly?

So, if I'm ""trivialising"" the supposed bigotry against heterosexual people and white people it's because it's so rare and so isolated that it *is* trivial and not an endemic social problem. Put another way I'm trivialising it because you seem to be using it to suggest either that people of colour don't have it so bad or that the structural discrimination against them doesn't matter. The reason also that, as you say, 'skin colour as a single group' exists is because *that is how people are discriminated against* and thus it makes sense to identify and combat racism along those lines.

&gt;than there is between the amount of discrimination that these disadvantaged groups receive in the West and the brutal treatment that exists in developing countries.

Not only is it pretty racist to suggest that the immense inequalities faced by people of colour in the West doesn't matter compared to ""developing countries""- it's rather ironic that you hearken to nations whose impoverishment and continued exploitation are the direct result of past colonialism by European powers and the ongoing neocolonialism of Western corporations and governments (again, you may also include the USSR which, while not Western per se, exercised immense imperialist power over decolonising countries along with the US and its Western allies).

I get the distinct sense you've never *been* to an economically depressed area in London, Paris, Sydney, New York, Los Angeles, or Berlin. Nor did you seem to pay much attention to how institutional racism left New Orleans here in the US inadequately prepared for a hurricane and also ensured black communities were heavily concentrated in flood zones.

&gt;and you linked to some article that a person wrote about how seeing people of a similar skin colour in places around society was privilege. 

Peggy McIntosh said quite a few things besides, as did I. There was no ""basically it"" about it. As I recall you continued to shift your perspective from individual to national to ill defined social as suited your need to rebut anything that was said.

But can you demonstrate to me the immense and crippling discrimination suffered by heterosexual people and whites that leaves them at a marked disadvantage in society? Or the lengthy history of oppression they have which echoes in the present day?

Any incident of discrimination is wrong. But if you're asking me to put a single white person who may have in some small way been discriminated against (like say, having to eundure a ""Chinese guy"" saying he's filthy) on a level par with the vast economic inequalities in the West, the onslaught levelled at Muslims throughout the West, America's racist prison industrial complex and its racist War on Drugs, and the culture of racism that makes Fox News, the Daily Mail, the Sydney Daily Telegraph and Bild profitable, as well as the culture that gives rise to small but very active anti-immigrant parties in the West, then yes I'm going to have to say one is trivial relative to the other as a speck of dust might be when compared to The Moon.",0,,False,1280978421,t3_cwui4,t1_c0vyyrh,t5_2r2jt,,1426408981,,TwoXChromosomes,t1_c0w028a,c0w028a,0,0,0,True,True,Qeraeth

2,"&gt;I was trying to say that my previous comment had nothing to do with their rights. I have continued to make that claim.

And you failed.

&gt;My point is that all of the boundaries and identifications in question have been fluid. (your previous ""point"")

And we are back to the argument shit happens. There is an old argument in America that is patently false. That Native Americans didn't understand propery rights and therefore lost their land in treaties. This is pure nonsense, as is the boundaries are fluid argument.

The inhabitants had property rights by living there. The few Jews living there had property rights as well. The problems came when European Jews displaced rightful owners of property from their lands. And it continues in Jerusalem and the settlements, today. That is the bullshit put forth by Israel while it continues to go about dispossessing Palestinians.

You can claim that borders being fluid, or Jordan claiming territory makes it right to disposess the Palestinians. You can claim that the Israelis reaped the spoils of war, which of course, the UN and international law does not support.

You can claim that Israels rights somehow by a huge magic wand supersedes Palestinian rights, and even claim you aren't making the argument you are making. All of it is circular and nonsense argument.

First you argue that Nazi's didn't confine Jews to ghettos, then you argue that the Gazans are reasonably confined. Then you argue the Muslims control Jerusalem.  If anyone is denying the Holocaust it appears to be you. You also appear to be in complete denial of the situation in Israel and Palestine.

&gt;You are working to pretend that the death camps don't matter.

Demonstrate that by ANYTHING I said. You sir, are a major Bullshit artist who makes wild claims of whole cloth without any factual support.

The last point I made is that by Israeli's not seeing their strategy in the context of history are setting themselves up for failure. A two state solution is the only solution, but Israel must give up the settlements. Israel must invest in the Palestinian state and usurp the upper hand they have given Hamas and Fatah, by making Palestinians realize they will prosper by eschewing those groups. However, it cannot be made with the phoney attempts, for show, that Israel currently makes to play to a western audience.

This is not the 1800's. Portraying the Palestinian people as terrorists while continuing to deny them equality and stealing their lands will not sell. The Palestinians out populate and will grow faster than Israeli Jews, unlike the Europeans and Native Americans. You cannot destroy them in the manner the US did.

When there is a surplus of land and few people to work it it's in the producers best interest to own slaves. Under those situations and in those societies we see oppression and slavery take root. We see people dehumanized and make property or chattle. 

These days slavery wouldn't be profitable. Our economics are different. Instead we have a small amount of land and a huge number of potential workers. It makes no sense to own a person, have to take care of their shelter, food and clothing when you can pay them a menial wage and then replace them if they're sick or burnt out. 

But race plays an impact in average earnings. I'm Canadian so pardon the fact that my stats are going to shift slightly to women of colour in Canada. Aboriginal Women of colour are our lowest earning wage bracket. The whiter your skin not only the more educated you likely are but some studies have shown the ""whiter"" your name the higher the marks and the more likely you are to get called back for a job interview.

Following the 1868 change to the fourteenth amendment that allowed citizen ship to Black Americans and up until 1871 conservative figures put the number of Klan murders for those years in the 20, 000's with additional tens of thousand other acts of violence being committed against people of colour.In 1871 President Ulysses S. Grant became the first president who suspended the writ of habeus corpus during peacetime and sent federal soldiers in parts of south Carolina. The Klan members brought to trial were community leaders, doctors, lawyers, politicians. And yes whites were killing people of colour before the KKK but it amplified the violence and it timed it to drive voters of colour away from using their rights.   

But by that point the message had been sent and the damage had been done. It just took the mention of a threat to scare voters away. 

It's in these roots of seeming racial superiority and power inequalities that institutional racism took seed. 

It came out of pseudo scientific ideals that were held as truth that caucasians specifically white people of European descent were biologically a different species from people of colour. That whiteness some how meant intellectual, moral and ethical superiority. 

And as a society we're still dealing with the repercussions of that. Many of them so systemic that we're not consciously aware of them with out active thought. 

When it comes to unpacking white privilege I would really heavily suggest checking out Peggy McIntosh [White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nymbp.org%2Freference%2FWhitePrivilege.pdf&amp;ei=9GdaTI35A5TksQO-2-RB&amp;usg=AFQjCNHc4ofQVRK9tZKwkqYpK_hXr1KI3w&amp;sig2=__XmxLRUHgASvesXLKdbdA). It's a really good introduction to the small ways privilege plays a role in our lives. 

If you're still having a tough time wrapping your head totally around it look at your own life. Look at an area where you deal with oppression. Be it class, be it race, be it gender, be it sexuality, be it ability level... etc.

Look at that list with your own life experience and adapt it to fit your own personal struggles. How don't you fit the social ideals that culture and media represent? How does that impact your life? Your access to services? Your resources? Your options? 

If you can make that connection try reading the list but take it from the perspective of ""How would I want someone who approached my own list to think and consider these points.""

Although that also means because [Jews share many chromosomes with other Semites and Europeans](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100603123707.htm), Jews aren't a race.

2,"&gt;Sure, as long as we ban ALL religious and cultural symbols from the courtroom...

IMHO this is highly illiberal and will not go anywhere towards ensuring that religion doesn't enter the minds of jurors, judges, witnesses, lawyers or observers.

Certainly we don't want a cross above the judge's bench but if people want to wear a crucifix then they can go right ahead but I  do not approve.

&gt;Now excuse my ignorance, do we swear on the bible in Australia? (sorry Ive never broken a law that Ive been caught for and i grew up watching Law and Order)

You must make a choice between a solemn affirmation or a religious oath ([s 21 of the Evidence Act (Cth)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s21.html)) and you must be informed of this choice. If you refuse to make a choice you are forced to make an affirmation. ([s 23 of the Evidence Act (Cth)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s23.html)). Note that substantially similar sections exist in NSW and Victoria too.

There is no need for a religious text to be used when making an oath and, interestingly, if you take the oath there is no requirement that you believe in the particular deity you are swearing to ([s 24 of the Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/s24.html)).


Whatever it is all that matters is that it binds your conscience so as to ensure you tell the truth.

&gt;when i say my Atheist pledge

You could make a non-religious, secular affirmation in [this form](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea199580/sch1.html).

Unlikely. If they do think that way then there's a chance they'll be excluded anyway.

&gt;the entire ""ban the burqa"" movement reeks of racism...

I respectfully disagree. It has taken a lot of anti-social behaviour on the part of too many Muslims towards Western society in general. The Netherlands for a long time favoured multiculturalism but now is finding the anti-Western backlash from many members of the Muslim community (see the Jyllands-Posten Cartoon Controversy and the butchering of Theo van Gogh!) to be too much and is quickly rejecting that world-view.

I think it is symptomatic of a kind of cultural war between western liberal values (where I stand) and Islamic values including Sharia law and compelling women to dress as they do.

While we should be able to get along Europe is finding that their Muslims can't or won't integrate, the UK is struggling, the USA is doing slightly better but the strain is still there and we are relatively untouched by those kinds of vicious fundamentalists which have damaged if not destroyed Islamic-Western relations.

I actually approach the issue from a different angle and instead ask what has happened to make liberal western democracies like Spain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium seriously consider passing laws to ban the burqa, and what does that say about the rights and wrongs of the situation?

&gt;we don't seem to have a problem with a Nun? If there a little old nun dropping off the weekly tithes to her local bank would we ask her to remove her habit?

The key difference is you can see her face and it is not imposed on her. She makes that choice of her own free will although certainly there was a time when this was not the case.

The problem with the burqa is that is appears to imprison women by shutting them out of the rest of society and it is an item of dress which they cannot freely choose not to wear for reasons of significant cultural, familial and religious pressure.",0,,False,1280999860,t3_cxiel,t1_c0w0o3n,t5_2qh8e,,1426409288,,australia,t1_c0w0plz,c0w0plz,0,2,0,False,True,twistedd

2,"""It depends"".

I can't comment with any degree of authority on the US, beyond what I have seen on recent visits to coastal cities and heard from friends/read online, but it appears to me that a lot of especially staple foods would not be imported, due to the enormous agricultural output of the country.  And particularly in higher-end places, I've seen a strong move toward locally produced high-quality foodstuffs in restaurants and markets as people catch on to farming techniques for things like oysters and sturgeon, and learn to make and sell good bread and cheese.

In Europe, remember that unless you're somewhere like France, with its very very broad range of agricultural production, or the Netherlands, with a strong culture of greenhouse growing, you'll almost have to have some of your food imported from somewhere else.  In its worst form, you have abominations like tomatoes being picked in country A, transported to country B to be peeled and canned, and transported to country C to be sold, sometimes even more than that.  This is the result of (a) interlinked economies, (b) highly variable costs of labor, and (c) really screwed up subsidy and tax politics -- but that's a different story.

Now, it's a question as to whether a given foodstuff is being trucked from 500km away, or from flown in from another continent.  The salmon we're eating tonight will most likely have been raised in a biological farm in Scotland or Norway and shipped down (Paris).  The steak at the great Argentine place down the road comes from, well, Argentina -- that's the whole definition.  But these are exceptions.  Widespread exceptions, but still vastly in the minority.

1,"&gt;We are not talking about America. So I will make my point again so you can stop with the straw: every single country in the Middle East had one or more boundary changes in the 20th century. That is not ""shit happens"", that is ""none of those boundaries are set in stone"". Instead of responding to what I say you make shit up and change the subject.

I have compared the taking of land by Israel to America. So we ARE talking about America. America claimed there were only European borders in the new world. They completely ignored Native American claims. You say this is not ""shit happens"". You state that the boundaries are fluid. This is true all over the world. So is this a totally unrelated fact or a justification for taking of land by Israel? If it isn't a part of your argument, then why state a random fact? It is the argument that borders change so Israel isn't really taking land. That's a ""shit happens"" argument, and is a dumb argument. Israel is responsible for its actions. How about dealing with the consequences of your statements rather than call any interpretation ""not what I said""?

&gt;To call Gaza like the Warsaw Ghetto is to deny what made the Warsaw Ghetto significant.

No it isn't. That is your argument. They are both acts of confinement. It is confinement in poverty, and Nazi confinement wasn't limited to Warsaw. If you cannot understand confinement in a ghetto as mistreatment and somehow believe based on others doing it, justified, then you are blind to Israel's inhumanity, simply because it hasn't led to death camps. That's another dumb argument.

&gt;I said that Muslims controlled Jerusalem. Got the past  tense part?

 So your argument is that because something happened in the past Israel is justified doing it today? Another stupid argument.

&gt;I have, I'll do it again: you keep asserting that Gaza is like the Warsaw Ghetto in some meaningful manner. Either you are claiming that there are death camps right now in Israel or you are saying they did not exist or were not significant to the Warsaw Ghetto. Which is it?

Lots of modifiers you added there. I never said what you are trying to twist it into. Another phony argument. Very creative, but still phony.

&gt; A position I have stated many times here. But because I, unlike you, don't accuse Israel of genocide I am called a fundamentalist and a zionazi.

I never called you anything, except a troll, when you made snarky remarks rather than respond. While I consider Israel racist and guilty of theft of land, and policies that cause people to die, I haven't accused them of genocide. Ethnic cleansing is something closer to what their policies approach.

&gt;Wow, only off by about 2 centuries. The Palestinians are today terrorists,not in the 1800's. They use weapons that are inherent war crimes to terrorize Israeli civilians. But you seem blind to that.

One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. It's a lame term, mostly propagandist in nature. It's a tactic in which Israel engaged at it's inception. Tell me which is more terrifying small unaimed missiles or large targeted missiles? The uneven killing that Israel engages in is certainly far more terrifying than the Palestinians. I don't support either.

You missed my point about the 1800's and America's ethnic cleansing. It was largely ignored. Israel's ethnic cleansing won't be ignored.

I do not think a European Jew (or Russian, or American Jew) has any right to one inch of Palestine. They are more than welcome to stay if they had not been the colonizers and conquered the land. 

Honestly, the Americans are bitching about Mexicans illegal immigrants. Imagine if these Mexicans conquered, and ethnically cleansed certain parts of the US...kinda like how the Whities ethnically cleansed the Natives in North America (perhap it explains the ""special bond"" with Israel that American policy makers have with Israel)...oh well.

A lot of people think their perceived streak of creative genius allows them to be utter cunts. I work in advertisement and see it every day.

His sketches are terrible. His workers are slaves that have to thank Jesus for holding such a sought-after, awfully paid position.

Also most people who work in creative fields are assholes. Period. They can drink booze for 500 bucks and then argue with the waiter about the ""high cost"" of the champagne, while the poor sod did a superb job catering to their retarded needs and even offered 3 rounds of shots for free. I once was so embarrassed that me and my friend, who both stuck to beer, basically took over some of our ""friends'"" tab because they couldn't get their fucking money together. Even after us donating 100 bucks they wanted to fucking tip the waiter for 3 bucks, while they drank Aperol / Prosecco for 500 bucks. So we also gave him the tip. Cunts.

So when people think 'Afghanistan', they'll remember the burqa debate at home.

&gt;In the late 1920s Lysol disinfectant began being marketed by maker Lysol, Incorporated and distributor Lehn &amp; Fink, Inc. as a feminine hygiene product. They intimated that vaginal douching with a Lysol solution prevented infections and vaginal odor, and thereby preserved marital bliss[7]. This Lysol solution was also used as a birth control agent, as post-coital douching was a popular method of preventing pregnancy at that time. The use of Lysol was later discouraged by the medical community as it tended to eliminate the bacteria normal to the healthy vagina, thus allowing more robust, health-threatening bacteria to thrive, and may have masked more serious problems that certain odors indicated in the first place.[8] All the same, Joseph De Lee, a prominent American obstetrician who held great sway over American obstetric practice through his writings, encouraged the use of Lysol during labor. ""...[J]ust before introducing the hand, the vagina is liberally flushed with 1 per cent lysol solution squeezed from pledgets of cotton, the idea being to reduce the amount of infections matter unavoidably carried into the puerperal wounds and up into the uterus by the manipulations."" [9]
In the US, from around 1930 to 1960, vaginal douching with a Lysol disinfectant solution was the most popular form of birth control.[10] US marketing ads printed testimonials from European ""doctors"" touting its safety and effectiveness. The American Medical Association later investigated these claims. They were unable to locate the cited ""experts"" and found that Lysol was not effective as a contraceptive.[10]

Let's examine this as objectively as we can manage.  Lets assume a 40 hour work week where the employer pays for lunch, as the employer should be doing, which results in a real 8 hour day instead of a 9 hour day.  Of course a 9 hour day will work even more in favor of my argument.

You need to sleep 7 to 8 hours to be healthy, on average.  Let's say 7.5.  Then you need to do maintenance, such as taking a shower, getting dressed, handling bills and other inane things that can't possibly count for having a life.  Most maintenance, other than some amount of shitting and pissing, falls on the off-work time.  Then you have a commute.  Let's say you have a 30 minute commute one way, which means 1 hour both ways.  Let's add up and subtract.  7.5 + 1 hour maintenance + 1.5 hours for two decent meals (breakfast and supper, and I am assuming the employer will pay for the lunch). + 1 hour commute and we get 11 hours taken up by various bullshit that we normally don't count as ""having a life.""  24 hours - 11 = 13 hours left.  Out of that time, your employer gets 7 hours (because they pay for lunch, and let's say they don't want to count lunch as a productive hour just like we don't count eating food as having a life on our off-work time either, which makes it fair n square), and 1 hour is ""wasted"" on lunch.  So you are away from home for 8 hours.  So (24 - 11) - 8 = (13) - 8 = 5.  So you get 5 hours of time which we can describe as ""having a life.""  Your employer gets 7 hours, if the employer pays for lunch, as they should be doing.  You lose and your employer wins when it comes to quantity.

If the employer refuses to pay for lunch, then you are absent from home 9 hours, then the equation becomes (24 - 11) - 9 = 4: you get 4 hours and your employer gets 8.  In this case you lose much harder than in the previous case.

Now let's talk about quality.  Quality is just as important, if perhaps even not more important, than quantity.  In most cases, for a normal scenario of a day shift, 9 to 5 shift, the quality of the 9 to 5 time slot is much, much better than the quality of the 5:30 to 10:30 slot.  Why is that?  It should be obvious.  When you wake up, you are fresh, your mind is most clear at the beginning of the day.  At work, you accumulate stress and get tired.  So you come home tired and wasted after a hard day's of work.

So your employer not only gets more hours on a work day, it also gets higher quality hours too.  In a week there are also 2 days off.  Of course on those days you also have more chores to do that you've been putting off on the work days, and plus you need to recuperate from all the stress you've been accumulating the entire work week.

If you're in the USA, your vacation time is likely non-existent (2 weeks and grudgingly it increases to 3 after many years).  If you're in Europe, you probably get 1-2 *months* vacation time right off the bat, which goes a long way toward ameliorating the problem we are discussing.  In many industries it's also the case that even the weekend doesn't belong to you.  You are on-call, or you have to work the weekend, whatever.  Having a commute that's more than 30 minutes one way drastically alters the balance of the formula as well.

So, at least if you are in the USA, chances are you spent your life for the sake of the employer and not for your own sake.  There is no balance to speak of.  The balance is a myth and a mirage and a dream.  In Europe, people may have something that resembles balance due to their more generous law-mandated vacation time and other labor protections.",0,,False,1281041603,t3_cxt31,t1_c0w23a2,t5_2fwo,,1426410058,,programming,t1_c0w2c87,c0w2c87,0,234,0,True,True,[deleted]

Where were you when the west had the Reform party? And the Canadian Alliance? (sounds of crickets).

First of all, weâre not just âa provinceâ, weâre **the founding nation**. We are the ones who put the basis of european civilization up here.

Second, for the last quarter-millenium, the french have been regarded as an inferior people by the english, and they have done all they could to deny us political and economic power. 

In 1982, the liberals repatriated the constitution, and though a series of kitchen deals, have managed to totally exclude us from it.

As a result, QuÃ©bec has stopped voting liberal since 1984, 26 years ago.

Then, the tories (nothing to do with the current Canadian Reform Alliance Party that usurped their name) honestly tried to get QuÃ©bec accept a constitution. They tried twice (Meech &amp; Charlottetown), and both times failed.

As a result, QuÃ©bec has stopped voting conservative since 1993, 17 years ago.

For about 12 years, the liberals managed to get majorities in the Commons thanks to the right being splintered. That ended when the right wingnuts regrouped in the Canadian Reform Alliance Party, then subverted the old tory party, and then they first managed to put the liberals on shaky minority grounds, then they got themselves minorities.

There are 50 solid seats in QuÃ©bec that are beyond the reach of the other federal parties; this is the direct cause of the minority governments.

Imagine! In 1980, the liberals had 74 seats in QuÃ©bec! Thatâs 74 out of 75! Now they can barely get a dozen. And the cons donât fare better.

We vote Bloc because no federal party will address our concerns, and no federal party will address our concerns because they know very well that they are going to lose support elsewhere in Canada.

Basically, that situation has been brought by Canadaâs inability and unwillingness to address our concerns, and for 26 years, Canada has ignored the problem. Well, the chicken are coming home to roost, and itâs time to pay for that neglect.

We are not an insignificant minority, we founded this country; we did the legwork for the foundation of the current country, and all we got was being shoved aside with no recognition. Well, it may be possible to fool people for centuries, but all good things must end.

The time where the french can be dismissed as insignificant is over. We have had a raw deal both in 1867 and 1982. We are not going to lay low and ignore it anymore, nor are we going to hope that the english are going to give us what we need, as History as shown that you cannot expect anything from the english unless you hold a knife to their throat.

0,"I'll define the Greek anarchists' success purely in contrast to American anarchists' failure.
 

Decades of organizing, propagandizing, squatting, rioting and urban guerrilla actions have made anarchism an undeniable factor in Greek politics, *especially* since the (anarchist-tinted) revolt of December 2008. There is an entire neighbourhood in central Athens, called Exarcheia, which is a de factor anarchist region. When I was there last, the police never actually entered because when they did the anarchists attacked them. Instead, the MAT (riot police) stationed riot cops on all 4 sides of the neighbourhood borders, 24/7. So while police do occasionally invade Exarcheia in very large numbers, the fact remains that there is a part of the Greek capital city, a mere 20 minutes walk from the parliament buildings, that is effectively stateless. During the December 2008 revolt, people who had never before fought or rioted came to Exarcheia in very large numbers because everyone knew that is where the people are free, and if you want to fight the government that is where you will find comrades to help you. In the same vein, there are many buildings in many Greek cities and towns that are under anarchist occupation, which provide free housing and social spaces for people. These squats are rarely attacked by the police because doing so would lead to retaliatory attacks by anarchists. One squat, Yfanet in Thessaloniki, is an abandoned textile factory that covers an entire city block, and is the largest squat in Europe. The anarchist group that occupies it has turned it into housing, a social space, a BMX track, a place for music shows, a library with free internet access, and many other things. Again, despite being attacked many times by riot police and fascists (bombings), Yfanet remains an anarchist-held asset because the Greek anarchists are able and willing to defend it.

In American politics, anarchism is a non-factor and on its current course it will continue to be a non-factor indefinitely. There are no anarchist-held neighbourhoods in America like Exarcheia, no anarchist squats in every city, no multi-purpose anarchist compounds like Yfanet. It's so easy to brush this all off and make excuses for failure, but the fact is that this weakness *is on American anarchists*.

1,"&gt;This happens more often than you think, and its not just happening in rural areas. I live in an apartment in Orange County, and my only provider is Cox.

Yet you chose to live there.  I lived in an apartment while my home was being built and Grande had a monopoly on all services within the complex.  I knew this in advance and since it was 3 months, I was fine with it.  Yet when I built my home I made sure that I had a number of options including FIOS.... places with limited connectivity were of no interest.  

&gt;However, there are places of lower population that can only support one ISP. Should they be beholden to the whims of this provider? 

Those places also have a limited number of radio and tv stations that they can recieve.  They have to drive further to seek medical care and go grocery shopping.  It's a choice they made when they decided to live there.  

With the advances of wireless, rural options will get better.  My parents live in a rural area of VA and have a choice of two wireless providers and within a year the cable company will be in their neighborhood.  The wireless companies are using 900 MHz to penetrate the trees, but now that 802.16 is available, higher speeds will be coming with better coverage areas.  

&gt;Allowing competition might solve this many years from now. Mandating Net Neutrality would solve it now.

Perhaps if you ignore unintended consequences.  If I can't filter traffic and a DDoS attack happens on my network, what happens to everyone's access?  If my ToS prohibited a home user from running a web server, and I am no longer permitted to block 80/tcp, what prevents people from setting up web servers in their homes which consume extraordinary amounts of bandwidth?

Net neutrality ignores that all networks are built on oversubscription.  If you have a few users which are willing to consume all of their bandwidth almost all of the time, it's no longer cost effective to operate.  The solution is to raise rates for everyone to fund upgrades, ones that only really benefit a minority of users.

7,"The problem with your position is that it assumes that we have to stay in the same system. Also, it buys into the republican proposition that ""entitlement"" will reduce both ""production and innovation,"" which simply isn't proven. We know that there is suffering and we can demonstrate that through redistribution of wealth that a large portion of it is unnecessary and can be ended. What we do not know is that a system of entitlements will lead to an end to productivity, because no fully entitled system has ever truly existed, and those countries with some entitlements (basically all of Europe) are no less productive or innovative. The conservative thesis is not proven and is more often contravened by the evidence. 

The real issue though is that wealth shouldn't have to be ***re***distributed, it needs to be properly distributed in the first place. The means by which extreme wealth has been concentrated in the hands of the few is because we assume the primacy of voluntary contracts without recognizing that the contracts entered into are pretty much compulsory for those who are not endowed with wealth from historical inheritance and chance. Walmart employees should be getting paid more, they aren't because they have no leverage in negotiating their wages, so the Walton family grabs a disproportionate amount of the wealth from the economic activity of their stores without even a need to work in the stores at all. We wouldn't need to tax the rich and redistribute the wealth through government programs if the working class was given its fair share to begin with. 

Furthermore, another factor in all this is manufactured underemployment. The wealthy don't want full employment because so long as there is a level of unemployment, the working class will be forced to accept lower wages or suffer the consequences of no employment at all.",0,,False,1281067732,t3_cxyt9,t3_cxyt9,t5_2cneq,,1426410600,,politics,t1_c0w3i28,c0w3i28,0,7,0,True,True,exnihilonihilfit

True. I had to try a few times before I found a series that wasn't available.

I see 10 series, all of them from Crunchyroll. I even tried registering to see if that makes a difference (it doesn't). I couldn't find any proper answers but at least their forums seem to indicate they restrict the available content by country.

&gt; For Funimation.com... You're bad at navigating the web, I guess :\

Classy. Typing www.funimation.com into the address bar redirects to navarre.com/funimation. Clicking on the ""Visit Funimation's Consumer Site"" link found there opens a new window which loads the same page. Tried with multiple browsers, computers and IP's. Either their site is broken or they're deliberately fucking with (some?) non-US visitors. Only blog.funimation.com and community.funimation.com work for me (I found those via direct links from other sites). Not that any of this matters because Funimation doesn't allow me to watch their content on Youtube, so I kinda doubt it'd be any different on their own site.

3,"&gt;How is it/What is an ""accident of history"" exactly?

It's an accident of history in that in Europe at least, you could not express in thought or writing any thing which conflicted with Church teachings, for fear of punishment/heresy/book burnings etc. So of course all ethical ideas would have to be developed within a Christian millieu. 

Most of our secular ideals arise from the enlightenment. It was around that time the idea of expressing ethical ideas outside of a christian framework became better accepted. If Christianity had not been the dominant religion (assume an alternate reality where the late Roman Empire did not make Christianity the state religion, or where the Christian religion never existed) the same ethical ideas we have know would still be the same. In fact they might even be a bit more ahead, as they would have had a headstart in terms of the superstitious elements that early christians and middle age christians added to morality, which have no basis in a rational ethical system and we are currently trying to roll back (e.g. homophobia, 2nd class treatment of women, etc).

&gt;Even if we take your argument, you still can't deny the fact that Christianity has helped a lot of people build/rebuild good lives; AA, youth-centres, homeless shelters, charities, orphanages, etc. Lots of people in these situations near suicidal-levels often have their lives turned around by the help of these organisations and ""the light of God"".

Equally, I could use the same reasoning to say Christianity has done as much or more things to destroy lives. Behind the house where my father lived as a child there was a Magdalen laundry, where the church imprisoned enslaved women who had the audacity to get pregnant while being unmarried. This is in the 20th century!

""the light of god"" (whatever that is) is an unecessary hypothesis/idea for people to have compassion for other human beings. 
Christianity did not help people build/rebuild lifes. People who felt compassion for others did and whether they were or were not Christian is irrelevant. And that's the umbrage I take at religion- they have succesfully marketed the idea that Religion=good, implying by default that not religion=bad. 

I'm happy for you that christianity is just about living a good honest life. But for 99% of people of all backgrounds life is just about living a good honest life. ",0,,False,1281086383,t3_cxvb6,t1_c0w402f,t5_6,,1426410844,,reddit.com,t1_c0w40uv,c0w40uv,0,3,0,False,True,ruaidhri

- Buy an airline headset adapter (those two-to-one RCA jack thingies.)  You can get them cheaply in almost any electronics store.
- Bring your own sandwich.  It's better and cheaper than anything you're bound to get on planes.
- Liquid rules are being relaxed, at least in Europe.  I haven't had trouble recently with my toiletries bags.  Bottled water is stupid anyway.  
- I don't see how asking you to pay for a business lounge is ""nickel and diming you to death"" -- it was never free if you didn't have a business/first class ticket.
- Fuck charging more for certain seats, but [SeatGuru](http://www.seatguru.com) is your friend.
- Regarding drinks, bring a bottle and fill it from an airport faucet.  See comment about bottled water.
- No idea what the FAA has to say about this, but EU regulations impose fixed penalties for being bumped.  Yes, it sucks, but at least you're assured of compensation.
- Spirit Airlines carry-on fee -- easy enough, don't fly with them.
- Pay toilets were a publicity stunt by Michael O'Leary (scumbag RyanAir CEO) to get his airline name in the news.  They are not, I believe, legal as a concept anywhere in the civilized world.

A lot of this came about because everyone and their dog wanted cheaper tickets, and because tourists generally reacted more favorably to Ã -la-carte pricing.  Furthermore, air travel is still vastly underpriced -- aviation kerosene is not taxed in almost all of the world.  Air travel is _still_ vastly cheaper than it was in the past; I remember flying transatlantic in the 1970s before deregulation, and it was a much bigger luxury than today.

I'm not saying this is right or good, but at least Americans can thank the absence of a [reasonable alternative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail).

&gt;Not even close. Hell, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were, at best, third for horrific crimes in the Pacific Theatre behind the Japanese rampage through east asia, and behind the conventional firebombing on Japanese cities which would have continued had the bombs not been dropped.

Japan's crimes in East Asia nor the firebombing of Japanese cities diminish the needless inhumanity of the atomic bombings.  The atomic bombings also had the long-term effect of creating a world that would forever live under the threat of complete nuclear destruction.  For 45 years after the war this was a very credible threat.  So the atomic bombings were horrible crimes, period.  I'm not interested in the ""x bad thing was worse!"" game and I'm not going to play it.

&gt;That ""condition"" was to keep their government.

That's an oversimplification by you: they wanted to keep the emperor in place, and were open to the idea of the emperor as a puppet ruler.  Which is what they ended up with after the final surrender anyway.

&gt; The same government that bombed Pearl Harbor and killed 20x (this is being optimistic... it could be as high as 100x) as many civilians in East Asia as the Americans kiled in the bombings in question. 

Comparing civilian deaths Japan inflicted across the entire war to the civilian deaths inflicted just by Hiroshima and Nagasaki is a really ridiculous comparison.  I don't even understand the point of it, unless, again, you're interested in playing one of those ""Well Japan was worse!"" games, in which case you can stop now.  I'm not interested in apologizing for or rationalizing the crimes of Imperial Japan the way you are with the crimes of the US.  

Additionally, who cares if Japan bombed Pearl Harbor?  It was a legitimate military target.  

&gt;Yes, with the benefit of hindsight, that is arguably, not certainly, true.

It's true.  Sorry.

&gt;Really? Most people go the other way. Most people think the first bomb should have been a warning, because Potsdam wasn't enough.

They were both completely unjustifiable, but Nagasaki being dropped just days later for no real reason is especially senseless.

&gt;It's almost impossible to imagine ANY scenario where less Japanese civilians die w/o the use of nuclear weapons with the exception of a warning nuke or a single nuke that causes capitulation.

The US accepting the Japanese surrender terms (which they did in the end anyway) before dropping the bombs would have resulted in less deaths.

&gt;God forbid.

Yes, God forbid, because the US did not want to end the war quickly to benefit the Japanese people, they wanted to end the war quickly to stop the Soviets from overrunning East Asia the way they did Eastern Europe.

&gt;Indeed. You left out: to test the weapon's effectiveness. They intentionally did not target Hiroshima in firebombings just to see how effective the weapon was. There was very obviously push from the inside to try it ""live"".

I'm aware of that as well.

&gt;See, the American nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was complicated, and arguable.

No, it wasn't, fuck you for saying so.  And for the record, no, Japanese war crimes in East Asia and the firebombing of Japanese cities are also not complicated nor arguable, they are wrong, flat out, just like the atomic bombings were.

That part of the world (I'm from near there, across the Swiss border) gets _really_ cold in winter.  And it rains.  

I like the sentiment of making everything public transit-accessible, and increasing bike-friendliness -- but those are positive measures, rather than punitive measures (European gas prices are already quite high.)  Private cars have their place.

There seems to be no differentiation between different kinds of vehicles, leading me to wonder whether the focus is on emissions-, noise-, or traffic reduction, or lifestyle experimentation.

There are downsides for older/disabled people too.  No matter how densely you pack public transportation, someone who is mobility-impaired will inevitably have more difficulty getting on a tram or bus.  This is something that is often misunderstood by environmental advocates; my mom lives on a hill in San Francisco and drives to work -- in city planning meetings she attends, she's often criticized by bicycle advocates who say she should ride bike (hills?  She's 65...) or move to the city center, closer to her work (checked real estate prices recently?)

I'm also concerned by the ""no free-standing houses"" thing -- while it's probably indubitably easier to make clustered residences highly energy efficient, it is by no means impossible to do so for free-standing houses.  My father turned two very inefficient buildings, one a 17th century farmhouse and the other one his house from the 1970s, into as close to energy-neutral as I can think, with extremely effective insulation, photovoltaic and battery power supply, solar water heating, and a low-consumption fireplace that feeds into both the house's hot water and space heating systems.

On the whole, if this is more of a gimmick to prove a point (i.e. ""xyz can be done""), great, but I'd hate to see it used as proof by certain well-meaning urban planners that it's the definitive way to live.

&gt;Actually we stopped having witch burnings when they went too far. They weren't as much about the Christian religion as they were about superstition. People would blame bumps in the night on other people because that's how it worked. Politics got involved as well.

Religious christian superstition in a Catholic society under religious law in Europe, protestant colony under the same self imposed religious law in the colonies. It stopped because rational, secular, enlightened thought imposed itself on the religious. The bible says do not suffer a witch to live. These people were following a commandment from God.

&gt;The Catholic Church wasn't innocent, but the mobs were being worked up by profiteering inquisitors to point out people they hated. The guilty parties were few and in a time of such global ignorance you cannot really blame guilt by inaction.

The property was sold pretty much âas isâ and even still included a majority of the equipment used in the growing operation, including the white buckets and grow lights.",0,,False,1281109557,t3_cy21v,t3_cy21v,t5_2qh0u,,1426411163,,pics,t1_c0w4pim,c0w4pim,0,1,0,False,True,Yangoose
1,"Well,  it is so far back that any trace of it is so dilute;  nonetheless,  it leaves me irate when people are racist of them.  

Your question confused me by this ""...are Romini people like the last people who **you** are allowed to be racist towards?""

You were asking what here exactly?   If you wish to know are the Gypsies are considered a group that it is acceptable pretty much world wide to be bigoted towards and express racism against,  then yes,  sort of.    It isn't just the Romani (gypsies)  but any traveler people (Irish Travelers for example).    Watch any number of british shows,  top gear being a pretty bad offender,   you'll note the term pikie (pikey)  used often,  usually as an adjective referring to something being of negative or suspect quality.    The term pikey was originally referential to Gypsies,  but later took to mean any traveler or lower class person,  this pejorative shift itself shows the class intent by the word from its initial association with Gypsies.   It came from a shortening of ""Turnpike Traveler""  the Pikie/pikey.    

The news casts in many European countries (both east and west)  disparage and group together Gypsies and traveler people in negative light.   Security camera footage of Gypsy criminals stealing is often labeled as Gypsies/Pikies,  etc.  as if to imply that by being Gypsies this is expected.   Let me put it another way,   if you were watching a television broadcast that showed some african-american's stealing from a store and the announcer simply referred to them as ""Blacks""   would that feel a bit uncomfortable to use?   This implies that the theft is typical of blacks and thus to refer to them as such is understood and acceptable;  it is not and neither should such be for any of the travelers.

From the article on the Bakker-Schut plan, the two reasons for not allowing annexation were 1-too many refugees already and 2-the need for a strong West Germany because of the Cold War. While refugees were an immediately pressing problem, the bigger issue was the Cold War. Had there been no Cold War, the Allies would have somehow broken up Germany into smaller pieces to make sure that it did not again threaten Europe.

-6,"yes the japanese and hitler were on a rampage .. and yes they woul dhave used the bomb if they had it..

but we used it 2x.. and i dont know but even 1x seems like OMG.. did they not believe that it could be done? 

what im afraid of was JAPAN WAS LIKE PLEASE DONT PLEASE DONT, or they didnt even know.. and america just SENT THEM AND BAM MILLIONS DEAD..  worst is we will never know.. especially if it was something aweful like that on americas part. 
Yes war is war.. but war is what you make it.. you can rape and abuse.. or you can just kill ... dropping the atom bomb on 1 city was horrendous and should have been denounced and not a single more atom bomb developed.. BUT ON THE CONTRARY more bombs, bigger bombs, and even dropped another one.

The whole administration should have been hanged for crimes against humanity.. BUT THEN THEY SHOUL DHAVE ALSO BEEN HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING HITLER TO RISE TO POWER AND JAPAN TO BUILD THEIR INSANE NAVY... we enabled and allowed it all to happen because PROFITS were too good to pass up...then WW2 happened..

so why are bank robbers guilty of planning the robbery but governments dont have to answer the questions of HOW AND WHY IT WAS ALLOWED... because then very rich and powerful people will be in ditches and not the poor who can be falsely accused and quickly hanged.

And why? because humans CAN.. because then can get away with it.. so they will do it.. its human nature in a society where money is EVERYTHING.. and if lying or killing is how you attain money and it takes minutes to kill.. but years to spend the money.. people will do it.

If you build it they will come, if you build it they will come to tear it down, just because. So dont rule out anything just because its too horrible to believe, the more horrible it is the more the perpetrators thought the reaction would be how you are reacting.. IT CANT BE TRUE.. and so thats the general perception and the guilty are right next to us, like a family member who raped a cousin and nobody knew for years.. then stumbled on it and now what? 10 years worth of lies that you believed? and still you wont have that same approach to government.. they lie and lie and lie.. and the majority still believes them when they say one thing and do something else. 

And the changing of administrations every few terms is the gaurantee that no real results will come from investigations ... once the president is out of the spotlight who would want to prosecute him and put so much negative PR on america? especially when it will mean BIG SPENDERS/INVESTORS wont invest their .0003% of their wealth... but in  reality thats the difference between having a yacht and having 3 yachts and a leer for politicians. America is a crime safehaven.. money buys you freedom .. and if not freedom then a government position. And all the laws are setup to aid the corruption and help it grow.. if everyone is on the take then what? Then 9/11 you idiots. We too gullible, and we are too narrow minded because that is what religion teaches... only think about what is in the book and nothing more.. and education in america is setup to keep kids from logic and really raising their IQ...outside the US .. eduction is so different.. but in america ther is more money and ability.. but out there theres more actual learning and substance in schools. In america 5th grade math is done in 2nd grade in russia.. and same in europe.. and thats just one of hundreds of little details that shape americans's perception of what is happening in the world and the direction it is going in, believing what they are told but seeing a different result every 10 years. 

Everything is thought through and setup perfectly for enabling legal crimes.. raising income taxes, DEFENSE SPENDING OUTSIDE OF OUR DEFENSES.. a bomb is not defense to me, it is aggression. Just like freeing Iraq by causing as many civilian DEATHS as we did.. that is unnaceptable.. to humanity.. but it IS acceptable to americans.. primarily because if they are not THERE witnessing what is happening NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN CARES.. but i bet if you put every american into iraq before 2001  and after 2003 they would either blow their own brains out or become a terrorist by our definitions.. but to them they are freedom fighters.. or sorry thats what the iraqis were when we supplied them with weapons and WMDs against iran. So our meddling is what caused the iraqis to be in their predicament.. and again our actions caused everything since the illegal war.

Where the power is the greatest there should be more accountability and punishment. The higher you go the stricter the laws and penalties, not the other way around. Our presidents seem to have more leniency on them than handicapped steet thugs that were stopped for saggy pants and nothing more. The president and all government positions should have the perception with them that if you do ANYTHING wrong, ANYTHING UNETHICAL.. you will lose your life. They have the highest trust .. they have power over every american...BUT THEY HAVE LESS ACCOUNTABILITY THAN A MCDONADS WORKER. Politicians choose a public life, and thus they should have to answer to higher laws than we do.. they should have every aspect of their lives made public .. if people cannot be trusted then they have to be held completely accountable and not be allowed to have the ability to make the wrong decision. For a politician to make a decision that causes harm to thousands but makes few rich.. he had to meet with people and make actions that will lead to this deal.. if we monitor them 100% of the time and have records of everything then that would be closer to a moral and accountable nation. What is more important than accountability? Freedom? Freedom is not possible while people can make decisions out of choice.. and not out of hard facts. When the president tells us that we have freed iraq from a evil dictatro we are not given solid numbers or proof.. we are told what we need to believe for everything to  be kosher.

If people were outraged about iraq as they were about 9/11 then there woul dhave been mutiny in washington DC.. the public would take up arms and replace the government as allowed by our constitution.. when the government is actively working with corporations to profit regardless of national impact it should be viewed as an act of treason.. not business brings more profits to america... you can make a positive out of the worst negatives... but its the perception that matters. But on top of everything there is this drug called GOD that makes everyone who believes start to hallucinate that a man named jesus is approving everything you do.. and you do everything out of love for jesus.. because you believe jesus would want what you do. If that is not under the influence then i dont know what is.

And through all of this time just goes forward.. and the more shit is going on the less of the shit will ever be exposed for what it really is. 10 people running away is easier to catch than 300 people running away.. infact you wont even spot the 40 that commited atrocities and not just smal small booboos (small smal booboo for the government is thousands of people without their pensions or physical health issues that were not disclosed prior (even though they were known prior by the people pushing for it) to me that is a crime that should see a person in jail longer than a drug dealer who sold crack...but they are not even charged because thats just how the justice system works... it protects the minds while punishing the players. Brilliant system.. took a long time of crime penetration into government to lobby for the proper laws to make it all possible.. and still at it today.. creating laws that make loopholes for creation of small to HUGE profits through whatever scam it is. bernie Madoff was enabled by MANY.. he didnt squeeze by.. he was allowed to do what he did because the people that allowed it were working with him and were part of the PROFIT gang.. not the ones he stole from. 

You bring a gun to a party and get shot with it, you are responsible not the person who shot you.. but in america its the person who shot you and he is labeled a terrorist. When in real life the politician was going to shoot someone and the guy intervened.. but that puts sucha bad light on the politician.. and who will argue with the official story? Someone who will be ticketed or arrested very soon for who knows what they can make up.

Watch the GODFATHER trilogy.. now apply that to the White house, congress, senate.. its aweful to imagine.. but not thinking of it doesnt make it any less true. Every minute politicians are working to harm or screw americans out of their money.. one way or another.. while keeping it legal under US law.. and if it isnt legal then you lobby for law changes to make it legal.. is that the america we think we live in? Is that the america we are pushing onto iraq? Its not that iraq didnt have corruption.. its that their corruption did not include the US government anymore.. and the worst thing you can do to the US is exclude them... if they cannot legally get in then they will find a legal way.. and they did didnt they?

&gt;It's no different from the Salem witch trials, really. The religion of those involved ranks far down on the list of why people were actually killed. Go to Salem sometime and check out the Witch museum. Read a few books on it. It might open your eyes.

I've read a few books on it. A common trope is that it was a class warfare. But one that happened to involve irrational belief in God, the Devil, Jesus, and witchcraft. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. 


&gt;No. I spoke a fact. More blacks are arrested and convicted of crimes than whites. Without further convincing evidence of conspiratorial behavior across the country one must assume that they commit more crimes. That doesn't mean many black people are criminals.

Your implication in your question is that black people are criminals by their very nature of being black. That's how you categorized the question, that's obviously how you feel. You may not want to admit it openly, but why else would you make such an obviously asinine and racist statement?

1,"First off: Texas Jews FTW!
Most people don't know this but TX was the second most populous state for Jews for a period of time in the late 1800's to the early 1900's.  Many boats of Jews from Europe at this time were denied entry at New York due to anti-Semitic sentiment.  The boats would often head down to Galveston and once it was discovered that there was easier entry in Galveston, many boats just stopped heading for New York altogether.  Several Jewish aid agencies sprung up in Galveston to help place newly arrived Jews in jobs.

Anyways, on to the discussion at hand.  As I suspected, your original assertion of internal contradictions is a little off the mark, at least in the case of Reform Judaism.  Reform Judaism was the first Jewish movement.  It was founded during the heyday of the Enlightenment era in Germany, which is a point in time that was really about moving away from using God as a catch-all explanation for things that weren't understood and focusing more on science to explain things.  The movement was born out of the fact that, previously, Jews had been segregating themselves into their own communities.  The movement focused on mainstreaming Jews into modern society.  It has always been pro-science, pro-social issues, etc.  

Living a life guided by religious texts that contain non-scientific elements does not necessarily mean that a person believes anything that is non-scientific nor does it mean that a person can't appreciate the scientific method and it's results.  There are certain things that I believe, and there are certain things that I know.  I believe in God.  I *know* that if I heat water up to 100 degrees Celsius at STP it will boil.  I can't prove God exists, but I believe God exists.  Nobody can know God exists or not given current technology and our current understanding of the fundamentals of the Universe.  Anyone who says otherwise is a fool.  And that works both ways.  People who say they know God exists are fools, but so are people who say they know God doesn't exist.  You can never *know* that because it is not prove-able.  At best you can have a hypothesis.  Until someone designs a robust experiment (not possible at this time), you can't even apply scientific principles to a subject like God or spirituality.  It is stupid to even try.  

Sorry I got into a digression there.  What I never could understand about the atheist movement is that they always tend to blur the line between the concept of belief (which is personal) and knowledge (which is universal).  It's the same as confusing hypothesis with data.  At the most basic, the difference between you and me is that we have different hypotheses about the question does God exist.  That doesn't mean either of us doesn't understand science and appreciate it.  ",0,,False,1281124281,t3_cwugm,t1_c0w28qg,t5_2qh2p,,1426411540,,atheism,t1_c0w5ilk,c0w5ilk,0,1,0,False,True,aedile

This is such a misleading standard.  100k per job created assumes that the stimulus money added no value other than job creation.

2,"It seems that the cave is still there, but the house might not be. I found this on one site. I remembered hearing something about the house being destroyed.

This is from http://www.agreenercountry.com/marijuana-news/tennessee-pot-cave-bust-stories-and-pictures


{The Fire and Rumors

On December 5th 2006, the house and a neighboring home about a half mile away, caught fire and burned to the ground. The suspicious fires were intentionally set and sparked a wave of speculation about who, and more importantly, why someone would burn the houses. A popular theory is that the police possibly missed a key piece of evidence during the investigation. Maybe documents or information leading to more underground grows or other co-conspirators in the operation. With the attention to detail that went into hiding the huge grow operation, it seems logical that the police could have missed something small and well hidden within the home. We will probably never know the true reason, but the fact that a second house was also destroyed, fuels suspicion about how large this operation really was (or possibly still is).

There are rumors that a neighbor was found murdered in a house close to the pot cave about 3 or 4 months before the bust. The rumor also says that 2 dead immigrants were found a few days later in the same area. I was unable to confirm whether or not the bodies were actually ever found.

The Auction

On December 8th, 2007, the famous pot cave was auctioned off on behalf of the state. The auction was held in what had been one of the underground growing rooms in the previous marijuana operation. About 170 people, mostly spectators, came to watch the court-ordered sale unfold about 90 feet below ground.

Roth Kase, a Wisconsin-based maker of European-style cheeses, won the auction with a bid of $285,000. The auction included 7 acres of land, the high-tech cave, the burned remains of the house, and a smaller house located behind the original which was believed to house the garden workers. The property was sold pretty much âas isâ and even still included a majority of the equipment used in the growing operation, including the white buckets and grow lights.}

Dear Friend:

Thank you for contacting me regarding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). I welcome your thoughts and comments.

The ninth round of talks on the proposed ACTA recently took place in Lucerne, Switzerland from June 28 through July 1, 2010. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement intends to offset the recent influx of counterfeit and pirated goods. In fact, the ACTA would establish a new international legal structure that countries can voluntarily join. It would create its own governing body outside existing international institutions. The United States has been negotiating with several trading nations, including Mexico, Canada, members of the European Union, and Japan, to build the trade agreement.

Counterfeiting often undermines legitimate trade and the sustainable development of the world economy. Counterfeit and pirated goods have also led to cases of organized crime, as well as potentially dangerous products. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement intends to promote Texasâ legitimate trade and prevent Texans from unintentionally buying dangerous counterfeit products.

Texas has greatly benefited from strong international trade agreements. These trade agreements have supported Texas through reduced consumer prices, open markets for exports, the creation of jobs, and economic growth. Open markets for exports through trade agreements helped Texas exports total $163 billion in 2009. One of the largest benefactors of international trade are our nation's small business owners. Small and medium businesses account for 97% of all American exports. During a time of economic hardship, it is helpful to provide our small business owners, farmers and ranchers access to the international community.

The U.S. must continue to seek opportunities to open up markets through trade agreements with countries across the world â not only for commerce, but also for security. While the economic stability of our state and national economies is a primary objective of many trade agreements, trade agreements also serve the broader purpose of building and improving international relationships. A vital global economy is critical to countering the destructive policies of menacing regimes and protecting the United States from the security threats they pose.

I appreciate hearing from you, and I hope that you will not hesitate to contact me on any issue that is important to you.

Sincerely,
Kay Bailey Hutchison

2. The battlefield tactics of Scipio and Hannibal are amazing.  I don't think the Greeks used much cavalry or archers, they relied more on individual courage rather than battlefield tactics.

38,"There's a nice rule of thumb for when you think someone is ""blind"" or ""brainwashed"" as a society: we're all practically identical. Especially as ""a nation""/""a people"".

I'm not sure why you got that impression from your acquaintances in Beijing, but typically (and especially from the younger generation) you'll hear exactly the same sort of complaints that you hear *everywhere in the world*.

Yes, there are varying degrees of severity, of course - China has spent less time developed by our current standards than say - a European nation, however when it comes down to it - it's all the same. Just with *1.3 billion people*.

It really is *all the same*. People complain about taxes, corruption and not being able to really make a difference. They'll complain about the stupidity of mainstream views. They'll complain about pensions, retirement plans, working conditions.

Everyone is the same, and practically everyone thinks about the same issues in their everyday life.

They probably didn't have blinders on, they just saw no reason in talking to some initially complete stranger that didn't even live there about things more appropriate as a point of discussion between a group of friends having a few beers.

Everywhere you go in the world now, be they desolute and poor or ""moderately OK"", in an undeveloped nation or a developed one, the average human feels powerless, *regardless* of the system ruling over them. Some from the outside, from one perspective, look better than the others. Some nations objectively have it much worse in certain parts - than others. Some are richer nations, some are poorer nations. Some are wartorn.

Some live under a one party system, some live under a two party system, and some live under a 14+ (and however many more) system.
In some systems you vote for a guy that puts out ads talking about cute puppies, in others you join a party and submit to a debate with suggestions that are either thrown out or accepted - or a mixture of both. (or none)

In one view the idea of a gated community with a curfew seems horrific, in another view the idea of homeless people on the streets being seen as ""the norm"" to the point where it's even become a part of the accepted media/movies - is equally horrific.

We can talk about the horrible conditions of prisons in some nations, where the slightest physical abuse is seen as ""barbaric""; while we make fun of many of *our own* prisons where it's perfectly accepted that a person might be killed or raped repeatedly by their fellow inmates because ""that's just the way it is""; where it becomes so common and normal that it acts as a ""lighthearted comical reference"" in a movie just as the screen pans to show yet another group of homeless people pushing a cart crossing the path of the main character, acting as if it's the most natural and normal thing in the world.

We live in a world full of shit, and at most a few of us can feel better about our own shit by pointing out what we consider 'awkward' in someone else's shit. In the end, we are so alike, so absolutely identical, it's enough to drive someone to suicide out of boredom.

Every argument ever written here has been written by someone on a forum somewhere in China. Every blind patriotism you've ever seen a Chinese person do has been rivalled by an American, or any other natinonality.

Every idea or notion of superiority you've ever had about your society and your way of life, has been matched - word by word - by someone in the societies you've felt superior to.

1,"The Second World War was the last war where the embodiment of good versus evil ACTUALLY stood. At least in retrospect it does - considering that the implementations of the 'final solution' were in Germany, I'm not sure that the Allies would have known about it til they reached Germany.

It's amazing to think that the Great Depression had happened so close to the War and so soon after the First World War, and still the various armies brought technological advancements along to WWII. Then there were people who were 18 - 20 by the end of WWI were only 38 - 40 by WWII - the stigma this would have attached to the Germans for the 20th Century would have been immense throughout Europe.

It also was the last conflict that marked the beginning of the end of isolationist America. Up until that point, European problems were generally considered the problems of Europe - that's why America wasn't keen on being involved with the League of Nations.

It was, for all intents and purposes, a second and significant turning point for a lot of world history, which largely disposed of what was left of the old regimes after the First World War. Hence the importance in educational institutions and some academics.

The end result is a fascination with the war - the battles fought, who won, lives lost, who won, who lost, why people fought, who they represented... It is most likely the biggest war event in the 20th Century, not to mention the destruction wrought at Nagasaki and Hiroshima too.

1,"&gt; I am saying that they can get away with illegal activity with lesser punishment than regular citizens. The environment goes a long way toward shaping human behavior...

Ok, this is an excellent point.  You're 100% right that cops CAN get away with more, which they know, so they will on occasion. I think society should call for more harsh punishments for those for whom we entrust our safety.  As much as it hurts me to say this ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" and clearly many are taking advantage of the power without any responsibility.

&gt; I hope that things improve to where people feel at least as satisfied and comfortable with the police as they do in European countries. 

Story time:  I just think this is a bit relevant to the difference in police in other countries.  In italy, a police officer comes to pick up a storekeeper, then walks away with them, not in handcuffs, nor any type of restraint.  When my friend asks him ""What if he runs!?"" the police officer laughs and responds, ""If he runs, he knows I'll just shoot him!""

I think we can both agree that isn't the type of power we want to give the officers in America.

To that effect, I am under the impression that criminal activity in the US is far worse in terms of criminal activity compared to many european nations, as well as holding police officers as completely different parts of society.  I'm not sure that it is really a fair comparison.  

&gt; It doesn't help that there are so many obscure laws that people are unaware of, so many charges filed for a single act of impropriety, and such long sentences dealt out for such harmless activities.

I could not disagree more.  There is absolutely no excuse for ignorance of the law, and in my experience with criminal law, there are VERY few obscure laws that carry extensive charges, and for the most part, we have to remember that there ARE checks in place in a number of ways.  

* Discretion to ticket on the part of the police officer:  This may be the lowest and least executed form of discretion, but it happens occasionally.  Often times I see cases where police will lower the charges on scene as a response to good behavior, which is a misleading term, it specifically means complete obedience. The French actually have a term ""La droit d'obeissance"" which means ""the right of obedience,"" which implies a right to be treated beter for obeying a lawful order of police officers.  (Random factoids put to use!) 

* Discretion to prosecute:  In my experience this is the most common form of discretion executed.  The prosecuting attorney can amend the charges, higher or lower, and can recommend deals, or offer conditional discharges (6 months crime free means a dismissal), or flat out refuse to prosecute.

* Community involvement via elections:  The DA (head of prosecuting attorneys for the county) is in charge of directing the office in how to treat each case.  They are elected, as are judges and sheriffs, who further influence sentencing and police actions respectively.  They reflect the will of the voters.

* Juries even effect how police act: The police won't stop people for things that juries would let them walk for.

The problem of course is the slow court system, and the time wasted the moment the police decide to stop you for something. There ARE checks on them though, deserves to be noted.",0,,False,1281190195,t3_cxw8y,t1_c0w6sx5,t5_2cneq,,1426412346,,politics,t1_c0w78se,c0w78se,0,1,0,False,True,[deleted]

As for gay marriage the tea partiers have consistently worked against it, and even though its would-be leaders are _currently_ avoiding the issue prior to the election, [a crushing majority of people claiming to be tea partiers are against it](http://gayrights.change.org/blog/view/the_tea_party_says_no_to_gay_marriage). And the historical view of people like Glenn Beck, Ron Paul, and Sarah Palin on the issue are not exactly secret.

So, let's see. Anti immigration? Check. Isolationist? Check. Exceedingly nationalist? Check. Runs on a platform of lower taxes without specifying where to cut budget? Check. Claims to represent the ""common people"" against the ""elite""? Check. Anti-intellectualism? Check. Racist undertones? Check.

30,"While I think the people who want to build this 'culture centre' have every right in the world to do so (See the First Amendment), I also think that buying into the propaganda that it promotes ""integration, tolerance of difference and community cohesion"" is at least a bit odd, for a number of reasons:

1) It was not unforseeable that building such a centre in this part of NYC would create animosity and negative attention. If they were really interested in promoting understanding and tolerance, they would have found a less controversial spot. As of right now, it is not promoting ""community cohesion"" very effectively.

2) The choice of name, 'Cordoba House'. CÃ³rdoba, a town in southern Spain, was the place where the first mosque in Europe was built by Islamic conquerors. The CÃ³rdoba mosque was constructed using materials taken from what used to be a Catholic church. The name 'CÃ³rdoba', like virtually no other, stands for the Islamic desire for conquest, and building mosques on conquered grounds or places of victory has a long tradition in Islam. If the initiators of this project wanted to promote tolerance and understanding, they might have wanted to pick another name. In this form, it looks a bit like a Nazi party building a ""Hitler House"" in Auschwitz.

Downvote me all you want, but this is my perception of this project, and a lot of people I know share this sentiment. Not all criticism of this project is ""right-wing"" or ""bigoted"", and I do not think we should abandon reason and critical thought in the name of political correctness.

0,"Ah, just like a typical Quebecois--too stupid to see beyond Bloc propaganda, and no--not from Alberta :)

I guess I can spare a bit of the morning to highlight how stupid you are.

&gt;We are far more than 1/3 of the founders of Canada as an european country, we are half of it.

&gt;At **confederation, which laid the basis of the current supreme court**,   we were Â½ of the population of Canada. So 1/3 of the supreme court is far from being ridiculous, especially given that we do not have the common law in QuÃ©bec.

I don't know about you, but the last time I wasn't in Francophone propaganda class in high school--the [constitution was written in 1982](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada). At that point Quebec had 6.5 million people, Canada had 26 million--and that justice number is there as, again, an antiquated way to appease little baby separatists.

&gt; Thatâs because the chinese are not founders of Canada. They may have given a lot of help building the railroad to go out west (and being royally shafted in the process, then denied the ability to immigrate), but that does not give them the status of founders.

Oh ok. I think it's a complete and total outrage that we aren't allowed to learn Cree or Ojibway in high school!  You're basing your assumptions on things that were true 150 years ago, but haven't been backed by a shred of factual evidence for 35 years. Quebec separatists has spent the last 35 years trying to destroy Canada for a few bigots and racists with political power provincially.

As I said before. Let's give the retarded little separatists their own country--keep the sane regions that know what's good for them (that way you don't punish areas devoid of a majority of mouth breathers like you), and in 10 years when you are somewhere between Zimbabwe and Rwanda on the HDI we might take you back for constitutionally entrenched guarantees that nobody will be that stupid again.

&gt;Primate, as âfull of monkeysâ?

&gt;Reality check: Moronto has the largest number of head offices, yes, but those are little chickenshit companies, and parasitic behemoths (bank and financial services) that are a drain on the Economy.

&gt;MontrÃ©al, on the other hand, controls 35% of canadian industrial equity; thatâs 35% of the machinery that actually does something (extract, process and transform natural ressources) in contrast to the parasitic financial services based in Moronto. Oh, and Moronto only controls 25% of industrial equity.

Well now I know you're a Francophone, because [Primate City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate_city) makes perfect sense when you use Wikipedia correctly. I guess they only teach you how to froth at the mouth over 'Anglo supremacy' in school.

Now, addressing your point about 'parasitic' financial services. They were all headquartered in Montreal until Bill 101 and the separatist idiots that you probably voted for got into power. RBC still has it's 'headquarters' in Montreal but runs everything out of Toronto. Want to hazard a guess as to why? Wonder why Montreal is a second rate options exchange with a trickle of volume (and owned by those damn Anglos at TSX, and even worse--[cleared](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_Clearing_Corporation) by those damn Anglos south of the border!) While the TSX is now a trillion dollar stock market? Bill 101.

Why does Toronto have all the financial services, 'chickenshit companies' (I assume they're chickenshit because they realize who would win politically, economically, and socially in a referendum scenario), and 25% of industrial output? Bill 101. (Although to be fair,industrial output in this day and age isn't a great thing to base your city's economy on--aka how's that Shell refinery in Montreal work---oh right, shut. You can go join Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, and the rest of the rust belt).

&gt; Look whoâs talking, the federalist with a 50 billion federal deficit!!! We are 25% of the canadian population, so if QuÃ©bec was as badly managed as Canada, we would have a 12.5 billion deficit.

&gt; As of the equalization payments, they could be totally abolished if the federal would stop duplicating services offered by the QuÃ©bec government. They only amount to less than $800 per capita per annum anyways. A pittance.

LOLOLOLOL. Ok. So I'm just going to address anyone who doesn't know what equalization is because this asstard just put enough falsehoods in 2 paragraphs to make it seem like Quebec is Mother Teresa (she wasn't a French Catholic--try not to be offended).

1) [Equalization as a system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_payments_in_Canada) (and why he claimed I was from Alberta).

2) Quebec is 22% of the population, All provincial deficits are $34 billion. Quebec received 8.6 billion in equalization, which as defined above, is money to help **provincial** services and is running a 4.2 billion dollar deficit. Quebec is therefore running a 12.8 billion dollar 'true' deficit (cost of what is provided provincially vs what is taken in from provincial taxes).  I work that out as about 35%. You'd need to reduce your deficit or increase your productivity quite a bit to make up for the hush money this country continually pays ignorant retards like the above. As an aside note, Quebec per capita equalization is $1100, not 800 as some morons would have you believe.

I won't even go into why Quebec administering it's own little racist (French favouring) federal tax system (yes you read that right--Quebec administers it's own version of *federal* tax rules which make Bill 101 look tolerant) deprives the federal government of revenue someone would receive living anywhere else in Canada.

&gt; It sure is, immigrants are told by the federal government that they can live in english in QuÃ©bec. If thatâs not an attack, I donât know what is.

And if that's not separatist racist vitriol I'm not sure what is You can't cry about being a minority continentally and then claim that someone living in Montreal can't speak English like 40%+ of the local population. For anyone not aware (and still reading), [it was money and the ethnic vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_and_the_ethnic_vote) that 'saved' English Canada last time.

&gt; Oh! My god! Democracy! EGAD! Theyâre gonna actually ask the people directly? Oh my god, where is the world going to!!!!

No, I said go ahead--I mean it. Stupid people can have their own country.

&gt;How do you know that? Go to Moonsonee and ask the crees there if they would rather live in QuÃ©becâ¦ I double-dog dare youâ¦

[Ok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_independence_referendum,_1995#First_Nations). Idiot.

&gt; Xenophobic? Where do you see any law in QuÃ©bec that is aimed against foreigners? Or people of any other race than the indian+white+blacks mixed blood the french are?

&gt; You donât know what you are talking about; you are just mouthing the usual anti-QuÃ©bec propaganda.

I don't even need to cite for this one, not two sentences ago you were complaining **learning English constitutes a xenophobic attack against you, according to your own words**. My favourite one from Bill 101: You cannot answer a phone in English before French while being employed at a business in Quebec (if you say 'Hello?', not 'Allo?' first--you can be fired). It's a fire-able offense. [Then again a lot is under your racist little law](http://allnurses.com/nursing-news/quebec-nurses-who-89930.html). Just read any provision of Bill 101 if you want a reason why the separatists are xenophobes.

&gt; Oh? Now itâs 13 billion? I thought it was a 4.2 billion deficit???

Then I added equalization of 8.6 billion and rounded up, as I explained above. I guess the only math and reasoning they taught you in school was:

1,"Hah. So the Canadian standard is actually YYYY-MM-DD according to that, which hardly anyone ever uses except on a form that spells out what format to use :D

At least I'm not the only one here confused.

&gt;The Canadian Standards Association has adopted the ISO 8601  yyyy-MM-dd (e.g., 2009-06-09) date format; however, the European dd/MM/(yy)yy (e.g., 09/06/(20)09) date format is still widely known, especially in QuÃ©bec because of its cultural links to France[citation needed]. The American MM/dd/(yy)yy (e.g., 06/09/(20)09) date format is also known because of the influences from the United States. In more casual use, the 3 different date formats can cause ambiguity. For example, this all-numeric date format ""01/02/03"" can be 3 different expanded date forms. It can be British ""01 February 2003"", American ""January 02, 2003"", and some might even think it could be ISO 8601  for ""2001 February 03"", even though the ISO standard always uses four digits for the year. Today, people are more exposed to the American date format and the ISO 8601 date format due to the updated technology. The ISO 8601  date format is an easy date format to understand because it always starts from the biggest number first and then goes down to the smallest number last, year(2009)-month(06)-day(09), and the format always includes the date with a 4-digit year, so it is free from ambiguity.

&gt; In Canada, all 3 date formats are used, âyyyy-MM-dd or yyyy MMMM dd (big-endian)â, âdd/MM/(yy)yy or dd MMMM yyyy (little-endian)â and âMM/dd/(yy)yy or MMMM dd, yyyy (middle-endian)â. All short date formats should display leading zeros for any numbers below 10. The separator is usually a hyphen or a slash. Expanded date formats may display leading zeros (e.g., 2009 June 09) or may not (e.g., 2009 June 9) for numbers below 10. They may also include the weekday name. The ISO 8601 expanded date form would look like â2009 June 09, Tuesdayâ the British expanded date form would look like âTuesday, 09 June 2009â and the American expanded date form would look like âTuesday, June 09, 2009â. There may also be abbreviations for words in any date format (e.g., 2009-Jun-09, Tue). Weekday name and month abbreviations are usually the first 3 or 4 letters of the word (Weekday abbreviated names: Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, SatâMonths: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec).

7,"the same hoteliers who think their bedbug infestations add local color to your stay? 


both the hotel i stayed at in the hague, and the one i stayed at in genveva, when i was in europe recently for work, had bed bugs; and if you had the audacity to complain and ask for another room or to be allowed to cancel your reservation to go somewhere else, because there were bleeding sores all over your back from the bites, you'd get this ""you americans think everybody should cater to your every whim"" response. um, yeah, silly me for thinking that for 400 euros a night, at the very least, i should not be assaulted nightly by parasites.


i had to throw away my luggage and all of my clothes before getting on the plane to come home, in a futile attempt to prevent the damn things from infesting my home, and still those fucking bed bugs got into my house somehow--it took me over $3,000 and 5 months to get rid of the damn things, and i had to get a new mattresses and bedding to boot and dowse my house every two weeks with toxic chemicals that will probably give me cancer--my dry cleaner figures that they came back in the one thing i didn't toss--my wallet. actually i found out that i am pretty lucky, most people bring home so many unknowingly that by the time they realize they have them, they basically have to evacuate their homes and burn everything they own.


so yeah, you'll have to forgive me if i am not overly impressed with the opinions of european hoteliers.


just as an aside: in conversations with the dutch and swiss people that i met while i was there, my impression, especially from the dutch, is that they hate english tourists and would ban you if they could. they find you repulsive with all of your public drunkenness, and vomiting and unirating in their streets. 


the other thing they all said was that they were surprised that every american tourist they had ever actually met in person had been so nice and polite and respectful and self-deprecating. i kept thinking of that movie ""in bruges,"" where the rude ""american"" tourists were all canadians. i'm not sure how candadians got the reputation they have for being so genial, the ones i have met have all been very passive aggressive, whiny, and obsessed with the US--they remind me of jan brady, screaming ""marsha, marsha, marsha,"" except that they scream ""US, US, US."" 


anyway, it seemed that the dutch and genevans i met expected us to be like the people they see in american action movies--brash and rude. it dawned on me that they don't seem to realize that those portrayals are generally meant to ridicule that sort of behavior and that no body here actually acts that way, who isn't an ass, and universally acknowledged as such.


the genevans were the best BTW. they were so charming. they all said ""bon jour"" and ""au revior"" when they got on and off of elevators. the dutch were very much like the british in my opinion--except that they seemed generally more knowledgeable and tended to only be argumentative about stuff they did actually know something about (unlike the british who do not seem to know much about anything but will argue about what they don't know for ten centuries nonetheless). one weird thing was that the dutch women were all dressed like bag ladies for some reason, the men were dressed normally though. the genevans dressed elegantly, male and female.


one last thought, many of the europeans i saw while i was there seemed pretty fat to me for the most part--especially in the hague, way fatter than south floridians at least. the genevans weren't as fat though, but they weren't skinny either, but when i was in sweden 3 years ago, the swedes i saw were all very slight.

28,"Long, long story. 

Basically, they came to Europe with the Mongols, and then got into bed with the Eastern European aristocracy (which is why you have gypsy servants in most Dracula movies, including Coppola's), by selling themselves as indentured servants (somewhat slaves, but think overseers and nannies rather than forced-labor peasants). Those that didn't choose this road (or got out of it) either formed sedentary communities of their own (most of which were eventually assimilated into the local culture), or immigrated to the rest of Europe, as nomads or settlers, when possible.

As you can imagine, there was a lot of hostility between the local peasantry and these newcomers, and the end of the feudal regime in the XVIII-XIXth century was in many ways the worst for the Roma, culminating in Nazi Germany camps in the XXth.

As those still recognized as Roma are generally either in segregated communities (mostly Eastern Europe) or nomadic, they understandably developed a culture of us vs. them, that makes it perfectly acceptable to swindle, steal and cheat outsiders while being fiercely loyal to their community. 

So, anytime one of those itinerant camps sets up somewhere, robberies, car thefts, metal theft and so on skyrocket, only to subside when the local authorities finally expel them. In Eastern Europe they most often run local organized crime, as many segregated communities have done all over the world.

Another striking aspect of the Islamic civilization here was cleanliness. One of the first moves made by Muslims no matter where they settled was to open up large hamams (public baths) for the local people. In Cordoba alone, there were 990 hamams for the local residents of this city. Europeans at the time were very influenced by the hygienic habits of the Muslims they encountered. In many ways, the state of Andalusia was at the time the most modern and developed part of Europe under the Umayyads, and the city of Cordoba was Europe's largest metropolis at the time. A full 99 percent of the city's residents were literate.

 During those years, seven different races and three major religions could be found in Andalusia. Muslims, Christians, and Jews lived together in peace and tolerance, an example the likes of which Europe was not to see again for a long time. The heights of civilization achieved at this time in the Andalusian region were unparalleled at the time in Europe.

1,"I ate my finest meal ever during a month-long stay in Italy, about 5 years ago. My uncle, who works in downtown Rome, decided to take my family to dinner. Since he took the train to work, our only realistic options for travel were public transit and walking. As there was no direct public transit route to the restaurant, we walked for about an hour and a half to get there. Throughout the walk, my uncle assured our family it was well worth the walk, which became a running joke on the trip as the understatement of the century.

The place was discretely hidden in a side alley behind the more touristy (and overpriced) restaurants on the main street front. The main entrance looked like a service entrance to one of the other restaurants, but, on the inside, the restaurant was impressively designed in a classical style, but certainly wasn't gaudy. After the antipasto, which was very good, but not mind-blowing, we all (about 8 of us) shared three enormous dishes of pasta, Bucattini all'amatriciana, Bucattini Carbonara, and Rigatoni alla Pastora. The taste was indescribable. The pasta itself was made in-house and the sauces were phenomenal, all with a perfect balance of flavors. I was pitifully depressed when I found myself getting full at the end of the meal. Though my family shared countless other excellent meals on the trip, including one at a five star restaurant on the Mediterranean cliffs, none could hold a candle to that one sublime evening. After leaving, I promised myself that if I were ever in Italy (or whenever I would return to Europe, for that matter), I would make a special pilgrimage to the restaurant, but, unfortunately, when I went to ask for the name a year later, my uncle had completely forgotten the name and location of the restaurant. At that point, I decided that it's better for the experience to remain a fond reminiscence.

6,"&gt;Communism has been responsible for more death and famine than any other form of government

If you say so. Based on the [the Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_Communist_Party/Chapter_II), I don't agree that it's possible to have a communist government. Communism entails the use of a democracy to get rid of classes, and the government too.

I think the communist governments you're thinking of were about as communist as the DRPK (Democratic People's Republic of North Korea) is democratic. In other words, not at all, not even in terms of far-future goals. And I think they don't say anything bad about communism, in much the same way that I don't think the DRPK says anything bad about democracy. Surely, what happened in Soviet Russia wasn't good, but I don't think that had much to do with communism, at least based on the communism described in The Communist Manifesto. The Communist Manifesto says very specifically:
 
&gt;In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole? The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.

&gt;They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.

&gt;They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mold the proletarian movement.

&gt;The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: **Formation of the proletariat into a class**, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, **conquest of political power by *the proletariat*.**

It's quite specific on the point that the Communist party should not be in control, it should only try to help people and inform them, but should let the workers take control and do what they want. This doesn't really fit in with what you're calling communist governments.

Also, the Communist Manifesto was an early advocate of women's rights, in other words, the right to not be raped by your husband, which was still happening when it was written. It was also an early advocate of children's rights, when children were often forced by their fathers to work in factories. It also called for an end to borders and nationality, at a time when the slave trade in the United States was still ongoing and slaves were still being taken from their homes in Africa, and when people in India (including Pakistan and Bangladesh at that time) were ruled by the East India Trading Company, and made into second-class citizens in their own country. This absence of borders and nationality is partly why I don't think it's possible to have a communist government. Once you have communism, you have no government.

&gt;Finally, anarcho communism is a half baked retarded idea that could never work in any situation involving more than couple hundred people.

It worked pretty well in [Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain#1936_Revolution) during [the revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_revolution). George Orwell fought in Spain alongside anarchists and Marxists, and [wrote a book about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_catalonia). He described his experience as:

&gt;""I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. **In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it.** There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and **no one owned anyone else as his master**.""

The wiki article on Spain during the revolution goes on to say:

&gt;""The anarchist held areas were run according to the basic principle of ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."" In some places, money was entirely eliminated, to be replaced with vouchers. Under this system, **goods were often up to a quarter of their previous cost.**

&gt;Despite the critics clamoring for maximum efficiency, **anarchic communes often produced more than before the collectivization.** The newly liberated zones worked on entirely libertarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any sort of bureaucracy. (The CNT-FAI leadership was at this time not nearly as radical as the rank and file members responsible for these sweeping changes.)

&gt;In addition to the economic revolution, there was a spirit of cultural revolution. **Oppressive traditions were done away with. For instance, women were allowed to have abortions, and the idea of ""free love"" became popular.** In many ways, this spirit of cultural liberation was similar to that of the ""New Left"" movements of the 1960s.""

1,"Well this is the definition of ""tradition liberal"" (or classical liberal) that I use:

From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism

&gt; Classical liberalism is a political ideology that developed in the nineteenth century in Western Europe, and the Americas. It is committed to the ideal of limited government and liberty of individuals including freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and free markets.[1] Notable individuals who have contributed to classical liberalism include Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo. There was a revival of interest in classical liberalism in the twentieth century led by Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and other economists.[2][3][4]

&gt; Classical liberalism places a particular emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual, with private property rights being seen as essential to individual liberty. This forms the philosophical basis for laissez-faire public policy. The ideology of the original classical liberals argued against direct democracy ""for there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law.""[14] For example, James Madison argued for a constitutional republic with protections for individual liberty, over a pure democracy, reasoning that in a pure democracy, a ""common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole...and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party....""[15]

&gt;According to Anthony Quinton, classical liberals believe that ""an unfettered market"" is the most efficient mechanism to satisfy human needs and channel resources to their most productive uses: they ""are more suspicious than conservatives of all but the most minimal government.""[16] Anarcho-capitalist Walter Block claims, however, that while Adam Smith was an advocate of economic freedom he also allowed for government to intervene in many areas.[17]

&gt;Classical liberalism holds that individual rights are natural, inherent, or inalienable, and exist independently of government. Thomas Jefferson called these inalienable rights: ""...rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law', because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.""[18] For classical liberalism, rights are of a negative natureârights that require that other individuals (and governments) refrain from interfering with individual liberty, whereas social liberalism (also called modern liberalism or welfare liberalism) holds that individuals have a right to be provided with certain benefits or services by others.[19] Unlike social liberals, classical liberals are ""hostile to the welfare state.""[14] They do not have an interest in material equality but only in ""equality before the law"".[20] Classical liberalism is critical of social liberalism and takes offense at group rights being pursued at the expense of individual rights.[21]

Seems to fit Ron Paul pretty well IMO.

Especially since traditional liberals were big proponents of a gold standard to protect the property rights of individuals from currency debasement.

3,"[Here is a great website](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/) with resources for teachers to share with their classes. I think this is a good place for you to start on your own.  

The featured modules (on the right) are very well done, particularly the one comparing [China and Europe](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/) and the one about the [Qing Dynasty](http://www.learn.columbia.edu/nanxuntu/start.html), which looks at that era by examining sets of imperial hand scrolls.

Another interesting website is [The China History Forum](http://chinahistoryforum.com/), (though it is down right now). 
China's history is so rich and vast that I'd suggest you start there, then move into Japanese and Korean History as well. This will give you a good understanding of the region as a whole. Don't be intimidated by the sheer volume of info at first. Once you get into it, you'll be surprised at how interesting it all is and how relevant it is to us now.

Be sure in your research you also take a good look at the Song Dynasty.  The rise and fall of that dynasty holds many lessons for America in my opinion.  Also some of the most fascinating historical figures come from that era. My favorites are the amazing [General Yue Fei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Fei), the brilliant scientist [Shen Kuo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo), The tragic [Emperor Huizong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Huizong_of_Song_China), and the incredible artwork (hand scrolls) of [Zhang Zeduan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zeduan). 

Have fun!

2,"I went on a cruise earlier this year, and it was the first time that I've been outside of the US/Canada/Mexico, and the first time that I've been exposed to a large number of non-British foreigners.  There may be a (true) stereotype that many Americans are ignorant about world geography, but many Europeans are equally ignorant about the sheer size and diversity of the United States.

-1,"&gt; It's the Muslim's own fault for not integrating fully into the French society. Moving to a new country, you must be considerate of the people and their culture. You'd think they (the immigrants) would want to contact and 'be friends' with the French, but instead, they segregate. They stay amongst themselves.

Its hard to integrate when you're faced with massive discrimination and racism. Why bother?

5,"Well, some knives have serrations on only one side, and it's generally on the right side: if you hold something with your left hand and cut with your right hand, the knife will tend to slide if at all, towards the side with the serration: away from your fingers, and towards mine. That being said, if your knife is sharp you'll never have this problem. Most european kitchen knives are symmetric, but some Japanese knives are strongly ""handed.""

Scissors are a pain in the ass because if you use them left handed, you either have to do without seeing what you're cutting (because the top blade is in the way), hold things sideways so you can see the cutting path (my solution), or wedge your fingers into the thumb hole and your thumb in the finger hole (only matters if your scissors have a blade that's easier to use as the ""bottom"") and cut way over on your right side.

1,"Please explain why this nightmare scenario has not happened in Europe, Japan, Australia, or anywhere else in the world really?   And who all do it at half the cost or less than the US currently?

And first made-up fact by you I will call you on.  So, if you want to pull the ""waits times in Canada are so much longer"" crap I will explain that that statistic is pure bullshit from a study where they calculated the wait times in Canada from when the procedure was said to be needed by a doctor and the US wait times were calculated from after the Insurance Companies FINAL sign off saying it was okay, which was over typically more than 60 days after the doctor asked for it.      

Basically out and out pulling a ""let's just subtract 60 here for no reason what-so-ever from X"" and then saying ""see, X is less than Y"".    And the anti-Health Care folks do this on shit loads of statistics they like to pull out of their asses.  

Do I like the health care bill entirely?  Nope.  But then, it doesn't call for the execution of insurance company executives.
