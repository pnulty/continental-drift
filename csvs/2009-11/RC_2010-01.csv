There's some very specific moments where it was important, e.g. during the national strikes for the eight hour day, the workers had actually broken into city armories and were using cannon against troops.  That strike was defeated really with black strikebreakers, but not only did the white workers not allow black people in their unions, they'd been lynching black people in a big chicago white race riot a couple of months before.  When social democratic parties were starting to win in Europe, we still had Jim Crow in this country, we did not have multi race unions for decades.  Black people in the south got the vote at best about 1970, barely before the current president was born.

First, I'm African American.  Last night, my girlfriend, who's asian-american, asked me if I knew about African-African slavery and she was shocked that I did; she'd never knew it before.  I'd always thought it was a fairly well-known fact at this point.  

When she asked me what I thought of it, all I could say was that I still don't think it was the same as what the Europeans turned it into, in general.  First of all, everyone was doing it.  It was a horrible institution but there doesn't seem to be a nation on this Earth that wasn't complicit in it.  So if that's the case, all you can do is judge how slaves were treated.  Since Africa isn't a country, all the nations seemed to treat their slaves differently...in some cases it was pretty brutal, and in others it was so liberal that slaves became kings.

So...I dunno, what do you guys think?  To me, it's kind of a null question.  My opinion is that the trans-atlantic slave trade turned something that used to be a consequence of war into a reason to *go* to war for many African nations.

,,t5_2cneq,"I just posted this yesterday.:

Here's some quotes from the book ""THE BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN RIGHT"" by MURRAY N. ROTHBARD describing the situation in the USA:

&gt;Under the guise of regulations “against monopoly” and “for the public welfare,” Big Business has succeeded in granting itself cartels and privileges through the use of government. As for the liberal intellectuals, their role has been to serve as “corporate liberals,” as weavers of sophisticated apologies to inform the masses that the rulers of the American corporate state are ruling on behalf of the “common good” and the “general welfare.” The role of the corporate liberal intellectual in justifying the ways of the modern State to man is precisely equivalent to the function of the priest in the Oriental despotisms who convinced the masses that their Emperor was all-wise and divine.

&gt;In the meanwhile, the Buckleyite right wing was progressively abandoning even its rhetorical devotion to libertarian ideals. For National Review and its associates had learned what they believed to be the lesson of the Goldwater rout; from that point on, the conservative movement would shed itself of any and all “extremist” elements, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, and move in a “responsible” and “respectable” manner toward the seats of Power for which it had yearned for so many years.

&gt;And so we now face an America ruled alternately by scarcely differentiated conservative and liberal wings of the same state-corporatist system. Within the ranks of liberalism there is a growing number of disaffected people who are increasingly facing the fact that their own credo, liberalism, has been in power for forty years, and what has it wrought? Executive dictation, unending war in Vietnam, imperialism abroad and militarism and conscription at home, intimate partnership between Big Business and Leviathan Government. An increasing number of liberals are facing this critical failure and are recognizing that liberalism itself is to blame. They are beginning to see that Lyndon Johnson was absolutely correct in habitually referring to Franklin Roosevelt as his “Big Daddy.”

Some naive or interested people spread the word that in Europe is better because Europe is....less Capitalist (and more Socialist).

Bullshit. In Europe things are better because there's **more** capitalism:

- No [regulatory capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)

- More competition. The only market regulation accepted is the anti-trust one.

Example:

&gt;The European Commission actively encourages the spread of high speed Internet access across the EU. One of its means to do so is the application of EU antitrust rules against abusive behaviour by companies that hold a dominant position in the broadband services market, which could hamper expansion of broadband services. For example, in July 2007, the European Commission fined the Spanish incumbent telecoms operator Telefónica for a very serious abuse of its dominant position in the Spanish broadband market. The Commission found that for five years Telefónica had imposed unfair prices in the form of a margin squeeze between the wholesale prices it charged to competitors and the retail prices it charged to its own customers. In so doing, Telefónica weakened its competitors, making their continued presence and growth in the market difficult: they were forced to make losses if they wanted to match Telefónica's retail prices. As a result, consumers were paying the highest prices in all of Europe for broadband services, and as a consequence, broadband penetration was very low in Spain.

There's an [European Commissioner for Competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Competition) and a Commission for Competition, USA should have that. 

Here is the site of the Commissioner:

http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/kroes/index_en.html - watch the little video.

&gt;Sometimes, companies, Member States or other bodies may be tempted to take action to reduce competition. Preserving well-functioning product markets therefore requires competition authorities to review, prevent or prosecute any such anti-competitive behaviour. One of the roles of the European Commission is to perform this function in the European Union. In order to do this, the Commission can look at several areas:

* Agreements between companies that restrict competition, such as cartels or other
 unfair agreements between businesses. Through such agreements, companies may agree
 to avoid competing with each other and try to set their own rules for the game.
* Action by a major player to squeeze competitors out of the market, or ""abuse of a dominant position""
* Mergers or other formal agreements between companies (where companies join forces either permanently or temporarily) in order to ensure only those that can expand markets and bring benefits to the consumer are allowed;
* **Opening up markets to competition in areas such as transport, energy, postal services and telecommunications. Many of these sectors were previously controlled by state-run monopolies (also known as liberalisation)**.
* Financial support (state aids) given to companies by EU national governments. Such support may be given by national authorities to promote certain economic activities or to protect national industries. It is fundamental that this does not distort fair and effective competition between companies in Member States and harm the economy;",1426171833,t1_c0i1noy,c0i1noy,0,t3_akfol,False,politics,[deleted],True,0,1262343373,,11,0,True,t3_akfol,11,

Anyway, your info was very useful, thank you for that. I was considering not wasting the visa, but I think I'll have to work to lessen the pressure on my already tight budget. The only expensive regions I'll visit is Australia and the USA (where I know enough people to stay without paying for hostels). 

I'll probably want to check out some Arabic places (Damascus, Beirut, Amman, maybe Israel and Tehran), then move on to SE-Asia (from Bangkok to Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and then surfacing down in Singapore). From Singapore (or maybe Bangkok, depending on where I start and end, although Singapore makes more sense mile-wise) to Australia, where nothing is planned out. I'm considering staying 5 months in Australia, 2 working, 3 travelling. Beyond that I'm not really trying to plan anything, Australia seems easier without planning.

By the way, I think the South East Asian trip is going to take me about 2 months. Is that realistic? I think I won't be able to extend my trip further than 9 months..

So after that I actually wanted to go somewhere cheap: maybe South America, as it lies en route. But I might want to leave that option open depending on if I can find someone to travel with me. I think my parents would die from worries if I went on my own. I speak a bit of spanish but it's definitely not enough. Cramps.

If I go through airport security in Europe, I am most likely to be selected to be searched for drugs because I am a young male. I don't see that as ageist or sexist, I just see it as sensible because you can use profiling to better allocate your resources by applying them where it makes sense. I'm almost certain that very few old ladies get pulled over and their bags searched, where as I get pulled out 50% of the time.

I live in London, most knife and gun crime is perpetrated by young black guys and a smaller proportion of young white guys and a smaller proportion of young black girls and so on and so forth.

So it makes sense that the police allocate their resources efficiently by searching mainly young black guys and young white guys, but no one complains about this being ageist or sexist, but for reason, which I find interesting, people will complain that it is racist when the profiling being applied is racial but not complain that it is agist when the profiling is based on age.

I think it would be a huge misappropriation of time if the police searched equally old chinese ladies and young men for weapons, and that is why they don't.

Pics: http://imgur.com/n2R7S.jpg http://imgur.com/334ze.jpg Guess how much it cost me? $0!

2. A minimum wage so shitty it would make most slave drivers blush. Strangely any effort to raise it is opposed by your hard core conservatives... who claim to be christian. It's christian to have people living in such poverty?

3. Your country worships capitalism so hard that any attempt for socialist policy is shouted down as though it is communism... which is bizarre, because it seems like your society doesn't give a shit about its poorest members?

4. Your country claims to be all about freedom whilst invading other countries and using your CIA to distabilise other countries governments. Seriously, wtf guys?

5. An apparently horrible schooling system.

6. A large population (% wise) of mouth breathers who oppose evolution and climate change.

7. A stupidly high prison population, locked up for stupid offences like smoking a joint.

8. A high crime rate in many of your cities. I live in a city of 2 million people, yet I have never been robbed or mugged. Sometimes I do not even bother to close my garage door if I go out.

9. A large number of gun owning morons. Why would I *need* a pump action shot gun or AK-47 to protect my family from danger? The police here do a good enough job of that. The gun obsession in the US baffles me.

How Americans can think they live in the best country in the world baffles me.

That's perspective.  Perhaps one day society will consider the act of cooking one's own food characteristic of poverty.  

In China, popular thought is that vegetarianism is a sign of poverty.

Certainly, street vendors here are not engaging in a losing proposition, especially since their relatively well-groomed appearance (for the most part) and clothing indicates that they are probably supporting themselves.  

It's my thought that independent vendors offering pricing based on the result of bargaining and haggling is a much more efficient resource allocation process than fixed pricing.  Those with inelastic demand for a relatively commoditized product, likely the wealthier consumers willing to pay for convenience, will pay higher prices than the poor, moving closer to a system of [perfect price discrimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination).  A vendor who is able to maximize producer surplus may then pass the extra profits along to the (poorer) consumer who will take the extra effort to bargain for a lower price.  The wealthy consumer will effectively subsidize the poorer consumer (and the vendor), and more products will be sold, allowing the manufacturer to capture the benefits of economies of scale.

Alas, the concept of bargaining is all but dead in America.

The most well respected is the Human Development Index.

As for personal debt, I'm too lazy to research it, so I'll concede the point. However though my reference of the HDI, and statistics regarding other trends such as high school dropout rates I hope you'll take impressions from the media with a grain of salt next time.

My 13 year old daughter is obsessed with the 2012 doomsday predictions.  All my logic and thoughtful conversations have barely made a dent in her illogical concerns.  But then I remember being 13 years old and walking home from school looking up in the sky to see if a Cuban missile was going to wipe out Philadelphia and me with it. I was petrified.  But  here's what I am trying to tell my daughter now and it seems to be working.  Throughout the entire recorded history of humanity, somewhere on this planet some society or culture, was always advancing our knowledge base.  Even in the Dark Ages of Europe, the Moors and Chinese continued to advance.  Eventually everyone catches up.   We have a lot of problems; global climate changes, diseases, intolerance, lack of corporate responsibility, ineffective and seemingly unresponsive governments, ineffective educational institutions and such.  The list seems never ending.  My generation (60's and 70""s) had  every one of these same problems.  Some got solved a little, some became worse, but through it all we continued to advance our science, our medicine, and our information distribution systems. There are more scientists, engineers, and doctors alive and working today, than there have been in the entire combined history of the human race before this time.   We will solve the climate problems, overpopulation, famine, poor education, energy, disease. All these things will happen, perhaps and very likely in the life span of  most young redditors.  It's an amazing time to be alive.   The mission for the current generation and perhaps for the next two or three generations, is to to learn how to resolve human conflict without force, without threats, without killing and without war.    When that happens, when science, math, medicine, engineering and peaceful resolution come together in most world societies, our species will then be on the fore edge of a golden age.  Coming out of the past ten years, as bad as they seemed at times, that's my hope for the future and the hope I wish to instill in my daughter.

,,t5_2cneq,"&gt; Many reddittors mean by more socialist ""more regulation"" or more ""state-run"" things. They are continuously whining about the ""lack of regulation"" when in fact exactly the monopolistic Govt regulation is to blame.

In terms of regulation, personally, I would call for *smart* regulation.  People get obsessed about the amount of regulation without looking at the content of said regulation.  When, for example, people call for more regulation with regards to the too big too fail banks, I would *think* they mean more smart regulation.

&gt; As to the welfare state, in here there's no such a thing like 50% not paying income taxes as it is in the USA. Also we have sales tax (VAT) that go in many countries upward to 20% of everything you buy.

&gt; So, the welfare is paid by pretty much everyone, including its beneficiaries whenever they buy something.

&gt; But it's hard to tax only half of the people, have no VAT, no huge gas taxes, wage wars AND in the same time have a strong welfare system. I'm amazed that USA can still afford the current welfare level.

I agree.  Our tax system in the US is completely backwards.  For one, compared to most European countries, our [personal vs corporate tax rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Income_Taxes_By_Country.svg) are backwards.  They all have more personal income taxes then corporate taxes.

In addition, like you mentioned, they have VATs and huge gas taxes.  But, these would probably be political suicide for any politician to suggest.  Off topic, but I believe this is correlated to the fact that we have more of a direct democracy here, in part due to the 17th amendment.  One only needs to look at California to see what a direct democracy does.  People vote for entitlements but no new taxes and you end up bankrupt.

Anyways, I think most people on the left would agree with your last point.  We all agree that the waging wars needs to stop and the defense budget needs to be drastically cut.  But I guess we differ on the current welfare level part.  Some would suggest cutting the welfare and others would suggest adding taxes.

Yes, but i like to call things by their proper name. Americans from the other 34 countries are usually annoyed by USican hijacking of the term. Similarly, i'm annoyed at being called Deutsch (""Dutch"") or my place of residence being refered to as a province that ceased to exist in 1840 (""Holland""). 

In the same vein i use the term Inuït instead of ""eskimo"" (eater of raw meat) and seppuku instead of ""hara kiri"" (cutting up meat).

But having lived and worked in many countries around the world (including the so-called highly evolved countries in Europe), I find the Americans to be the friendliest towards outsiders and most willing to accept differences. Also, I have noticed a far greater willingness to judge a person by their merits instead of considering just their ethnic background. I guess this comes from the fact that USA is a very young nation formed from immigrants.

having travelled through europe and living in England myself i have to say that out of them Holland, even Amsterdam has far less obvious crime and drug addiction problem around it's high density housing - a fraction of what you see in Italy (although i only really know rome i admit) or France or germany or spain...

Taking the train from Paris to Rotterdam last time i passed through some really dark places, Lille is nice in places but sitting in the park a huge group of 'yobs' came and hassled us for smokes - they were nice enough when we got chatting but it was obvious they were 'problem people' in the eyes of society.. in brussels we watched as the homeless floated around diving on anything chucked in a bin, the park behind the station was FULL of very fucked up people, not just the disenfranchised youth of Lille but a fully developed community spanning all ages and breeds of desperation hung around doing the things poor, homeless heartbroken people do (from the look of them mainly skag, in france they were pill heads, weed smokers and speed abusers (amphetamine sulphate -euro speed)... Rotterdam station was immaculate and between there and the park we didn't spot a single person that society would label 'degenerate' -even the station park contained nothing but idle walkers, students eating lunch and of course an endless stream of cyclists winding their way though the streets.

Anyone that has done the journey during the Tourist summer time should remember that it's only in the harsh light of winter that places reveal their true form...  although it's basically true, if less obvious, year round.

I am a massive stoner - everywhere i go i buy weed and speak to people about drugs, in my industry (live music) EVERYONE tours around with various acts and EVERYONE gets involved in the local drugs culture... I have a pretty good idea of the drug scene around the world (i know you're interested so i better say Israel, Germany, France, Denmark and of course England have the biggest and most hardcore drugs party scene near Europe) and i really have to say that Holland is a great place to party, a brilliant place to get stoned and possibly one of the most awesome places in europe (and that would be true if weed was legal the world over) however they don't have a spectacular love of hardcore narcotics.... I know this is totally counter intuitive but it's true, certainly in my industry Holland is seen as a rest gap for fried synapses and bleeding noses, because you can just find a nice relaxed coffee shop to chill in people don't need to go to such great lengths to create a 'movement' or latch onto some secret counter culture...

It is of course very, very easy to get any drug you need in amsterdam - i could get you basically any substance that kids have ever been warned will ruin their life due to too much fun in any near europe major city... Lots of people do flood to amsterdam, i know this will seem totally absurd to anyone who holds an irrational fear of drugs or buys into the lies of those that do but part of the reason heroin addicts, junkies and the like flock to amsterdam is because of the culture - the thing which attracts many people to the harder drugs is desperation, poverty and a cruel system - thus many drug addicts learn to hate the system or maybe more likely they turned to drugs partly because they hated the system they were raised in so much, holland is tolerant of drugs because they're the most compassionately liberal country in Europe - they have a respect for people, for privacy and for idiosyncratic personalities - it's not then strange that these people who have been driven to distraction and drug dependency by their cruel overlords should feel a sudden kinship with a country that's kind to the dreamers and gives every fool his chance.",1426171941,t1_c0i1w03,c0i1w03,0,t3_akauu,False,worldnews,The3rdWorld,False,0,1262365877,,3,0,True,t1_c0i0xq2,3,

I don't want to sound like I'm bashing the British in general, because I'm not, BUT...

The British have a HORRIBLE reputation in Eastern Europe from what I've heard, due to the ""stag"" parties (I'm not sure what those are--would Americans call them ""bachelor parties""? Is it what you do before you get married?) that tend to be held there where the Brits almost always tend to get rip-roaring drunk, start fights and destroy a lot of shit, and treat every local girl they see like a prostitute. 

They also tend to have a reputation as being rude tourists in general: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britons-are-rated-the-worlds-rudest-tourists-648751.html

I know Americans are the stereotypical ""bad"" tourists, but I really don't think that's an accurate stereotype **due to the kind of Americans that tend to travel abroad**.

- The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists conducted a study of over 400,000 women, all of whom had consumed alcohol during pregnancy. **No case of fetal alcohol syndrome occurred and no adverse effects on children were found when consumption was under 8.5 drinks per week.**

-  **A review of research studies found that fetal alcohol syndrome only occurred among alcoholics**; no apparent risk to the child occurred when the pregnant women consumed no more than one drink per day.

- A study of **moderate drinking during pregnancy found no negative effects** and the researchers concluded that one drink per day provides a significant margin of safety, although they did not encourage drinking during pregnancy.

- A study of pregnancies in eight European countries found that consuming no more than one drink per day did not appear to have any effect on fetal growth. **A follow-up of children at 18 months of age found that those from women who drank during pregnancy, even two drinks per day, scored higher in several areas of development.**

- An analysis of seven medical research studies involving over 130,000 pregnancies found that **consuming two to 14 drinks per week did not increase the risk** of giving birth to a child with either malformations or fetal alcohol syndrome.

&gt; Shitty health care with no universal option.

Long ago, government got in the way of progress. Now, it continues to get in the way, possibly taxing the crap out of the middle class (and the upper class, but they actually have money to spare) in order to help the lower, poverty-stricken class. I wish I could pay a little extra to my insurance and see that money go to provide insurance for those less fortunate. I don't want the government involved--they already screw up enough crap. How can I expect the government to do health care/insurance reform correctly? Moreover, what is correct? European style? American civil war style? It's a shame that so many people are without the care they need, but it's a shame that the government has gotten in the way and increased costs (on all ends: insurance, service providers, etc.) while decreasing the amount of money the citizenry has to spend in the first place.

I wonder how many Americans would have health care if the US spent $20 billion/month on health care programs instead of a pointless war?

&gt; A large number of gun owning morons. Why would I need a pump action shot gun or AK-47 to protect my family from danger? The police here do a good enough job of that. The gun obsession in the US baffles me.

I'm glad that, in Australia, police are always prompt, caring, and correct in action, with emphasis on the first. I'm not a gun owner myself, and I likely won't for as long as I'm living in the city. When I move out to where a precinct isn't a minute away, you bet your sweet bippie I will be armed. I recognize that it's not *necessary*, but I choose to exercise my rights and assert that I am the master of my domain, and prepare for the worst case scenario in which the cops never come.

It's unfortunate that most US states, IIRC, have made illegal the defense of one's own home, fearing vigilantism and trigger-happy paranoiacs.

Among the celebrities I have seen there are Muhammad Ali, Terri Garr, Tyra Banks, Laura Linney, Keenan Ivory Wayans, the guitarist for The Cult, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, and Weird Al Yankovic.

But Ann Coulter is the only celebrity I’ve ever spotted at Farmer’s Market that I wound up fucking in the ass, hard.

It would be fair to observe that my feeling obligated to present the list of celebrities above in roughly Black-White-Black-White order is indicative of my own carefully Liberal sensibilities. And that this sort of conscientiousness is more than a little ridiculous, on examination. But what I notice about myself only on reflection, Ann Coulter seemed to recognize and respond to in an instant, like a puma recognizes an injured giselle. For Ann Coulter is a predator. A predator with a hungry asshole.

I first spotted her sitting at a table in front of The Gumbo Pot with another woman who looked not unlike her, but a generation older (I neglected to ask her at any point subsequently whether this had in fact been her mother). I vaguely recognized her—there’s always a lag time placing faces you know from cable when unconfined to a telescreen—and began to notice, stealing furtive glances up from the copy of Steinbeck I was reading, that she was eyeing me with unsettling scrutiny.

The next thing I knew, her companion (mother?) had left and Coulter was standing over me, looking skeptically at my reading material.
‘The Grapes of Wrath, huh?’
‘Yes’ I said, faking composure. ‘It’s fantastic.’
‘It’s a fantastic primer for vacuous proto-Communists everywhere,’ she said dismissively.
‘I don’t know about that..’
She sighed. ‘I don’t have enough ink in my pen to keep a running list of what you don’t know. May I?’
She motioned to the empty chair next to me.
‘Of course.’ It would be fair to say my voice trembled a little.
She sat and said nothing. Ann Coulter evidently takes an unappreciative view of small talk. That she was eager to continue antagonizing me became evident when I re-opened my recently-insulted book to resume reading. A young man passed in a t-shirt proclaiming ‘Iraq Nam’. She stopped him.
‘1. Haircut. 2. Shower. 3. Get a job, you sniveling hippy,’ she glowered. ‘You’re probably too high to remember that, so write it down--if you can write.’
He looked at her with dismay and scampered away like a kicked cat. She turned to me with bloodlust.
‘What do you think of the war: complete success, or very nearly complete success?’ she asked.
‘Well, in no time—barring the strong possibility of Civil War--we’ll have a democratically-elected anti-US Islamicist government in charge of the world’s second-largest oil reserves, so I’d have to say only very-nearly, on the complete success scale, at a hysterically distorted best.’
She showed her teeth. ‘It sounds to me like you don’t support our troops.’
‘I think that ‘Support Our Troops’ business is the most crass, craven cowardice ever to go unquestioned by the allegedly Liberal media.’
‘Yes? Yes?’ There was oddly growing excitement in her voice.
‘It allows the Administration to absolve itself of responsibility for its own flawed policy. It’s no different than if you sent a classroom of 2nd graders into a burning building, and when anyone objects you throw in their face that they ""don’t support our 2nd graders""’
‘Where do you live?’
‘A few blocks away.’
‘Take me there.’

When we got to my apartment, she looked around glumly.
‘I was thinking you’d have half-burned American flags up on the wall,’ she said, disappointed.
‘That’s ridiculous. I love my country.’
‘Whatever you think that means,’ she said, rolling her eyes. ‘Don’t you have anything nasty to say about the President?’
‘Like what?’
‘Like he’s an imbecile, or corrupt, or a corrupt imbecile—the usual sore-loser bitter chatter.’
‘To be honest, I didn’t like the nasty things that were said about Clinton, and I’ve decided to have respect for the Office, no matter who holds it. I don’t think President Bush is corrupt or an imbecile anyway. Would you like something to drink?’
‘I think maybe this was a mistake,’ she said, starting to go.
‘That’s not to say I don’t disagree strongly with many of his policies and objectives.’
She seemed to reconsider. ‘Like what?’
‘I don’t know. Name one.’
‘Get me a drink first.’

With every point I expressed that ran counter to a view she held, she removed one article of clothing. Soon she sat on my couch naked, gently pulling at her untrimmed pubic hair, staring intently but not quite invitingly at me. The growing hard lump in my throat was just outpaced by the one in my pants. I was a little nervous because we had agreed on the last two points—the need to reconsider the option of nuclear energy, and drilling in the Arctic—and I noticed her oversized nipples were no longer hard. Luckily, she was, by this point, determined.
‘What do you think,’ she began provocatively, ‘of the President’s plan to privatize Social Security?’
I sighed with relief; this was as sure a promise to seal the deal as her asking if I had a condom.
‘I think it’s a payoff to the Americans the President has always been most intent on pleasing: the richest 1%.’
‘What do you mean?’ she cooed. I noticed her nipples hardening once more. She dropped to her knees in front of me. She pushed me backwards and positioned my legs up in the air.
‘A stock’s value is even now only partially tied to the actual value of any publicly traded company. But who’s going to profit from inflated valuations when stock prices swell irrationally from the forced, artificial injection of capital?
Her breath was hot on my ‘taint as she lifted my scrotum. ‘Yes? Yes?’
‘You might as well shoehorn billions of dollars into the Baseball Card market. The price of a Derek Jeter rookie will be driven up to hundreds of thousands of dollars—before the bubble bursts and the whole market crashes massively.’ It was getting hard to stay on point as she tongue-fucked my shitter vigorously.
‘Don’t..Stop!!’ her contorted mouth pled from my butthole.
‘The top 1% will sell stocks at the inflated valuations to the novice investors-by-necessity, the market will swell and crash, and the same 1% will come back and re-purchase their holdings at pennies on the dollar. Meanwhile, Social Security will go bankrupt and all the novice investors will be eating catfood for the duration of their ""golden years,'’ barring a massive Federal bailout several hundred times in excess of what the Savings &amp; Loan scandal cost us.’
She sprung up on the couch on all fours and looked over her shoulder at me. She pointed to her twitching, puckered anus. ‘See this?’
I nodded eagerly.
‘I want you to wreck it.’
I spit on my skeezer-pleaser and, prying her ass cheeks apart like a hot dinner roll, drove it home, into the biggest browneye I had ever seen. She gurgled contentedly. Every thrust of my babymaker was met with a wrenched squeal as I grabbed her by the hips and began really leaning into it.
‘Harder!’ she begged, ‘Harder!! Tell me what you think of Chomsky!’
‘I..think..he’s..brill..iant..but..I..don’t really agree with much of his stance on Israel, and--’
‘You’re slowing down!’ she snapped. ‘DON’T SLOW DOWN!’
I went back to punishing her asshole, giving no thought whatsoever to compassionate conservatism as her chocolate socket gnawed on my pork pipe. She was babbling now, as out of a delirious reverie.
‘Feed it,' Ann Coulter rasped. 'Feed my hungry asshole!'
I buried her face in a throw pillow and she swiveled her hips back on my fuckstick with obvious appreciation. My pace quickened as my man-magma built towards eruption.
‘Wait!’ she gasped, sensing the fuse on my yogurt cannon was burning quick. ‘I want to take you ass-to-mouth!’
I withdrew from her puckerhole with an audible ‘pop’ and she scrambled around, gulping at my wang-dang-doodle as though the lives of all her loved ones hinged on her marks for enthusiasm. Her eyes rolled up pleadingly as she threw her head down again and again on my magic johnson. I knew what she wanted.
‘There is a specter haunting Europe,’ I began, and she started to convulse spasmodically with her own thrashing orgasm, her head now dribbling in a blur against my groin. I repeated every Karl Marx quote I could think of until I reached my own ‘historic inevitability’ and launched surge after surge from my hairy boda bag. I ejaculated with what seemed like enough force to blow out the back of her head--but her head was made of stronger stuff. She sputtered, gobbled and gulped what I’d have to call a very liberal, even radically so, quantity of hot splooey.
Once she caught her breath, she wiped her mouth, stood, and took me by the hand.
‘Let’s go to the bathroom.’
‘Why?’
She seemed surprised I had to ask. Her tone was that of someone reminding another of something too obvious to need mention.
‘Uh, so I can get in the tub and you can piss all over me?’

I sat in a robe and watched her as she dressed.
‘Will I see you again?’ I asked tentatively.
‘Sure,’ she said, pointing to the TV. ‘On that.’
Some moments passed. I tried to dispel the awkward silence.
‘Well, nice meeting you,’ I offered.
‘You’ve really got a gift for tedious small talk,’ she shot back.
I was a little hurt and, recognizing this, she softened just a shade as she reached for her purse to leave.
‘Hey.’
‘Yes?’ I asked.
‘Thanks for not staring at my adam’s apple.’
‘No problem.’
She let herself out without another word, and I sat in the late afternoon silence alone. I considered how it felt to be a disposable instrument in someone’s personal debasement fantasy.

Very good point. However, I think when it comes to extreme forms of government such as fascism that there is no such thing as ""too careful"". We need to keep from resorting to that ever again.

I do, however, understand your point about the Nazi Germany parallel. Hitler has become something of a boogeyman in Western culture. Whenever something is bad, compare it to Hitler.

American History classes are fairly U.S-centric. I didn't learn any real history from Kindergarten (might recognize that word, basically the first level of education or ""0th grade"") until 5th grade. In the 5th and 6th grade were all the basics: the U.S Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and so forth. History is lumped in with ""Social Sciences"" in the U.S curriculum. Granted, before that we learned things like ""Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492"", but there was no mention of his endorsement by the Spanish or the other conquerors who hit Latin and South America. Cortez, de Francisco and all the others came up in 7th grade (8th grade by German standards).

We didn't learn about what lead up to WWI, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by the Serbian mercenaries was only a passing subject in my 9th grade history class (I believe that's the equivalent of the first year before the German ""Gymnasium""). In 9th grade my class focused on ""World History"", which was really only history since the early 1800's.

10th grade was ""American History"", we learned about James Madison, the war of 1812, all the shit that isn't really prevalent in common knowledge of American History.

I certainly agree that a basic understanding of the home country history is important. In the case of America, there's only so much that you can talk about. In America, at least in my schooling, there was no mention of Australia, the history of Africa, ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece, Persia, ancient China, or Russia. All it is is American and *some* European history. It's a shame, really.

While there is naturally still a vast variety of unfreedom, such as the virulent sex trade, that are colloquially called ""slavery"", most of them lack one or another criteria to be actually called so in the actual formal, legal meaning of the term. Two of them (probably the amongst the most important) being that it has to be a legal (notice: legal ≠ social) institution and the victim is stripped totally of his/her legal rights, hence becoming a mere ware.

Hence a forced prostitute in Europe is not a slave in the full meaning of that word. In Yemen, she is.

,,t5_2qh13,"WWII is one, where the alternative would have been a Europe dominated by the Third Reich.

Another is the US Civil War. It wreaked havoc on the entire nation. Slavery however is a remarkably wasteful institution that is even worse for the economy (even regardless of the injustice to the slaves).

You'll find people like Pat Buchanan who believe that US participation in WWII was unnecessary, and many in the South who think that the Civil War was a mistake made by an aggressive North. However I think there is a large enough consensus on the choices made that resulted in the execution of these wars that they serve as reasonably good examples.

I think that if a dictator came to power in Canada or Mexico and decided to completely abandon representational governments and also legalize slavery, objectively, the US would be less worse off declaring war than not—not merely because of the offense to our sensibilities, but because our economy depends on having functional, healthy neighbors.

edit: I should add a [wikipedia synopsis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill,_Hitler_and_the_Unnecessary_War) of Buchanan's thought process. Anyone with a sibling may recall a fight where you are hitting each other and simultaneously trying to get the other to stop. You get that agreement, then administer one more whack, and say okay we're even now... I don't think Buchanan's analysis is entirely absurd when one considers that Germany's ambitions before WWI were essentially the same thing that Britain had been practicing in the previous century. It was a little disingenuous to deny Germany the same liberites with its neighbors that Britain had taken with nations around the world as though such behavior was completely inconceivable.

However, I think he is completely off the mark when he fails to acknowledge that Nazism embraced a revolutionary philosophy unlike any other that had existed for 800-900 years. (The 1086 Domesday Book is often recognized as emblematic of a general shift toward legalism throughout western Europe) One relatively benign example is that the random street violence carried out by the Brown Shirts was exalted as a way to strengthen the country and encourage individual strength. The burning of books and destruction of art that was considered degenerate is another.

Note: I list these two other examples, because Buchanan attempts to explain that the holocaust was somehow precipitated by the failure of Churchill to accept Hitler's offers of peace. That's nonsense, but I think the other initiatives of the Nazi party to recast European civilization belie the argument that a Nazi regime could have been tolerated regardless of whether that argument holds water for someone.",1426172046,t1_c0i244n,c0i244n,0,t3_akikm,False,worldnews,rz2000,True,0,1262377704,,5,0,True,t1_c0i23gf,5,

Sorry if I ""come off as offensive"", but I didn't God was so unsubstantial as to be a bauble for a romance. And you're asking me to take something I've wrestled with all my life and make it something you can conveniently compartmentalize into your own--or just as quickly dispose of. And my approach to Christ is not uniform with other people on this site--and this does engender great conflicts; all money and royalty aside, the ""Religious Wars"" in Europe were as much over disputes in Christian doctrine as they were over secular matters. Personally, I don't accept of original sin is an absolute *literal* premise for human life--but in saying that, I open myself to attacks from untold minions on this subReddit. I get attacked by Christians--my own ""spiritual brethren"".

So what you're really looking for is a bargain. Admit it. You want maximum philosophical return on the barest minimum of personal emotional investment (and man, can a person ever infer something about the relationship you got with this girl from that observation). Sorry, but I suck at trying to compartmentalize ""love"" in rational terms--be it love of God or something more on the lines of eros. 

And what are you going to do if you really are graced with something that inclines you to be a Christian? Anything? Maybe something for a couple years, then forget about it? 

*And are we even talking about Christ, here?* You say you're an atheist, yet you have a philosophical bent. Maybe you ought try first wrestling with Deism. Then you go onto theodicy. Then, ontology. I mean, this is a very specific Christian tenant you will be honoring--Luke 14 specifically warns against people entering unthought commitments. In contrast, these ""alter calls""--that's when you give a sudden public confession in the church and the preacher loudly responds, ""Salvation has come to you today!""--maybe they last and maybe they don't. Regardless, that's a very slapdash way of honoring the Great Commandment.

I never had a dramatic Christian rebirth. Maybe that makes me unsaved and evil. Maybe it means every word out of my mouth is spoken by an unseen viper. Believe it or not, it never really was important to me. It so happens I liked the Jesus I was taught about in Sunday School back when I was 6 years old, liked him enough to keep him as ""savior"" ever since. However, it's clear Jesus did not preach a message for 6 year olds, which means I've had to grow. It's also clear that what I experienced in 1980s, 1990s and 2000s America had very little to do with anything I'd mistake as ""Christ-like"". I assume I'm living in the shadow which preceeds what will amount to the apocalypse--yet that, too, doesn't have to be literal from ""sola scriptura"" (Revelation includes 11 references to an ""angry god"" or ""wrathful god""--yet how can perfection be blemished with anger?).

*Hard?* Hard. But what choice is there? Are you going to be serious with this stuff, or is it just a phase you're going through? I think I might actually prefer being an atheist on some level, as this is the era in which you guys get all the breaks. Karl Rove is an atheist. He's an atheist who appeals to the absolute worst sentiments in fundamentalist Christians, so they support him. *And what retribution does he fear?* None. In his mind, human law is everything and he is above human law. *Is that the sort of definition of the universe you would teach to children? A universe run on 'do as thou wilt, but don't get caught'?* No? OK, then prepare to do some legwork in order to fathom something a little deeper.

Scientific progress should be about humanity as a whole, not petty tribal or national pride.

The LHC is funded by hundreds of countries and it is European only in the sense that it is physically located in Europe.

So, my advice to Neil Degrasse Tyson and others: Stop viewing science through the lens of nationality and start viewing it as an endeavour belonging to all humanity. If more scientific research is now going on in other parts of the world than previously, then that is to be welcomed.

There is no reason to believe in that theistic junk. Please think about these, because I am concerned not for your salvation, but your intelligence and mental health. Believing in that crud is akin to believing in Santa Claus. [Some people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_dawkins) think that believing in religion actually classifies you as mentally ill. To be honest I do not think that is a stretch of the truth at all. 

Why does the church almost always seem to oppose science? If religion is right, shouldn't they be embracing math as god's language and physics as his law? But instead it seems like everything we can learn about the (6000 year old) universe opposes religion. Logic and reason always oppose religion.

If you grew up in Algeria, you would probably be a Muslim. If you grew up in India you would probably be a Hindu. Do you not see that religion is based on your socialization (growing up) process? Native Americans had no idea of Christianity when the European settlers first came here. Did god damn the thousands of previous generations all to hell because they never heard about some wizard that could multiply fish and booze and walk on water? (or a magical god rock that fell from the sky or a talking burning bush that nobody else saw). 

There is no such thing as a religious person who accepts dogma from ALL world religions. How do you know your religion is right? Faith? I know that my atheism is right because of testable, provable concepts. 

Have you heard of [Epicarus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Logical_problem_of_evil)? The problem of evil is one logical fallacy that disproves the existence of an all powerful and all good god. In short, god cannot be both all powerful and morally just because of the existence of evil in the world. If he allows suffering and evil to run free in the world, then he is himself wicked. If evil exists because he cannot abolish it, then he is not all powerful.

Fascets like this, as well as things like radio-isotopic dating disproving the 6000 year old Earth belief, the evidence of long term evolution disproving immediate creation, and inconsistencies in the logic of the bible should cause any intelligent person to reject Christianity, and subsequently all religion.

Please do not teach your kids anything about any particular religion. If you won't read a wikipedia article on logic, open a history book. Religion has been used by people to justify wars for thousands of years. The funny thing is that both sides usually claim to be on god's side (and when god gets pissed off he kills everything: man, woman, child, and beast alike). If you can get someone to believe in religion, you can get them to believe anything because there is no evidence to support the existence of theistic dogma, and any person with critical thinking skills will see that the lack of evidence automatically nullifies the claims of religion.

Rocco DiSpirito, a New York chef and best-selling food author, made famous as the star of the NBC reality show *The Restaurant*, wrote a public letter supporting a campaign by the U.S. Humane Society to end the Canadian seal hunt. The article quoted Mr. DiSpirito as saying, ""Most of the seal clubbers [in Canada] are also snow crabbers. By refusing to use Canadian or Canadian-sourced snow crab in our restaurants, we can make a very vocal statement against the seal hunt."" The Humane Society had been lobbying for an American boycott of Canadian seafood, especially snow crab from Atlantic Canada, advocating the boycott as an economic tactic to stop the seal hunt. Many American restaurants and seafood wholesalers had joined the boycott, pledging to not buy Canadian seafood. Newfoundland fishermen in the sealing industry replied by arguing that DiSpirito was a hypocrite for calling the seal hunt inhumane while serving *foie gras* made from the engorged livers of force-fed geese in his restaurant. This practice was officially banned in some European countries and California, where the humane society condemned it. Frank Pinhorn, managing director of the Newfoundland-based Canadian Sealers Association, was quoted as saying, ""He's an absolute hypocrite, a man of double standards."" Earl McCurdy, president of the Fish, Food, and Allied Workers Union in St. John's was quoted as saying, ""I think somebody who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones. It shows the hypocrisy of these celebrities, who know nothing about the seal hunt ... if he wants to serve *foie gras* in his restaurants, that's fine with me, but he shouldn't pass judgment on us."" John Grandy, senior vice-president of the Humane Society, defended the chef. He was quoted as saying, ""Absolutely the society is opposed to *foie gras*, but this issue is about seals, and a man of his distinction and abilities, who is simply appaled at the brutal destruction of these seals, well, *if* we can use him on the seals issue, we're happy to do so.""

The industrial revolution happened in the same period and boosted total GDP dramatically, especially England's, so colonialism - while definitely a factor - is not the only one in China/India's percentage reduction.

&gt; Most of the research in science and mathematics, prior to the advent of English, was in Sanskrit, Greek and Arabic/Persian. Whole branches of Mathematics like the basic number system, algebra and calculus were founded by the Indians and Persians/Arabs, and trignometry/geometry by the Greeks. There were many achievements in astronomy and other fields too. If Latin/Greek of 1500 years ago was worth reading, so were Sanskrit and Persian/Arabic.

True, and yet... the golden ages of Arabic and Sanskrit intellectual achievements were well in the past and their works are of historical interest, rather than practically useful for pedagogy. The ~400 years or so of post-Renaissance Europe added a very great deal to the sum of human knowledge.

It's pragmatic! The fact that C/J/SK have done it is great, but it doesn't alter the fact that lack of English is a huge barrier when dealing with the English speaking world, who happen to dominate the information economy. That's why India dominates high-interaction offshoring (for now)

,,t5_2qh11,"Machine shorthand seems really strange at first, but it's actually a fairly simple code, although I can imagine it would be very difficult to remember if you were not actively writing/reading it every day.

The fingers on your left hand have control over seven keys, all of which are in vertical pairs (the furthest left ""pair"" on the stenotype is actually fused, it represents **S**).  These fingers on your left hand will use those keys to create the initial sound of a syllable.  Because there are only seven keys to do this with, and far more sounds you can make to start a syllable (or end it, in the case of the right hand's fingers), you must use letter combinations to make some of those sounds.

For example, if you said a word that began with a hard G sound, like ""gorilla,"" I would have to hit all of the keys underneath my left ring and middle fingers, which would be typed out as **TKPW**.  But once you know that seeing that gibberish printed out on your paper means G, it's fairly easy to follow.

Those four keys on the bottom of the stenotype are for the vowels in a syllable, and go **A O E U**, and combinations are used there as well to create other vowels, hard or soft.  An *I* would be represented as **EU**, and a hard O (like in ""go"") would be represented with **OE**.

The ten keys underneath your right hand's fingers create the final sound in a syllable.  They use many combinations, as well, including combinations to represent letter combinations.  To create the ""nk"" ending in ""drunk,"" I would have to press down both keys under both my right hand pointer and middle fingers, and the lower key underneath my ring finger, which would be printed out as **FRPBG**.  

So if I were to type ""drunk,"" the letter combinations would be **TKR** (the **TK** is for the initial D) **UFRPBG**.  **TKRUFRPBG**.  Looks just like ""drunk,"" right?

Example, in the wikipedia article, would be written in two strokes on the stenotype (since one full syllable is all stroked at once).  You would do **KP** (for X) **APL** (the **PL** is the M combination) and then you would make a second stroke, represented as **P-L**, meaning that the P is on your initial (left) side, and the L is on your final (right) side, with no vowel.  Otherwise, you could get confused (or you will confuse the software interpreting your shorthand) about whether you meant **-PL** to represent M, or the sound that is made at the end of ""example.""

From the catalog:

--------------------------------------------

My current priority is culturing the fungal
residents in old growth forests. One mushroom
species in particular beckons me: Agarikon, Fomitopsis officinalis. This mushroom has been used medicinally for thousands
of years, and known for centuries as ""elixirium ad longam vitam""
(elixir of long life). It is on the brink of extinction in Europe, but I have
found specimens in the towering old growth forests of Washington
State and British Columbia. Fomitopsis officinalis is exposed to
hurricane force winds and hundreds of inches of rain per year, and
defends itself against legions of parasitizing bacteria and other fungi,
yet these mushrooms can live up to 75 years. What is the secret to
Agarikon's longevity, I wonder. Since humans are afflicted by many of the same microbes that harm mushrooms, we are learning a lot from studying Agarikon's host defenses
against pathogens. Having as many Agarikons in culture as possible is important, as medical science
long ago discovered that strains differ in their ability to fend against microbial competitors. To date, we
have isolated 27 strains of Agarikon, after decades of searching for this elusive species.

In August of 2008, we set out on an expedition in search of Agarikon
on Canada's west coast. We chartered The Misty Isles, a motor
sailboat, and gathered a crew of field mycologists and research
specialists in infectious diseases. Our intent was to scan the old
growth forests on the shorelines of Desolation Sound, looking
through binoculars for the characteristic living-snags of Douglas Fir
trees where this rare mushroom can reside. After scanning thousands
of trees, the prospects of finding Agarikon waned. Then, with a shout
of surprise and relief, one of our team exclaimed, ""There's one!""

We zoomed to shore in a Zodiac inflatable, and scrambled up a bluff to
find a ""ghost form"" of Agarikon appropriately named for its white chalk-like appearance straddled across a branch. What was so unusual about this
specimen is that it appeared to have fallen from a spot farther up the tree,
landed on its present supporting branch, and then connected to the mother
mycelium that had infused the host tree, forming two downward legs. Scaling
the tree, I reached out and carefully removed a small fingernail-sized sample
of the mushroom tissue. Unfortunately, after much effort in the lab, the
tissue did not revive, and so this Agarikon exists only in the wild. Although
now dead, the ghost form can persist for decades, while the mycelium inside
the tree can live much longer. In the future, we plan to return on another
expedition to gather more specimens.

My mission is to collect and culture as many strains of Agarikon as possible. This species' genomic
diversity could be essential for its survival, and possibly ours as well. To date, Fungi Perfecti has spent
countless hours and dollars creating the largest culture bank of this species in the world. This culture
library may be the enduring achievement of my life's research, reflecting hundreds of forays into these
dream-like cathedral forests. We and our descendants may benefit from this work. We shall see...

Two quotes directly from that article to prove the point-

- *""creating a potential crisis as Western countries rush to find alternative supplies, and companies open new mines in locations from South Africa to Greenland to satisfy international demand.""*

- *""European and North American companies are meanwhile racing to open or re-open mines in Canada, South Africa and Greenland amid calls in the US for government-backed loans to secure supplies of some REEs which are used in the guidance systems of missiles and laser-guided munitions.

What this shows is that other governments and large corporations are not waiting for China to completely choke off supply- and if they can predict that China will get even stingier with REE's, then it's a no-brainer for them to look elsewhere.

,,t5_mouw,"&gt;I would contend that Louis XIV had more power than anyone today

Correct and incorrect.

As one of the stricter absolute monarchies, he certainly had more authority, and a greater personal share of his nation's ""power"" than anyone alive today.  But at the same time, if we take America as an example, our president (whoever that may be) has the ability to control and command a global empire far larger than Louis XIV's ever was, its economic resources (which are thousands of times greater than France's were), and can (and historically does) have the power and ability to send a cruise missile/special ops team/covert operatives (spies)/miltary force of over one million individuals to kill anyone he wants.  Ask Saddam or the Taliban about that.  Or, for that matter, ask the democratic government of Iran we deposed (CIA, 1953/4) or the democratic governments of Chile, Grenada and Venezuela we took out during our ""misadventures"" in Latin America in the 70's and 80's. (And so on - there are dozens of examples.)

Yeah, perhaps no single individual wields as much power as one of Europe's more powerful absolute monarchs ever did... but by the same token, ""the American government"" is vastly more powerful than any one of them could ever have dreamed of being... and I suspect that even some of the world's larger multi-national corporations (GE, Microsoft, etc) are more powerful, as an organization, than any single king ever was.

If I wanted to, (and was willing to die to do it) I could kill Obama... or Bill Gates/Steve Ballmer... or the CEO of General Electric (whoever that may be), but that wouldn't take down the American government, or GE or Microsoft, or whatever.

&gt; Take a look around you - we're still in a global recession. A lot of countries are taking protectionist steps right now (probably yours!) Tom Friedman lets-hold-hands globalization was a luxury of the mid-2000s.

You have fallen into the trap of viewing scientific progress as an engine for economic success, and economic success only in a narrow, provincial sense at that, rather than something that is an end unto itself. What commercial ventures do you think the LHC will spawn? What about the international space station?

&gt;If you're claiming Keynesian ideas are the ones taken seriously based purely on their academic merit, I don't personally believe it.

You don't have to believe it, but that doesn't make it untrue.

&gt;So then I assume you were heartily endorsing bush's massive spending when he was in office as stimulating the economy and giving him all the credit he deserved for that right?

Uh, no. You are twisting my words to derive a random conclusion. As I said, we did not need this spending because we were not in a liquidity trap. If anything, we should have been saving that money during the Bush years or reinvesting it in America's infrastructure. We could have replaced coal plants with nuclear plants, fixed our roads/bridges, built maglev trains, and installed fiber to the home in every house for all of the money that Bush blew through.

&gt;That may be an interesting intellectual academic tidbit, but back in the real world there's now dangerous levels of debt and an out of control massive inefficient govt bureaucracy, which is continuing to expand at a rate that can only be called reckless.

The current US debt is not dangerous by any means. It is a big number only because the economy is big. You have to look at it in relative terms. It is something like 80-90% of GDP. It is high, but not dangerous in historical terms. We were much higher after WWII (like 120%).

,,t5_mouw,"&gt;&gt; No, but it is only Americans who view any scientific advance which did not occur within their own borders as something to be viewed with regret and envy. Do you hear Europeans complaining about NASA's success in landing rovers on Mars?

&gt; We disagree here. I think in the US people generally applaud scientific advancement anywhere, and people only get concerned when they perceive the US to be falling behind - as they should.

Really? Why should they be concerned? What does it mean to say that the US is falling behind? Why, if people in the US applaud scientific advances wherever they occur, does Neil Degrasse Tyson see the LHC and Russia's asteroid deflection programs as causes for concern instead of causes for celebration?

&gt; Science isn't performed with sunshine and unicorn farts. Wealthy nations can apply more $ to basic research, which you rightly applaud. In doing so, GDP increases, enabling them to apply more $ to basic research, which I rightly applaud.

Yes, we agree with and applaud more money being applied to research, but we do not do research only in the hope of improving our GDP. Much research, like that of the LHC, will likely never repay a hundredth part of what was invested.  To me, that doesn't matter, and I suspect most of the scientists at CERN don't care either. CERN does not view its mission as putting Europe ahead of America in some race. I suspect that NASA doesn't see its mission as gaining economic advantage for America. The advancement of narrow, parochial agendas, like gaining a commercial advantage over one's neighbours, or gaining power over them, these are not the reasons why we fund science.

&gt;&gt; So, on one hand you say that globalisation is a thing of the past, while on the other telling me that I must complete globally for my job. Which is it?

&gt; You mischaracterize my argument (perhaps unintentionally?). 

How so? Did you not say that ""Tom Friedman lets-hold-hands globalization was a luxury of the mid-2000s.""? Did you not also say ""Unless your job strictly requires your physical presence, you are competing locally, regionally, nationally, and globally for it. You forget this at your peril."" So, you say that globalisation is a luxury of the mid 2000s that has been replaced with protectionism, and then declare that *I* must compete globally for my job. 

&gt;&gt; You have fallen into the trap of viewing scientific progress as an engine for economic success, and economic success only in a narrow, provincial sense at that, rather than something that is an end unto itself.

&gt; I am not sure how to respond to this, since I am not sure from where you got this idea.

My original post was to condemn a nationalistic view of science, to which you responded with an argument about economics and protectionism, the gist of which I took to be that America must do better in science for economic reasons. Now you claim you cannot see where I got that idea? In fact, a few paragraphs above, you make this very same argument again, this time more explicitly, in these words:

&gt;&gt; ""Wealthy nations can apply more $ to basic research, which you rightly applaud. In doing so, GDP increases, enabling them to apply more $ to basic research, which I rightly applaud.""

I also included a bit about economic advancement in a narrow parochial sense because you appear to seek economic advantage for America rather than advantage for whichever company, regardless of nationality, should commercialise some scientific advance. 

&gt;&gt; What commercial ventures do you think the LHC will spawn? What about the international space station?

&gt; Wait and see - there sure as hell will be some, though. Transistors came out of Bell Labs - ostensibly ""basic research"" that resulted in one of the greatest technological advances of the 20th century - homegrown in the US of A. In the current epoch, governments have to fund it.

Undoubtedly there will be *some* commercial products, but they are impossible to predict, and they may not offer any significant return on investment for decades, if at all. From a strictly economic point of view, investing billions in the LHC is a horrible idea. 

&gt;&gt; They do it because they are driven to understand the universe, because occasionally but sadly all too rarely, some people find that there are some things more important than grubbing for money, power, and status.

&gt; I'm guessing you're not a working scientist. EVERYONE ""[grubs] for money, power, and status."" We are not monks; we're monkeys, like everyone else.

There's a magazine called ""High Times"" which some refer to as the latest issue of ""probable cause"".

&gt; Why are we permitted to get so publicly passionate about meaningless sports competitions, but not about much more important political ones?

Now we peel back the first veneer of bullshit.  Ask yourself this; our society, as a whole, sets aside time in the year when it's socially acceptable (or expected) to neglect all else in favour of:
- Thanksgiving
- Christmas
- New Year's Eve
- 'Black Friday'
- Birthdays
- The superbowl

And probably a whole bunch of other US and National holidays I'm unaware of.

The only times I know of that are set aside for political thought or discussion are Labor day and/or May Day, both traditional leftist days, which may or may not be holidays where you live.  If you discard all the fluffy flashy bollocks, how much air time is seriously devoted to the analysis of football (player stats, strategies &amp; so on) vs how much time on *serious* discussion of national social policy?

There's a thought vacuum in the west on the decisions we should make that affect all of us as a group, or even on how these decisions should be made.

&gt; I care about constitutional rights because I care about how people are treated.

What I meant was that by whacking a sticker on, it *implies* that you think you care more than the people without stickers.  In general, this stuff applies more to racist/nationalist issues than the one under discussion, but in general, if I'm driving around and every single car has a US flag on it except mine, *I'm* suddenly the one that looks out of place -- I'm suddenly perceived as less patriotic!

If you feel that caring about constitutional rights is worth whacking a sticker up about, it's implies that most other people without the stickers *don't* care about them, which isn't really fair.   The proof is clear, because if they *did* care as much as you, well, they'd already have the sticker, right? So you're declaring yourself more constitutionally aware than the other people.

To labour the point; You wouldn't go to a party and say ""Hi! I'm CitizenCain, and I think constitutional rights are *really* important.""

If you wouldn't do it face-to-face, why in a car? I'm probably in a minority, but when I see a sticker that says ""Fuck you"" it makes me exactly as offended as if the driver screamed it to me personally.

&gt; I find it hard to believe that the FBI actually thinks a Gadsden flag or other symbols of the founding fathers are ""dangerous"" or ""extreme.""

I did explain the link to extremism.  The abolition of income taxes and the reduction of Govt size/power by over 50% is an extreme position, *regardless of its merit*.

&gt; ""Domestic extremists"" (or members of terrorist/guerrilla/insurgent groups) 

These are two different things. Many aren't trained, as such, or have masters or groups.  See unabomber, Tim McVeigh, the sniper-in-the-boot, various religious cult leaders and the 'lone wolf' approach promoted by stormfront.org and Hal Turner aren't 'trained' to this level of sophistication.

&gt; if someone publicly expresses extreme political views, it is a virtual certainty he is not a member of any terrorist, guerrilla or insurgent group

But that lack of membership does not preclude a valid interest in that person.  The FBI has the right to investigate people, not just groups. Besides, even with a lack of violence, part of the FBI's reason for existing is to help preserve the social status quo, in general, so any extreme political view-holder is worthy of note, at least; especially if officials, even if mistaken, honestly believe that the ideology is flawed enough to bring mass misery and suffering on the population if implemented.

My argument isn't that this bumper-sticker-awareness campaign is a good idea, just that it does have a rational justification, from both a self-interested evil state power bastards worldview, and from a wise sensible moderate state power worldview.

We both agree that it's not worth trumping personal freedoms for bumper stickers; I'm just saying that leaving that aside, there is some rational justification for it.

&gt; when the government controls all the physical power, all the ability to do violence (as was the case under King George, and in most European governments of the time)

What you say only applies if you define Government as ""any man of good standing"".  Check the UK Gun laws of the time on wikipedia, you had to have a permit, yes, but neither the permits nor the guns were hard for 'normal people' to obtain.

&gt; oppress and do violence against any group of people it doesn't like, and history has shown that it invariably does.

Depends what you mean by doesn't like.  Govt's are made of people, fallible as any other, and if they decide, or come to be convinced, that a certain group is a threat (eg Jews in Germany) then those people will be oppressed, even if they probably weren't a threat anyway.

Also you say that this is inevitable.  I think that there has been at least one Government, somewhere, that lasted a four year term without oppressing anyone; unless you include drug dealers maybe, but certainly it's plausible that these people were thought to represent a genuine threat to the society, and so the Govt has a legitimate mandate to limit their freedoms, as a local militia would do the same if they were regarded as a threat.

The key thing though is 'group'.  It's not as though Rosa Parkes shot her way into a bus seat.  Groups are oppressed with the permission, or often encouragement, of the population-at-large, and this armed population often insists on stripping the rights of these minorities, not protecting them.  Often this is racially based, or thinly veiled (think how much people carry on about the 'damage' that immigrants do.  Will they shoot a cop to stop the unlawful detention and bashing of a wetback?)

&gt; it's about attempting to keep power in the hands of the people, rather than in the hands of the political leadership.

I think that with or without gun controls, it's essential for the people to retain control of their government to begin with.  Having a civil war/bloodbath is hardly a preferred outcome, so that retention of control must be mandated.  I don't know how to do this, but I think it's important to do it, and do it well, rather than say ""It's okay! If they ever do suspend our rights we can shoot them"" and then just cheer hurrah when it happens, because in reality the Govt will just oppress and do violence against various groups; and the less-oppressed majority will cheer them on, all the while armed to the teeth.

In other words, the 2nd Amendment assumes that post Katrina, someone will take arms against blackwater to defend people they never liked living near in the first place... and that's *not* what happened, AFAICT, many men (up to fifty or more) were shot for being black, and walking around other neighbourhoods.  These were people who had a legitimate claim on state resources, which was denied; who were being actively coerced and sometimes disarmed by FEMA and blackwater agents; and the local self-formed militia was *not* interested one jot in protecting them from the excesses of state power, only in protecting material property from possible theft.

Otro problema es que las universidades tienen muy bajos niveles de admisión y de egreso, lo que produce profesionistas de baja calidad. Entonces te encuentras en México a muchos profesionistas que no merecen ser llamados como tales y que por consiguiente no pueden cobrar como tales.

El modelo mexicano no es meritocrático en el sentido académico. Lo es en el sentido político, por esta razón los militantes de cualquier partido pueden tener acceso a 150 mil salarios mínimos al mes con el simple hecho de ser diputados aunque no tengan primaria terminada.

Esto no se ve que vaya a cambiar pronto, por varias razones, entre ellas la corrupción en los altos niveles, la impunidad y los delitos cometidos en altos niveles. Hay que dejar a un lado de una vez por todas los delitos de bajo nivel, esos son solamente el reflejo de las capas superiores. Hay que sumarle el hecho de que México está pegado a EU y por esa razón le veo pocas posibilidades pues EU necesita un lugar cercano para manufacturar todo lo que consumen a manera desmesurada y uno que los provea de mano laboral migrante sin responsabilidad alguna (en el momento de una crisis los mandan de nuevo a México).

El problema es gravísimo, 16 carreras es muchas de las veces la mitad o más de la oferta académica de cualquier universidad. Si es que hay 135 mil egresados por cada puesto, el problema es relativamente fácil de solucionar atacándolo desde dos perspectivas. Primero, hacer que obtener una licenciatura sea relativamente más difícil, pero no solamente por joder, sino que de verdad te enseñen de mejor manera, que suba la calidad. Segundo, apuntar a crear empleos que requieran este tipo de trabajo (tampoco le veo mucha posibilidad a esto para ser sincero).

Sin embargo aquí hay graves trancas sistémicas. Las universidades están llenas de gente que no tiene ni idea de lo que enseñan, entonces para abordar el problema de la calidad educativa, se tendrían que deshacer de millones de profesores que no valen la pena. Pero ahí se irían en contra de todas las pequeñas mafias que desgraciadamente abundan en el sistema educativo. Irse en contra de estas mafias es al mismo tiempo contraproducente políticamente entonces ningún partido quiere moverle a esto.

On June the 4th, the Chinese government brought armour and battle hardened troops into the capital and told them they were crushing a violent counter revolution. Afterwards the incident was effectively erased from history inside China.

Or even Iran in the last revolution where troops joined the revolution.
I'm sure the comparison is not lost on the people demonstrating, or on the government. I think the regime will fall because it doesn't have enough control on the army and police, or on information. They're in danger of having a small number of loyalists ending up as snipers in an overwhelmingly hostile city.

Because a democracy needs to be overwhelmingly intelligent and knowledgeable in order for its people to make the most rational decisions possible, which is incredibly difficult and expensive to do in a nation that is so spread out unlike in Europe (where people actually give a rat's ass about who the issues). 

Notice that I didn't say literate, because literacy is not sufficient. If people are woefully ignorant of what is going on, and are susceptible to emotional influence and believe whatever the authorities say, then there is no democracy **of the mind.**",1426172584,t1_c0i39lz,c0i39lz,0,t3_aklv0,False,Economics,[deleted],True,0,1262443350,,5,0,True,t1_c0i38rr,5,

,,t5_2cneq,"&gt;Yeah, but that's only because the comet wasn't developed by a competing nation.

It could have been.  An alien species could have, with their advanced technology, slung a comet into the planet to more easily mine us for valuable metals.  Or they could have destroyed us some other way.  And again, that has no bearing on how happy and free the people on Earth are.  Yes, if Earthlings knew about the alien presence, then it would be a failure if we couldn't stop them from destroying us, if we were able to.  The Native Americans?  I'm sure bad decisions were made by some of them, but most of the blame rests with the Europeans and the diseases they carried with them.  The Native Americans couldn't match their guns...they have been without trade with the rest of the world for many centuries.  They were clearly taken advantage of.

Don't get me wrong...I'm not defending anarcho-capitalism, a system I know very little about, and intuitively I very highly doubt.  I'm just opposing the notion that the Native American systems (which I know practically nothing about) fail.  Perhaps their system (anarcho-capitalism, or whatever) would be awesome..if they had the technology to survive against menaces.

,,t5_1a8ah,"A good reminder of some things he did achieve - some of which I didn't even know, or had already forgotten, like the Public Lands Protections legislation.

But this overview has a far too heavy emphasis on speeches. Amidst the ""historic address"", the ""beautiful vision"", the ""address to graduates in Moscow"", the townhall in China and the ""loving visit to Africa"", between ""one of the most amazingly honest speeches"", the ""commencement speech in a place where some people really hates [sic] him"", the ""message for America's students"", the ""conversation with 9th graders"" and the interview with a student-reporter, among reading to kids on the WH lawn, presenting a night of astronomy and reading letters to the president, and amidst more ""heartbreaking speeches"", ""moving eulogies"", ""funny appearances"" and ""good punchlines"", a staggering half of the 40 or so items listed here are about words rather than actions. About symbolical steps rather than concrete domestic legislation or substantive foreign policy changes. And that's not counting the White House kitchen garden or the improvement of ""brand America"".

Considering that one of the most voiced raps against Obama, justified or not, is that he is all words, the beautiful speechifier who hasnt proven his worth in real action, a listing like this comes across, if anything, as confirming the stereotype rather than debunking it. Considering the link karma here, it apparently works as a confidence booster for Obama supporters, but I doubt it does much for anyone who isn't dreamy about Obama in the first place. 

I, for example, was extremely happy that Obama won against, first, Hillary Clinton, and then John McCain in 2008 - even if he hadn't been my first choice in the primaries. Since one of my main doubts about him in the primaries had been that he was too cautious and too centrist, I was not surprised that he didn't suddenly turn into Bernie Sanders once he was elected, and took things slowly. But still I've been disappointed by just how bogged down he has gotten. And while much of that is due to the filibuster, the intransigent opposition and the handful of conservative Dems in the Senate, I can't help but feel Obama himself hasn't been anywhere assertive enough. 

The Copenhagen summit on climate change was a disaster - and over here in Europe, newspapers in the different countries I travelled through singled out Obama's unwillingness to make a meaningful move on America's commitments as the main cause of failure along with China's refusal to budge. Similarly, the Cairo speech may have been ""historic"" at the time, but without concrete follow-up, its symbolic effect in creating good-will in the Arab world is dissipating fast. With no progress in Israel/Palestine, the US surge in Afghanistan and the continued existence of Guantanamo Bay and similar internment places abroad, most of it has dissipated already.

I understand that this is not the place to repeat the most common criticisms of Obama again. What I'm saying is just that I would have gladly exchanged the whole lot of speeches, interviews, talks and punchlines that are admired at such length in this post for just, say: Obama having joined the EU in offering concrete, half-way ambitious further emission cuts, and thus making a difference in Copenhagen.

SCHIP, the Hate Crimes Bill, expanding veteran benefits, the Lily Leadbetter Act - those were all great first measures. The health care legislation about to be completed falls short on many counts but is still a historic step forward (if only most of it wasn't only going into effect in 2013/2014...). The stimulus bill was a relative disappointment, but still staved off the worst of a looming crisis, at least for the time being. Fine, by all means, remind us. But as someone with mixed feelings about his record so far, all the focus on his ""moving"" speeches just rankles me further.

Compared to most European countries, the US actually has a very low income tax rate. It's not uncommon in, say, Denmark or the UK, for the very rich to be taxed 40% or 50%. In the US, on the other hand, thanks to a) tax cuts from the Bush administration and b) clever fiddling with the laws for different types of incomes*, many billionaires actually pay less income tax (percentage) than do most low-wage workers.

Anyway, addressing your main point, an economist friend of mine actually holds the complete opposite view, that we should do away with sales tax and tax solely on income alone; he had some principled reasons for this and after a little discussion, I could see his point of view. However, I can't remember any of his arguments, and I'm no economist, so I'll bow out of this discussion for now.

,,t5_6,"I moved into an older home a few years ago, and retained the 1970s-vintage refrigerator, since it worked fine.  Then I stuck one of these meters on it, which lets you measure the long-term power consumption of any plug-in device:
http://www.p3international.com/products/special/P4400/P4400-CE.html

The results amazed me - I live in an area with some of the cheapest electricity in the US (7 cents/kWh), but I was spending over $180/year just to run this ancient fridge.  By replacing it with a modern unit (EnergyStar certified), the annual cost dropped to around $35/year. These numbers are based on multiple days of measurement, required to get an accurate number for a device that cycles on and off like a fridge.  

After that experience, I got a strange delight out of discovering where the energy hogs are in my house, for example finding a stereo power amp that idles at 70 watts, even with no audio signal going through it.  Converting a halogen lamp to use CF bulbs of equivalent light output dropped its consumption from 300W to 80W. It's worth the effort to identify the low-hanging fruit and get rid if it, fix it or at least turn it off.  

PS I assume someone must make a 220/240V version of this type of meter for all you overseas folks with your crazy European plugs and voltages.

,,t5_2qh2p,"I am not objecting to the use of the word in the context of the agent of terror( Hitler, or Osama). I am talking about the (emotional) response of the target of ""terror"" attack. 

If Winston Churchill says anywhere that he'd been terrorized, then you could make a point refuting my mention of him. That Hitler wanted to terrorize is just Churchill's viewpoint of Hitler's intention. Just a viewpoint. He also believed that Britain had a right to ran Empire. Is that sancrosanct too? All I am saying is these are subjective views.

More pertinant, Hitler's terror of Europe and London is cpompletely different from a terror as used in he modern context. When Churchill says ""he has terrorized them into abject submission"", he is talking about a real threat to existence that they face if they do not do as Hitler wishes. Its a state of remaining under threat of force, which is real, and not subjective. If they do not do not comply with Hitler, presumably they would be attacked. They choose to comply with Hitler, rather than be attacked. Thats Churchill's terror. A state of submission under threat of force.
 
The modern meaning we are talking about is different.

In the modern meaning of the word, if the target does not respond to a ""terror"" attack by being terrorized, would the term ""terror"" attack have any meaning? What percentage of a population have to be terrorized for a attack to be called a terror attack? 

I am just trying to say, that perhaps we would be more **real** if we did not call these attacks terror attacks in the first place. That itself causes terror, creating a self-perpetuating subjective myth, which has real world consequences. 

I am almost completely sure the use would not change; but I would surely prefer some other word. ",1426172655,t1_c0i3f2p,c0i3f2p,0,t3_akn1x,False,atheism,vishalrix,False,0,1262452547,,0,0,True,t1_c0i3ch7,0,

&gt;The fifth eldest, Motassim Bilal (Hannibal) Gaddafi[67], once worked for General National Maritime Transport Company, a company that specializes in Libyan oil exports. He is most notable for being involved in a series of violent incidents throughout Europe. In 2001, Hannibal attacked three Italian policemen with a fire extinguisher; in September 2004, he was briefly detained after driving a Porsche at 90 mph in the wrong direction and through red lights down the Champs-Élysées while intoxicated; and in 2005, Hannibal allegedly beat model and then girlfriend Alin Skaf, who later filed an assault suit against him.[68]

&gt;On 15 July 2008, Hannibal and his wife were held for two days and charged with assaulting two of their staff in Geneva, Switzerland and then released on bail on 17 July. The government of Libya subsequently put a boycott on Swiss imports, reduced flights between Libya and Switzerland, stopped issuing visas to Swiss citizens, recalled diplomats from Bern, and forced all Swiss companies such as ABB and Nestlé to close offices. General National Maritime Transport Company, which owns a large refinery in Switzerland, also halted oil shipments to Switzerland.[69] Two Swiss businessmen who were in Libya at the time have, ever since, been denied permission to leave the country, and even held hostage for some time.[70] At the 35th G8 summit in July 2009, Gaddafi called Switzerland a ""world mafia"" and called for the country to be split between France, Germany and Italy.[71]

1. Jesus Christ, when asked if he was the son of God, in Matthew 26:64: “Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” According to the Christian Bible, the Jewish chief priests and elders and council deemed this statement by Jesus to be blasphemous, and they sentenced Jesus to death for saying it.

2. Jesus Christ, talking to Jews about their God, in John 8:44: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.” This is one of several chapters in the Christian Bible that can give a scriptural foundation to Christian anti-Semitism. The first part of John 8, the story of “whoever is without sin cast the first stone”, was not in the original version, but was added centuries later. The original John 8 is a debate between Jesus and some Jews. In brief, Jesus calls the Jews who disbelieve him sons of the Devil, the Jews try to stone him, and Jesus runs away and hides.

3. Muhammad, quoted in Hadith of Bukhari, Vol 1 Book 8 Hadith 427: “May Allah curse the Jews and Christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.” This quote is attributed to Muhammad on his death-bed as a warning to Muslims not to copy this practice of the Jews and Christians. It is one of several passages in the Koran and in Hadith that can give a scriptural foundation to Islamic anti-Semitism, including the assertion in Sura 5:60 that Allah cursed Jews and turned some of them into apes and swine.

4. Mark Twain, describing the Christian Bible in Letters from the Earth, 1909: “Also it has another name - The Word of God. For the Christian thinks every word of it was dictated by God. It is full of interest. It has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies… But you notice that when the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, adored Father of Man, goes to war, there is no limit. He is totally without mercy - he, who is called the Fountain of Mercy. He slays, slays, slays! All the men, all the beasts, all the boys, all the babies; also all the women and all the girls, except those that have not been deflowered. He makes no distinction between innocent and guilty… What the insane Father required was blood and misery; he was indifferent as to who furnished it.” Twain’s book was published posthumously in 1939. His daughter, Clara Clemens, at first objected to it being published, but later changed her mind in 1960 when she believed that public opinion had grown more tolerant of the expression of such ideas. That was half a century before Fianna Fail and the Green Party imposed a new blasphemy law on the people of Ireland.

5. Tom Lehrer, The Vatican Rag, 1963: “Get in line in that processional, step into that small confessional. There, the guy who’s got religion’ll tell you if your sin’s original. If it is, try playing it safer, drink the wine and chew the wafer. Two, four, six, eight, time to transubstantiate!”

6. Randy Newman, God’s Song, 1972: “And the Lord said: I burn down your cities - how blind you must be. I take from you your children, and you say how blessed are we. You all must be crazy to put your faith in me. That’s why I love mankind.”

7. James Kirkup, The Love That Dares to Speak its Name, 1976: “While they prepared the tomb I kept guard over him. His mother and the Magdalen had gone to fetch clean linen to shroud his nakedness. I was alone with him… I laid my lips around the tip of that great cock, the instrument of our salvation, our eternal joy. The shaft, still throbbed, anointed with death’s final ejaculation.” This extract is from a poem that led to the last successful blasphemy prosecution in Britain, when Denis Lemon was given a suspended prison sentence after he published it in the now-defunct magazine Gay News. In 2002, a public reading of the poem, on the steps of St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, failed to lead to any prosecution. In 2008, the British Parliament abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel.

8. Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath, in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, 1979: “Look, I had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah.”

9. Rev Ian Paisley MEP to the Pope in the European Parliament, 1988: “I denounce you as the Antichrist.” Paisley’s website describes the Antichrist as being “a liar, the true son of the father of lies, the original liar from the beginning… he will imitate Christ, a diabolical imitation, Satan transformed into an angel of light, which will deceive the world.”

10. Conor Cruise O’Brien, 1989: “In the last century the Arab thinker Jamal al-Afghani wrote: ‘Every Muslim is sick and his only remedy is in the Koran.’ Unfortunately the sickness gets worse the more the remedy is taken.”

11. Frank Zappa, 1989: “If you want to get together in any exclusive situation and have people love you, fine - but to hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of The Cloud-Guy who has The Big Book, who knows if you’ve been bad or good - and cares about any of it - to hang it all on that, folks, is the chimpanzee part of the brain working.”

12. Salman Rushdie, 1990: “The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas - uncertainty, progress, change - into crimes.” In 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie because of blasphemous passages in Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses.

13. Bjork, 1995: “I do not believe in religion, but if I had to choose one it would be Buddhism. It seems more livable, closer to men… I’ve been reading about reincarnation, and the Buddhists say we come back as animals and they refer to them as lesser beings. Well, animals aren’t lesser beings, they’re just like us. So I say fuck the Buddhists.”

14. Amanda Donohoe on her role in the Ken Russell movie Lair of the White Worm, 1995: “Spitting on Christ was a great deal of fun. I can’t embrace a male god who has persecuted female sexuality throughout the ages, and that persecution still goes on today all over the world.”

15. George Carlin, 1999: “Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ’til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He’s all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can’t handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, talk about a good bullshit story.

16\. Paul Woodfull as Ding Dong Denny O’Reilly, The Ballad of Jaysus Christ, 2000: “He said me ma’s a virgin and sure no one disagreed, Cause they knew a lad who walks on water’s handy with his feet… Jaysus oh Jaysus, as cool as bleedin’ ice, With all the scrubbers in Israel he could not be enticed, Jaysus oh Jaysus, it’s funny you never rode, Cause it’s you I do be shoutin’ for each time I shoot me load.”

17\. Jesus Christ, in Jerry Springer The Opera, 2003: “Actually, I’m a bit gay.” In 2005, the Christian Institute tried to bring a prosecution against the BBC for screening Jerry Springer the Opera, but the UK courts refused to issue a summons.

18\. Tim Minchin, Ten-foot Cock and a Few Hundred Virgins, 2005: “So you’re gonna live in paradise, With a ten-foot cock and a few hundred virgins, So you’re gonna sacrifice your life, For a shot at the greener grass, And when the Lord comes down with his shiny rod of judgment, He’s gonna kick my heathen ass.”

19\. Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion, 2006: “The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.” In 2007 Turkish publisher Erol Karaaslan was charged with the crime of insulting believers for publishing a Turkish translation of The God Delusion. He was acquitted in 2008, but another charge was brought in 2009. Karaaslan told the court that “it is a right to criticise religions and beliefs as part of the freedom of thought and expression.”

20\. Pope Benedict XVI quoting a 14th century Byzantine emperor, 2006: “Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” This statement has already led to both outrage and condemnation of the outrage. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the world’s largest Muslim body, said it was a “character assassination of the prophet Muhammad”. The Malaysian Prime Minister said that “the Pope must not take lightly the spread of outrage that has been created.” Pakistan’s foreign Ministry spokesperson said that “anyone who describes Islam as a religion as intolerant encourages violence”. The European Commission said that “reactions which are disproportionate and which are tantamount to rejecting freedom of speech are unacceptable.”

21\. Christopher Hitchens in God is not Great, 2007: “There is some question as to whether Islam is a separate religion at all… Islam when examined is not much more than a rather obvious and ill-arranged set of plagiarisms, helping itself from earlier books and traditions as occasion appeared to require… It makes immense claims for itself, invokes prostrate submission or ‘surrender’ as a maxim to its adherents, and demands deference and respect from nonbelievers into the bargain. There is nothing-absolutely nothing-in its teachings that can even begin to justify such arrogance and presumption.”

22\. PZ Myers, on the Roman Catholic communion host, 2008: “You would not believe how many people are writing to me, insisting that these horrible little crackers (they look like flattened bits of styrofoam) are literally pieces of their god, and that this omnipotent being who created the universe can actually be seriously harmed by some third-rate liberal intellectual at a third-rate university… However, inspired by an old woodcut of Jews stabbing the host, I thought of a simple, quick thing to do: I pierced it with a rusty nail (I hope Jesus’s tetanus shots are up to date). And then I simply threw it in the trash, followed by the classic, decorative items of trash cans everywhere, old coffeegrounds and a banana peel.”

23\. Ian O’Doherty, 2009: “(If defamation of religion was illegal) it would be a crime for me to say that the notion of transubstantiation is so ridiculous that even a small child should be able to see the insanity and utter physical impossibility of a piece of bread and some wine somehow taking on corporeal form. It would be a crime for me to say that Islam is a backward desert superstition that has no place in modern, enlightened Europe and it would be a crime to point out that Jewish settlers in Israel who believe they have a God given right to take the land are, frankly, mad. All the above assertions will, no doubt, offend someone or other.”

24\. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, 2009: “Whether a person is atheist or any other, there is in fact in my view something not totally human if they leave out the transcendent… we call it God… I think that if you leave that out you are not fully human.” Because atheism is not a religion, the Irish blasphemy law does not protect atheists from abusive and insulting statements about their fundamental beliefs. While atheists are not seeking such protection, we include the statement here to point out that it is discriminatory that this law does not hold all citizens equal.

25\. Dermot Ahern, Irish Minister for Justice, introducing his blasphemy law at an Oireachtas Justice Committee meeting, 2009, and referring to comments made about him personally: “They are blasphemous.” Deputy Pat Rabbitte replied: “Given the Minister’s self-image, it could very well be that we are blaspheming,” and Minister Ahern replied: “Deputy Rabbitte says that I am close to the baby Jesus, I am so pure.” So here we have an Irish Justice Minister joking about himself being blasphemed, at a parliamentary Justice Committee discussing his own blasphemy law, that could make his own jokes illegal.

Finally, as a bonus, Micheal Martin, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, opposing attempts by Islamic States to make defamation of religion a crime at UN level, 2009: “We believe that the concept of defamation of religion is not consistent with the promotion and protection of human rights. It can be used to justify arbitrary limitations on, or the denial of, freedom of expression. Indeed, Ireland considers that freedom of expression is a key and inherent element in the manifestation of freedom of thought and conscience and as such is complementary to freedom of religion or belief.” Just months after Minister Martin made this comment, his colleague Dermot Ahern introduced Ireland’s new blasphemy law.",1426172733,t1_c0i3l2o,c0i3l2o,0,t3_akupj,False,reddit.com,antinode,True,0,1262459909,,6,0,True,t1_c0i3l06,6,

That would still not have secured a global deal, no, but would sure have spurred a transatlantic alliance for more far-reaching action. As it is now, Obama left behind a sour aftertaste in Europe, sorry.

As for Mark Lynas' personal account of having been there and knowing it was just China that did it - sorry, but there were hundreds of people there, and it seems others think differently. Take John Prescott, who was deputy prime minister in previous Labour governments in Britain, and who [squarely blamed Obama](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/28/john-prescott-defends-china-copenhagen):

&gt;John Prescott has defended China's role in the climate change summit, saying the blame for its flawed outcome must lie with the United States and Barack Obama.
&gt;
&gt;The former deputy prime minister helped negotiate the Kyoto protocol in 1997, and was in Copenhagen acting as an informal bridge between the Chinese delegation and others. [..]
&gt;
&gt;In a letter to the Guardian, Prescott criticises the US climate change special envoy, Todd Stern, who ""said at Copenhagen emissions weren't about 'morality or politics', they were 'just maths', with China projected to emit 60% more CO2 than the US by 2030"".
&gt;
&gt;In his letter Prescott claims that Stern's arguments ""ignored the more transparent measure of pollution per capita, which shows the US emits 20 tonnes per person every year, compared to China's six tonnes, whilst America's GDP per person is almost eight times greater than the Chinese"". He also attacks President Barack Obama for suggesting there had been a period of ""two decades of talking and no action. That might have been true in America, which refused to sign up to Kyoto, but not in the case of China or Europe, who followed a lot of that protocol's policies. Indeed Obama's offer of a 17% cut is wholly dependent on Congressional approval and will still be less than Kyoto targets."" Prescott is climate change convenor for the Council of Europe, with the role of exploring how to keep the talks on the road.

EDIT: I'm not, of course, saying China is any less to blame - far as I'm concerned both they and you guys screwed up.

Lithuania fears exposure as reactor shuts down

By Andrew Ward in Ignalina, Lithuania

Published: January 2 2010 02:00 | Last updated: January 2 2010 02:00

It was at about 8pm on New Year's eve when technicians started reducing output from the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania. The bright yellow generating unit in its cavernous turbine hall fell silent for the last time an hour before midnight.

Closure of Ignalina was a condition of Lithuania's entry into the European Union in 2004, amid concern over the safety of its Soviet-era reactors, which are similar to the one involved in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

But the deadline could hardly have come at a worse time for the Baltic country as it faces the loss of its biggest source of electricity - covering nearly three-quarters of demand - while battling through its deepest recession since breaking from the Soviet Union two decades ago.

In addition to the 30 per cent increase in electricity prices forecast by the government, the shutdown also threatens Lithuania's energy security as the country is forced to turn to Russia and other neighbours to fill the power shortfall.

""We are becoming even more dependent on [energy] imports from Russia,"" says Andrius Kubilius, Lithuania's prime minister, warning that this makes the country ""very sensitive to anything that happens [politically] on Russia's -borders"".

The government insists it has already secured enough supplies of electricity and natural gas to cope without Ignalina. But Arvydas Sekmokas, the energy minister, admits the shutdown has exposed the region's dependence on Soviet-era power infrastructure. ""The Baltic countries are still an energy island within the EU,"" he says, referring to Lithuania and neighbouring Latvia and Estonia, which were among the first wave of former communist states to join the EU.

Steps are under way to reduce the region's isolation, with work scheduled to start this year on an undersea cable between Lithuania and Sweden to connect the Baltic states to the Scandinavian power grid by 2016. Another link is planned with Poland.

But Lithuania is staking its greatest hopes on a €3bn-€5bn ($4.3bn-$7.2bn, £2.7bn-£4.4bn) plan to build a new nuclear plant at Ignalina in partnership with Latvia, Estonia and Poland. The government launched the tender process last month, inviting bids from companies interested in building and operating the facility. All of Europe's biggest nuclear power groups, such as EDF of France, RWE of Germany, and Iberdrola of Spain, have been touted as potential investors. Lithuania is aiming to sign a binding deal during the second half of 2010.

There is still much to be decided, such as the size of stake to be taken by the private investor and each participating country, and some sceptics question whether the project will get off the ground, given the rotten state of public finances in the crisis-hit Baltic region. Lithuania's economy is forecast to have shrunk by about 18 per cent in 2009 while its budget deficit ballooned to 10 per cent of gross domestic product.

Mr Sekmokas insists the plant will be built.

""We are moving really fast,"" he says. But even if construction goes ahead on schedule, the earliest the new Ignalina will start producing electricity is 2018. Until then, Lithuania will be reliant on other countries for power.

Ignalina is surrounded by oak forests on the banks of Druksiai, Lithuania's biggest lake, close to the border with Belarus and Latvia. One of its two reactors was closed soon after EU entry, with a deadline of December 31 2009 set for switching off the other. It was one of 12 surviving Chernobyl-style reactors and the only one outside Russia.

Many Lithuanians resent the forced closure. In a referendum last year, 90 per cent voted to extend the plant's life until a replacement was built but low turnout invalidated the result. ""We have an obligation to close it as part of the entry agreement with the EU,"" says Mr Sekmokas. ""We must follow the law.""

Victor Shevaldin, Ignalina's director-general, does not hide his disappointment. A veteran of the Soviet nuclear industry, he has worked at Ignalina since it started operations in 1983. ""Throughout those years, Ignalina has worked very stably,"" he says, in an interview in his spartan, wood-panelled office a few hundred metres from the reactor. ""It was a purely political decision to shut it down. Technically, it would have been quite easy to modernise the reactors and go on with operations for another 20 years.""

Cranes loom over the site of a new waste storage facility being built to receive spent fuel rods and other radioactive material after closure. Mr Shevaldin says the decommissioning process will take 25 years and cost hundreds of millions of euros. ""Decommissioning is more challenging than construction,"" he says. ""So January 1 is the beginning, not the end.""

,,t5_2qh13,"Just going to add from another article:

The shutdown comes even as the EU seeks more energy independence from Russia, though it refused Lithuanian efforts to delay the Ignalina shutdown.

The EU wanted the 1980s plant shut down as a condition of EU membership because the two RBMK-1500 model reactors are too similar to the RBMK-1000 version that exploded at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, casting a radioactive cloud over Europe. Ignalina's first reactor was shut down in 2004, while the second will stop sending power to the grid an hour before midnight Dec. 31, although it will take years to complete the decomissioning process, including building final storage for the spent fuel.

Come Jan. 1, the country will cover the shortfall by buying kilowatts on the open market — from Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. By 2013 it hopes to build a new natural-gas power plant, but that would fall short of meeting its own energy needs.

Russia is ready to fill the gap, and is gearing up to build a two-reactor nuclear plant just 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Lithuanian border in Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad, wedged between Poland and Lithuania.

The planned $5 billion Baltic Nuclear Power Plant, to be built near the town of Sovetsk, would be overkill for Kaliningrad, a region of 1 million people whose future energy needs are already taken care of by a planned gas-fired power plant to be built by 2012.

""We'll export all the output from the nuclear power plant ... we've never concealed that fact,"" Kaliningrad's regional governor, Georgy Boos, told The Associated Press in his office in the exclave. ""By 2016, when we launch the first reactor, there will be a huge energy shortage"" throughout the Baltic Sea region, he said.

To assuage European fears about reliance on Russian kilowatts, Russia is offering foreign investors a minority stake in the new plant.

The problem is, Lithuania is essentially courting the same pool of investors for its own planned new plant in Visaginas. If the Russian plant is already established, Lithuania will be hard pressed for a market for its own future plant.

Because Lithuania still functions on the old Soviet power grid, it is isolated from Europe's — though the EU is working over the long term on building new connections to change that.

Lithuania is pinning its hopes on two possible alternatives: a euro600 million underwater power cable with Sweden, and a euro1.1 billion grid connection beween Alytas, Lithuania, and Elk in northern Poland.

But the link with Sweden will require eight years, and the one with Poland a decade, according to a new EU study. This is why Ignalina plant boss Shevaldin thinks Lithuania's chances of finding investors ""aren't very good.""

""Russia has the advantage since it already knows what kind of reactor it will build. In this sense they'll build their station quicker than Lithuania,"" said Shevaldin, a native Russian who moved to Lithuania in the 1980s.

Belarus is also eager to join the competition and have Russia's Rosatom build ",1426172912,t1_c0i3ywy,c0i3ywy,0,t3_akta4,False,worldnews,MrBukowski,False,0,1262475829,,2,0,True,t1_c0i3y3e,2,

What's happening is that ""globalization"" has caused governments to take a back seat to corporate interests. Government has become too much of a servant of certain large corporations and industries.

An interesting question!  As someone who spends a considerable amount of time on the shitter (an hour a day), I have a bit of personal experience on this very subject.  You should attack this problem on multiple fronts.

* First, as another poster said, increase your fiber intake.  Bananas will usually bulk up your bowel movements -- add more mass -- and ensure the poop comes out as clean as possible.   It can happen.  I have moved my bowels a few times and had to use ZERO toilet paper.  Plus, a clean turd just feels good.  It sorta slips out of your anus like a brown snake.  No fuss.  No soiled buttocks.  Just a long, brown, bulky turd.  Bonus points if you can loop it in the toilet.  

* Next, and this is essential, you have to wipe at least once while sitting on the shitter.  A back to front movement is essential.  The alternative, a front to back, only serves to push the poop into the upper recesses of your buttocks -- and require more TP to clean.  The first wipe is the most important and serves to remove the most external doodie.

* Do NOT stand up and take the first wipe.  When you stand up, you make a shitty mess into a shittier mess.  As you stand, your buttocks come together and press the external shit up and down your buttcrack.  The end result is more shit to clean.

* However, after the first wipe, it is permissible to crouch or stand for the second wipe.  The second wipe should be a front to back motion -- from your testicles to the top of your buttocks.  Generally, you want dive in, grab the remaining external doodie, and pull it out as quick as possible.  The goal here is to capture the remaining doodie in a quick, almost scooping, movement 

Generally, the first wipe is 5 sheets and the second is three.    Your mileage will vary depending on your size and ass mass.  The more mass in your ass, the more TP needed.

Of course, to avoid all of this, you could move to a European country and use a bidet.  Despite its French name, it is quite possibly the best doodie removal in the world.

In closing, good luck.  Make sure you bring good reading material.  It can also serve as emergency TP in that terrible event that you run out of TP.

""Today, skeletal remains from South African LSA are generally believed to be ancestral to historic peoples in the region, including the Khoikhoi and San. The ancient people did not mysteriously disappear: they are still with us! The artistic legacy of the ancient peoples, clearly evidenced in rock art, is impressive but no more so than that of the European Upper Paleolithic or that of indigenous Australians.

And their brains were not all that big. Boskop itself is a large skull, but it is a clear standout in the sample of ancient South African crania; other males range from 1350 to 1600 ml (these are documented by Henneberg and Steyn 1993). That is around the same as Upper Paleolithic Europeans and pre-Neolithic Chinese. LSA South Africans fit in with their contemporaries around the world.

To be sure, there has been a reduction in the average brain size in South Africa during the last 10,000 years, and there have been parallel reductions in Europe and China -- pretty much everywhere we have decent samples of skeletons, it looks like brains have been shrinking. This is something I've done quite a bit of research on, and will continue to do so, because it's interesting. But it is hardly a sign that ancient humans had mysterious mental powers -- it is probably a matter of energetic efficiency (brains are expensive), developmental time (brains take a long time to mature) and diet (brains require high protein and fat consumption, less and less available to Holocene populations).

So, how did this idea of ancient Boskops make it into a book by two neuroscientists in 2008?

If not through science, then possibly from science fiction. The ""Boskop race"" was immortalized in popular writing by Loren Eiseley, who included an essay on Boskop Man in his collection, The Immense Journey, first published in 1958. As you can see, by this time the entire concept of a ""Boskop race"" had fallen into scientific disrepute. But Eiseley was undeterred: he conjured the idea that the Boskopoids were advanced in their large brains and small faces -- the apex of a trend toward paedomorphism, the retention of juvenile characteristics. In this state, they resembled what Eiseley suggested would be the ""Future Man"": """,1426172957,t1_c0i42d8,c0i42d8,0,t3_akx4p,False,reddit.com,[deleted],False,0,1262479977,,3,0,True,t3_akx4p,3,

I'm not claiming it's the same kind of Empire.  But then, the Roman model was different from the late European model.  Both of which were different form Holy Roman Empire model.  All had similarities, but many substantial differences as well. 

It's also, I believe, very early on in the process.  And Rome and Britain were both more than happy to use the client state model when it gave them what they wanted.  Rome didn't care if a North African King wanted to claim he was independent as long as he obeyed them.   Only when he stopping listening did they they send in the legions to formally incorporate it into the Empire.

,,t5_6,"&gt;Serious mathematics may have been developed after astrology first was, but it is in no sense an offshoot. Mathematics is a pure discipline. (I majored in computer science, which is applied mathematics.)

But mathematics is required to perform astrological calculations. It requires careful measurement, and often necessitated the construction of a specialized tool -- the [astrolabe](http://astrolabes.org/history.htm) which could in fact be called an early computer, perhaps the first computer. [This fascinating TED talk demonstrates how an astrolabe works and makes the case for it being the personal computer of it's day since it has hundreds of uses.](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/tom_wujec_demos_the_13th_century_astrolabe.html) Applied mathematics indeed!

You know, that's one of the things that bugs me about your completely mainstream, boring, predictable argument here: You're a scientist who ignores or derides the wisdom of your discipline's early practitioners. Far from being stupid, the ancients were brilliant, and had to be, not only to survive but to contribute to the growth of human knowledge, through whatever framework. Astrology was the Evolution of its day; it was the accepted theoretical framework through which the educated classes viewed the world. The less educated were apt to scoff at astrology because they didn't understand how it worked. As you can see from the TED video, it's more complex than glancing at your iPod. 

It's worth noting that while the theory of geocentrism was disproven, astrology was never been convincingly refuted like geocentricism was. While astrology is geocentric, that's only because you were born on the surface of the earth. If you were born on the surface of the sun (ouch!) you'd have to talk to a [heliocentric astrologer](http://www.heliocentric-astrology.com/) to get a birth chart. As you can see, astrology is not dogmatic about geocentricism, it's just that it's only relevant insofar as heliocentricism provides more accurate celestial positions.

&gt;This seems to happen in every discipline except astrology, where for some mysterious reason, even the young up-and-coming scientists think it's bogus.

Do they, or is that a chicken and the egg problem? You probably weren't taught astrology in school. If it was mentioned at all it was in the form of derision. However, the repression may only be strong enough to prevent further study in the west; [Indian scientists are using astrology to advise heart patients.](http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/7/5/nation/20090705151829&amp;sec=nation)

&gt;Also, what about the fact that Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto weren't even discovered by humanity until 1781, 1846, and 1930? Doesn't this mean that all prior astrological claims are faulty, since they didn't take into account the positions of those planets? What about all the other trans-Neptunian large objects, like Sedna and Quaoar?

Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are considered generational planets, without quite as much significance on their own; usually they are considered when aspecting a closer planet (their transits can last years). They certainly would have been a factor in pre-discovery charts (an unknown one), but they have found a place in modern charts, and hopefully provide more accurate readings as a result. There are 10 established rulers but 12 signs so astrologers are debating which planets/comets to use for which sign. I use centaur comet Chiron as the ruler of Virgo, but the whole community isn't on-board yet. Quaoar and Sedna in particular will be tested to see if they work in Virgo or Libra, the other sign missing its own ruler.

&gt;Dark matter is a posited substance, astrology is a set of claims and concepts. It is literally a non sequitur to compare them in this way.

The key word in your first sentence is ""posited"". We don't even know it's a substance; it could be a new force (or dark energy could be, if you want to consider them separately) or something else entirely. It could be several things that combine into one observed phenomena under most conditions. 

&gt;To the best of my knowledge, astrology makes very few disprovable claims, which makes it not scientific, not rational, not repeatable, and therefore of no use. There's no point in searching for the mechanism that explains astrology until astrology actually observes something that needs a mechanism to explain it.

I agree that I could find a better metaphor than dark matter/energy, and I have one: [psychoanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis#Criticism).  It is more apropos because it also deals with the human mind/personality and it has also been accused of being unfalsifiable and a pseudoscience; it still has mainstream proponents and haters, just like astrology. In fact, Freud's friend and eventual rival Carl Jung embraced astrology instead, [who explained](http://www.astrologyweekly.com/astrology-articles/carl-g-jung-quotes.php):

&gt;We are born at a given moment in a given place and like vintage years of wine we have the qualities of the year and of the season in which we are born. Astrology does not lay claim to anything else. - C.G.Jung

He said it is a function of time and perhaps light. I'm sure you want a more air-tight explanation, but guess what -- psychology is full of this wishy-washy barely-testable stuff and sociology is in the same boat. The French Revolution is not a repeatable event, so testing to see what factors affect a revolution is extremely difficult. 

It's obvious you're in love with the hard sciences, probably because they tend to give solid answers. However psychology is a ""soft"" science and has proven very little in its hundred or so years as distinct from astrology. Perhaps you should pick a psychological school of thought and defend that versus astrology. I imagine you will recoil from that idea because you know any psychological school of thought is vulnerable to the same arguments astrology is. The success rate of modern psychological practices are also very vulnerable to attack, despite having vastly more research in its favor (but also against). 

So you're absolutely right -- comparing astrology to a hard science like astrophysics is a non sequitur. If you wish to attack astrology's validity you must defend a competing theory of personality typification.

Still glad I mentioned dark matter?  :)

(By the way, quantum mechanics are still useful to scientists studying astrophysics ([and vice versa](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090716093526.htm)), and may be instrumental to discovering what dark energy is and how it works. Despite the small scale of QM (or maybe because of it!) it's still relevant in an area as large-scaled as astrophysics. Of course, some quantum particles may end up being extremely massive, which has implications for gravity and any unified theory.)

Anyway, I suspect you are out of your element in the soft sciences. Please prove me wrong and show me a psychological rubric that is better at predicting personality type than astrology. 

As you do so, bear in mind the meaning behind these [Carl Jung quotes](http://www.astrologyweekly.com/astrology-articles/carl-g-jung-quotes.php):

&gt;The truth is that astrology flourishes as never before. There is a regular library of astrological books and magazines that sell for far better than the best scientific works. The Europeans and Americans who have horoscopes cast for them may be counted not by the hundred thousand but by the million. Astrology is a flourishing industry. ... If such a large percentage of the population has an insatiable need for this counter pole to the scientific spirit, we can be sure that the collective psyche in every individual - be he never so scientific - has this psychological requirement in equally high degree. A certain kind of ""scientific"" scepticism and criticism in our time is nothing but a misplaced compensation of the powerful and deep-rooted superstitious impulses of the collective psyche. *- C.G. Jung, Two Essays on Analytical Psychology*

Oh snap! He says you're overcompensating!

&gt;While studying astrology I have applied it to concrete cases many times. ... The experiment is most suggestive to a versatile mind, unreliable in the hands of the unimaginative, and dangerous in the hands of a fool, as those intuitive methods always are. If intelligently used the experiment is useful in cases where it is a matter of an opaque structure. It often provides surprising insights. The most definite limit of the experiment is lack of intelligence and literal-mindedness of the observer. ... Undoubtedly astrology today is flourishing as never before in the past, but it is still most unsatisfactorily explored despite very frequent use. It is an apt tool only when used intelligently. It is not at all foolproof and when used by a rationalistic and narrow mind it is a definite nuisance. *- C. G. Jung: Letters, volume 2, 1951-1961, pages 463-464, letter to Robert L. Kroon, 15 November 1958*

People often find modern psychology unsatisfactory and so they seek out alternate explanations like astrology. Perhaps that itself is a blistering critique of any psychological framework you might propose is superior. 

Modern science must stop the mockery and grow up and start learning from its elder sister.

&gt;Obviously astrology has much to offer psychology, but what the latter can offer its elder sister is less evident. So far as I judge, it would seem to me advantageous for astrology to take the existence of psychology into account, above all the psychology of the personality and of the unconscious. *- Carl G. Jung*

And indeed it has: Neptune is considered to affect the subconscious. Perhaps Neptune alone is offensive to the rational mind Jung speaks of because it rules mysticism. Yet for a rationalist looking for the cause of the stubborn belief in the divine throughout the history of mankind, Neptune provides a possible answer.

That is citation. 

Nonetheless, I can still refute if if I show you even a single historical writing which mentions rain and spring connection. But since that would take time, you can sleep easy for a few months or even years till then knowing that part of Koran's authencity is soundly based on IEEEE-Wiliey's publication, which I find amusing. This is not a putdown, but a reminder that you are defending ""G-d's work"" in your own words; and to base even part of its authenticity on some mortal's words would be foolish. **You** should use only logic and reality to get that point across, imo. Otherwise its denigrating G-d, imho.

&gt; why did it take modern Europe almost a century to prove it, after the idea was suggested?

I have no idea how it was proven, but let me tell you what would be *one* proof. First they would have to measure (one aspect of ) the spring water's mineral composition, before it rained. After taking the reading, you wait till rains are over. Then you measure the same aspect again. If you find it has diluted or become more like rain, you can put forward the theory that rain water is mixing with groundwater. Just because people hadn't had *such* proofs before whatever link you are asking me to google, does not mean **noone** had found the connection. Again to get you at least one person who found the connection without divine intereventiuon, it can take me months, if I retain my interest at all, which is not likely. 

People knew earth was round *long* before Columbus, they ""knew"" that sun went around eath long before Copernicus, atleast one greek even knew that circle couldn't be squared (1) before it was finally proven in 1882.

Indians across the entire Americas thought with each other before the Europeans arrived. The concept of the ""great warrior"" was not something that was invented the moment Europeans arrived. The more advanced the tribe /nation was the least attuned to nature they where. Incas being the advanced.
I.e. The image we are being spoon fed with, that native Americans being pacifists and only killing exactly what they needed and being with out greed, is false. 



The rest

The south American Indians (A.k.a Incas) Attacked other tribes, even their own ""citizens"" and lived beyond their means and was just recovering from a civil war before the Europeans got there.  As for the North American Tribes they thought among them self, though not at the same scale as the Europeans thought with other nations/cultures. But the European empires had evolved in far rougher and competitive climate.

Though some of the North American tribes tried to keep an balance between them self an their surrounding nature for spiritual reasons. Most other tribes did what they had to, to make sure there was food on the table. With the advantage that they where small tribes even if they killed more then their share of animals in one area it would have had a low impact especially since many where hunter / gatherer societies moving around with the seasons.

When I can process PDF documents from python or ruby we might consider it a widely adopted format.  At the moment only two proprietary code bases that I know of (Apple's and Adobe's) can deal with it.

&gt;You still don't get it. I don't want a ""proper editor"". I want to pick my editor, and include vi, emacs, and textmate in my list of options. 

You mean a ""proper editor"" like Acrobat.  Yes, we don't want closed formats.

Those that you named are all ""proper editors"" for a specific file format.  Up until a few years ago - ASCII.  They couldn't even deal with most of Europe.  Great format.  Linear ASCII text.  Then they got revved to support UTF-8 (some of them).  Its still a minefield, that but I guess if you only speak English and stay in the USA you're safe.  No meta storage facility in that though.  Big part of the problem - no standard for meta.

You're the one who still doesn't get it.  Linear text is just a file format and a pretty poor one at that.  Now all our text processing is based on assumptions about what the file holds.  Sucks ass.  Character encodings that are assumed because there's no meta storage facility.  A simple header would have sufficed.  Few lines of RFC 822 - would that be so hard?

I say lets have a different common format for storing attributed text and build editors for that you fucking caveman.

,,t5_2qh1i,"Don't sweat it. Of all the countries out there, I believe US has the second least amount of cultural shock [*] for Indians in general. You already would have friends or relatives living somewhere in the US, or perhaps have seen it all on TV (Friends, eg) or movies.

(Now, don't get me wrong, we're culturally the same with most of our neighbours, but sadly, the Ugly Indian has reared his head many times in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and they tend to look at us as boors, much like Europeans look at Americans, incidentally. Pakistan is a different tale; they're just like us, except they're significantly more emotional. Works both ways, it's either extreme friendship or extreme mistrust)

But yes, you ask about America . Remember a few things:-

a) Americans _love_ to chat. We do too, but mostly in our mother tongues and in our small-towns and villages; if you're from a metropolitan area, you probably won't be used to chatting with the guy sitting next to you. They tend to do that a lot in (what I call as) 'small big towns' like Seattle, SFO etc.

b) Americans _have_ a sense of humour. Now it isn't wry like the British's, or in-your-face as StarOne comedy shows, but it crops up in unexpected places. Also, it's more likely than not that you wouldn't understand the joke in the first go; difference in accent or lack of knowledge on social constructs (Do YOU know what wikiality is, for example?) can be a problem, in which case, smile gently and move on.

Corollary: Contrary to what the Americans here suggest, it is _okay_ to not laugh at jokes that you think are offensive. You don't have to make a fuss about it, often a quick glare would do the trick, but there's no reason to debase yourself just to get along. What you have to remember, though, is that most people mean well; in inter-cultural contexts, it's often critical to distinguish between 'intent' and 'outcome'. If you're sure of intent, but don't like the outcome (the wording), don't sweat it. If you aren't sure of intent either, walk away. 

Likewise, I won't say a complete no to racially-tinged jokes that you'd make, but you need to be self-aware as to whether you're caricaturizing, or are simply pulling someone's legs. (The first obviously is a no) While at it, remember that not all Americans are Anglo; especially in places like LA, most people are often mixed, with some European / Latino heritage even if they don't appear to be on first sniff.

c) Most Indians find Americans very egregious; you'd meet someone two days back, and when you meet them again today, they'd treat you like a long-lost friend. We Indians are easily swayed by this (or are alarmed); we often extend such bonhomie after years of friendship. Which is why some Indians think Americans are very superficial in relationships, or are _chipkos_ (Ind-glish term for someone who 'sticks' to you even you don't want them to). The reality, as always, is somewhere in between: you just need to re-calibre your empathy meter accordingly. The trick is to respond back with questions on some personal detail you remember about that person (and most Americans do drop hints along the way, either about sports or music or their kid's soccer game) and then quickly move on to business. 

d) The Red-State-Blue-State split is a politico-liberal fantasy that arm-chair sociologists have cooked up. America is a vast nation with a variety of political opinions across the land; you're as likely to meet a gun-toting anarcho-capitalist-libertarian in California, as you'd meet a latte-drinking-tofu-eating liberal in Texas. It's just an accident of contemporary politics that certain states elect certain kinds of politicians; it has little or no bearing on how your neighbours would treat you, or how your community is. Smalltown CA is exactly like Hicksville, AL.

&gt; For the last year or so, I've split my time between two complexes in the part of town where most of my city's blacks live.

So you work for two complexes where poor black trash lives. You will obviously see a sample of poor black trash. If you work for a white trash complex you will see sample of white trash. If you work for a low-income apartment complex in Albania you will see Albanian trash and in France you will see French trash etc etc etc etc.

Each community of trash has its own signature characteristics. (When one thinks of white trash, for example, one thinks of inbreeding and trailers, and when one thinks of black trash one thinks of single welfare moms and money stupidly spent on luxury items). As a (presumably) white person it is easier for you to recognize the social reasons behind white trash (namely, lack of education and poverty). However, since there is a clear difference between you and the poor blacks, it can be a knee-jerk reaction to associate black trash behavior with black skin color.

If you want a ""cure"" for racism simply pay a visit to middle- and upper-class black neighborhoods. Or Google this guy named ""Obama"". Or pay a visit to northern Europe where many (I'd venture to say most) blacks are educated African immigrants.

The situation has become more convoluted with the advent of the smoking ban. In short, you can't smoke tobacco in a coffeeshop.

Anyway, a coffeeshop needs to be licensed. That license can be taken away if said coffeeshop breaks the [arbitrary] rules set by the government.

A coffeeshop can't hold more than a certain amount of weed/hash in the shop, and they aren't allowed to sell more than a certain amount to one customer. The customer must be 18 years of age, or older.

The shop pays taxes on it's total turn-over, not on the sale of weed since EU regulations stipulate that it's illegal for a country to profit off illegal drug trade.

A lot of the weed sold in tourist coffeeshops are 'tumbled'. That means the fresh batch of dried weed goes through [maybe a couple] of cycles in a tumbler that separated the THC crystals from the buds. The tumbled buds are then sold to tourists at an inflated price. The THC crystals are pressed and sold as high grade hash at an inflated price.

In most, if not all, coffeeshops you can't buy alcohol.

,,t5_2qh3l,"Good morning comrade,

&gt; If we wanted cheap oil, we could've abused oil for food like the Russians and French did.

But that wouldn't give the US a strategic advantage over its competitors in the global race for oil, among them France and Russia.  And I didn't say the invasion was sensible, and necessarily worked out well for the US.  In some ways it did, it some ways it didn't.  But certainly for the leaders at the time (Bush &amp; Co.) it was a strategic decision to exploit the 9-11 attacks as justification to launch a war that ultimately favors over its major competitors China, Russia, and to some extent even the EU.  China and Russia aren't in this mess are they? Although it's on their doorstep, and not ours.

It's not about pure territory either.  It's not even about winning.  That's what people, and you among them don't understand.  That the US doesn't send a million troops over there to win is no indication of a lack of understanding of military strategy, but proof that the US doesn't want to win but to stay, where its boot at apply pressure on its competitors over the coming decades.

And that was a response to just your first paragraph.

&gt; If we wanted cheap oil, we could've abused oil for food like the Russians and French did.

You are so mistaken.  Where do you get your news?  Again it's not about territory, and it's not morality you're intent on believing.  The US supports dictatorships and democracies alike.  They both have their uses. 

&gt; The absolute best way for America to have increased its standing in the world with Iraq would have been to quickly defeat Saddam (which was done) and quickly turn the country back over to Iraqis

Indeed.  But that didn't happen did it.  Why?  What are these reasons you speak of?

Last summer, a girl I had a crush on since the 2nd grade began to flirt with me as we watched my physics teacher lose on Jeopardy. We were in a sports bar with some teachers and classmates and I sat down near her. She talked to me and somehow we ended up with pulling knotted cherry stems out of our respective mouths. 

During the last school year, we began to get close. She ended an internet relationship and our....whatever it was, but then turned to me, due to loneliness? 

Summer came and I was getting tired of the whole ""friends with minor benefits"" and tried to get her to leave me alone as I was/am completely stuck on her. That was a horrible idea as we were both too emotionally dependent on each other. Since I left her alone for about a month, this guy who liked her since 6th grade was given a chance to go out with her. Mind you, I was never in anything official with her, but this guy got the title I wanted. 

So now, I am the guy on the side (sometimes) and I am going to shape my future around her. Where she goes I will, even though she has a boyfriend.

The 9/11 terrorists must have believed they were doing the right thing and that directly following their suicides and mass murder, they would not simply be forgiven, but rewarded -- that god would be delighted at what they had done.

,,t5_2qh1q,"This is a hot topic for debate, and I doubt people on either side will convince the other for a while.

The problem is that the vast majority of evidence of migrations so far is ""linguistic"" evidence, which is largely theoretical, and not sufficiently empirical. People have formed theories about how the effect of human migrations would impact languages spoken in those areas, and they use these theories to analyze modern day languages and come to conclusions about where and how they originated.

But actual evidence in support of such theories is weak, since we haven't observed the mutation of languages in historical times sufficiently to make any grand statements about how things ought to be. So you can have, for example, data indicating that the Indo-European language group is more diverse in Central Asia than in India (which is a known fact), and from that reach two opposing conclusions. One group saying that more diversity means that Central Asia is closer to the point of origin, and the other group saying that less diversity means India is closer to the point of origin. Both groups can offer plausible explanations for why their theory is right, but neither can prove it.

The linguistic evidence, depending on how you interpret it, points to 3 possibilities:

1. Either the Indo-European languages entered India from the northwest around 2000 BC, or
2. The Indo-European languages originated in India, but are pre-Harappan (predate 4000 BC), or
3. Our linguistic theories are just wrong.

I would not hold my breath waiting for the linguists to sort it all out. I tend to think that if a solution appears, it will be based on physical and anthropological evidence. Perhaps some day we'll have solid archeological evidence showing a migration of people either east to west or the opposite, that can be dated precisely. This won't happen until Indian archeology itself is better established, meaning until the Indian government spends some serious cash digging relevant sites along the north Gangetic plain, and Pakistan spends some money digging near the presumed sites of the Saraswati.

The other possibility is DNA evidence. We're starting to see some very early evidence of migrations into and out of India in both mt-DNA and Y-chromosomal haplotypes. But sample sizes are still very small so the statistics haven't gotten very powerful yet. But this is really what I see as the best hope, because while developments in linguistics or archeology may be uncertain, I think it's a good bet we'll be able to bring the cost of DNA sequencing down pretty dramatically over the next decade. Then it will be cheap for scientists to create large databases of sequences from people all across the world, including India. So whatever theories of linguistics and migrations people come up with, will have to fit the DNA evidence or else most scientists won't take them seriously.",1426173450,t1_c0i54eu,c0i54eu,0,t3_aky2s,False,india,DaveM191,True,0,1262539630,,3,0,True,t1_c0i49jg,3,

Likely, even for free at the source, just from transmission cost, the cost would be to high.  And, no significant electric grid would want to try to handle the dangerous grid instability issues from the unpredictable source, even if the energy were delivered for free.

That electric energy source solves no existing problem because, thankfully from some magnificent engineering over the past 100 years, electric energy is not a problem, and here is some of why:

In the US, electric energy at the plant from coal costs less than 3 cents per kWh and nuclear, 2 cents.  From the 'WSJ' in August, the US wholesale price of electric energy was 0.4 cents per kWh and has been comfortably under 1 cent since year 2000.  This is for solidly reliable energy, close to the users.  For some source, more expensive, unreliable, a long way from the users, f'get about it.

The screaming about the importance of 'clean, renewable, carbon-free' energy is just a made-up, flim-flam, scam, fraud effort to get money and power from you -- good evidence below.

Here is some very good news:  For your concerns about 'carbon' and humans overheating the planet, f'get about it!

Below I give evidence with good references in parts (A) through (F).

Net, the concerns about significant, harmful global warming caused by humans is 100% a flim-flam, scam, fraud that serves the interests of (1) Al Gore who wants fame or whatever, (2) nearly all 'climate scientists' who want to get grant money (no 'crisis', no grant money), (3) some people in business who want to sell equipment that is too expensive and without screams of 'global warming' would sell little or nothing (wind turbines, solar panels, smart grid controls), (4) people in government who want to get money by raising taxes and get power from new laws, (5) much of the media, e.g., NYT, WoPo, LAT, NBC, who want a non-stop stream of 'stories', cheap and easy to write, to grab people by the gut, to get eyeballs for ads for ad revenue, (6) some venture capital partners eager to create a stock market bubble for 'clean energy' stocks, and possibly a few more.

look at the graph on page 2, and conclude that the temperature of the Earth is almost exactly the same now as in year 1000.

Year 1600?  Sure, the temperature was lower then.  Likely the best explanation is some temporary volcano activity that put a lot of sulfur into the upper atmosphere.  That put the Earth into 'The Little Ice Age', killed off the human settlements in Greenland, caused a lot of crop failures in Europe, likely created the ice as G. Washington crossed the Delaware River, likely created the especially cold weather as Napoleon retreated from Moscow, and we don't want to go back to that.

Since 400 years ago, the volcanoes quieted down, and we pulled out of 'The Little Ice Age' and got back to the temperature in year 1000 before The Little Ice Age.

Net, since year 1000, the Earth has not been getting warmer, from humans or anything else.

(B) Look at the graph of US temperature from NOAA at

     http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/images/1208natltemp.png

Net, since 1885, the US hasn't been getting warmer.

(D) Watch Al Gore's movie 'An Inconvenient Truth' again and pay attention to his evidence.

Some of his evidence is just absurd, e.g., pictures of icebergs breaking off from glaciers that reach the sea; when a glacier reaches the sea, pieces break off as icebergs; always have; always will.

Much of his evidence is anecdotal, e.g., some glacier in Patagonia.  There will always be some extreme situations, setting some new records, somewhere in the world so that for such evidence just find some such situations.  So, such anecdotal evidence is meaningless.

Apparently Gore got some of the data from the ice core the Russians drilled from their Vostok station in Antarctica in year 2003.  See

     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core#Vostok

That core goes back about 420,000 years with a graph of the data at

     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vostok-ice-core-petit.png

Gore saw that CO2 and temperature went up together, noticed that CO2 levels are relatively high now, and predicted that temperature will go way up soon, with disaster.

But Gore ignored a point:  Did (i) the higher CO2, from whatever source, cause the higher temperatures or (ii) the higher temperatures, from whatever source, cause more biological activity and, thus, more CO2?

Well, more recent analysis of the data shows that the CO2 went up about 800 years after the temperature went up causing us to conclude (ii) and not (i).

     ""Chapter 2, Changes in Atmospheric

with lead authors

     Piers Forster (UK), Venkatachalam
     Ramaswamy (USA)

and on page 133 and following read about their key concept of 'radiative forcing'.  This concept is their own and appears nowhere else in physics.

Their work with their 'radiative forcing' is basically a simple 'energy balance' model that ignores any changes in fluid flows, and more in the basic physics, in the atmosphere and oceans caused by the changes they are predicting.  So, at best that approach might work for some small changes for short periods of time.  For predicting the temperature of the Earth 50 to 100 years from now, it's useless.

Net, it's not good science.  That writing is most of the best the global warming alarmists have, and they don't have anything.

watch the R. Lindzen lecture.  Lindzen is a good candidate for the best scientist working on climate anywhere in the world; he's a chaired professor at MIT.

Lindzen discusses Arctic ice cover, the 'tipping point', 'feedback' effects, some of the really absurd climate science', and more.

In particular, in the first part, as Lindzen explains, Michael Hulme was the head of the (now notorious 'Climate Gate') Tyndall Center for Climate Studies at the University of East Anglia and author of the book 'Why We Disagree about Climate Change' with:

     ""The idea of climate change should be
     seen as an intellectual resource
     around which our collective and
     personal identities and projects can
     form and take shape.  We need to ask
     not what we can do for climate
     change, but to ask what climate
     change can do for us.

     ""Because the idea of climate change
     is so plastic, it can be deployed
     across many of our human projects and
     can serve many of our psychological,
     ethical, and spiritual needs.

     ""We will continue to create and tell
     new stories about climate change and
     mobilize them in support of our
     projects.

     ""These myths transcend the scientific
     categories of 'true' and 'false'"".

So, directly from Michael Hulme, one of the more important screaming 'climate scientists', 'global warming' is, like the threat of the pool table in 'The Music Man', an old English morality play about sinful humans, etc., propaganda.

Net, the whole 'climate change' concern is, directly from Hulme, admittedly, deliberately a flim-flam, scam, fraud.

Net, net, f'get about 'climate change'.

Why f'get about it?  Because some people are eager to use fear of 'climate change' to get money and power from you.  A good answer is in one word, ""No"".

,,t5_2qh1s,"&gt;Do you believe that there will be hyperinflation before 2020?

No. I think hyperinflation only happens when there is serious government structural problems (e.g. the war debt of Germany in the 1920s or the fact that Zimbabwe is ran by an idiot dictator). That isn't the case here. People often mention that we will need to hyperinflate to ease our debt load, but that isn't the case. The debt/GDP ratio has been much higher in the past here and even higher in other parts of the world without hyperinflation occurring. Additionally, hyperinflation has to be done on purpose by the central bank (either by excessive printing or by not taking money out of the economy if the velocity of money dramatically rises). Since the Federal Reserve would destroy any credibility it has by hyperinflating, it will not do so. The history of the Federal Reserve shows that it can control inflation or deflation very well when it has to. One example is the devaluing the dollar in 1933 by changing the price of gold. Another example is when oil supply shocks in the 70s caused high inflation and the Fed was able to kill the inflation completely by raising rates dramatically.

&gt;What is your explanation for the recession?

This is complex, but I'll try to keep it in logical order...

* The Asian financial crisis of the late 90s scared people there and as they recovered it resulted in lots of savings in Asian countries that was invested elsewhere, resulting in lots of free credit (google: Asian savings glut)
* The Federal Reserve probably had rates too low from 2002-2007. I tend to blame the Asian Savings Glut more than the Fed though because places in Europe also had huge housing bubbles that were not related to the Federal Reserve.
* The end of Glass-Steagall allowed the creation of massive and consolidated financial corporations (e.g. Citigroup, AIG, and BoA) that did lots of things under one roof.
* The growth of these institutions outside of commercial banking created the ""shadow banking system"" in which short term borrowing/long term investments (aka banks) were operating in a completely unregulated environment. A great example of this is the [auction rate securities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction_rate_security) market. Since these things worked like banks, they should have been regulated like banks prevent runs. They were not regulated though.
* The good tech bubble years and subsequent fairly painless end left investors desiring another bubble to ride.
* The decision to not regulate credit default swaps opened the possibility for AIG to sell CDS contracts to anyone it wanted to regardless of whether it could pay them out. If you aren't familiar with how a CDS works: basically party A pays party B installments to insure against some event. If the event happens, then party B pays out the value of the policy. In the case of this recession, party B was AIG and party A was companies like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Lehman Brothers.
* The rise of ""quants"" resulted in the creation and popularization of collateralized debt obligations on mortgages, which became the basis for other derivatives such as the ARS and CDS markets. CDOs themselves are fairly complex, but basically there is a pool of assets that pay some regular dividend into the pool (e.g. a mortgage payment), investors that own a security based on the pool receive a share of the dividend, and investors are ranked into different levels (e.g. the most valuable CDO security gets paid first and so on, meaning that if the pool stops generating return the low levels don't get paid). This meant that the highest levels of the CDO were rated AAA because mathematically it likely to always get the dividend.
* A commodity fetishism culture of accepting the use of credit for everything, combined with the cheap credit from the asian savings glut and the Federal Reserve's low rates, resulted in the start of a housing bubble.
* The housing bubble was made worse by the fact that the Bush administration did nothing to prevent very profitable fraud by mortgage lenders such as Countrywide. This was the shit like tricking people into adjustable rate mortgages and other scams.
* As the bubble grew, Americans got really greedy (much of which was just to keep their standards of living because of stagnant wages) and started using their homes for piggybanks (e.g. home equity loans). House flipping also became a popular past time.
* The financial derivatives I discussed above were sold like crazy among the major players. Because of the math behind the CDO, the companies were overconfident that a housing bust wouldn't harm them. They figured that they were hedged properly because of the AAA ratings of CDOs and the fact that they owned insurance in the form of CDS contracts.
* The last few points created a positive feedback loop, creating a huge housing bubble. The big banks (Citi, Lehman, etc.) borrowed like crazy and bought into CDOs and covered their asses with CDSs until they were at leverage ratios of 30-1.
* When the housing bubble crashed and it turned out to be everywhere and not just isolated to certain regions, the AAA CDOs became worthless. The CDS contracts then executed. Since CDS contracts were unregulated, AIG and other CDS sellers didn't back up their outstanding contracts with enough cash reserves, meaning that the banks that thought they were hedged really weren't. Since they all executed at once, AIG didn't have the money to pay everyone back.
* Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Wamu, etc. all fail because they can't pay its loans back. Other big banks such as Citi and BoA are in really deep shit for the same reason.
* Everybody panics. The stock market drops thousands of points. Baby boomers lose their 401Ks.
* TARP happens to save the other big banks from failing by basically giving them money to pay off their short term loans. Goldman Sachs benefits the most from this because they owned more AIG CDS contracts than anyone. TARP, for all its flaws, does prevent a complete collapse though.
* The credit markets are still jammed up because the big banks that are left are still in deep shit thanks to the fact they own a bunch of worthless securities and are generally afraid of doing business with anyone.
* The failure of the credit markets results in businesses in the real economy not being able to get their short term loans they need to operate. They are forced to cut production and start firing workers.
* The decreased production and firings mean that workers were spending less, which created a negative feedback loop for the real economy. Lots of companies that had nothing to do with the housing bubble start to fail.
* Americans generally feel like shit because they are underwater on the mortgage, their retirement money is gone, and they are out of work.

This pretty much puts us to the beginning of the Obama administration.

&gt; Do you believe that things would be better right now if there were no stimulus package?

I think things would be worse. It had a lot of aid for states and some good infrastructure projects. It also had lots of funding for various technology related things (e.g. incentives for green tech, scientific research money, etc.), which will create growth in the medium and long term.  However, I think the stimulus should have been bigger and focused more on projects that deal with unemployment directly and immediately rather than tax breaks and longer term projects.

&gt; Do you believe the Federal Reserve be replaced by a gold standard?

No. I think the gold standard is lame because it can't deal with deflation, as demonstrated by the Great Depression.

&gt; Do you realize that Keynesianism was not the dominant ideology during the Bush years?

Yes. It was a combination of supply-side ideology, crony capitalism, and generally being drunk at the wheel (e.g. the SEC).

,,t5_2qh63,"&gt;I'm saying that conducting a ""kinder gentler war"" where genocide is off the table, is a difficult if not impossible proposition. A war with rules like that is absurd.

Well, what you are saying is that citizens of different countries are less valuable than citizens of our country.

&gt;The government, any government, gains its power from the people, the people's willingness to suppport the govt's actions.

Are you actually in /r/Libertarian/ saying that the government is the will of the people?

&gt;There were millions of german patriots building planes and weapons and bombs, whistling and feeling every bit as loyal and patriotic as Rosie the Riveter in Gary, Indiana. The german people supported the war, wholeheartedly, until it started to go badly.

I'd actually like to pose the opposite position, that people didn't necessarily support the war. Have you read or seen [*Flags of our Fathers*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_our_fathers)? Americans in WWII were disillusioned with the war just like they are today.

Further, the German economy after Hitler came into power was nothing but a war economy. It had very little that people could do for money without working for the government or one of the companies working for the government.

&gt;The same is true, right here, in America, where people supported the Iraq invasion until it became clear that lots of American soldiers were continuing to die.

It's also true that people were angry about being lied to about the war. Unfortunately for your government is ""the will of the people"" argument, our government refuses to seriously re-examine any of their policies that have brought us to where we are today.

&gt;If that is the case, then the governments are showing that they are not in control, and of course the response to the parties being attacked is to go in and attempt to impose order.

What right do you have to tell people how to manage their lives, people or land? The fact that governments don't act how people want them to act AGAIN disproves your government = ""the will of the people"" argument above.

Governments do not represent the will of the people; they are the will of the political class and connected interests.

&gt;This is an old argument. The attacks on America are the choice of the attackers. You cannot blame america for that. And why and how do the attackers come to the decision? 

You're right, the choice is the attackers', and killing is a bad tactic for anyone to use. But to dismiss the stated reasons why Americans are being attacked as being ""old"" is to fall in the same trap that causes the US to be attacked. 

&gt;Yes, they have grievances, some of them justified. But to attack? No.

So what justifies the United States to attack and occupy Afghanistan when the 9/11 attacks were not conducted by a single Afghan and the attacks were planned in Germany and Florida? Most of the terrorists were Saudi; why aren't we invading Saudi Arabia?

&gt;That is in their culture. It comes from having failed to learn the lessons of the Enlightenment.

There are other terrorist movements that are not Muslims, many of which are in fact Europeans and did learn from the Enlightenment. Terrorism is the use of violence to exact political or social change. Again, your dismissal of the motivations of terrorists as being ""old"" ignores key facts.

,,t5_2qh1i,"&gt; I'm female, and I've had similar arguments with men who claim that women have a lower IQ.

Comparing the cranium sizes of women and men is in a sense like comparing apples and oranges. There is no question that the structure of female brains is significantly different to that of male brains. 

Intelligence tests do show that the intelligence tests of males and females are fairly close together (there is a significant difference between black and white scores on intelligence tests). There has been some speculation that the variance for intelligence in men is greater than in women (i.e. the averages are almost the same, but there are a lot more extremely stupid men and extremely smart men). (One of the persons who suggested this, for interest sake, was Lawrence Summers). 

&gt; If they are, do you not agree that a black man (or white woman) raised in a family that encourages education and that subsequently goes through the best schooling available will usually do better academically than a white male born to a poor, uneducated family?

First off, let’s get this straight. Intelligence is usually distributed as a normal distribution. This means that there will be extremely stupid white people and extremely smart black people. I am not claiming that all white people are smart and all black people are stupid. 

What you described in the above is called “boosting” in psychometrics. An interesting (and suprising) result of research into general intelligence is that general intelligence is not subject to boosting. General intelligence turns out to be an innate property of the brain (which is related to certain areas of the brain and the manner in which neurons fire). 

Therefore the athletics analogy is not apt for intelligence.

This also has interesting consequences (which have been demonstrated) in practice. Children adopted at birth for example regress to the intelligence of their biological parents (of any race). 

&gt; After all, even the Irish managed to do so! You know, despite their propensity towards violence and alcoholism.

The views on the Irish never had any basis in science. European populations tend to have the same tolerance for alcohol. Interestingly enough, some non-European populations have a lower tolerance for alcohol. This is because they do not produce an enzyme called Alcohol dehydrogenase which breaks down alcohol. This is unfortunately a very big problem among Native Americans. 

&gt; the best societies in the world include Vietnam and Cambodia, amirite?

These countries have fairly high IQs – but low economic output caused by its economic system.

&gt; negro-run South Africa? Except no, that's totally wrong

Have you ever been to South Africa? About 10% of South Africa is European white. Another 10% is of mixed race. White South Africans are responsible for all the wealth creation in that country and the highest income inequality exists between black and white people. 

Most Africans that are rich are beneficiaries of government jobs for black people or government policies that force businesses to hire black people. 

The average IQ in that country is 72 (which are fairly descriptive of the state of affairs). The black president of the country has grade 3. If anything, your example is reinforcing my argument.

&gt; It is easy for people living in gated, upper-class, well-educated white African communities to be extremely racist against the surrounding black people

That is unfortunately not my situation. I routinely live in what can only be described as slums (in majority black areas, usually cheap rental flats).

With 75 percent of fuel consumption relating directly to vehicle weight, potential weight reductions that result in improved price-performance ratio stimulate usage of lightweight materials.

&gt; A survey of the European auto industry emphasizes the success of lightweight plastics in vehicle weight reduction. Compared to traditional materials, plastic bumpers, engine covers, and fuel tanks are 10.4 kg, 4.2 kg, and 5 kg lighter, respectively. Lighter vehicles facilitate easier braking, reduced collision impact, and superior driving experience.

Iraqi oil producers will sell oil to whoever they can.  Yes, the US does import Iraqi oil, but it is currently seventh down on our list of suppliers, behind the US, Canada, Mexico, Saudi, Venezuela and Nigeria.  If we were really desperate for a strategic advantage in the race for oil, we would be pushing alternative energy (which we are), drilling in ANWAR and drilling off the coasts.

&gt;But certainly for the leaders at the time (Bush &amp; Co.) it was a strategic decision to exploit the 9-11 attacks as justification to launch a war...

OK, a strategic decision it was.  I suppose the 9/11 attacks were also used as justification.

&gt;...that ultimately favors over its major competitors China, Russia, and to some extent even the EU.

But I don't even understand what you are saying here.  Look, I get that you want to make it about oil, but it's not.  Strategic decision to make America safer or stronger, sure.  The amount of money saved, if any, by importing from Iraq pales in comparison to the costs of the conflict itself.  We consume more oil moving men and equipment to and in Middle East than we import from Iraq itself.

&gt;It's not about pure territory either. It's not even about winning. That's what people, and you among them don't understand. That the US doesn't send a million troops over there to win is no indication of a lack of understanding of military strategy, but proof that the US doesn't want to win but to stay, where its boot at apply pressure on its competitors over the coming decades.

The US, as a democracy, cannot sustain an indefinite war.  It's that simple.

Think along the lines of Germany, Britain or Japan.  Perhaps that is beneficial for the US in some way, but it's hardly so much better than having bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, etc.

The US invasion of Iraq was meant to serve US interests.  So what?  Everything we do is meant to serve US interests; everything France does is meant to serve French interests.

One of the key points was that Iceland guaranteed deposits in Icelandic branches of the failing banks while not extending that guarantee to deposits in foreign branches... The UK argues this is discrimination based on nationality which is not allowed under the EEA treaties (Iceland is in the EEA and as a result must implement most EU law.)

Ultimately it is a problem for Iceland that they will not get any foreign loans if the dispute is not resolved... some do not object so much to the concept of repayment but rather the interest rate being charged (basically Iceland is repaying British and Dutch savers with loans from the governments of Britain and the Netherlands, at a rate of 5.5%.)

Many of the British and Dutch depositors are individuals with small amounts of savings, but there was also considerable amounts in savings from local councils in both countries. Arguably these bodies should not expect the same level of protection as an individual saver but the British and Dutch governments are pressing the point on full reimbursement.

I'm talking about it being pervasive - you are *always* in one state or the other. I'm lucky - my depressive swings are generally only a day or so. But they happen fast and deep - I had one last night. I was reading through some quotes online. One just struck a chord and I was bawling my eyes out. I'm talking tears streaming down my face, chest-heaving crying. It lasted for about an hour. 

Other times I'll just get into a black mood for a day or so. My family's learned to just leave me alone. Now if something triggers it, I can be an emotional wreck for a week. 

The manic part is so much harder to describe. I don't mean the occasional ""I'll build a ship in a bottle"" impulse purchase. I mean sitting here, thinking ""I'd like to build a bookcase"" - so I stop what I'm doing, surf the web for ""best power tools to start with"", go to Amazon.com and buy them, find a workbench, buy *that*, figure out where to get lumber...

When all the stuff comes in, it'll sit in the garage in boxes, possibly forever. Because I've decided to figure out embroidery...

That's worst case. Personally, I have those urges, but I have learned to recognize them and short-circuit them. I have learned over the years to contemplate *finishing* tasks, and not taking something on if I can't see it through. Or back yard needs terracing. This is something I am completely capable of doing, and it would probably be good for me - getting outside, hard labor, etc. It also involves moving several metric tons of soil. I haven't started it because I'm deathly afraid of having to finish it. 

The whims aren't all about monumental tasks, either. There's ""Hey, let's go to europe this weekend"" or ""want to drive halfway across the country tomorrow?"" It's also about impulse purchases, and lack of discipline. 

In someone who's badly bipolar, this all adds together to make what is to outward appearances a train wreck of a person. The behaviors are manageable, both with medication, counseling, and cognitive behavior therapy. But it takes time and experimentation with what works best; and since many bipolar folks don't get diagnosed until their 20's or later, it also means unlearning very bad habits.

- Processors will have have MANY more than 64-cores (a Radeon 5870 already has 1600 cores!) and those processors will do different tasks. There will be ~ 8 or 16 cores like we know it, and then at least 8192 very simple parallel cores (like in GPUs) for massive floating point operation power.

- Europe will be caught in an identity crisis, but economically, it will be the most stable region in the world

- Europe and the US will get somewhat closer to one another diplomatically, while China will cause various minor diplomatic confrontations, leading to various sanctions against China which in turn force China to fall more in line with what Europe and the US want.

Right, and my point is that things have changed since we all lived in small, isolated and demographically homogeneous tribes.

&gt;Things that worked, and worked better than current choices

(in a very different world)

&gt;should be considered as alternatives to the problems that speculative and untested approaches create.

Every promising idea should be considered.  Whether or not they'll work in 2010, with a population approaching seven billion, is an idea both speculative and untested.

As I stated, I typically agree with Birch's views.  The problem is that they don't have much traction in the general population-- they're far too intellectual for one-- and violently shifting demographic numbers seem to indicate that they'll have less and less chance of gaining traction in the years to come.  Ten years from now we're going to be living in a very different world indeed.

I'd very much like to see policies like Birch's implemented in places like Northern Europe, where they might very well work.  Here in the United States I just don't see them as realistic either from the perspective of gaining the necessary traction or in implementation-- you'd encounter armed resistance that would make Afghanistan look like a walk in the park.

,,t5_2qzb6,"&gt;How do you become a fraud prevention agent? What qualifications are required?

You start out as customer support agent (i.e. customer report fraud to you). I did some statistics in college, never graduated though. You need to build your career, it doesn't happen overtime. You need experience more than any education, a good common sense and a perfect understand of the credit system

&gt;Are Visa and MC trying to revamp the credit card or how we use the credit card to make it safer?

Yes, they are - pins and chip credit cards are pretty common in Europe, but Americans don't like them. I personally don't like them neither but that's only me. I don't think they are safer. Anyone can very well steal a credit card and launder the money online. Then again, physical stores are NOT responsible for fraud (if some conditions are met), online stores are. 

&gt;What's the future of credit cards now that the internet is heavily involved?

Cash will never totally disappear. Credit will live long, perhaps forever. The recent crisis failed to have any impact on the credit card companies, except for a few stupid legislations. Credit will grow and continue, taking more and more place

&gt;What are the most common credit card frauds?

Unauthrozied use - forgery, most of it. 

&gt;How many times can I justifiably chargeback before there are negative consequences for me

**Each chargeback you do affects your credit rating** Keep this in mind. It IS on your credit file, even if you are 100% right. Whether you can remove it is another story (usually yes). There is no set number of chargeback; the way it works is that if there is any pattern in your chargebacks (and a pattern can be anything), you're finished. For each chargeback, you can get a lower card, or a lower limit. 

&gt;How many chargebacks before there are negative consequences for a merchant?

Online - we want a target rate of 1%. 1% is pretty common. There is a lot of fraud online. For smaller shops it can be higher. Chargebacks, fraud, happens.

&gt;What are some common unintuitive insights you can tell about common credit card use?

The one that shocks me the most? People who bitch about 20% interest rate. **A credit card is not a loan** You want a loan, go to the bank and take a personal loan. **A credit card is NOT a loan** We lend you the money, that's true, but the interest rate is so insanely high you should never, ever not pay in full each month. Seriously. Even at 10% - a very competitive credit card which will have TONS of drawbacks - it's still higher than a loan you can get at a bank.

I personally understand 20% interest rate and see nothing wrong with it (bye bye comment karma :( ). Honestly, it's a numbers. If you miss a payment, the chance that you repay your full debt is lowered by 25%. That's how it works. People either repay each month, or don't repay at all.

* Jews have a **non-assimilationist religion**. From imperial pagans under the roman empire, to european christians, to arab and central asian muslims, jews have appeared as a threat to religious norms. In societies in which state and religion are intertwined (the norm throughout human history) jews have also been seen as a threat to the sovereign. 



* Wherever they have gone, Jews (like gypsies, or eastern-orthodox christians) have formed close-knit communities of outsiders. Historically the jews have also tended to be literate (not surprising given the centrality of text and interpretation since the diaspora). These two factors combined with local restrictions on their ability to become craftsmen or landowners formed the perfect storm spurring jews throughout the world to become involved in **commerce, trade and banking**. Though they tended to be poor until recent centuries, they also became relatively powerful and influential in the societies they occupied, while remaining mysterious and seemingly untrustworthy.  During famines, recessions and other bad periods, they have thus been a natural scapegoat.




* **Socialism/marxism/national socialism**. Many of the 20th century authoritarian ideologies promoted the the direct manufacture of goods as the sole morally legitimate form of societal contribution. To the communists, jews were beorgeois leeches sucking the blood of the international workers. Hitler came back from the horrors of WW1, and was enraged at the relatively prosperous position of merchants during the bleakness of the weimar era.

Because this has been an industry meme for a bit, I don't want to discount it, but at the same time I have my doubts.

Really, I recently watched an old interview with Isaac Asimov where he made the point that when he has been wrong with predictions of future technology, it has normally been because he was too conservative in his outlook.   For example, he put man on the Moon in an early story of his in the 1970's.    He cited a work by Edger Allan Poe that predicted that in a thousand years people would be crossing from North America to Europe in fast balloons.

The point Asimov was making was that we don't see the big changes normally.  Poe had balloons in his day, so he figured the future was better balloons.  Airplanes or Rockets didn't figure into his thinking.  

I think we are going to see many of our predictions look very conservative for the same reason...  We don't see a coming fundamental technology or scientific shift.  So, we just predict better, faster, smaller and more powerful processors, RAM, Hard drives, etc.

We can discuss the follies of long-term American foreign policy and the various short-comings of those in power over the last 100 years, and I suspect you'd be surprised to find that I am very much not an American apologist. But we digress.

9/11 may have been a false flag operation. I don't accept this notion fully, nor do I completely discount it. So everything which follows is based on an uncertain assumption that those events were, indeed, of independent foreign genesis.

If the official story is true, then the reality is that the attack was planned and orchestrated from within Afghanistan. This by no means indicts the entire country. But once this reality was identified, and extradition was requested and denied, then the government became complicit, which made the attacks implicitly sanctioned. This being the case, a foreign government openly defended the liberty of those who were responsible for acts of a militarily aggressive nature. There is not much left to discuss in such a circumstance.

America has a long history of comprimising ideals in matters of foreign policy. I don't dispute this. We are a bloated beast on its way out of dominance, and I am well aware of the likely future for us. But let's be serious for a moment about the nations of the middle east in question.

Afghanistan was a repressive, violent, largely bronze-age country when this millenium broke, and very little has changed. They backed their guy after 9/11, we briefly kicked some ass, and the end result is that they will continue to be a third world country of repressive religious zealots who enslave their own women and grow the world's heroin supply. Period. Even our closest allies there whom we empowered are clearly cultural enemies of ours on paper. It's a waste of time. But that doesn't mean we lacked justification for attacking. You detonate major explosives in a major matropolitan area, it's reasonable to expect those people to come back with a bone to pick. (Yes, I realize that this same logic qualifies 9/11 from a given perspective.)

Now that we've identified some of America's many faults and detriments, let's look at the other side of the coin. Western Europe has a stable politcal environment and universal medicine becasue they don't need to piss their money away on military spending. Same for Japan and the Pacific rim. We Americans pay for damned near all of the world's military spending, which in many ways is heinous. But the rest of the world is pretty sure that we're fair-minded or there'd be a lot more countries arming up to defend themselves from us. We are far from perfect, granted. But before you get on a tear about us being war-mongers, think about what a real warmonger would be doing with our abilities. My government is corrupt and I question a lot of what it does, but it is always constrained by a populace which strives for restraint and fair play (even if many of my countrymen are borderline retarded). 

At the end of the day, we fight because we are in power and powerful countries have to face all comers. When people get indignant about the way power is used, it is usually because they've never borne the burden of wielding it. Reality is dirty, violent, and ugly at times.

,,t5_2qh1s,"&gt;If your point were true, that farming is primary and all wealth derives from farming, then what reason would anyone have for not farming?

Wealth does not simply derive from farming per se, but rather increased societal wealth derives from the ""leverage"" that high/increased productivity on the farms provide.

The fewer farmers needed to feed the population, the more people can be dedicated to other tasks (including those which improve farming further). A society that chooses to ""invest"" some of it's additional wealth appropriately into *improving* the productivity of its farmers, reaps a further *continual* benefits later on.

Thus a society where a single farmer can grow enough foodstuffs to not only provide for himself, his farm hands and his family, but which can also provide enough food for say an additional 100 people, can then allocate a number of them to: digging coal or ore, drilling for oil, refining and manufacturing steel, engineering and manufacturing farm implements to improve productivity even more, etc. In a few years it can increase the population so that 200, 500, and then thousands can be fed by the same single farmer. Those thousands can then produce the additional ""luxuries"" and ""entertainments"" that would otherwise be either too expensive, or not even possible.

Best illustration is between Europe and the US during the 19th century -- Europe's farming increased it's productivity in relatively minor *evolutionary* ways; but the US mechanized it in *revolutionary* ways, feeding and supporting not only the countless millions of direct immigrants, but their manifold descendants, as well as exporting substantial amounts.

&gt;By what metric? US production for corn and soybeans have steadily increased (PDF) for the past fifty years.

Yes, production has increased and even more remarkably so if you look not just at the yield per acre but *the yield per hour of work* (and thus this is the ultimate source of our increasing wealth).

By ""diminishing returns"" I mean that the proportion/rate of yield increase has been slowing. Each new innovation gains us *relatively* less than prior innovations. This is to be expected in mature systems, at some point you reach a virtual ""optimum"" and further innovations are often necessary just to maintain that optimum -- and once that ""optimum"" is reached they are just as likely to decrease output as they are to increase it.

Additionally, at such high rates of yield, sustainability issues come into play (deep aquifers begin drying up, topsoil becomes significantly eroded, more and more fertilizers are required, etc).",1426173715,t1_c0i5osh,c0i5osh,0,t3_al0xg,False,Economics,LWRellim,False,0,1262561796,,1,0,True,t1_c0i5m9e,1,

1. What I'm asserting here is that throughout America there are different dialects and accents.  There are NYC accents, Boston, southern, western, mid-western, etc, etc. What else do you need me to cite?

2. Read this article here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_dialect Pay close attention to ""Up until the earlier twentieth century, many Eastern European Jewish and Italian immigrants, as well as some later immigrants, arrived and further affected the region's speech. Sociolinguistic research, which is ongoing, suggests some differentiation between these last groups' speech may exist. For example, William Labov found differences in the rate and degree of the tensing and raising of (oh) and (aeh) of Italian American versus Jewish American New Yorkers. Jewish Americans were more likely than other groups to use the closest variants of (oh) and Italian Americans were more likely than other groups to use the closest variants of (aeh)."" These different ethnic groups had different pronunciations and controlled different neighborhoods.  So back in the day you could easily tell what part of Manhattan or NYC they were from by their accent. 

3. There's no specific text I'm pulling from here, but basically any text that deals with mobile society, globalization, mass media and their affect on culture will cover this.  Just as written text codified language, the recorded media started to 'codify' parts of speech linguistics etc. Here's an article that covers the basics

Every other religion was ruthlessly wiped out.  There were also a lot of religions in the colonized world.  Some remain.  Most that remain are limping along, but a whole lot are gone.

There were a lot of religions in the Middle East when Islam began to spread.  Judaism survived and a whole lot didn't.

For a religion that didn't itself spread the way Christianity and Islam spread over their territories, Judaism did the best.

In other words, Christians were less anti-Semitic than they were bigoted against every other religion except their own.  Muslims were less anti-Semitic than they were against every religion except their own and maybe Christianity.

So you can really ask why are Islam and Christianity so philo-Judaic.  The answer is that Judaism is seen as a parent religion to theirs, they claim to be perfecting Judaism - but they don't that relationship with any of the pagan religions that came in their path.

Then we can ask why are these philo-Judaic religions harsher on Judaism than they are on their own religions.  I guess some kind of tribal bigotry that has been real common historically? I'm not sure.

,,t5_2qh1i,"Do all of this up until the last step. Then, I'd open up a set of 10 or so high quality recording studios. Use one for myself, and the rest for new talent that I find online, on the street (Homeless Mustard anyone?), or at local clubs (The Beatles were discovered that way). With the inevitable profits from their albums being dropped, I take my cut and open up a film studio. I find some of the best directors around that aren't too big yet. I have them do film with equally talented, but relatively unknown actors. This keeps budgets relatively low. This becomes a self-sustaining investment.

Using the profits from these investments, I'd fund my friend's [website](http://www.ottabid.com) which needs an infusion of capital to break through. I'd then fund several of my startup ideas. Seeing as at least one of them will be profitable, that'll be good.

Then, I'll buy a couple houses near some colleges. I'll rent out the complexes to students, at low rates. Just enough to pay the mortgages, utilities, other necessities, and just enough to store in case of an accident. And of course a tiny profit per house for me.

Then, I'll start a non-profit foundation. I suppose we would invest in think-tanks and education. Every child and adult should have access to enough information to sustain an education. I would distribute high-quality computers to libraries around the country and the world (Having worked at a library for several years, and currently working at one, we need new computers. We're in a wealthy neighborhood, and we're on crappy machines from 1998.). I would make sure that we invested in clean energy companies, and would purchase wind-turbines, concentrated solar plants, and thorium reactors. We would also expose more and more children to the arts, from music, to writing, to film.

Then, I'd buy myself a nice place in the Upper West Side apartment complex. I'd also get a place in LA. Maybe an apartment in London also. The, I'd get at least two cars for each house, possibly three or four. I'm thinking a fair mix of European super cars (Aston Martins, Ferraris, Porsches) and good old American muscle cars. I'd open up a shop in LA to work on cars, my personal passion.

Next, I'd preserve history. I'd purchase a P-51D Mustang, a P-38, a P-40, a B-25, and a M3 Stuart. I'd get multiple antique cars as well.

I'd go on to buy a bunch of the more frivolous stuff I've alway wanted. Thompson sub-machine gun, 1949 Harley Davidson, get tattooed, my ear pierced, a Jet Ski, a couple props from favorite films, and enough equipment to start fabricating my own prop replicas.

Finally, with the remaining money, I'd settle debts that belong to close family and *very* close friends. There are a couple friends that have, in essence, saved my life. So, I'd give them a very handsome payout. I owe it to them. There's one or two teachers who really inspired me that deserve more money than the pitiful amount or government allocates to some of the most important people in our lives.

Bear in mind, all of this was done after putting a couple million (maybe $25 million) into a well diversified portfolio, consisting of bonds, CDs, real estate, stocks, and mutual funds. This step is essential. I inserted here at the end, simply because doing this first is imperative, and a given, so I don't want to sound too repetitive in reference to all of the other posters. This decision of course differs from the course others my age would take. Being idiot teenagers, they'd probably blow it all on hookers, drugs, booze, and cars.

But sometimes the speed of change increases big time on the international stage.    For example, the Warsaw Pact dissolving in 1989 and later the USSR breaking up in 1991.  

I just am envisioning the reverse effect occurring.  And the creation of a larger super-EU/NATO taking place.

Thing is, I've a degree in anthropology and like most anthropologists think that race is a social/cultural construct. An old textbook: ""The Mismeasure of Man"" was a pretty important part of my training, and it made some pretty convincing arguments about how the race of the test giver can affect the results, and the the interpretation of the results, particularly when the testing relates to race. I'm automatically suspicious of any race related tests that don't compensate for interviewer bias on the part of the interviewer and the test subjects.

Here is what is bothering me. One of the examples the text book used was a so-called IQ test given to little kids. They were told to point at the ""pretty girl"". The two pictures were line drawings with no skin tone, but one had  ""European"" characteristics and the other had more ""African"" ones. Black kids who pointed at the picture that looked like mommy (which was most of them) failed that question, and got lower IQ scores. This was in the 60's, I believe.

Now we are looking at a very similar test, but with apparently different results, and I'm looking for reasons why. One of the differences, in addition to the fact that it's more modern times, could be the race of the interviewer.

With the much higher prevalence of blacks in the media, I would have thought the result would have been different, and I was looking for reasons why. Hence the hypothesis.

Kadaicha (James Bogle, 1987). PC: David Hannay Productions. 

Teenagers in a newish housing estate dream of an Aboriginal witch doctor who gives them an engraved stone. They wake to find the stone to be real; shortly afterwards, each recipient is killed by savage fauna. The stones are 'kadaicha' or curse stones and the protagonists soon discover that the street in which they live was built, unethically and secretively, on the site of a native burial ground. For this, the neighbourhood teenagers are being cursed to death. It's Nightmare on Elm Street meets Poltergeist, but really just a teen slasher movie. Competently filmed, with patchy acting and poor SFX, especially in the climax, where good effects were desperately needed. 


The Dreaming (Mario Andreacchio, 1988). PC: Genesis Films. 

A good 'haunting' film in which an anthropologist (Arthur Dignam) unearths an ancient Aboriginal burial site, thus awakening a curse involving slaughtered natives and murderous European whalers. The anthropologist's daughter (Penny Cook) gets caught up in the midst of all sorts of supernatural goings-on. There are many effective moments in the film. One of my favourites occurs when the daughter (who is a doctor) is examining a set of x-rays, specifically one of a battered Aboriginal woman's skull, and suddenly the image on the x-ray film moves, the jaw opening and screaming. The doctor turns around to see the woman herself screaming.

,,t5_2qh1s,"A couple of things based on my background in Engineering yet having an MBA as well:

1. Accounting (on which Finance is generally based) was invented and well developed during the middle ages in Europe. It and its structure pre-date the math and conceptual models that are the basis for algebra, calculus and most high level math used by science and engineering.  For this reason they simply ""smell different"" in some very fundamental ways.

2. Accounting is generally retrospective (documenting the past as it already occurred) while finance is extrapolating past performance and future wished into the future.  As with all extrapolations and predictions, there are a lot of assumptions made and some may or may not be justified and some may or may not be provable.  

3. Most accounting and finance involves a lot of what technical fields call ""underspecified systems of equations"".  Sometimes insanely underspecified.  If you have a background in engineering design, this feature isn't so shocking or unfamiliar or scary.  If you are a techie outside of design, it will usually seem dangerous.  More certainty isn't possible however.

4. You simply have to learn (even if by rote) the structure of financial statements to really grok much of anything in finance. Understanding how per forma planning is done is also pretty essential.  They make sense once you understand accounts aren't variables like in algebra but have some similarity to non-functional programming variables over time.  Income, cashflow and balance sheet each characterize a different aspect of the whole.

5. Finance (and accounting in general) is heavily biased by tax law factors so what are ""good ratios"" usually is influenced by tax law benefits and penalties in ways that don't necessary make long-term corporate fitness sense. This is the distortion created by government intervention (via tax law)

6. Much of the standard ratios used in ratio analysis have to be understood within the context of tax law and of the specific type of company considered - not all ""good"" ratio values are actually good for any arbitrary types of companies.  Most ""typical"" values are only reasonable for Fortune 500 sized companies and only for status quo economic situations and operations. E.g. smaller companies, niche companies and high tech companies have radically different cost structures that necessarily alter the standard ratios - often making them look ""bad"" but in reality they are simply indicating a different functional type of company or operational business model.

7. A key feature of US tax law is that corporate income tax is defined radically differently from individual income tax.  This itself creates many bizarro biases in accounting and finance.

8. You can't use ratios to determine everything (or even most things) about a company's health. They are only indicators of situations but not proofs.  There are also ratios that are useful but not generally calculatable from standard US public financial statements.  Most of what you need to know to ""know"" a company's potential future performance is not actual in most publicly published document or if it is must be ""extracted"" uniquely and individually.  This is what most ""market research"" services are actually providing - the extra stuff.  Even that isn't going to give you 100% certainty - maybe 70% instead of 40% certainty.

9. What's listed in public financial statement is very much what people (FASB/SEC/etc.) thought was *minimally* useful/essential 10+ years ago.  Also it's only US public companies that have so much publicly published details - public companies in most of the rest of the world have only a tiny trickle (e.g. sometimes an income statement may have only 7-9 lines of detail total).  Further, US private companies do not publish financial statements at all - they are not required to and it's seldom a good idea anyway.

I would generally say that ""as practices by most people in the field"" finance is usually BS.  ""As practiced by the best"" or ""in theory"" not so much.  Best here is highly subjective.",1426174146,t1_c0i6kxv,c0i6kxv,0,t3_al693,False,Economics,mantra,False,0,1262596051,,6,0,True,t3_al693,6,

,,t5_2qh1i,"Another Saskatoon redditor here.

From the time I've spent in other mid-west cities here, I'd have to say that Saskatoon is probably the best thing between B.C. and Ontario. Although things get really boring really fast as soon as you get outside of the city. You'll need to visit Alberta/B.C. to see some really amazing landscapes. Saskatchewan does have it's own allure though. I really enjoy driving past abandoned farm buildings leaning at impossible angles from the strong prairie wind we get here. I've heard that there are some really incredible things to see in northern saskatchewan, but I have yet to make it up there. :(

Going along with what Capbrune said, I find it really hard to be a social person in Saskatchewan. It could all be my imagination working against me, but I've always found social groups to be very elitist and exclusive around here. In general I feel like I would need to put a great deal of effort towards fitting in around here. I grew up in Regina so I never really noticed anything unusual here. In Early 2008 I went to New Zealand for a year on a work/holiday visa, and got to spend some time in Vancouver as well as Europe. For the most part I found that it was significantly easier to get to know people in all of these other places.

City planning is interesting. When I moved here I was hoping that I wouldn't need to buy a car for transportation. Turns out that depending on where you live in this city, you're basically screwed unless you've got your own car.

Having been born and raised here, I think I'm still fairly happy to say I'm from Saskatchewan. But I also can't wait to leave this place and never come back for more than a week or two at a time. Applying to universities across the country right now, so if all goes well I'll only be living here another 8 months or so.

Heh, hopefully the people from the Saskatoon sub-reddit wont hate me for saying this If I had to give planning advice to somebody who was going to travel across Canada, I would tell them to start in Vancouver, check out B.C. and the rockies. Go east as far as Banff and Jasper national parks in Alberta. Banff is an overrated tourist trap. In Jasper I found scenery more beautiful than anything I'd ever seen before.

I'm Australian, but haven't lived there in over 20 years.  I do often visit my home town (Perth), however, and enjoy being a tourist in Australia now, since home is where my family (wife and son) are, and my family is Austrian.

One of the reasons I left Australia for good, and didn't really look back in terms of wishing to live there again, is the fact that Australian culture is so very, very closed-minded about many things.  One of those things: the way the Internet is treated.  As a pioneer during the 80's and 90's in the realm of Internet Services (started a few big ISP's in California) I always felt that the draconian control exerted over the Australian Internet scene was a huge detriment for Australian society, and I decided *not* to participate in it as a result, moving instead to California and later, Europe.

One of my fondest memories from the last time I visited Australia as a tourist was driving on a freeway and noticing, for a very brief second, two kids carting a laptop and pringle-can WLAN rig across a pedestrian walkway, pointing it in the general direction of a new housing development, and high-five'ing each other .. this was a very, very brief scene, as I drove on by, but I remember it with great mirth and joy.

Which was not much different from the reign of terror coming from just about every other empire and wannabe empire in history, the US included. If you think the Japanese were oh so bad, take a little look at what the British Empire had been doing late 19th and early 20th century.

&gt; This is completely untrue.

The only reason they were allies was because they were international outcasts and they both didn't like the Soviets. Japan was interested in oil fields and other natural resources in the far east, and Hitler only wanted Lebensraum in Eastern Europe and Russia. Half the Pacific conquests of Japan were merely in order to form a defensive line against the US. Hitler had zero interest in Western Europe as long as they left him alone in Russia.

Otherwise, though, he does seem to have good povs; putting criticism on the socialist states of this day, and taking positions even if they're not all-for socialism/communism/Marxism.

I myself have the position that these systems, too have the inherent nature of taking away freedom, and that they either have to co-exist with some capitalist system(or some other i don't know of) for the freedom of endeavor.

And greed existed in Soviet Russia too, something that isn't to be ignored. 'Cross your fingers', or 'but we're better' isn't exactly a good answer.. Fact of the matter is that capitalism has inherent mechanisms for some things and the Russians tried to do it plannedly, but it simply didn't work properly.

Capitalism and Marxism aren't entirely incompatible either, you can just choose industries to do the one way or the other way. Further, even inside a capitalist system, one can make a 'communist' - as in owned by the employees companies.

The current system does seem to have a problem with global corporations, it can be hard for individual governments to get a handle on them, and the populations of the governments that have any hope cannot see/feel the effects. The corporations can move countries. Especially for bulk goods a more planned, technocratic, open approach could lead to a more ethical and still effective result. This would also mean that these resources are more included(and more directly 'bartered with') in diplomatic talks. Mapping where resources come from and how we could alternatively distribute them is something anyone could try research. Also as an open project, seeing 'revolutionaries' as an opposite party, this is a very good idea to be more an actual alternative rather then a (relative) couch critic.

Another issue is the effect of corporations meddling with democracies and international affairs. The previous approach would also deal with some them, but i don't with that every case of this means that we should just make it a planned economy. Largely it is a result of just a bad structuring of US democracy and the culture of the voters though. (Similarly Europe(countries) simply takes weak positions on issues like Israel and such.)

,,t5_2qh13,"&gt; Cool. Moral relativism. So, because the British did some unrelated stuff earlier, the US was supposed to just let Japan fuel its war against the Eastern hemisphere in direct support of Hitler's gains against the Allies.

I'm simply saying the pot should not call the kettle black. This was standard colonial behaviour for 500 years, so why anyone would imagine Japan would act differently seems rather strange to me. Therefore, such brutalities were not the reason for the embargo, merely the propaganda added to it later on in order to differentiate the ""good guys"" from the ""bad guys"".

&gt; No, invasion plans for the US clearly did exist before Pearl Harbor. Note, I said plans. The US also had plans for an invasion of Canada.

So you link to an badly-written, unsourced article filled with unrealistic conjecture on an unknown, probably unmoderated wikipedia-wannabe as proof of this? Come back with at least one historical scholar of some renown who makes such a claim if you don't want people to ridicule you when you make such statements.

&gt; Perhaps that was a bad reason to cite for the embargo, though. A simpler reason could be that Japan was simply supporting the enemy of the US' enemy by participating in a pincer attack in the Eastern Front.

A Japanese pincer attack on the Eastern Front? You mean that Japanese garrison in Manchuria that didn't move for the entire war and was easily annihilated by Soviet forces in 1945? Or those couple of British ships sunk by the IJN, which wouldn't have contributed to the war in Europe either way? Note both these things happened after the embargo, so couldn't have caused it. Pre-embargo, Japan was only actively at war with China, which could not possibly be of any use to Germany. Don't mess up cause and effect.

Yes, they do exactly that, and as far as I know, it's not even entirely clear why they do. 

&gt; or does using them so frequently allow the system to grow animals that are unnaturally large, thereby increasing the production?

Not really, that's what hormones would do. And people are scared of hormones, so they are not very popular, and for instance have been verbotten in Europe IIRC. It's possible though that hormones do not present a direct risk for humans; however I wouldn't bet on it myself.

For example something like this:

Each of the 14 blades, loaded with 8GB memory and a total of 16TB of storage, this would cost around 4500$. 
It would support about 450 VPSes with the following specs (without overselling hardware too much - the main problem is memory, but with overselling network capacity, it really costs a lot) 

* 256MB memory (768MB Burstable) 
* 20GB storage
* 300GB transfer per month
* 100MB link
* 1 IP

The best collocation costs that I could find in the Netherlands for this box are around 2000 Euro per month, including unmetered 1GB connection, power, 1024 IPs. 

http://www.swiftway.co.uk/?module=sklep_colocation&amp;krok=wybor&amp;id=4

Let's say you can sell all the VPSs for 10euros per month, this is a pretty low price but some are still selling cheaper, for example  (I think they are overselling, but you can't know for sure)

http://www.yourwebhoster.eu/cart.php?gid=16

Thats just 5400 euro per month income, 3400 euro per month profit, sounds about right?

The problem is that you will also have to handle a lot of support requests, re-installs, reverse DNS updates, abuse calls, etc. It's a lot of work, I might have considered doing it if I was unemployed but it really looks like a lot of work and not really profitable. Also, you end up with 450 VPSs on 1 poor Gbps connections, higher speed costs significantly more than 2000 euros per month.

In either case we're talking about counties that have, as part of a process of post-war rebuilding, diverted money away from military self-sufficiency and towards social programs.  In most cases, these are countries that are largely incapable of engaging in foreign conflicts on their own, so unless they've been subjected to civil wars or invasion in the last 60 years, we should expect them to appear near the top of the list.

,,t5_2qh1s,"&gt;they restrict private capital flows

I've heard this phrase a lot with respect to China, but I don't know what it means or what it has to do with the money supply or its value.  I see capital flowing quite freely directly from the printing press of the Bank of China to foreign investors demanding the yuan.  China is expanding its currency exactly as fast as demand for it is increasing--more or less the same mechanism employed by the U.S. Treasury before 1971 (spot price of gold falls =&gt; print more money and exchange for gold).  Corporations might use the same mechanism to keep their stock price flat against a rising trend by issuing stock ratably.  Again, because of purchasing power parity with respect to international commodity trade, this should equalize raw materials cost in China as well as abroad.

Of course, this doesn't take into account any subsidies or government-distributed resources, *but this is a completely different policy question* far and away outside the currency debate.  It is my contention that no country could ever keep its currency ""artificially low""--economic forces are too strong to allow such meddling to produce a valuable effect or advantage.  Either manufacturing interests would be forced to sell at a loss or raise prices due to higher commodities costs.  The same goes for labor.  The dollar, whatever purchasing power it may have abroad, is being exchanged for goods of real value, and the Chinese enterprises, laborers and raw materials sellers are all earning substantial profits from same.  I fail to see how foreigners are underpaying Chinese interests for goods.

I provided the wiki link just to illustrate China's trade balance, since I really couldn't find any other link.  But I went back and read the links you provided, and came up with this primary indicator:

&gt;By February 2008, concerns were being raised that rising wages and inflation in China were beginning to create inflationary pressure in the United States and Europe

Real wages are rising and will continue to rise as long as capital is flowing into China.  Here, the inflation we see is not due to the Bank of China's policy but because of a rise in real wages, for which the peg cannot adjust.  The BoC's practice of printing money to stabilize prices only appropriates value from savers (a sort of inflation tax) but benefits asset holders and the government.  Real estate and other assets have a real yuan/dollar value, and if underpriced, the market will bid them up to appropriate international levels.  This could be affected if there were more severe restrictions on foreign ownership of property, which was more or less the case before 1990, and what we are arguing over might even be the after-effects of the policy.  Even with these rules in place, however, foreign capital will find its way into the hands of those who are qualified to own property and will inflate the price.  

As for a real estate bubble, this is no more the fault of Chinese currency manipulation as was the U.S. housing bubble the fault of Federal Reserve policies.  I happen to think that the latter is true, but even if you don't, it's not hard to connect the overextension of bank credit in the U.S. to the inflation of the yuan.  China is just yet to experience the shockwaves from overseas.

Lastly, I meant to assert that the yuan/dollar peg is meant to promote price stability with respect to the business climate between the U.S. and China, not that it would prevent *any* price inflation (that's not the purpose of the peg).  This is meant to eliminate wild swings in prices caused by rapid changes in the value of money,  but it does not prevent prices from rising due to accumulation of real wealth or a rise in real wages, both of which are very much occurring in China now.  Chinese prices are not low because of its currency policy, but because of substantially advantageous (read: low) labor wages and a heavy oversupply of labor.  This advantage is evaporating as demand for Chinese products increases.

I don't disagree with you that the policy is predatory, but it has nothing to do with the U.S.: it is only unfair to responsible Chinese citizens.  Those who save are robbed of enjoying the fruits of their wealth; instead, the benefits of deflation go directly into government coffers.  The Chinese citizen is prevented from accumulating wealth as rapidly as under a floating currency.  Certainly one could construct an argument that citizens accumulating wealth might demand higher wages more quickly, but as long as most of China's population is engaged in subsistence farming and living without electricity, this cannot be the case.  China's real wages are lower than the U.S.'s, and as long as this remains the case, unskilled and semi-skilled manufacturing tasks will continue to shift to China, regardless of whether the yuan is dollar-pegged, gold-pegged, pebble-pegged or floating.",1426174363,t1_c0i71qx,c0i71qx,0,t3_akfui,False,Economics,carcinogen,True,0,1262625952,,1,0,True,t1_c0i3cgv,1,

It doesn’t have open minds… I am really amazed that the Nobel Peace Prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists.” - Indian geologist Dr. Arun D. Ahluwalia at Punjab University and a board member of the UN-supported International Year of the Planet. 

“So far, real measurements give no ground for concern about a catastrophic future warming.” - Scientist Dr. Jarl R. Ahlbeck, a chemical engineer at Abo Akademi University in Finland, author of 200 scientific publications and former Greenpeace member.

“Anyone who claims that the debate is over and the conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time.” - Solar physicist Dr. Pal Brekke, senior advisor to the Norwegian Space Centre in Oslo. Brekke has published more than 40 peer-reviewed scientific articles on the sun and solar interaction with the Earth.

“The models and forecasts of the UN IPCC ""are incorrect because they only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include, for example, solar activity.” - Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics of the National Autonomous University of Mexico 
“It is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who don’t buy into anthropogenic global warming.” - U.S Government Atmospheric Scientist Stanley B. Goldenberg of the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA.

It is global warming that triggers higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not the other way round…A large number of critical documents submitted at the 1995 U.N. conference in Madrid vanished without a trace. As a result, the discussion was one-sided and heavily biased, and the U.N. declared global warming to be a scientific fact,” Andrei Kapitsa, a Russian geographer and Antarctic ice core researcher.

“I am convinced that the current alarm over carbon dioxide is mistaken...Fears about man-made global warming are unwarranted and are not based on good science.” - Award Winning Physicist Dr. Will Happer, Professor at the Department of Physics at Princeton University and Former Director of Energy Research at the Department of Energy, who has published over 200 scientific papers, and is a fellow of the American Physical Society, The American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the National Academy of Sciences.

“Nature's regulatory instrument is water vapor: more carbon dioxide leads to less moisture in the air, keeping the overall GHG content in accord with the necessary balance conditions.” – Prominent Hungarian Physicist and environmental researcher Dr. Miklós Zágoni reversed his view of man-made warming and is now a skeptic. Zágoni was once Hungary’s most outspoken supporter of the Kyoto Protocol.

“For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming? For how many years must cooling go on?"" - Geologist Dr. David Gee the chairman of the science committee of the 2008 International Geological Congress who has authored 130 plus peer reviewed papers, and is currently at Uppsala University in Sweden. 

“Gore prompted me to start delving into the science again and I quickly found myself solidly in the skeptic camp…Climate models can at best be useful for explaining climate changes after the fact.” - Meteorologist Hajo Smit of Holland, who reversed his belief in man-made warming to become a skeptic, is a former member of the Dutch UN IPCC committee. 

“The quantity of CO2 we produce is insignificant in terms of the natural circulation between air, water and soil... I am doing a detailed assessment of the UN IPCC reports and the Summaries for Policy Makers, identifying the way in which the Summaries have distorted the science.” - South Afican Nuclear Physicist and Chemical Engineer Dr. Philip Lloyd, a UN IPCC co-coordinating lead author who has authored over 150 refereed publications. 

“Many [scientists] are now searching for a way to back out quietly (from promoting warming fears), without having their professional careers ruined.” - Atmospheric physicist James A. Peden, formerly of the Space Research and Coordination Center in Pittsburgh. 

“All those urging action to curb global warming need to take off the blinkers and give some thought to what we should do if we are facing global cooling instead.” - Geophysicist Dr. Phil Chapman, an astronautical engineer and former NASA astronaut, served as staff physicist at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 

“Creating an ideology pegged to carbon dioxide is a dangerous nonsense…The present alarm on climate change is an instrument of social control, a pretext for major businesses and political battle. It became an ideology, which is concerning.” - Environmental Scientist Professor Delgado Domingos of Portugal, the founder of the Numerical Weather Forecast group, has more than 150 published articles. 

“CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or another….Every scientist knows this, but it doesn’t pay to say so…Global warming, as a political vehicle, keeps Europeans in the driver’s seat and developing nations walking barefoot.” - Dr. Takeda Kunihiko, vice-chancellor of the Institute of Science and Technology Research at Chubu University in Japan. 

“The [global warming] scaremongering has its justification in the fact that it is something that generates funds.” - Award-winning Paleontologist Dr. Eduardo Tonni, of the Committee for Scientific Research in Buenos Aires and head of the Paleontology Department at the University of La Plata. 

“Whatever the weather, it's not being caused by global warming. If anything, the climate may be starting into a cooling period.” Atmospheric scientist Dr. Art V. Douglas, former Chair of the Atmospheric Sciences Department at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, and is the author of numerous papers for peer-reviewed publications. 

“But there is no falsifiable scientific basis whatever to assert this warming is caused by human-produced greenhouse gasses because current physical theory is too grossly inadequate to establish any cause at all.” - Chemist Dr. Patrick Frank, who has authored more than 50 peer-reviewed articles.

Also, in regards to that European WEP cracking app: I've heard of a few versions of those (iWep comes to mind).  I thought it was only for Spain, but apparently works in other areas of Europe.

Let's suppose they finally manage to build a small number of 50's style ICBMs. They'll keep some and sell some to Iran. There's always a possibility of interdicting the ships. Still a few get through. Still a dozen or so low tech ICBMs are not that hard to shoot down with SM-3 missiles or even Patriot batteries in the likely target countries. They can't make enough of them to overwhelm the defences, plus there's deterrence.

&gt; Finally, the NK gov. has lasted 60 years, it can probably last another 60.

That's a very poor argument. The Soviet Union collapsed after 70 years as did most of Eastern Europe. The Chinese regime would have collapsed if they had not clamped down on Tiananmen so brutally. In fact in 1989 all sorts of tyrannies collapsed - Taiwan and South Africa for example. These regimes often have a limited life.

NK is a weird pseudo monarchy and such states get much weaker with time. Kim Il Sung was vicious but very effective at keeping his populous in line. He also had a military that was capable of overrunning SK and was ahead in terms of industrialization. Move on to Kim Jong Il and the whole system was a bit rockier - militarily and economically NK was slipping behind. KJI was a lot less plausible as a leader - there have been demonstrations against currency reform - before NK was a 1984 style state with no visible opposition. 

In many ways it is reminiscent of Imperial Rome - Augustus was a very effective politician/soldier who founded the system. His heirs got less and less effective because the system lacked checks and balances. Rome didn't collapse, but that's because there was no peer competitor to stress it for ages.

second, in order:

* Why would you wait for months before having sex, when it looks like most men don't think it's such a deal to share a thing as intimate as sexuality with someone? Why would that be different for women? Don't you also have a sex drive? If you say that most guys ""aren't worthy"", it's probably because you have problem attracting guys that are, and/or because those guys that are attracted to you seem to have no clue about making you feel comfortable. It looks, as you say, that it's more a problem with the *men* not being able to make you feel confident than with *you* not wanting to have sex. Which is *exactly* my point.

Maybe you're some dominant woman that love guys that listen to you and don't tell you anything, but you should realize that in most cases, this is quite the contrary.

* I'm not saying the guy should make love alone, I am simply saying that it usually is the case that the man must make the first steps toward it. Some women take the things in their hand, but usually, the guy will have to show clearly that he is confident and that he wants sex first, because women have a tendency to not show their sexual desires publicly because of some cultural reasons.

,,t5_2qh63,"I agree with exactly the failings you mention.

The constitution (like any other complicated efforts) was one of negotiation between the factions (largely Jefferson vs Hamilton). Jefferson himself, regretted that concession and in [1798 in a letter to John Taylor](http://yamaguchy.netfirms.com/7897401/jefferson/taylor.html), wrote:

     ""I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our 
      Constitution.  I would be willing to depend on that alone for the 
      reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine 
      principles of its Constitution;  I mean an additional article, taking 
      from the federal government the power of borrowing.  I now deny 
      their power of making paper money or anything else a legal 
      tender.  I know that to pay all proper expenses within the year, 
      would, in case of war, be hard on us.  But not so hard as ten wars 
      instead of one.  For wars would be reduced in that proportion.""

Which when reading over 200 years later, it is so absolutely stunning how intelligent Jefferson was and how well he understood the problem. We know of course precisely find ourselves in 10 wars instead of none. Of course, we are not taught history in school - so we must continually relearn it. 

Slavery of course was a reprehensible, and thoroughly immoral activity. There were numerous ways to end it without resorting to war - afterall the practice was ended all throughout Europe with no one firing a shot. In our case, the federal government refused to entertain any suggestion for how to end it that placed any sort of hardship on the industrial north. Hence, the south had no choice but to seceded, since the offered proposal would plunge most of the south into bankruptcy (to northern banks, of course).

At that moment, the iron fist came unmasked from the velvet glove and the true tyrannical nature of our 'forced union' came apparent. It was clear that the notion of States Rights was a farce, and only the dictatorial desires of our president-king mattered.

Of course, this second problem (of not recognizing states rights) is related directly to the issue Jefferson mentioned above. For without the power to issue debt, the federal government would by its nature be little more than an administrative body *among* the states. It would be relegated to a subordinate position and would by nature *have* to respect the rights of the states.

They start with some notes. on the subject matter, maybe a copy of the speech but speakers may change from the text and a Q&amp;A can totally change subject matter.

The problem is that word order may change significantly, remember the Germanic style of verb at the back. Simultaneous interpreters are taught a conceptual shorthand (language independent) but in the end they usually have to remember the sentence to reorder it.

Such is the concentration required, simultaneous interpreters work normally in pairs in the booth usually working for say 15 mins or so at a time.

The next complication is language chains. Not all language combinations may be available so a primary translation is made into a common language, say English or French and then a secondary interpreter takes over and translated into the target language.

,vegan,t5_2qhpm,"From the hippies in the 60s through animal rights activists in the 80s and beyond, we have been pushing vegetarianism and veganism for decades, yet the number of both are still a tiny fraction of the general population here in North America, and in Europe. What we, the veggie community, has been doing has for the most part *not been working*. Our numbers as a portion of the population are barely growing.

The ""all or nothing"" political approach places a very high hurdle in front of anyone who might otherwise be open to considering reducing their meat consumption. If the only options are to be a normal, complacent omnivore, or completely change their lifestyle and risk alienation and ridicule of their family and friends, they likely won't bother.

But a gradual shift in lifestyle, where meat becomes a side-dish, or an infrequent ""treat"" often relegated to holidays &amp; special occasions, but which doesn't require awkward discussions about diet with relatives, or difficulty in finding something to eat in a restaurant, makes eating less meat *far easier* for the typical person.

*Of course* it's better for someone to go vegan. *Of course* a vegan does far less harm to animals than a flexitarian. 

But if you get 2 people to eat half as much meat &amp; dairy, that's equivalent to making one person go vegan. And guess which is far easier, and more likely to win over the general public?

Furthermore, if you can start a trend of viewing meat as not the centerpiece of every meal, but something to be eaten in moderation and infrequently, that means demand falls, production is reduced (factory farms close down), and prices go up, further increasing the incentive to reduce meat consumption.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to encourage people to go vegetarian/vegan. But instead of attacking or vilifying people for not ""going far enough"", they should be congratulated for making the steps they have. Flexitarianism, pescetarianism, and vegetarianism are all *good things*, when the default in our society is to be an indifferent omnivore. Vegans who antagonize these people for their ""half-measures"" are doing far more harm than good, as a person might wonder why they should bother at all, if their choices to reduce their consumption of animal products simply earns them derision from both sides.

It was supposed to regulate chemicals and control the production and use of potentially toxic chemicals. Unfortunately, the act's been pretty toothless and is encumbered by high regulatory burdens and unable to act quickly. EPA administrator Lisa Jackson recently pointed out that after getting asbestos banned in the 80s, using the act, this was almost entirely overturned later. Added to this there's the problem that chemicals that were in use when the act came into place never needed even the most cursory of examination.

,,t5_2qh63,"***Functions of Government***

**Maintenance of Authority.** One of the principal functions of government is to remain in power. Governments do not relinquish their authority unless compelled to do so. Many of the actions of politicians and civil servants can be explained by the need to maintain and enhance their power.

Every government strives to increase its legitimacy in the eyes of the people. It may identify itself with ancient traditions, with hope for the future, or with fear of a common enemy. Some governments employ repression, never relaxing their vigils against real or imagined opponents. Even democracies, when threatened, are likely to engage in a search for subversives and ""enemies of the people.""

When a regime draws its main support from a privileged class or group that decreases in numbers and strength, when a government becomes ineffective in handling domestic affairs or countering external threats, or when a society's consensus on the principles and goals of government evaporates, a government tends to lose authority. The French monarchy in the 18th century and the Russian monarchy in the 20th century were based on aristocracies that had lost much of their legitimacy in the eyes of the people. Eventually these regimes were unable to enforce their laws, and revolutions swept them from power.

Governments tend, therefore, to foster widespread ideological commitment to the nation through patriotic ceremonies, propaganda, and civic education; they employ armed forces and intelligence-gathering organizations for national defense; they maintain police and prison systems to ensure domestic order; and they undertake the administration of supervisory and regulatory functions to carry out national goals by establishing various bureaucracies to handle each complex function.

**Administration.** All governments recognize the principle that the public must be protected and served. The citizen, in effect, surrenders a degree of individual sovereignty to the government in return for protection of life and property and the delivery of essential services. Governments supervise the resolution of conflicting interests, the workings of the political process, the enforcement of laws and rights, and the monitoring of national income and international trade; they regulate economic and social relationships among individuals and private organizations; and they carry out enterprises such as production of military goods, provision of postal services, and ownership of power utilities and public works. Among the most basic services provided by government are the printing and coining of money, the provision of roads, sewers, water, education, and social and welfare services.

With the growth of the welfare state, governments began to provide services such as social security and health insurance. But the scope of government regulation is now much broader. In the United States the government sets minimum wages, limits the rates charged by public utilities, buys farm commodities to keep prices up, forbids the sale of harmful foods and drugs, sets standards for gasoline consumption by automobiles, requires manufacturers to install antipollution devices, and monitors the safety of factories. Federal, state, and local governments in the United States also engage directly in economic activity. They impose taxes, produce and consume goods, sell electric power, lend money to farmers, and insure bank deposits.

In other countries governments intrude even further into the workings of the economy. In Western Europe governments own and operate telephone, radio, and television services, railroads, coal mines, and aircraft companies. In some countries, such as Sweden and Great Britain, the entire health system is also run by the state. In countries with Communist governments, such as the former USSR , North Korea, China, and Cuba, the state has attempted to control the entire economic life of the nation. All economic planning is centralized in the government and its bureaucracies. When the system fails to produce the goods and services expected by the people, the government is forced to increase the level of repression of its citizens in order to remain in power.",1426174602,t1_c0i7k56,c0i7k56,0,t3_alg13,False,Libertarian,poohbanookraksmokpl,False,0,1262643717,,4,0,True,t3_alg13,4,

,,t5_2qzb6,"There are several crops with GMO issues but here in Hawaii taro has been the big focus.  Politically, it's a huge deal.  Practically, it's not nearly as big of a problem.  There is a group of activist farmers here in Kona that get all worked up about GMO coffee.  They worked really hard to pass legislation even though there currently is no GMO coffee.  Even if there were, coffee is at no threat.  Well, no biological threat I should say.  The threat from panicked buyers is very real.

GMO, Genetically Modified Organisms, is basically just a high powered version of a tradition breeding program.  Instead of breeding cousins together until you get a strain you like, GM makes it possible to splice in a new gene to get a specific, desire trait.  The most common example, developed my Monsanto, is RoundUp Ready (tm) Canola.

Normal Canola (rapeseed) dies when sprayed with RoundUp while the GM version does not.  That means farmers can spray their entire field with RoundUp, killing all the weeds while their rapeseed crop survives.  You can see how farmers would love this.  As does Monsanto who sells RoundUp.  You can also see how they might get carried away.

The RoundUp resistance is built into the plant, just like your eye color is built into you.  The GMO can't contaminate other plants any more than your neighbor's eye color can contaminate you.  If your neighbor has kids though, they will likely inherit that eye color.  If those kids mate with my kids then my grand kids may have my neighbor's eye color.  The scare is that some of the seeds from my neighbor's field may blow into my field and sprout.

This is a very real concern because Monsanto owns powerful patents.  If a patented seed sprouts on my farm, I have to pay Monsanto a fee.  Yes, even if I claim that they simply blew in from my neighbor's property.  There have been lawsuits about this.  The big guys usually win.

With coffee there are two potential GMO ideas.  The first is a decaf bean.  There is naturally occurring coffee that is caffeine free but it tastes horrible.  The hope is that GM would create a decaf coffee that tastes good.  That's the hope.  It hasn't happened yet and as far as I know nobody is currently working on it.  The funding just isn't there.  GMO research is expensive.

The second GMO idea is a coffee with uniform ripening.  Actually, it would be a delayed ripening.  Coffee normally ripens a couple beans at a time.  That means I have to harvest repeatedly, sometimes all year long.  This is even worse for companies that use mechanical harvesters because they can only harvest once.  Every bean, ripe or not, is harvested by the machine then the bad beans are thrown out.  Using GMO they hope to make beans that won't ripen until sprayed with a specific chemical.  Spray this magical chemical then the entire field ripens at once.  Of course that chemical would be sold by Monsanto, the same people paying for the GMO research.

Even if my neighbor planted GMO coffee it would not affect me unless I picked their GMO beans and planted them on my property.  Since my property is already planted with coffee trees, I'm not too concerned.

On the other hand, GMO scares are huge.  Japan and parts of Europe have basically outlawed anything that starts with the letters G or M.  It's ridiculous some of the things they have banned.  It doesn't matter if it's safe or not, if people are afraid to buy it then it won't sell.  So, because of these fears, I don't want any GMO coffee in Kona.

I don't want a ban on research either though.  GMO can be a very powerful tool.  I compare it to my chainsaw, it can be great when used properly, or very dangerous when used improperly.  Just because it can be dangerous, I'm not going to ban all chainsaws.  They're just too valuable of a tool to ignore.  The same is true with GMO.

Thus, the study does not tell us anything significant about the economic effect of immigrants on the economy, nor about what would happen if immigrants weren't present in the economy. What I am trying to argue is that the study you quoted is useless to make any sort of meaningful conclusion.

You are the one making the claim about ""sweeping the floor"". I can already tell by several mistakes here that you haven't really bothered to read the study in detail. 

**And not accounting inflation? Are you stupid? If you counted inflation, the real wages would show an even higher decline, making a bigger point against immigration.** Inflation raises salaries, not lowers. 

Since you even failed to grasp this simple concept, I really have doubts of the competency of your intelligence as well as the conclusions of your so called studies. It really seems like you are grasping at straws here.

&gt; 1.- I don't use them anyway.

Bullshit. You live off the grid? You don't drive a car? I don't think so. How do you think you are getting the electricity and the internet to write your inane comments on? If it weren't for the pioneers who braved the wilds came here before you, none of this would have existed.

It is a public work, based on the sacrifices that the people before you have made. Therefore I am showing you how silly it is for you to argue that you shouldn't expect anything from the hard work of the generation before you. 

Immigrants, especially illegal ones, don't really pay much of an entry fee compared to long term residents. Or did you willfully ignore that non-residents of colleges are charged more, and that legal immigration is quite restrictive?

&gt; Yes on the Iraq war. As for ""both World Wars"", the US propaganda clearly stated they were doing it for the world, not for them, and the benefits of both wars far outweighed their costs.

This Iraq war is cutting the cost of oil for your business. Are you really being naive in thinking that the wars weren't done for economic reasons? Do you think that Germany ruling all of Europe would have just been fine and dandy for the economy here? If you do, you are very ignorant. 

There is a reason why America, as the sole superpower, has been able to enjoy such economic prosperity. And it is in no small part due to the veterans and people who have lived here long before you.

&gt; The study talks about all immigrants, not just illegal immigrants, so your point about ""illegal immigrants"" is not in the spirit of the study, so, again, citation needed. As for, do their offsprings deserve to make a living in the US? Sure, no one is challenging them to make a living. I am challenging the idea that making $10 an hour for sweeping the floor is a ""right"".

You certainly are challenging their right by driving their wages down with foreign labor that are a drain on every other tax payer in the US. $10 today is going to be $5 tomorrow in a race to the bottom. Not to mention that lower end wages have even declined considering inflation. 

&gt; The study talks about all immigrants, not just illegal immigrants, so your point about ""illegal immigrants"" is not in the spirit of the study, so, again, citation needed.

Why do you keep being so willfully ignorant? Illegal immigrants are an entire 50% of legal immigrants. You act like the number of illegal immigrants are a tiny number.

&gt; Yes. The same way that the US wants their heavily subsidized fields to compete with survival farmers in the Third World. It is called ""globalization"" and, for the last 25 years, since Reagan, the United States has been the world's biggest proponent. Walk the talk.

The US has not been the world's biggest proponent to compete with survival farmers in the third world. Your comment is laughably ignorant. Not only does the US have immense farming subsidies, the modernized farms of the US outproduce 3rd world countries which is why there is such high demand for Mexican crop pickers.

,,t5_2cneq,"&gt; On the final point of population diversity, I'm unconvinced that it would have a large effect on the overall numbers. 

Same here (not that I have any authority whatsoever in matters medical or statistical).

&gt; But perhaps the author was talking about something like ... African Americans were 2.3 times as likely 

Firstly I'd just like to point out: _Europe does actually have black and Asian people_.  Lots of them in fact.  Not aiming at you I hasten to add, but generally when I read comments like that ""our greater diversity"" line, it's coming from someone apparently operating on the quaint assumption that European countries are immacculately preserved little ethnic monocultures, no immigration and everyone ticking along with homogenous genes, so we couldn't _possibly_ have any idea of what the issues big advanced America has what with having _different races and all_ :o   

Which is possibly an unfair construction in my mind, but that's what comes across when used in the snidely dismissive but massively unsubstantiated way that the OP uses it.

That aside, it does make me wonder how the statistics would play out, and I think it may depend on the definition of ""diverse"".  For example, let's say France has 20 different ""races"", 1 makes up 90% of the population, another 4 make up the next 5%, and the remaining 15 only make up the last 5% between them.  While the USA also has 20, but no one race accounts for more than 30%, or less than 3%, of the population.

I suspect (given the obviously ridiculous numbers I am using here, let alone quibbles over ""race"" etc etc) this is very roughly the sense in which the ""greater diversity of our population"" claim is made.

In which case, is there not a possible case that this should _reduce_ spending, rather than justify the higher spending?  (or benefit the other axis of the graph).  My thinking here is this.  Imagine one of those groups on my hypothetical France which had 0.01% of the population, has a particular vulnerability to some disease or condition, which is no great risk for the rest of the population.   With only 10 people of that group in the country, France either won't invest in the treatment facilities for that illness at all (they die, worsening France's place on the graph), or may build/buy a single centre/medicine factory or buy medicine/relevant expertise/whatever from other countries ""ad hoc"", at presumably high rates, likewise skewing the expenditure per capita graph.  Whereas if the USA has 1,000,000 of those people, they can more reasonably invest in healthcare for that group with economies of scale and so on.

Sorry, I think I am explaining this really badly.  What I'm trying to say is...  I'm sure there are many interesting points to be made concerning population diversity and healthcare expenditure, but ""The Business Insider"" certainly didn't make them, and in their absense I only read it as ""Our minorities are bigger so that inherently means we have to pay more DUH"" and I find that extremely unconvincing.

I know that Turkey will become quite an important part of the EU once and if it gets in. Some see it as a threat, I see it as an opportunity :) Do we really honestly think that the ""old"" Europe can compete on the same level against China or a resurrected US? I honestly doubt it. 

And about all the ""political and cultural integration"" issue, unfortunately a lot of those people really don't know what the hell they're talking about. 

First, let me start with at an anecdote level, that is my first trip to Paris. Me and my wife arrived on an Wednesday morning by plane, at Charles de Gaulle airport. Of course we chose the [RER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Réseau_express_régional) to get to the city, and at that moment it became really interesting, because after 2 or 3 stations the European-looking faces that had started the journey at the airport were easily outnumbered by Blacks, Arabs and Asians. I said it was interesting because at that moment the whole ""Europe for white civilized people"" discourse seemed rather far-fetched. Of course by the time we reached the downtown stations most of the ""indesirables"" had already gotten off the train, replaced by white-skinned tourists and locals, but that's another story.

And passing to serious and more documented evidence of why ""Europe for us old Europeans"" is bullshit just read articles like [this one](http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/01/04/01002-20100104ARTFIG00562-identite-le-debat-n-est-pas-un-defouloir-raciste-.php) (is written in French, sorry, maybe Google Translate can help you out). In essence, it seems like the white French people don't know who the hell they are anymore, or what their country is supposed to represent, and in the old Republican tradition it seems that they've set up a commission to decide for them on this issue. So, in light of events like these it seems hypocritical to accuse Turkey that it doesn't share core European ""values"".

Yet again you've lost me, WTF are you talking about?

&gt;The fact is, I am sick and tired of blacks. I've lived around them all my life, to such an extent that can't be appreciated by most liberal whites.

I lived in Guyana (South America) from 1993 - 1998 and I can assure you that my experience with black people is completely different to yours. I've also extensively travelled most of the Caribbean as well as some parts of Africa. Now that you have let on a bit more about your particular experience, I can tell exactly the person you are. Even in our past exchanges I can tell that you are trying desperately to prove yourself as superior. You have many complexes that distort your perception of reality. No matter what you say, I have enough variables to piece together a vague picture of your character, and it isn't pretty.

&gt;I'm not doing anything of the sort. I'm trying to assist in the preservation of white culture.

There is no such thing as the white culture you moron. Little things like this expose the holes in your intelligence or lack of. We have American culture, European culture, British culture. Culture by definition has nothing to do with the colour of ones skin, but I shouldn't have to explain that to a person who boasts an IQ of 150.

&gt;This statement is so incorrect as to be absolutely ludicrous, prima facie. Your BBC is full of indoctrination.

Not only are you full of disinformation and half truths, you make assumptions about EVERYTHING. It isn't MY BBC and you are wrong to assume that I even watch or give the BBC any of my time.

&gt;Here in the US, multiculturalist indoctrination is EVERYWHERE.

I thought you were in Tanzania? Most of the shit that comes out your mouth makes you look like a pathological liar, you do know this right?

In the US you LIVE in a multicultural society. The entire country was built on the back of slavery, it was the white man who brought the Africans to the US. You cannot do ANYTHING but accept the country you live in. I really don't want to go down the road of explaining the situation in the US as I don't want to devote that much time to a bigot who knows NOTHING about history.

&gt;Familiar with Heidegger? What about Linkola? I'm not my distant cousin's keeper. Logically? Don't make me laugh-- everything you've said here has been a naked appeal to emotion.

Why do you always feel the need to name drop? It makes you look like the biggest ass-hole ever. It doesn't add any validation to anything you say and makes you look more like you DON'T know about a particular subject when you try to name drop. I'm not a fan of that particular German philosopher but am completely absorbed in Eastern teachings and philosophy. Maybe if you learnt in this direction some peace would come to your life. I am sorry to hear about your circumstances or bad experience with a particular group of black people, however from my travels I can assure you that your accusations/conclusions are incorrect, ignorant, and far far from reality.

You can continue to spout racism, xenophobic half truths, etc all day long on reddit. Unfortunately, you won't sway many minds here and your hateful nature will get you flamed by me and many others here.

Me, I'm opposed to capital punishment for a couple of reasons - DNA evidence keeps revealing the innocence of people who have spent decades on death row, telling me we convict a lot of innocent people (especially minorities, but that's another rant); and the death penalty isn't proving to be much of a deterrent, since execution states like Texas or Washington don't have lower rates of rape or murder than other states, or European countries where there's no death penalty.

It would be nice if the world had advanced to the point where your perspective (of race not mattering and not being worth distinguishing) were the norm, but unfortunately we haven't arrived there yet.

By the way, be extremely wary of anyone who claims to be able to identify Jewish people.  While there are some facial features that are stereotypically associated with Jews (big nose, curly hair, etc) these are stereotypes -- not reality.  As an Asian you've probably noticed that all white people have big noses, and as for curly hair, I mean, really.

It seems to be a hold-over from the Ashkanazi Jews who had a primarily Eastern European origin (and looked the part) moving into Western Europe.

I was an American who loved to eat out - until I met my American husband who loves to cook and has a European outlook on food (his parents were from Europe.)

Nope - only about once or twice a year for very special occasions. He uses cream in some soups...again something we might have once a month and not on a daily basis.

In my opinion national politics should be handled by a more parliamentary proportional system as used in other European nations. We the people are no longer represented by states. We need a way to introduce minority opinions into the Congress, which is loaded with like-minded white men. They have no expert opinion because they all won the election the same fucking way. Without enough variation, the population fitness of Congress is poor, and they ultimately make poor decisions and must be informed by outside forces (ie interest groups).

,,t5_2qzb6,"&gt; Where do you get your water?

Good question.  The entire island is made of lava rock.  Lava rock is extremely hard yet porous.  That means digging a well is next to impossible.  It also means that even if you could dig a well, there's no groundwater until you get down to sea level.  Dig in the wrong place and you might even hit some lava.

The county does own some wells and that's where the city water comes from.  I'm too far up the mountain though so I can't get city water unless I wanted to pump it a mile or so uphill.  So if we can't dig a well and we can't get city water, where do we get our water?

We collect all the rainwater off the roof.  I have 80,000 gallons of catchment capacity and in a typical year we'll get over 100 inches of rain.  That's far more water than we usually need.  Most years anyways.  This year has been extremely dry so our tanks are running a bit low.  If it doesn't rain soon, I may need to pay a water truck to fill up our tanks.

&gt; Is the cost of electricity overwhelming?

At $.33/kWH it's among the highest in the nation.  And we're about to get another substation cost increase.  There are two main reasons for the high prices.  First is the fact that most of the electricity is generated from fuel which must be shipped to the island.  Second is the fact that we can't rely on other islands or other states for backup electricity.  That means each islands needs enough generators to handle peak demand.  That means more expense per person because we can't share with neighboring cities.

&gt; Have you thought of a new and better weed-whacker?

Yup, it's called glyphosate.  It's cheaper, safer, easier to apply, more effective and lasts longer.  Its only real disadvantage is that it's often misunderstood and therefore feared.

&gt; Have you thought about advertising to the booming Asian market since the US/EU may be in the shitter for another 3 years?

First, I don't know of anybody that can predict the future so I'm not willing to bet on where the market will be in three years.  Second, I'd love to get into the Asian market no matter what the U.S. economy does.  The main barrier is shipping.  Shipping to the U.S. mainland is easy.  Shipping to foreign countries is amazing difficult and expensive for a small business like mine.  It's not impossible, just difficult and expensive.

The thing is, any group of people who interbreed long enough develop a set of characteristics that can be distinguished, but no group of people is completely isolated. Jews tended to mate with other Jews. Just like Africans tended to mate with other Africans. The mixing of traits from other gene pools is variable and so there cannot be a specific set of characteristics that define an African face or a face of Jewish descent, but our minds can work out subtle patterns that says to you...""this face reminds me of many of the Korean faces I know,"" or ""this face is not like any of the faces I saw in Europe.""

Poking fun at France seems to be a long running gag, especially in the U.K. and America.  You would need to look at the relationships between these countries and France, searching specifically for any subtle cultural difference which makes for easy comedic fodder.  ""Oh look, they're different, how funny!"".


England and France have a long history of conflict (going back to the Battle of Hastings in 1066, if not further).  Why?  Geographical proximity?  Familial infighting?  Nationalism and arguments over responsibilities and territory?


My best guess would be repeated attempts on both sides of the Channel to assert sovereignty over the other, and the subsequent trickling down of general dislike between the two populations.  Colonial expansion by both countries into the 'New World' in the 1600's and the Napoleonic conquest of Europe did little to ease tensions between England and France.  Many are quick to remember how France fell to the Germans in WWII, yet fail to recall continued French resistance actions during the occupation - actions which certainly made the Allied invasion easier to carry out.


And then there is the the French withdrawl from NATO in 1966.  My guess was that de Gaulle had legitimate reasons for the move, however America and England probably viewed it as simple duty shirking against a perceived Communist threat.

Numerous reasons exist for dislike against France, but I think at the end of the day it comes down to this: human nature is petty and selfish.

,,t5_2qh1i,"Religion has been around for thousands of years, for that to have happened it must be something of intrinsic worth that people keep returning to, i.e. a moral/cultural framework that adds value to their lives; Also that people could be psychologically disposed to religious considerations : http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/sep/04/religion.uk. If humanity is really like this then arguing about religion becomes like arguing about the weather, a facile practice that passes the time. If supporters of rational discourse are serious about turning people's head away from religion they should create a moral system that people prefer to use. Yet it appears to me that most active atheists and anti-theists are just in the mood to criticise and not build.

If Religions divide people we should also consider that nations divide people, politics divides people, sports teams divide people.  Ideas can divide or unite, for good or ill. Are the passions generated by Religions so different from any other? If not we should note that the problem is not with the message but with the people acting on it.

'Also, religious morality is also damaging because it does not allow for moral growth. it keeps part of society trapped in moral stasis at the time of whatever their religious work was written. They, through childhood indoctrination, are not allowed to socially evolve.'

I once asked a priest what he had learnt during his training. He said that he started with conviction and ended up with doubt and uncertainty. During his three years of training his class discussed all the religious heresies and controversies throughout history and became completely grounded in a hundred opposing points of view. He is an Anglican vicar (Church of England) and the idea is that because he had a rounded view of many moral arguments he would be better able to help his parishioners. Now if you look at fundamentalist forms of religion I can see why a view could be developed that there is limited moral growth. I would ask you to accept that moral growth and religion often go hand in hand and that absence of moral instruction may lead to an absence of moral growth.

Focusing just on Christianity and the theme of social evolution, consider the work of the Christian socialist movement and its predecessors http://www.thecsm.org.uk/Groups/87270/Christian_Socialist_Movement.aspx. The ending of the slave trade and the modern welfare state were due in part to the work of Christians.

[It's leagal and political dispute.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icesave_dispute). Iceland guaranteed the savings up to €20,000, but is refusing to do it for foreigners. It affects 400,000 depositors in UK and Netherlands, plus some 30,000 Germans. 
legal background: 

&gt;The arguments of the British and Dutch governments are based on their interpretation of the law of the European Economic Area (EEA), and around two positions in particular:

&gt;- that the Icelandic government is obliged to guarantee at least the first €20,000 in Icesave accounts;
- that Iceland's actions surrounding the collapse of Landsbanki are discriminatory against non-Icelandic creditors.

&gt;The Icelandic government disputes these positions.


&gt;The second, if not primary claim of the British and Dutch governments is that Iceland is in breach of its obligations under Article 4 of the EEA Agreement which prohibits ""any discrimination on grounds of nationality"",[66] echoing Article 7 of the Treaty of Rome.[67] The contention is that, by guaranteeing deposits at Icelandic branches but not at overseas branches, the Icelandic government is unfairly (or ""illegally"") favouring Icelanders, be they individuals or corporations. Iceland roundly denies the charge of discrimination.


ps. I think Icelanders are legally on thin ice on this. When foreigin banks are allowed to operate in other countries, they and their countries of origin are bind by the international agreements.  On the other hand there is the  UK freeze of Landsbanki assets based on Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. It was dirty move, and Icelanders have every right to be angry.

you're parodying something which barely exists.  actual ""anti-american"" posts on this site as far as I can see are FAR MORE often from americans themselves.  the vast majority of ""yank bashing"" posts I see, bemoaning the majority of the population or politicians as too religious / too conservative / too rural / whatever, are from _american_ redditors of the liberal / progressive / whatever mould, not ""TypicalEuroRedditors"".   I wonder about VitaminP for example.  Scan of the last few pages of his comments doesn't confirm anything, but mostly suggests he's probably American.   

So you're mostly railing against a complete strawman before you even start typing.  Then if we specifically look at the content of your post, it's 100% railing at straw men.  ""The US is filled with simple minded bigots who love NASCAR and Jesus"" - for fuck's sake where did you get that from VitaminP's post?  Where did you get anything REMOTELY LIKE THAT?  You didn't.  He didn't say it, he didn't even imply it.  There was no allusion to sport or religion in his discussion of national stereotypes WHATSOEVER.  You are just trotting out your usual SHIT routine regardless of its relevance.  

Next sentence, ""we in Europe would never think of being prejudice [sic]"" - ok, even MORE of a strawman argument, if that's even possible.  Because even if you INSIST on construing his discussion of American prejudices and stereotypes as ""Americans are all prejudiced and stupidly stereotype other people"" (which, as above, isn't really sustainable, but it's almost understandable), he says absolutely NOTHING to suggest prejudice and stereotypes are unique to the US and Europeans are immune to the same tendencies.  So where the fuck are you getting this drivel from?

Furthermore, where I do see ""attacks"" on the US from European or otherwise foreign redditors, or internal critics (as above), they are mostly along the lines of ""according to these stats the US has a higher per capita expenditure on healthcare"", ie trying to stick to facts and issues rather than jumping to baseless social stereotyping as you consistently portray it.  You know what's pretty ironic?  When faced with largely reasonable, nuanced arguments, you don't meet them head on, or even when faced with actual lazy, unjustifiable stereotyping, you don't rise above it, ignoring it as the idiocy it obviously is.  Instead you get all nationalistically butthurt and invent a fucking retarded puppet version of the ficticous mental enemy you've invented in your head so you can parade around missing all the points actually made or, at best, crassly simplifying them, for the sake of a cheap shot at a caricature of what you THINK people in other countries are like.

You may argue that this is due to inherently liberal social values not present in the US, rather than European homosexuals' desire for being allowed to *marry* being as great as that of American homosexuals, but there are influential conservative movements in every European country that, in my opinion, would have prevented gay marriage from being instituted had the homosexuals not actively desired it.",1426175229,t1_c0i8v8x,c0i8v8x,0,t3_alrku,False,atheism,Aqwis,False,0,1262706090,,6,0,True,t1_c0i8p4b,6,

I think that the U.S. never really got around to converting to metric because after WWII we didn't have to do all the rebuilding that Europe did, so many of our public buildings, roads, and the like would have had strange metric measurements.

Also, out of curiosity, do you feel energized after the first orgasm, or after say a few of them?

&gt;Along with the anatomical changes that occur during arousal, orgasm,
&gt;and resolution, a host of physiologic and biochemical events unfold 
&gt;involving the central and peripheral nervous systems. The senses relay 
&gt;sexual images and impulses to the brain, which releases a variety of 
&gt;neurochemicals and neuropeptides, including serotonin, dopamine, 
&gt;epinephrine, norepinephrine, histamine, opioids, gamma-aminobutyric 
&gt;acid, oxytocin, nitric oxide, and vasoactive intestinal peptide.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The brain is so central to female sexual response that imagery alone 
&gt;may be enough to produce orgasm. One study suggests that women 
&gt;may experience a state that appears to be an orgasm via fantasy, 
&gt;without self-stimulation of the genitals.9 In this study, physiologic 
&gt;measurements did not differ between orgasms experienced through 
&gt;fantasy versus masturbation.

Also, interestingly:

&gt;The experiments also revealed a rather surprising effect: both men
&gt;and women found it easier to have an orgasm when they kept their

,,t5_2qh1i,"To the citizens of the United States of America, in the light of your failure to competently govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories.

Except Utah, which she does not fancy.

Your new Prime Minister (The Right Honourable Gordon Brown MP, for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America without the need for further elections.

The House of Representatives and the Senate will be disbanded.

A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminium."" Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.

The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour'; skipping the letter 'U' is nothing more than laziness on your part. Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters.

You will end your love affair with the letter 'Z' (pronounced 'zed' not 'zee') and the suffix ""ize"" will be replaced by the suffix ""ise.""

You will learn that the suffix 'burgh' is pronounced 'burra' e.g. Edinburgh. You are welcome to re-spell Pittsburgh as 'Pittsberg' if you can't cope with correct pronunciation.

Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up “vocabulary."" Using the same thirty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""uhh"", ""like"", and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.

Look up ""interspersed.""

There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you shouldn't have chat shows. When you learn to develop your vocabulary, then you won't have to use bad language as often.

There is no such thing as ""US English."" We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of ""-ize.""

You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier).

You will also have to learn how to understand regional accents --- Scottish dramas such as ""Taggart"" will no longer be broadcast with subtitles.

While we're talking about regions, you must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is ""Devon."" If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become ""shires"" e.g. Texasshire, Floridashire, Louisianashire.

Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. Hollywood will be required to cast English actors to play English characters.

British sit-coms such as ""Men Behaving Badly"" or ""Red Dwarf"" will not be re-cast and watered down for a wishy-washy American audience who can't cope with the humour of occasional political incorrectness. Popular British films such as the Italian Job and the Wicker Man should never be remade.

You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.

You should stop playing American ""football."" There are other types of football such as Rugby, Aussie Rules &amp; Gaelic football. However proper football - which will no longer be known as soccer, is the best known, most loved and most popular. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game.

The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.

Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies).

We are hoping to get together at least a US Rugby sevens side by 2010.

You should stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of North America. Since only 2.15% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called ""rounders,"" which is baseball without fancy team strip, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs.

You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because we don't believe you are sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you will require a permit if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.

The 4th of July is no longer a public holiday. The 2nd of November will be a new national holiday, but only in Britain. It will be called ""Indecisive Day.""

All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap, and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.

All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts. You will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.

You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call 'French fries' are not real chips. Fries aren't even French, they are Belgian though 97.85% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called ""crisps."" Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat.

Waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers.

As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself.

The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling ""beer"" is not actually beer at all, it is lager . From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as ""beer,"" and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as ""Lager."" The substances formerly known as ""American Beer"" will henceforth be referred to as ""Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine,"" with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as ""Weak Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine."" This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in the Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.

From the 10th of November the UK will harmonise petrol (or ""gasoline,"" as you will be permitted to keep calling it until the 1st of April) prices with the former USA. The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will, in return, adopt UK petrol prices (roughly $10/US gallon -- get used to it).

You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent. Guns should only be handled by adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, then you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.

Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.

You don't need hitler to answer that one.  He invaded france because germany was at war with france.  Germany was at war with france because france declared war after germany invaded poland.  For his motivations about that, well we have this quote from him:

&gt;Our strength is our speed and our brutality. Genghis Khan chased millions of women and children to death, consciously and with a happy heart. History sees him only as a great founder of states. It is of no concern, what the weak Western European civilisation is saying about me. I issued the command - and I will have everybody executed, who will only utter a single word of criticism - that it is not the aim of the war to reach particular lines, but to physically annihilate the enemy. Therefore I have mobilised my Skull Squads, for the time being only in the East, with the command to unpityingly and mercilessly send men, women and children of Polish descent and language to death.

The French tend to resist American ideas and culture and initiatives more than any other western european nation. In other words, they tend to stand up to us more than others. So there's that (they're not a lap dog like Great Britain so often is).


France has also proven itself (so far) to be the only nation on Earth which seems competent at using nuclear power safely. Indeed, many countries over past decades have outsourced many nuclear jobs to France, since they are so good at it.


America desperately wants to claim it can do peaceful nuclear power competently too-- but in the past BOTH our private and public efforts in the field have made some major mistakes. We're much better at killing people than keeping them safe, with nuclear energy.

No, it only further cultivates hate and distrust between both nations, leading to more violence and problems in the future.

One merely has to look at European history. Last century we were the center stage of the two most horrible, destructive conflicts in the history of mankind. And how did these happen? Because nations at both sides have been at war with each other so often it became a natural response to every disagreement. 

Look up the history of Alsace-Lorraine, a region on the French-German border. It's been the cause of strife between both nations (and their predecessors) ever since the 9th century. None of these wars solved anything. Yet now we live in the most peaceful times ever in the history of Europe. Why? Because we all set around a table, realized the futility of war and started working together.

As we have explained for almost 20 years—and has been borne out repeatedly in real-world events—the “king of the south” spoken of in these verses is radical Islam under the leadership of Iran.

If one buys into haystack theory evolution, more successful social organizations thrived and simply crowded out the individuals of less successful ones.

The murder rates, combined with the rate of sackings that occurred, where cities like Merv (or Troy) were completely wiped out, suggests that the people who are left over from our tumultuous prehistory may have been lucky to be members of more successful social organization schemes.

So we have the civilizations growing out of mythologies, and these are mythologies that convince the people within them that they are finding their fulfillment within the world in which they are dwelling.

Now something happened to our world a little while ago. Let’s think what the old Medieval myth was, which really was the life of the Medieval civilization so that people between the year 1150 and 1250 built most of the great cathedrals in Europe. They put everything they had into that absurd task.

Mythology asks for absurd tasks—think of the Egyptian pyramids. I mean the economic interpretation of history just doesn’t confront the pyramids. [laughter] And that was the beginning. In fact, the economic concern is ego concern with survival and all that, which is the non-mythological concern, and it has never built a civilization—it has never built a cathedral.

What builds the civilization and the cathedral is a **mad aspiration of some kind.** And as long as that lasts, people are pulling together. And if you don’t have an aspiration, then the only other thing that will pull people together so they will do something is fear. Either aspiration or fear, and then people will work together. But let them not be scared, and not have something crazy pushing them, then just their thinking of survival, security and you know what else.

The myth of the Middle Ages was of Man’s Fall, of all being born in Original Sin as a consequence. When they die they will go to hell unless they are saved. They are saved by the Savior Jesus who was crucified, and founded the Church, and through the Sacraments of the church, salvation is achieved.

This supported an enormous institution: the Church, and the whole civilization of the Middle Ages was based on this. And when that belief disintegrated, the culture disintegrated; it has disintegrated now.

We are in what is called a wasteland. T.S. Eliott put his finger on it, back there in 1922, I think it was. What is a wasteland? It is a wasteland of people living without aspiration, going through the routine of their lives, doing things they are told to do because they don’t have the courage to do something they want to do, which would be a little bit insane.

We are in a realm that I would describe as a terminal moraine of myths. There are no end of destroyed mythologies around us.

,,t5_2qh49,"p.s. Here's his response to my portion, summarized by Adlayormoffer as, ""What consensus exists between Socialism and Libertarianism?"" 

&gt;I suppose, well, at least at the beginning of each movement, the thing in common that the Socialist movement had—well, there wasn’t a Libertarian movement in the early days of the Industrial Revolution; you don’t really get Libertarian movements until there’s a certain amount of peace, democracy and prosperity, and where the hard task of building a state and creating a nation has been done, so it’s [an] ahistoric question in some ways, but let’s say that Socialism begins—Marxism certainly begins—by looking forward to the end of the state—to the withering away of the state, as Marx and Engels famously put it—and to, as they better put it, actually, to the replacement of the government of men by the administration by man of things. And that bit of the ideal dropped out in the terrible struggles in Europe and elsewhere in the 20th century over nation states, wars, crises and revolution. But certainly the original idea was that the state was not the arbiter of social disputes but the product of them, and that if you could remove certain contradictions, there would be less and less need for an absolute authority. The Libertarians have got the same point in a different way, but I think that they always suffer—to me—from the disadvantage of being, I think I said before ‘ahistorical’—what would have been a Libertarian position on the Franco-Prussian War? On the collapse of czarism in Russia, on the rise of fascism, on the military industrial complex, on all these things? There’s so many things on which there’s no distinctly Libertarian position to take. What is the Libertarian view of the Vietnam War, say, or the Chinese Revolution? It’s a bit thin; it’s a bit faint.  But nonetheless, I’ve always said and believed that I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t have a bit of the Libertarian and the Anarchist within them ... I don’t make the presumption that those in charge know better than I do; I also don’t make the presumption that they have the right to tell me what to do unless they repeatedly have earned that right. So it’s very important that one has some Libertarian and Anarchist elements in his makeup, I believe.",1426175411,t1_c0i99c0,c0i99c0,0,t3_alv53,False,blog,palsh7,False,0,1262718854,,4,0,True,t1_c0i95cx,4,
,,t5_2qh13,"&gt;Second, the state is not allowed to guarantee deposits by the EU rules. 

I find that hard to believe. If deposit-guarantee schemes fail (too many banks fail) governments open their purses to prevent banking bank run, no matter what. 

&gt;Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes [3] requires all member states to have a deposit guarantee scheme for at least 90% of the deposited amount, up to at least 20,000 euro per person. On October 7, 2008, the Ecofin meeting of EU's ministers of finance agreed to increase the minimum amount to 50,000.[4] Timelines and details on procedures for the implementation, which is likely to be a national matter for the member states, was not immediately available.

Some of the headlines here use the words 'Financial pariah' amongst others. Your credit rating will fall, and the long term damage that will do to your ability to loan in the future is going to cost you much more than whatever you're not going to pay back now.

When a state can no longer issue bonds then there is a real risk of complete collapse. Look at Argentine for an example.

&gt; The new government's plans included stabilizing Argentina's economy including the creation of a new currency (the Austral, first of its kind not to carry the word peso as part of its name), for which new loans were required. The state eventually became unable to pay the interest of this debt and confidence in the Austral collapsed. Inflation, which had been held to 10 to 20% a month, spiraled out of control. In July 1989, Argentina's inflation reached 200% that month alone, topping 5,000% for the year. During the Alfonsin years, unemployment did not substantially increase; but, real wages fell by almost half (to the lowest level in fifty years). ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999%E2%80%932002) )

And this happened again in the 2000s:

&gt; Argentina defaulted on part of its external debt at the beginning of 2002. Foreign investment fled the country, and capital flow towards Argentina ceased almost completely. Argentina was ""left out of the world."" The currency exchange rate (formerly a fixed 1-to-1 parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar) was floated, and the peso devalued quickly, producing massive inflation.

,,t5_2qh13,"These Icesave accounts were savings accounts, not investment accounts (hence the word ""save"" in Icesave). The people opening such accounts are called ""savers"" not ""investors"". Calling them ""investors"" is deceitful, because you are misrepresenting the situation.

The difference is important because savings accounts are insured by law for a certain amount, in every civilized country in the world. This is called ""deposit insurance"". Investment accounts are not insured. When a person puts his money in a savings account, he does so with the knowledge that his money is insured (up to a certain amount) against bank failures.

Icelandic banks operating in England and Holland were required both by European law (European Union directive 94/19/EC) and Icelandic law (Act No. 98/1999) to provide such insurance to depositors. The minimum insurance required by law is €20,000 per account, which is what these Icelandic banks offered (although British banks offer €60,000 per account and Dutch banks offer €100,000 per account insurance).

When the banking crisis hit, the Icelandic banks realized they didn't have enough money in their insurance scheme to even pay the €20,000 minimum required by their own law and by European law. Instead of revealing these lack of funds, what they did was:

1. to start moving whatever cash was left in their foreign branches back into Iceland
2. modifying their rules so they would pay deposit insurance for Icelanders who had made deposits in bank branches in Iceland, but not pay deposit insurance to foreigners who had made deposits under exactly the same Icesave type accounts in bank branches in England and Holland.

If this hasn't sunk in, I suggest you re-read the two points above again. And again. And understand what this means. It means that the banks said they would pay the €20,000 for Icesave accounts held by Icelandic people in Iceland, but NOT for Brits or Dutch people who held exactly the same Icesave accounts in Icelandic banks in England and Holland.

Further, since they realized what an enormous squawk this would raise from the Brits and Dutch who got cheated, they quietly started moving cash out of their branches abroad, back into Iceland.

The movement of such large amounts of cash obviously can't be kept secret for long. The Brits found out and confronted Iceland. There is a very famous phone call between the British Chancellor Alistair Darling, and the Icelandic Finance Minister Árni Mathiesen, in which Mathiesen declared that Icelandic banks were obliged to pay back deposits for Icelanders, but not for foreigners. You can probably find transcripts of that phone call at dozens of web sites if you google for it.

This was the last straw. When England and Holland realized that not only did Iceland have no intention of honoring its deposit insurance, which it was required to do both by European and Icelandic law, BUT ALSO was secretly moving funds back to Iceland, from its branches in England and Holland, THEN, they reacted.

Instead of waiting to pass new laws to prevent this transfer of money (by which time the money would already be out of the country and gone forever), England took the unusual step of using an existing law, an emergency anti-terrorism law, to halt the transfer of funds. This was a law used ONLY because there was no other way to immediately freeze the transfer of funds, and if they had waited, they would have been too late. But a lot of Icelandic people were very upset and there were outraged demonstrations in Iceland with people saying ""look, do I look like a terrorist? I'm white, not brown, I'm not Al-Qaida!"". People went to town, dressed up in fatigues, holding mock weapons and getting their pictures taken. It was all great fun, like ""haha, look, the brits think we're terrorists, what a joke!"".

But I don't think the Brits considered them terrorists at all, they simply used the only law they had available to them at the time, to prevent the Icelandic banks from stealing more money from them.

The path to finding a solution, since then, has been tough. The situation is this. In both England and Holland, a lot of ordinary people got burned. Again, these were NOT investors, they were savers. Crucial difference. These people are telling their governments to do something. The government can't ignore them, too many people are involved. So the Brit and Dutch governments got together with the Icelanders, and tried to work out a solution. The solution was this: the Brits would lend the Icelanders sufficient money to repay the deposit insurance, and the Icelanders could then repay the loan over a long period. The Dutch agreed to do the same, for the Dutch people.

Initially, Iceland rebuffed this. Their thinking was that they could get better loan terms from the IMF (International Monetary Fund). However, since both England and Holland have some clout with the IMF, not to mention a bunch of other European countries that had lost smaller amounts of money but were still pissed off with the Icelanders, it became clear that the IMF would loan no cash to Iceland until this matter was resolved. In fact, all 27 EU member states said that Iceland needed to sort out this mess before the IMF would make any loans. This is not because 27 different EU countries all hate Iceland for some reason, it's because the situation was clear enough from a point of law that this ought to be the recommended course.

So Iceland was forced back to the bargaining table. This time, they came to an agreement with both England and Holland. As a consequence of the agreement, the Dutch have already started paying out the deposit insurances, and the Brits were about to follow. But there is more drama ahead.

Although the Icelandic government had agreed to the deal, it hadn't actually passed their parliament. The vote in parliament finally happened on August 28, 2009, and the bill passed, BUT parliament tacked on some extra provisions that weren't part of what they had previously agreed to, with England and Holland. Specifically, the provisions were that the repayments would never exceed yearly payment amounts higher than 4% of the GDP to England, and 2% of the GDP to Holland. Further, if as a consequence of these reduced payments, they failed to repay the loan in 20-something years, the rest of the loan would be forgiven.

If you do the math based on Iceland's pre-fake-boom GDP, you can see that under these terms they would only repay a fraction of the loan. Naturally, both England and Holland rebelled, and pointed out that this was not what they had agreed to. Until  lately, this was the situation, with both England and Holland threatening that they would block the IMF loans again (Iceland has also been separately applying for IMF loans during this time).

Finally, Iceland again voted on it again in parliament, and in December last year, they again approved the bill. But there were massive protests, with Icelandic people calling for a referendum. So a couple weeks later, the Icelandic President vetoed the bill again (today).

So that's where we are at present. I dunno what's going to happen. I expect partisans from both sides will distort the situation as they see fit. But please don't get taken in by too many lies. Remember:

1. these were SAVINGS accounts, not investment accounts
2. the SAVINGS accounts were insured for €20,000 each under both Icelandic and European law
3. when the crash came, Iceland found there wasn't enough insurance money to pay everyone
4. Iceland then said it would pay only depositors who had accounts in the branches in Iceland, but not abroad, for the SAME type of account
5. Iceland started to move cash from England and Holland into Iceland
6. THEN the Brits got annoyed and put a stop to it, and yes, they used an antiterrorism law to do so
7. NOBODY has asked that Iceland pay any more than the €20,000 per account, plus interest. Interest is standard in banking, it is stupid to see bankers getting outraged over ""oh, they want us to pay interest!""
8. Iceland has said yes and no to repaying several times, changing its mind at least 3 times over this. Further, what they voted on in parliament was not what they had agreed to privately with England and Holland.

I dunno how this will work out. I have sympathy for the Icelandic people, not all of whom were responsible for the excesses of their countrymen. I also feel that the country was poorly governed, and I find it hard to understand why the public failed to ask some hard questions when these puny banks had already leveraged themselves to 5x the whole country's GDP. Why did they not ask questions when foreigners, including Americans, Dutch and Britishers went to Iceland many times and publicly warned them that their economy was going to crash, that such financial gimmicks could not continue. This was widely reported in the Icelandic press, so it's not like no one knew. Why did they not then question their own Prime Minister, and other politicians, who were simultaneously giving speeches, saying ""oh, we Icelanders are financial geniuses, it has to do with our heritage and national temperament"". Surely someone could have said ""hey, wait a minute, where did this expertise suddenly come from, a few years ago we were selling fish"".

,,t5_2qh1i,"I am going to answer this generally as there are several generations present here today.    

My generation, standing on the sholders of giants, changed the way this country deals with race issues.  The work is not done but this is a new world compared to 40 years ago.    

We continued to improve the way woman can live in this world by changing the way both women and men think about equality.   

My generation worked to stop all Nuclear weapons testing. Atmospheric stopped in 1963 and underground testing was mostly over by the early 90's. We also reduced the number of weapons and warheads from about 80,000 to about 25,000.  Still too many but the slope is in the right direction.    

 My generation elsewhere in the world moved South Africa to a non-aparthied state, China moved massively in new directions (not agreeing with all of it - just asking that you note how much better off many in China are compared to 20 years ago), The European Union has become a reality just a few decades after one of the worlds most massive wars was waged there, The Soviet Union mostly peacefully dimantled itself and its member states are all growing and becoming something new - not without problems but this is happening mostly without wars - these two changes in Europe would have been impossible 60 years ago.

So yes there is much work to do.  But please look over your sholder at the massive changes made in the past 100 years to position you in such a privilaged place.  It is hard and messy work improving the state of humanity when there are so many who want the old orders to stand.

,,t5_2qh13,"&gt;It was actually the The Depositors’ and Investors’ Guarantee Fund which guaranteed the deposits. The bill in question gave the bankrupt fund a government guarantee so that it could pay out the minimum €20,000 per account.

The Depositors' and Investors' Fund IS the Icelandic government. It was created by an act of Parliament to become Icelandic law. From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depositors'_and_Investors'_Guarantee_Fund):

*The Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund is the statutory deposit insurance scheme in Iceland. It is established under Act No. 98/1999 on Deposit Guarantees and Investor-Compensation Scheme, which transposes European Union directives 94/19/EC[2] and 97/9/EC[3] into Icelandic law, in accordance with the decisions of the European Economic Area.*

This bill wasn't a last minute thing pushed onto poor Iceland when they went bankrupt. It became law in Iceland way back in 1999, well before their bust when they were still riding high. It was a condition to operating in the EU. If you want to open branches in EU, you have to follow EU law, and one of the laws is that savings accounts get deposit insurance. This is law not only in the EU, but in the vast majority of the civilized world.

Saying at this point that it was just something set up by Icelandic parliament, not Iceland itself, is silly. This is how international law works. The EU doesn't do any hand holding - it can't, because doing so would be meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign country. It can only say ""you must have working deposit insurance if you want to open branches in our territory"". It can't tell you how to work your own deposit insurance, to make sure it has sufficient funds, to police your banks. It doesn't have the power to do any of that, only Icelandic government does, which therefore bears the responsibility, in the same way as any other country.",1426175503,t1_c0i9ggb,c0i9ggb,0,t3_alr4g,False,worldnews,DaveM191,True,0,1262724765,,15,0,True,t1_c0i8s8q,15,

Early in 2008, [Putin threatened the Ukraine with nukes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/12/AR2008021201658.html) because they were in talks about joining NATO.  Seeing as how they cut the gas only the month before makes me a little bit suspicious.

Considering the fact that Russia started sowing the seeds of discord between Abkhazia and South Ossetia around that exact same time, leading the regions to request independence the month after Russia threatened the Ukraine and three months before Gazprom expressed a desire to build a pipeline, with rumors of exploratory expeditions to Abkhazia just three months after that, things become more sketchy.

This all becomes even more suspicious when coupled with the fact that Georgia has also been incredibly involved with NATO, even to the point where they had sent a security force to assist NATO in Afghanistan.  Things became more clear concerning the conflict when Russian officials claimed that, since Abkhazia and South Ossetia were no longer part of Georgia, they wouldn't be included if NATO allowed Georgia to join.  Not only so, but they further widened the divide between the regions and Georgia by claiming that Georgia had intended to join NATO without them all along.

When confronted by the EU concerning the military buildup of Russian forces, Russia threatened to shut off gas to Europe if they didn't mind their own affairs, claiming that regional issues were none of their concern.

I'm in full agreement concerning your points about the United States, however, I don't trust Russia's play to develop a more dominant energy presence is entirely for economical reasons, especially since it has been employed as a means of control once already.

Well, I am not a society. So the rest of your ill-conceived rant doesn't apply to me.

&gt; People in this group without insurance create a significant burden on society. That is the whole point of the health care debate. How do you reduce that burden?

You aren't even capable of understanding the problem, apparently.

Let's say you sell widgets in nice comfy Europistan. It's a rich place, and you can command a high price per widget. But for whatever reason, you move to Mexistan. It is a poor country. And you, the poor widget salesman... you know no other profession. You have to sell widgets. What do you do?

You lower prices. You have to. You could be pissed and spiteful at the stingy Mexistanians... but this won't put food on your table. You either lower the price or you starve.

However, how would this change if everyone in Mexistan had rich uncles, waiting in the billing office with blank checks? You'd charge whatever you could. It wouldn't matter that sometimes the rich uncles get pissed, tear up the checks and leave... because right behind them is another with another blank check. You'd soon be charging even more than you ever did in the rich country. It's inevitable. It's not even greed on your part, really... everyone else is doing it, and if you charge less and are the outlier, rather than getting more business, you'd get less (which when you're undercutting is a bad situation).

We can't give everyone rich uncles. We need to get rid of them and their blank checks.

In fact, once government takes over insurance and we have ""single payer"", things will go to hell. They'll wail and bitch and scream about the high costs, and they will know other way than to cap prices. They did this in the 1970s with gasoline. But this won't fix things, it will just mean waiting in the 5-mile-long gas lines, and hoping that some is still left when it's your turn.

Of course, there are other issues that affect the cost of care, but the rich uncle syndrome dwarfs those by an order of magnitude or more.

&gt; Most countries reduce it by having some sort of socialized or single payer system.

Why does it matter now - what's so different now that all handguns should be banned?  Because someone *might* get hurt?  I could use that logic to ban just about anything.

Most Americans who support gun rights don't do so because we're afraid of anything.  It's because we support the rights of the individual to his or her property.  If a crime is committed with that property, we prosecute that crime.  To do otherwise is to compromise liberty, something that we're doing all too often in this day and age for no good reason.

Abriged version:

WWI: Germany invades france. NZ sends troops to reclaim it. Thousands die in the Somme, NZ loses more people per capita than any other nation despite being on the other side of the world. The most New Zealanders that ever died in a single day did it on on French soil, fighting for french freedom

WWII: Again france is invaded by germany, again NZ sends troops, again suffers the highest per capita loss of the allied nations.

Fourty Years Later the french were nuking their colonies unpopulated island moruroa in the south pacific to prove how badass they were. New Zealand nicely asked them to stop dropping bombs in our neighborhood. They didnt. Thiroid cancer cases in French polonesia went up 10 fold in a year (coincidence?). New Zealand and Australia put in an injunction with the FIA (federal atomic agency) to stop france giving people cancer, fucking up awesome islands and irradiating all sorts of marine life for no good reason. The FIA passed the injunction, which France ignored. NZ sailed protest vessels (private) frigates (oficial) into the blast zones in order to prevent the french bombing the islands.

A few months later one of the protest vessels suspiciously exploded in dock in auckland, killing a civilian. France condemmed the blatant terrorist act on our soil and offered full co-operation in finding the perpetrators. The NZ police captured the incompetant French spies a few days later. France denied any responsibility, threatened a european embargo of NZ products if the spies were not repatriated (this would destroy the NZ economy). NZ said ""fuck you france"" and took them to court. France lost was ordered to pay reperations and they had their spies returned on the condition that they serve out their sentences in france. They were pretty promptly released and promoted.

And some idiot keeps removing france from the list of state sponsored terrorist acts on wikipedia, despite them bombing a ship in an ALLIED nations harbour. It's totally retarded.

Is that a good enough reason?

TL;DR France owes new zealand after 2 world wars. they start nuking the pacific and giving people cancer despite an FIA injunction. Then sent spies to sabotage a protest vessel in an NZ harbour, killing a civilian. NZ captures spies and france are arrogant dicks about the whole thing.",1426175553,t1_c0i9kbs,c0i9kbs,0,t3_alptq,False,AskReddit,djinnandtonic,True,0,1262728306,,1,0,True,t3_alptq,1,

Now, there is no excuse for having to wait endlessly in a line when it seems the employees are not really handling customers. But for example in a restaurant the attitude towards the customer is completely different.

In the US the purpose of a restaurant visit is the meal. You'll be standing in the service line until there is an opening, the waiting staff will sit you down and will then not let you distract you one moment from the purpose of your visit : eating and drinking. Hence the menu is offered straight away, you get asked 50 times if you want to refill your soda, if a plate takes more than 5 minutes before it comes out of the kitchen your waiter will be apologizing and the bill will be on your table before you finish.

In Europe, the purpose of a restaurant visit is not being fed but having a relaxing time. Hence there is nearly never a waiting line at the restaurant : either you have a reservation or you'll be told they have no table for you tonight. (a reservation line will kill the mood for neighbouring tables) you will have plenty of time to (re)aquaint yourself with the other guests before a menu is offered, the waiter will nearly never interrupt your privacy by offering extras and after you're finished you get the bill at your own pace.

Me, I am used to the European style and I actually prefer it but I can certainly see how someone who is looking for something else in a restaurant visit really hates it.

This is really the minimum in the larger cities. Without extra work (hard if you do not know Swedish) or help from home, you will not afford unforeseen expenses like a visit to the dentist or a lost winter jacket. 

Depending of what your study, extra work might be almost impossible. Since the tuition is free, the teachers wont flinch to fail you if they feel you didn't live up to the standards for the course. (I have read courses with ~75-80% failure rate). But just do some research beforehand and you will be fine, even when working extra. 

Rent under 3000 sek/month is considered really cheap in Stockholm. The building standards are relatively high in Sweden so cheap older apartments are hard to come by. Rent for a one room student apartment can cost over 5000 sek/month (But a good student rent is somewhere arount 2700 sek/month). For Swedes, the government will give students welfare if they can't find cheap housing. 

This will create trouble for you. Since you as a foreigner probably will have to take the cheaper housing. (I myself prefer not to receive any welfare, thank you!

&lt;&lt;&lt;America is losing the free world"" by Gideon Rachman

Published: January 4 2010 20:11 | Last updated: January 4 2010 20:11


Ever since 1945, the US has regarded itself as the leader of the “free world”. But the Obama administration is facing an unexpected and unwelcome development in global politics. Four of the biggest and most strategically important democracies in the developing world – Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey – are increasingly at odds with American foreign policy. Rather than siding with the US on the big international issues, they are just as likely to line up with authoritarian powers such as China and Iran.

The US has been slow to pick up on this development, perhaps because it seems so surprising and unnatural. Most Americans assume that fellow democracies will share their values and opinions on international affairs. During the last presidential election campaign, John McCain, the Republican candidate, called for the formation of a global alliance of democracies to push back against authoritarian powers. Some of President Barack Obama’s senior advisers have also written enthusiastically about an international league of democracies.

But the assumption that the world’s democracies will naturally stick together is proving unfounded. The latest example came during the Copenhagen climate summit. On the last day of the talks, the Americans tried to fix up one-to-one meetings between Mr Obama and the leaders of South Africa, Brazil and India – but failed each time. The Indians even said that their prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had already left for the airport.

So Mr Obama must have felt something of a chump when he arrived for a last-minute meeting with Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, only to find him already deep in negotiations with the leaders of none other than Brazil, South Africa and India. Symbolically, the leaders had to squeeze up to make space for the American president around the table.

There was more than symbolism at work. In Copenhagen, Brazil, South Africa and India decided that their status as developing nations was more important than their status as democracies. Like the Chinese, they argued that it is fundamentally unjust to cap the greenhouse gas emissions of poor countries at a lower level than the emissions of the US or the European Union; all the more so since the industrialised west is responsible for the great bulk of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere.

Revealingly, both Brazilian and Chinese leaders have made the same pointed joke – likening the US to a rich man who, after gorging himself at a banquet, then invites the neighbours in for coffee and asks them to split the bill.

If climate change were an isolated example, it might be dismissed as an important but anomalous issue that is almost designed to split countries along rich-poor lines. But, in fact, if you look at Brazil, South Africa, India and Turkey – the four most important democracies in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the greater Middle East – it is clear that none of them can be counted as a reliable ally of the US, or of a broader “community of democracies”.

In the past year, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil has cut a lucrative oil deal with China, spoken warmly of Hugo Chávez, president of Venezuela, and congratulated Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad on his “victory” in the Iranian presidential election, while welcoming him on a state visit to Brazil.

During a two-year stint on the United Nations Security Council from 2006, the South Africans routinely joined China and Russia in blocking resolutions on human rights and protecting authoritarian regimes such as Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan and Iran.

Turkey, once regarded as a crucial American ally in the cold war and then trumpeted as the only example of a secular, pro-western, Muslim democracy, is also no longer a reliable partner for the west. Ever since the US-led invasion of Iraq, opinion polls there have shown very high levels of anti-Americanism. The mildly Islamist AKP government has engaged with America’s regional enemies – including Hamas, Hizbollah and Iran – and alarmed the Americans by taking an increasingly hostile attitude to Israel.

India’s leaders do seem to cherish the idea that they have a “special relationship” with the US. But even the Indians regularly line up against the Americans on a range of international issues, from climate change to the Doha round of trade negotiations and the pursuit of sanctions against Iran or Burma.

So what is going on? The answer is that Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and India are all countries whose identities as democracies are now being balanced – or even trumped – by their identities as developing nations that are not part of the white, rich, western world. All four countries have ruling parties that see themselves as champions of social justice at home and a more equitable global order overseas. Brazil’s Workers’ party, India’s Congress party, Turkey’s AKP and South Africa’s African National Congress have all adapted to globalisation – but they all retain traces of the old suspicions of global capitalism and of the US.

Mr Obama is seen as a huge improvement on George W. Bush – but he is still an American president. As emerging global powers and developing nations, Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey may often feel they have more in common with a rising China than with the democratic US.

The belief was that the masculine-dominant nature of most Indo-European languages acted to bias the speakers of those languages towards patriarchal social norms.  It has since generally been shown that this is not the case -- contradictions abound.  In particular, grammatical gender of any sort is actually not particularly common outside of the Indo-European language family and yet despite those other cultures speaking languages that make no particular gender distinction one way or another (Chinese, for example, or Finnish) patriarchal social organization remained extant.

For the converse, languages which exhibit feminine-dominance do exist -- for example, in Irish, the gender of the word ""they"" used when referring to mixed crowds is feminine, not masculine as it would be in Latin or French -- and yet those cultures did not exhibit matriarchal characteristics.

In view of this, it seems that mainstream feminism has mostly abandoned their desire for the adoption of gender neutral pronouns, as their fears that society was being programmed against gender equality were unfounded.

,,t5_6,"I lived in America for almost 4 years, spent quality time in 39 states, met a host of great people and learned an incredible amount by being immersed in the culture. 

Your youth are incredibly polite when compared to Brits, you have much less litter (in non 'tourist' areas) and much less graffiti (yeah, even in LA). You do appear 'loud' to us Brits but that is because we are brought up to speak in hushed tones (who knows why) and yeah you do appear a little rude but that is because you are taught to stand up for yourself and be confident, the difficulty with that is in the UK that is seen as a 'challenge' and clearly a challenge should be met head on (we may think ""that guy is an asshat, but we wouldn't say it unless we wanted a fight) 
Drink driving over there is a bit too frequent and does not seem to be taken seriously enough (we like to plan a lynching for drink drivers) yet speeding over there is seen as a terrible thing whereas over here it is the norm. You are so friendly at times it makes us feel uncomfortable (we are thinking ""what do you want"") and there seems to be a common practice of saying ""you must come for a meal / drink / party/ whatever within 3 seconds of meeting but that never materialises leaving you looking shallow. We do a lot of 'dropping in'.... if passing a friends house we just 'drop in' whereas your visits seem to be more planned and scripted to some extent. you tend to fill the lives of your kids with an 'after school everything' whereas we tend to leave them to cause chaos in the neighbourhood. 
Your middle class white folks seem to be terrified of black people, your cops are just far too violent and that violence is usually supported by the state. You are capable of incredible acts of compassion but also some of the most horrific acts of violence I have ever seen, you reach both ends of the spectrum in equal proportion. You have really shitty news programmes that focus on 'cat stuck up a tree' stories from around America followed by 'they are all out to get us' stories from the middle east / Russia. You have a lot of 'worlds best / worlds biggest when in fact you mean best / biggest in the lower 48. The general education with regard to other countries is absolutely shocking but I feel this is intentional (knowledge is power and all that). 
You have some of the most incredible scenery all in one place and reachable via a network of roads that have little or no traffic (between cities) you desperately need cross country high speed railways (drive on- drive off, like euro tunnel). 
Your cities can be a little disappointing and repetitive (with exceptions of course) South beach Miami, The old town San Fransisco, French Quarter New Orleans, NYC almost anywhere, loads in the north east, LA various etc. 
You seem to crave history whereas we have too much of it at times, you talk of 200 years ago as if it were an aeon yet thousands of brits live in 200 year old houses and treat them merely as home. 
The variety of stuff over there is somewhat restricted, I think because the 'chain store' is celebrated and that means mass market which means restricted choice whereas we think chain stores are ok for some stuff but we also need thousands and thousands of niche stores....the same could be said of restaurants in most states. 
You use far too much oil and other natural resources almost without a care which makes Europeans pissed off because we don't have the ability to do that (if we did we would be doing it just as you guys are). 
You have far too much 'AMERICA IS THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH' going on when in truth the majority of you guys have no idea what any other nation is like....and if you thought about it for a moment how would you like to hear from one single nation how great they are, every 5 minutes for the entirety of your life?? I know it is absolutely banged into you from birth and so you are to some extent indoctrinated but it still get on the tits....just a little. 
I could go on forever....oh I think I have sorry, but I had a great time in your incredible country, I met and maintain loads of new friends but equally I am happy to be back in my own small nation....and confess to a greater national pride in the achievements of the UK given the size of the scrappy little chunk of rock that I call home.

We can divert attention, of course, but the overhanging issue is that Canadians are under the thumb of the Americans.

Take W's call for a war against Iraq. Canadians said yes, along with Layton/Chretien/Harper. They quibbled over technicalities of course, such as having the UN approve the mission, but the Canadian government still committed itself to helping its neighbour. When it turns out the UN refused to give the USA a mandate we did the next best thing politically and boosted our commitment in Afghanistan.

We Canadians cannot say no to the Americans. They're too strong militarily, completely dominate us economically, and we're politically tied down by the previous two points.

The only way out is to tear up NAFTA and maybe get closer ties to the UK (with the EU) or China (with the Pacific powers). But that's never going to happen because, quite frankly, the gain of the benefits of trillions of investment, an easy place to sell our goods/resources, and military protection eclipses the possibility of entering an anarchic and chaotic world by our lonesome. Businesses would revolt versus a government that'd go that way, Alberta would likely split with Canada over denying its economic rights as a province, and, god dammit, it'd quite frankly tear apart the American-reliant auto manufacturing core in Ontario which'll cause huge political/economic catastrophes for **anyone** who even hints of going through with that policy.

All for the price of a few, mostly insignificant, people like Mark Emery. That's where we are. We can sell off our own citizens, and not care about it, for the benefits of being a parasite on the thigh of the world's foremost military and economic power.

i see why people use this measure - it makes countries with low infant mortality look very good by comparison.  but it really distorts the reality by suggesting, in this case that 'most afghan women die around the age of 44'.  which is completely wrong.  most likely this is a bimodal distribution with one spike around 3~4 years of age, and the other one around 65~70, much closer to what we'd expect. 

the even sillier thing is, this is also true of the u.s. or europe about 200 years ago (pre-industrial revolution).  there was a really good chance you'd die before the age of 5, but if you made it past that and into your early teens, life expectancy for adults was pretty much the same as it is now.  for me this puts a lot of the fuss over modern medical care and especially advanced treatments into different perspective.

Ukraine and Russia were having plenty of problems with gas sales, though, especially with Russia selling their gas to Ukraine at subsidized rates.

Russia didn't start sowing the seeds of discord between Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Abkahzians and Ossetians didn't want to live under oppressive Georgian supremacy and Georgia's pro US puppet decided to launch a surprise attack including against Russian peacekeepers and then immediately start a public relations campaign to make himself seem like the victim of Russian aggression to the gullible US citizenry with their handful of corporations controlling the information they get.  I remember right when Georgia launched the war, but before Russia responded why the fuck is the mainstream US media completely ignoring this story and then when Russia retaliated and they all parroted the Russian aggression line I realized what had transpired.

Anyway Georgia lost badly and as a result of the US and the west unilaterally recognizing the independence of Kosovo Russia used it as an excuse to recognize the independence that had long been declared by Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Georgia isn't even going to join NATO.  Europeans saw with their own eyes that Georgia in NATO could easily lead to a NATO-Russian war because of the mutual defense pact part.  The Abkhazians and Ossetians in South Ossetia never wanted to be a part of Georgia.

Russia didn't want NATO to extend itself into a beachhead in Georgia from which to continue its encirclement of Russia.  NATO is an anti-Russian organization and Russians sees NATO eventually extending to all the post Soviet states to choke Russia into submission.  Sure pro US drunk Yeltsin didn't care about fucking over his country, but Putin, regardless of how much we can disagree with his methods, is a Russian nationalist and doesn't want the country to be strangled by the US.

Russians and Ukrainians are incredibly similar and the problems between them is a combination of historical resentment by Ukrainians for Russian domination and constant western prodding to try to wedge the two countries as far apart as possible.  The west tries to wedge every single post Soviet country away from Russia and into their sphere of influence while decrying Russia as imperialist for trying to salvage whatever influence they have left in the world.

,,t5_2qh13,"&gt;We have already agreed to pay the UK and the Dutch back, but the terms of the deal that these country's want is totally unfair.

Haha. What a joke.

This is how ""unfair"" it is:

* You guys ran a fraudulent scheme, and cheated tens of thousands of British, Dutch, and other European people out of their cash, sometimes their whole life's savings.

* To protect against precisely this kind of fraud, the EU has set up rules requiring deposit insurance for savings accounts. You agreed to these rules when you opened branches in England and the Netherlands.

* But this insurance scheme was also a fraud. It was created by your government, under an act of your parliament. And your government failed to supervise it, police it, take responsibility for a law that THEY had signed, that THEY had taken responsibility for fulfilling. They were too busy getting their own cuts from the bankers.

* The insurance scheme was the cheapest permissible under law. While the Brits insured accounts for €60,000, and the Dutch for €100,000, your banks cheaped out and went for the minimum of €20,000.

* But it was a fraud all along, and when the crash came, they didn't even have €20,000 to hand out.

* Knowing this, they secretly moved their funds out of the UK and the Netherlands, back into Iceland. They knew that when the storm broke, their own citizens would burn their homes down if they didn't get paid, while the Brits and Dutch could do nothing. So whatever funds they had left, they brought home in a hurry, to pay Icelanders off.

* When the Brits and Dutch protested, and after all this pressure by the EU and the IMF, they made a deal. But now they don't want to honor that deal either.

And you call the deal unfair? What's unfair about it? This is what the actual deal is:

- Britain and Holland have offered to **loan** money to Iceland, so that Iceland can pay back its insured foreign investors.

- Note that no one is asking Iceland to return the 10x as large amount of money that they took as foreign investments, and then lost. That's not even being counted, because hey, that was investment money and investments are risky. Who cares if a bunch of Brits lost their pension funds because your idiot banks were playing cowboys and indians with that cash. That's all under the bridge.

- Only those small number of foreigners who had **Savings** accounts, guaranteed against bank failure through an insurance scheme, required by both Icelandic and EU law, specifically, the Icesave accounts - these are **ALL** that Iceland is being asked to pay back.

- And they're not even being asked to pay back the whole amount. Just the insured amount. Meaning if a Brit or Dutch citizen had €100,000 in his Icesave account, he's already reconciled himself to the loss of €80,000 of that. He just wants €20,000 back. The very cheapest insurance allowed by EU law, which Iceland chose.

- And to pay back that small amount, his own government is willing to give you the loan, out of **his** tax money.

But you claim that this is ""unfair"". Let's see what you consider ""fair"". In August, your parliament passed the bill allowing them to take the loans from England and Holland, to fulfill the insurance claims. But they added the following clauses:

- Iceland will never make a yearly loan payment any greater than 4% of its GDP to England, and 2% of its GDP to Holland.
- Even these reduced payments will only be paid for 14 years. At the end of the 14 years, England and Holland must forgive the remainder of the loan.

This is what you call fair? Do some math. Look at your GDP, now that your thieving banks are gone. It's shrunk. With that GDP and the 4%/2% limit and the deadline of 14 years, you'll only pay a fraction of what you owe. And what you owe is only a *tiny* fraction of what you actually stole. And that is fair?

It sounds like a happy solution for the Icelanders, but it's terribly unfair to the people whose money they stole.",1426175753,t1_c0i9zpb,c0i9zpb,0,t3_alr4g,False,worldnews,EvanRWT,False,0,1262743924,,13,0,True,t1_c0i94zf,13,

,,t5_2qh13,"&gt; Indeed, I and many of my friends signed the petition to reject the current terms because we would like a better interest rate on the repayment plan.

5.5% seems eminently reasonable for a long-term loan. If Iceland tried to raise money right now on the open market by selling long-term sovereign debt, I can guarantee it would have to pay a significantly higher interest rate.

Just to give you an idea, long-term U.S. Treasury yields right now are just above four and a half percent. Iceland is being granted a very narrow spread considering the credit risk that it represents--much narrower than the market would demand. 

&gt; Iceland will repay its debts, it will join the EU, it will repair its economy, but in the meantime we could do with a slightly smaller financial choke hold and I don't think that is too much to ask for and I certainly won't stand for any less.

I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, but Iceland's bargaining position is very weak. You certainly won't be joining the EU any time soon if you don't settle accounts with Britain and the Netherlands to their satisfaction. Those countries also have a lot of influence with the IMF, which is currently propping up your economy. 

I think your government probably used all the leverage it could muster in negotiating these repayment terms. Don't expect Britain and Holland to make further concessions. The IMF loan was made on the condition that you come to terms with them, and it might lose patience if you unilaterally repudiate this agreement.

Thats just the thing, Britain and Holland made zero concessions, they rejected Iceland's initial repayment terms and we accepted their new terms outright with no argument.  That is why this petition garnered all this attention.

&gt;If the agreement isn't approved, I fear Iceland may be headed for sovereign default, currency collapse, and runaway inflation.

The initial fear was that we would not pay for Icesave at all, any terms of repayment are better than none, which certainly allows for some negotiation of terms.

There is a very good chance we will agree to the original terms we are now rebuking, after negotiations are through if it appears that we can make no headway, but the main thrust here is that is a bargaining process where it isn't simply assumed that Iceland accepts whatever terms are demanded.

No one is thinking of doing anything to make repayment fall through, because that would only cause more hardship, which is precisely what we are trying to avoid.

&gt;currency collapse, and runaway inflation.

These have already effectively happened.  The Krona will never be a totally viable currency again, and inflation has always been rampant  and at this stage will not be curtailed till we join the EU.

,,t5_2qh13,"&gt;UK did not even give us time to do anything, they used the law the day after the collapse.

The UK used the law because your banks were moving the cash out of the UK. If they had waited and not used the law like you say, they would have lost even the last little bit of the cash. It would also have been stolen. This was cash belonging to UK depositors, and your banks were stealing it right out of the country. Why? Your finance minister answered that question, when he told the UK that Iceland only had an obligation to honor insurance for Icelandic customers, not foreigners. Meaning Icelandic people who had the exact same Icesave account that you sold Britishers, would get paid, but not the British.

This is why the British invoked the law, because your bankers had already stolen most of the British money, and the last little bit that remained was being funneled out of England right under their eyes.

&gt; If people don't read the contract and sign, then that's their fault.

Are you stupid? These were **SAVINGS** accounts. They came with contracts saying ""this money is insured against bank failure"". They **did** read the contracts, that's why they deposited the money there in the first place. The problem isn't that the Brits didn't read the contracts, the problem is that the Icelanders broke the contracts.

&gt;We want to honor that deal, most icelandic people are pissed over the fact the taxpayer is paying for a private company, we should have given landsbankinn to the UK and let them sell all the assets to pay those savings.

But the Brits don't want your POS broken bank which owes more money than it has, they just want their own money back. They don't even want all their money, just a tiny fraction of it. They're not asking for the money which you guys stole from their investment accounts. That money was at least 10 times as much as this Icesave money, and Iceland could never pay it back in 100 years. That's considered investment money, and was not protected by insurance, and the Brits have already written it off.

They're not even asking for the full Icesave cash. They're asking only for the minimum insured amount, which was up to €20,000. So if someone had €100,000 in his savings account, he's only asking for €20,000 of it back.

&gt;Our idiot banks? What about all the other banks that failed? What about Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Lloyds? People probably lost a lot more money there even thought the UK government guaranteed €60,000.

No, the British government kept its promises. Their insurance system didn't break, YOURS did. The Brits paid back each of their investors up to €60,000 according to insurance rules, for every last one of their failed banks. You guys cheaped out and only insured for €20,000, but you don't even want to pay that back.

I didn't say you did. However, insisting that we respect beliefs that harm our society is not compatible with the spirit of protest. If you have been participating in protests while insisting upon respect, it would appear that you are experiencing some dissonance. 

&gt;I'm talking about not yelling at someone in a way that immediately gets me into a fucking fist-fight or ostracized by my family when calm discussion would do the same.

There won't be much calm discussion when people have no respect for *you* simply because you don't buy into religion. Religious folk who can withstand any kind of criticism of their beliefs are disappointingly rare, making such opportunities practically theoretical.

&gt;Nono, these are not 'in-of-itself' theories, these are people throwing their beliefs upon the world in a violent and oppressive manner which I will oppose whether it stems from religion or political ideology or philosophy. It's not religion that makes these things bad, it's the power and oppression which are not unique to religion.

Yeah, that is *exactly my point*. People in positions of power impose their beliefs on others by way of religious fiat. Religious fiat trumps all other fiats because of its arbitrary divinity. Therefore its fiat is unique.

&gt;Really? You should look into the secular history of Stalinist Russia. I'm not saying divine fiat helps, but it's not unique. It's equally as bad as any oppression, and nothing about 'religion' makes it any worse.

Religion most certainly makes it worse, because its fiat is completely arbitrary. The reasons why the Catholic Church objects to condoms is not in any way based on science or logical deduction based on observation of the natural world. It's an emotion-based argument grounded in the misbegotten virtue of faith and inserted into the minds of impressionable people by those who simply want more power for themselves.

Even Stalinist Russia did not go that far. For all of Stalin's terrible crimes, his motivations were based on a very simple fact: Russia's industry was lagging far behind that of Europe and was in desperate need of modernization in general. There is nothing illogical about the source of his motivation. He just carried out his mission with violence and paranoia.

By contrast, religion officially promotes ""good"" behavior on the basis of unsupportable logic (that my god is real and all the others are false, if you do this or that you burn for eternity, etc). But what is ""good""? To a Christian, volunteering at a soup kitchen and demonizing homosexuals may both be considered ""good.""

,,t5_2qh13,"&gt;&gt; Certainly Icesave claimed to foreign savers that deposits with them were guaranteed under the Icelandic compensation arrangement.

&gt; They didn't. .... [quotes wikipedia at me]

This is one of those rare topics on which I know a little more than wikipedia.  While events were unfolding, Icesave savers were repeatedly assured that their savings were covered by the Icelandic Deposit Guarantees and Investor-Compensation Scheme.  It was also repeatedly reported in the press that this was the case.

Here is what Icesave published on their website at http://www.icesave.co.uk/financial-protection.html in [July 2008](http://web.archive.org/web/20080728042454/www.icesave.co.uk/financial-protection.html)

    The maximum protection per account holder is 100% of the first £35,000 of savings that you hold with
    us (the same as every FSA regulated bank and building society in the UK). In the unlikely event of a
    claim, any compensation is payable within three months.
    
    The protection itself is provided by two schemes (sometimes referred to as a passport scheme) – the
    end result being that the total amount protected is the same as if your savings were only protected
    by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The protection works as follows:
    
    * The first level of protection is provided under the Icelandic Deposit Guarantees and
    Investor-Compensation Scheme. The maximum protection under this scheme is 100% of the first
    €20,887 (or the sterling equivalent) of savings that you hold with us.
    * The second level of protection is provided by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme
    (www.fscs.org.uk). This scheme tops-up your protection so that the protection per account holder, under 
    both schemes, is equal to 100% of the first £35,000 of savings that you hold with us.
    * Under EU law compensation for any losses incurred due to the failure of a bank should be paid
    within three months - regardless of whether it is through a passport scheme or the UK Financial
    Services Compensation Scheme.

(You can check that the top up arrangement was agreed with the UKs FSA [here](http://www.fscs.org.uk//consumer/making_a_claim/deposits/EEA_firms_that_have_topped_up/))

See also [here](http://www.lovemoney.com/news/manage-your-finances/is-saving-with-icelandic-banks-safe-2954.aspx) for third parties saying the same thing, and a quote from the MD of Icesave on the issue.

The Scheme was set up by the icelandic government with [Act No 98/1999](http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/laws-and-regulations/nr/1165) in order to put into effect broader EU regulations (see Article 21 for exactly which ones) intended to guarantee retail deposits.  Also see Article 13 about banks with foreign branches still being able to take part in the scheme (which is what icesave did).

Also, see the following quote in the wikipedia article you linked:
&gt; The result of the meeting was a letter on behalf of the Icelandic Minister for Business Affairs stating that ""[i]f needed the Icelandic Government will support the Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund in raising the necessary funds, so that the Fund would be able to meet the minimum compensation limits in the event of a failure of Landsbanki and its UK branch.""

It's quite clear to me that the Icelandic government gave a guarantee for those deposits, and that if it hadn't, icesave would have had many fewer investors.  Now they want to renege on that guarantee.  I can sympathise somewhat with that, given their situation (and that is their claim under EU law - that systemic failure allows them to duck out of their commitments), but lets not try to pretend that they never made the guarantee in the first place.",1426175997,t1_c0iailj,c0iailj,0,t3_alr4g,False,worldnews,kybernetikos,True,0,1262764516,,5,0,True,t1_c0i964q,5,

Personally, I don't mind chlorine chickens and GM crops.

But, as a European, I can guarantee you that if the government would allow chlorine chicken or GM foods, the leftists would organize rallys, supported by the **current** poultry and agri industry, and the ruling parties would suffer election defeats.
I say **current**, because when these types of laws are on the table, EU industries complain that it will hurt their global competitiveness (and it does). 

Only after the laws have passed (usually by giving the industries extra subsidies), do they invest to change their practices and support the law. The downside is that EU producers can not effectively compete on the global market, but they can compete in markets with similar legislation.

So it's not primarily protectionism, it's mostly that we have real democracy: European citizen consumers actually have the power to force their governments to pass consumer friendly legislation.

Also, it's pretty predictable. The issues in EU politics atm are animal suffering. Expect new legislation in the next decade like maximum animal density, painless killing and other rules that will increase production costs (and consumer prices) and reduce EU global competitiveness, but minimize animal suffering.

,,t5_2fwo,"&gt;I got a new boss recently, an outsider with no technical knowledge who got given godly powers, who own his own company, for which he pays developers in East Europe to do the web development he needs.

That seems to be the crux. He wants to bill your company for the work his company will do. I'd count that his higher-ups approved the plan, 'cause he can't do it something like that on a personal whim. From ""business"" sense, of course, price tag for a switch might be enormous. But if that problem is waived aside by higher-ups, it's a dead alley to explore.

You're saying that you're running *infrastructure* (albeit I guess that includes some development). Infrastructure is slightly less likely to be ran from East Europe. That's +1 for you.

Easy guess is also that you also feel much less comfortable with .NET/Windows. -1 for you.

So your problem is that your ground is being taken under you, which is tough. There are two paths IMO: start looking for another job, or join the .NET party. Given that you're in the company long(er), that should count. At any rate, it looks like you're on top of existing working stuff. If so, and if company relies on that stuff much, you're safe for enough time to find a place to jump to, or to get up to scratch with .NET.

,,t5_2qh1i,"Yes, it's a little known fact that Rudyard Kipling's ""Just So"" stories
are nothing much more than a summary of animal slaughter techniques
for primitive races across the world. Kipling travelled widely in his
youth and collected many of these pseudo-myths from his encounters
with primitive peoples.

Thus ""Sing song of Old Man Kangaroo"" refers to the australian
aborigines technique of persistence hunting marsupials. When the first
aborigines arrived in Australia, kangaroos were slow ungainly
creatures with four short legs, not unlike the Kipling
illustrations. Under evolutionary pressure from hunting they evolved
into the modern species.  Sadly, persistence hunting today is confined
to some of the Fukawi tribes in central africa, though it is being
resurrected by long distance runners in North America as a useful
adjunt in training for ultramarathons.

""The Elephants Child"" metaphorically recounts another african hunting
technique, notably waiting immersed in waterholes and rivers until a
memory of elephants arrived, then grabbing the submerged trunks and
nailing them to logs until the beast suffocated. The ""crocodile"" and
""bi-colored python rock snake"" were just symptomatic of other hazards
inherent in this strategy.

Inuit hunters would assemble together a bundle of driftwood with seal tendons
and jam it down the throat of baleen whales to choke them: the dead
cetacean would beach some days later and the dead carcass would
provide blubber and ambergris to feed a tribe for months afterwards.

In the middle east, whole stuffed camel was a delicacy and camels
could be captured at oases by placing a mirror at waters edge and
tempting for the beast to come and admire its reflection.

Back to Africa, rhinoceri could be tempted with packets of breadcrumbs
and leopards thoroughly confused by squid ink daubed on the yellow
Kalahari sands.

Europeans were generally above these things, though in hard times, cat
was a nourishing substitute for other forms of protein and it was
necessary to find ways of keeping cats close to the house so they
could be slaughtered for food when needed. ""The Cat that Walked by
Himself"" was a morality tale making the point that ones' children
could starve if one let felines do their own thing, rather than
consent to being fully domesticated like the sheep, dog and horse, all
of which were accepted food sources in times of need.

Australia's long-term target across the whole range of mid-term targets - 5-25% - is 60% by 2050. The difference is between a fast start or a fast finish. 

&gt; The way the scheme works it would be possible for companies to buy permits from overseas ...

Well, initially they couldn't purchase permits (allowances) from overseas because initially there won't be any linkages to any international schemes (e.g. EU-ETS). They can purchase offset-credits, under the CDM mechanism, but in theory there is still a tonne of emissions sequestered or avoided so the benefit is still there. I don't really think that's a whole.

&gt; ... [companies could] import their products/materials from overseas increasing the trade deficit and throwing away jobs.

The only way to deal with this is put tariffs in place. This is something the US is considering in their scheme.

Enphase has got a good product and even better monitoring, however, they are not cost competitive beyond 3kW system. And they know that...  So I hear all kind of rumors flying about them.

It will be hard to have a different business model then Enphase, so most startups will struggle or will need to learn to live with low volumes (and that's not going to work either).

,,t5_2qh13,"I don't know anything about EU's crossborder banking legislation but this case looks typical. There are two basic ways in which banks can expand retail operations across borders: by opening branches of the mother company abroad or founding a separate company with its own capital, management, etc. Looks like EU favours the first approach, so while Icelandic banks in the UK operate within that country's jurisdiction they belong to respective companies in Iceland, and that means that they don't have any assets or liabilities or capital of their own - they are just a bunch of offices.

The sane way to do this is the second one, since if a foreign bank operating in your country is actually a legally separate company then the only foreign things about it are the brand name, some staff, and easier access to foreign financing. In all other respects it's no different from any of your domestic banks, and should it implode what you expect to happen happens. It has assets, liabilities, and capital which can be inspected, regulated, arrested. It has to play by the same rules every other bank in the country plays with respect to deposit insurance, foreign currency regime, crossborder operations, and so on. 

So the real lesson that needs to be learned here is that this situation was caused not by reckless speculation, bankster greed or whatever else - it was caused by the push to deregulate crossborder banking, of which the UK was one of the most eager participants.

A country bears responsibility for the government-approved, government-permitted actions of its people. The US faces the same problem.

The US is saying ""supporting these failed banks is ruining us, we should either not let them grow so big that they ruin us, or we should regulate them better so they don't do such stupid things ever again"".

Nor did the insurance fail in the US. Even if their banks have failed, none of the people with insured savings accounts got cheated - they were paid their insurance money. Only investors lost money.

But in Iceland, not only did investors lose (nobody cares about them anyway), but also savers/depositors, who were supposed to be protected by law. Your **laws** failed.

Don't forget, this Icesave debacle is only a tiny part of Iceland's collapse. Icelandic banks actually stole anywhere from 10 to 15 times that much money, if you count the *investment* accounts. Many of these accounts were held by large pension funds in England and Holland, and as a result of the loss, many old people in England and Holland will live in poverty in their old ages.

But no one is even bothering about that right now. No one is asking Iceland to pay any of those losses, which like I said, are many, many times bigger than Icesave.

All that people are asking for is that Iceland pay the minimum insured amount, **only** on savings accounts held by individuals, which are supposed to be protected by law.

And this is what Iceland doesn't seem to want to pay. So let's not confuse the issue with investment losses or local governments and stuff. That is all money gone forever, away from the people who earned it, into the pockets of Icelandic bankers. It's a total loss. Gone.

That would mean people having access to tanks, bombers, non-detectable submarines, bio-chemical weapons, and worst of all, nuclear weapons. In such a situation, one crazy person, or even simpler, one stupid accident, and you destroy a sizable part of the population (of a city, country, or world, depending on what you use).

So, you're saying that some crazy guy's gonna be able to buy a 6 billion dollar bomber/tank/sub/nuke/whatever and then decide to blow up a bunch of people for shits and giggles?  That's a bond villain, not a real life scenario.  Of course, anyone who does decide to kill a ton of people for fun and wants to use a tank to do it... joins the military and uses government weapons.  Not a huge improvement, and not exactly supportive of your argument.

&gt;The weapons that were available at the time (I'll guess basic rifles and rudimentary explosives, but correct me if I am wrong) did not have the lethality that today's weapons do, and could therefore, without too much concern, be handled by mostly anybody. Even with guns of course you have the possibility of a crazy person shooting randomly in malls or simply of an ND, but it's limited to at most 30 people.

Not really correct.  You know what grapeshot is?  The 18th and early 19th century's answer to shrapnel.  And it was pretty easy to use - think of it as pretty much a cannon turned into a really big shotgun.  TNT and ""plastic explosives"" were also invented in the late 1800's, FWIW.

The capacity was definitely there for some crazy nut to kill thousands of people with a single act of mass murder.  But, of course, it didn't happen for the same reason it doesn't happen today  - anyone who can afford to buy the (very expensive) tools to mass murder thousands of people won't, because it costs lots of money and gains nothing.  (Ignoring, of course, the ""state sanctioned"" act of mass murder which we call ""war,"" which they afford by taking taxes and spending *our* money for *their* causes.)

&gt;Furthermore, the strength of the different agencies that are part of the American government do not only lie in the type of weapons they have but also, very importantly, in the training and organization they have. It is extremely unlikely that you and some of your fellow citizen will be well-trained and enough to resist the CIA for any sizable amount of time. It just delays and potentially limits the potential for abuse.

Please.  If a bunch of untrained Iraqis and Afghans can do it, I'm sure I could whip a bunch of Americans into an effective guerrilla fighting force.  And, on that note, the Afghans and Iraqis who've been (effectively) fighting off American forces do so with homemade bombs, automatic small arms and some RGPs and grenades.  So, no, it's not necessary to allow everyone to own a tank to oppose and/or threaten government power.  But it does require more than ownership of semi-automatic handguns.

&gt;Last but not least, even though we have never used (because, mostly, it has never been possible since the 18th century) revolt to control our government

That's just dead wrong.  Revolts (and the threat of revolts) were used frequently against government power up until about the time of Prohibition (when government effectively outlawed private ownership of automatic firearms, in response to alcohol smugglers outgunning police forces).  In fact, the source of that famous Jefferson quote about the tree of liberty (must be watered from time to time with to blood of patriots and tyrants...) was his response when questioned about a taxation revolt by a bunch of colonial farmers, after the Revolutionary War and creation of the American government.

Seriously, just for fun, type in ""Whiskey revolt"" into Google and see how many different revolts there were against punitive whiskey taxes in America.  (There's the famous ""Whiskey Rebellion,"" but there are dozens of others as well.)

&gt;I think we can safely argue that it has been checked and balanced pretty effectively.

I'd ask what world you live in, but instead, I'm just going to assume you've never had to go through the court system any time recently.  Or for that matter, paid taxes.  Sorry, but you can't slice forcibly taking 40% of my money any other way than ""tyranny.""

&gt;Of course there are scandals, and abuse, but we've done OK enough over the past 2 centuries to be, until recently, the nation the most associated with Freedom.

And you're obviously an American.  Yippie.  You guys may think that, but it's not been the prevailing world view for decades... since the Vietnam-era and the War on Drugs, which spreads corruption, oppression, crime and terrorism to all corners of the Earth.  Oh, and just FWIW, when the Americans send in special ops teams and CIA operatives to overthrow democratically elected governments, it's pretty predictable as to what those people associate with America.  (Hint: not ""Freedom."")

&gt;I'd also like to add that European countries, even though they have way thougher gun control laws, seem to me still very liberal (even though once again there are exceptions) while other countries where guns are easily obtainable are corrupt as fuck (I'm thinking of Afghanistan at the moment, but it probably applies to most African countries).

On a related note, those countries are all impoverished and lacking in any stable national-level cohesive forces (such as government, shared culture/ethnicity and so on).  Probably has more to do with their current state than unrestricted gun ownership.  Even in Europe, draconian gun bans are relatively recent (last 30-40 years), yet somehow, they weren't ravaged by civil war and violence before the gun bans came into law.

,,t5_2qh13,"&gt;The UK and Dutch governments did nothing to prevent the IceSave accounts, the responsibility is not only ours.

I don't know now if you are trolling, or if you just don't have the information. However, I will assume that you are sincere, and not just throwing out nonsense for the heck of it.

The UK and Dutch governments did ""nothing"" because they had no power to do anything. These Icelandic banks were under the jurisdiction of the Icelandic government, not under the jurisdiction of the British or Dutch. It would have been **illegal** for either Britain or Holland to try to police Icelandic banks.

All that the Brits or Dutch could do is to tell them ""here is a list of EU regulations, you must agree to them and follow them if you operate in this country"". This they did. It was exactly such EU regulation (European Union Directive 94/19/EC) which required these banks to offer deposit insurance for savings accounts. And not only did the Icelandic banks agree (which would not have been enough for either Britain or Holland), Iceland's government *agreed to enforce the EU directive by enshrining it into Icelandic law*. This is how Iceland's deposit insurance scheme was created, by an act of Icelandic Parliament (Act No. 98/1999), in order to comply with EU law.

So it was not simply that the Icelandic banks agreed to EU directives, it was the fact that Icelandic government took responsibility for enforcing EU directives on its own banks, under newly created Icelandic law, that was key in Britain's decision to allow Icelandic banks to operate on its territory. Britain and Holland didn't trust your banks, they trusted *your government* to enforce EU laws on your banks while they operated in EU territory.

This is a crucial thing you need to understand. Britain and Holland wanted Icelandic banks to comply with EU law while they operated in EU territory. But Britain and Holland have **no power to enforce compliance**, because these were Icelandic banks, not British banks. The only country with the power to force compliance is Iceland. So Britain and Holland and the EU put the condition on the Icelandic government. The Icelandic government has no power to enforce compliance either, *unless it creates a law*. This the Icelandic government did, by passing Act No. 98/1999 in their parliament. As a result of this new law, Icelandic government gained the power to tell its banks to comply with EU regulations, and to *enforce compliance*. No one else had this power. If Britain or Holland had tried to do it, Iceland would have taken them to the UN, and sued them for breach of national sovereignty.

All that Britain and Holland could do was to tell Icelandic government to make sure that their banks followed EU law. They could not meddle directly with the banks, that would have been illegal. And they did tell Iceland's government to follow EU law, which Iceland's government promised to do, when they signed 94/19/EC.

It was then Iceland's government that failed to police its banks, after promising Britain, Holland, and the EU, that they would do so.",1426176273,t1_c0ib3us,c0ib3us,0,t3_alr4g,False,worldnews,DaveM191,True,0,1262797869,,4,0,True,t1_c0ib1cp,4,

&gt; These Icesave accounts were savings accounts, not investment accounts (hence the word ""save"" in Icesave). The people opening such accounts are called ""savers"" not ""investors"". Calling them ""investors"" is deceitful, because you are misrepresenting the situation.

&gt; The difference is important because savings accounts are insured by law for a certain amount, in every civilized country in the world. This is called ""deposit insurance"". Investment accounts are not insured. When a person puts his money in a savings account, he does so with the knowledge that his money is insured (up to a certain amount) against bank failures.

&gt; Icelandic banks operating in England and Holland were required both by European law (European Union directive 94/19/EC) and Icelandic law (Act No. 98/1999) to provide such insurance to depositors. The minimum insurance required by law is €20,000 per account, which is what these Icelandic banks offered (although British banks offer €60,000 per account and Dutch banks offer €100,000 per account insurance).

&gt; When the banking crisis hit, the Icelandic banks realized they didn't have enough money in their insurance scheme to even pay the €20,000 minimum required by their own law and by European law. Instead of revealing these lack of funds, what they did was:

&gt;   1. to start moving whatever cash was left in their foreign branches back into Iceland

&gt;   2. modifying their rules so they would pay deposit insurance for Icelanders who had made deposits in bank branches in Iceland, but not pay deposit insurance to foreigners who had made deposits under exactly the same Icesave type accounts in bank branches in England and Holland.

&gt; If this hasn't sunk in, I suggest you re-read the two points above again. And again. And understand what this means. It means that the banks said they would pay the €20,000 for Icesave accounts held by Icelandic people in Iceland, but NOT for Brits or Dutch people who held exactly the same Icesave accounts in Icelandic banks in England and Holland.

&gt; Further, since they realized what an enormous squawk this would raise from the Brits and Dutch who got cheated, they quietly started moving cash out of their branches abroad, back into Iceland.

&gt; The movement of such large amounts of cash obviously can't be kept secret for long. The Brits found out and confronted Iceland. There is a very famous phone call between the British Chancellor Alistair Darling, and the Icelandic Finance Minister Árni Mathiesen, in which Mathiesen declared that Icelandic banks were obliged to pay back deposits for Icelanders, but not for foreigners. You can probably find transcripts of that phone call at dozens of web sites if you google for it.

&gt; This was the last straw. When England and Holland realized that not only did Iceland have no intention of honoring its deposit insurance, which it was required to do both by European and Icelandic law, BUT ALSO was secretly moving funds back to Iceland, from its branches in England and Holland, THEN, they reacted.

&gt; Instead of waiting to pass new laws to prevent this transfer of money (by which time the money would already be out of the country and gone forever), England took the unusual step of using an existing law, an emergency anti-terrorism law, to halt the transfer of funds. This was a law used ONLY because there was no other way to immediately freeze the transfer of funds, and if they had waited, they would have been too late. But a lot of Icelandic people were very upset and there were outraged demonstrations in Iceland with people saying ""look, do I look like a terrorist? I'm white, not brown, I'm not Al-Qaida!"". People went to town, dressed up in fatigues, holding mock weapons and getting their pictures taken. It was all great fun, like ""haha, look, the brits think we're terrorists, what a joke!"".

&gt; But I don't think the Brits considered them terrorists at all, they simply used the only law they had available to them at the time, to prevent the Icelandic banks from stealing more money from them.

&gt; The path to finding a solution, since then, has been tough. The situation is this. In both England and Holland, a lot of ordinary people got burned. Again, these were NOT investors, they were savers. Crucial difference. These people are telling their governments to do something. The government can't ignore them, too many people are involved. So the Brit and Dutch governments got together with the Icelanders, and tried to work out a solution. The solution was this: the Brits would lend the Icelanders sufficient money to repay the deposit insurance, and the Icelanders could then repay the loan over a long period. The Dutch agreed to do the same, for the Dutch people.

&gt; Initially, Iceland rebuffed this. Their thinking was that they could get better loan terms from the IMF (International Monetary Fund). However, since both England and Holland have some clout with the IMF, not to mention a bunch of other European countries that had lost smaller amounts of money but were still pissed off with the Icelanders, it became clear that the IMF would loan no cash to Iceland until this matter was resolved. In fact, all 27 EU member states said that Iceland needed to sort out this mess before the IMF would make any loans. This is not because 27 different EU countries all hate Iceland for some reason, it's because the situation was clear enough from a point of law that this ought to be the recommended course.

&gt; So Iceland was forced back to the bargaining table. This time, they came to an agreement with both England and Holland. As a consequence of the agreement, the Dutch have already started paying out the deposit insurances, and the Brits were about to follow. But there is more drama ahead.

&gt; Although the Icelandic government had agreed to the deal, it hadn't actually passed their parliament. The vote in parliament finally happened on August 28, 2009, and the bill passed, BUT parliament tacked on some extra provisions that weren't part of what they had previously agreed to, with England and Holland. Specifically, the provisions were that the repayments would never exceed yearly payment amounts higher than 4% of the GDP to England, and 2% of the GDP to Holland. Further, if as a consequence of these reduced payments, they failed to repay the loan in 20-something years, the rest of the loan would be forgiven.

&gt; If you do the math based on Iceland's pre-fake-boom GDP, you can see that under these terms they would only repay a fraction of the loan. Naturally, both England and Holland rebelled, and pointed out that this was not what they had agreed to. Until lately, this was the situation, with both England and Holland threatening that they would block the IMF loans again (Iceland has also been separately applying for IMF loans during this time).

&gt; Finally, Iceland again voted on it again in parliament, and in December last year, they again approved the bill. But there were massive protests, with Icelandic people calling for a referendum. So a couple weeks later, the Icelandic President vetoed the bill again (today).

&gt; So that's where we are at present. I dunno what's going to happen. I expect partisans from both sides will distort the situation as they see fit. But please don't get taken in by too many lies. Remember:

&gt;   1. these were SAVINGS accounts, not investment accounts

&gt;   2. the SAVINGS accounts were insured for €20,000 each under both Icelandic and European law

&gt;   3. when the crash came, Iceland found there wasn't enough insurance money to pay everyone

&gt;   4. Iceland then said it would pay only depositors who had accounts in the branches in Iceland, but not abroad, for the SAME type of account

&gt;   5. Iceland started to move cash from England and Holland into Iceland

&gt;   6. THEN the Brits got annoyed and put a stop to it, and yes, they used an antiterrorism law to do so

&gt;   7. NOBODY has asked that Iceland pay any more than the €20,000 per account, plus interest. Interest is standard in banking, it is stupid to see bankers getting outraged over ""oh, they want us to pay interest!""

&gt;   8. Iceland has said yes and no to repaying several times, changing its mind at least 3 times over this. Further, what they voted on in parliament was not what they had agreed to privately with England and Holland.

&gt; I dunno how this will work out. I have sympathy for the Icelandic people, not all of whom were responsible for the excesses of their countrymen. I also feel that the country was poorly governed, and I find it hard to understand why the public failed to ask some hard questions when these puny banks had already leveraged themselves to 5x the whole country's GDP. Why did they not ask questions when foreigners, including Americans, Dutch and Britishers went to Iceland many times and publicly warned them that their economy was going to crash, that such financial gimmicks could not continue. This was widely reported in the Icelandic press, so it's not like no one knew. Why did they not then question their own Prime Minister, and other politicians, who were simultaneously giving speeches, saying ""oh, we Icelanders are financial geniuses, it has to do with our heritage and national temperament"". Surely someone could have said ""hey, wait a minute, where did this expertise suddenly come from, a few years ago we were selling fish"". It's a shame, and there is much blame and hurt to go around.

I know the point you trying to point out.  The problem is there is a lot of cultural male dominance baggage attached to many Muslim countries laws.

Like they forget after the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, the top scholar of Islam and the most elite was a woman, his wife, Aishah, may God be pleased with her.  Nowadays, women aren't really treated with the same respect they were treated during the time of the Prophet peace be upon him.

For example, in order to punish someone for committing adultery, there has to be 4 witnesses.  That's extremely hard.  The other evidence would be admitting to it or the pregnancy of an unmarried woman.  Kinda hard if the woman is married and pregnant back then.  I guess nowadays you can use DNA.

The point I'm making is that in all the cases during the time of the Prophet (saas) there was conclusive and solid evidence.  Nowadays that is thrown out and if some high ranking official or some family member connected to the regime says person x committed adultery, that's all they need.

Being that I have family in Saudi Arabia, I know that this country is more about family honor than following the laws of Islam.  If the family doesn't like you and they have connections with the government or worse if you piss of the Saudi Royal family they'll get you no matter what.  They'll pin some fake crime and you'll be punished in the name of Islam.  Or worse they'll punish your family (children, parents, spouse etc.).

If you ask any Muslim scholar even in Saudi or any country if the Sharia is correctly and implemented in any country, they will all say no.

I personally believe the ""perfect Islamic state"" ended over a 1,000 years ago with the death of the 4th Caliph Ali, may God be pleased with him.  After that it was family monarchies and dynasties.  After WW1, Europe chopped up the Muslim world and pretty much the entire world except Europe and that was the end of that.

Every Muslim country today is run by a dictator (or group of dictators) or family.

Lastly, America is more Islamic than Muslim countries meaning you can be a better Muslim in America than in many parts of the world.

Proud to live in America for that.  Thank you Constitution!

,,t5_2qh1i,"The real answer is that there are two ways to divide europe - politically (Western Europe and Eastern Europe) and strictly geographically (where you have Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, a smaller Western Europe, and possibly other divisions depending on how specific you wish to be). The political division (note that there has historically also been a divide between the Slavic cultures in the Eastern half of Europe and the Germanic and Latin cultures in the Western part; Russia's dreams of Slavic unity were very important in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, not all politically Eastern European countries and cultures are Slavic: one example of this is Hungary) has its origins in the Cold War. The fact that the typical division of Europe into a Western part and an Eastern part is political, and not geographical, is obvious if you look at Greece, for example, which is located to the east of many ""Eastern European"" countries but was considered part of Western Europe during the cold war. Geographically, Greece is, of course, part of Southern Europe.

However, the political division is still highly relevant due to the extant economic dispirities between the part of Europe that was formerly dominated by the Soviet Union and the wealthy US-dominated part of Europe. Few countries in the political Eastern Europe are wealthier than any in Western Europe (Slovenia and the Czech Republic have higher GDPs per capita than Portugal, but I can't think of any other cases). For that reason it is still common and indeed very useful even today to divide Europe using the old political division, which is not based on geography. Strictly, however, if one is talking about geography, Eastern Europe only encompasses the Baltic states (although Estonia does, probably mainly for PR reasons, often consider itself as one of the Nordic countries), Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, Romania, and possibly Bulgaria and Serbia (most of which happen to still be under Russian influence, whether voluntary or involuntary).",1426176354,t1_c0iba0e,c0iba0e,0,t3_am7ww,False,AskReddit,Aqwis,False,0,1262803137,,1,0,True,t1_c0iato6,1,

,,t5_2cneq,"I'm a lawyer and work for a large corp.  I am not in favor of government ""taking over"" anything, but I am in favor of government being able to engage in business activities for the purpose of providing a public good.  For example, health care.  Government of course should not go seize insurance companies or hospitals, but if government opens a competing hospital or insurance plan, great.  If government is truly so inefficient, the for-profit businesses should have nothing to worry about, right?  Also keep in mind that anything government spends money on finds its way into the hands of private businesses, so really, ""government waste"" is completely synonymous with ""exploitation by business"".  All the tax money winds up with private contractors in one way or another.  

Now there is of course never any easy answer or blanket generality that you can combine this all in to, but I think you will agree that the whole point of a for-profit business is to provide the least amount of service for the highest possible price.  In fact, a business that was giving more to their customers than needed to maximize profits with shareholders would probably endure a complete shitstorm for it.  Consider the case of a North Carolina town that tried to put in municipal fiber optic internet:

http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?art_aid=105468&amp;fa=Articles.showArticle

This fiber optic system ran circles around what the cable company wanted to offer, at a lower price.  Consumers got a great public service, but they were sued and shut down so the cable company could keep their margins wide.  Seizing private property isn't right, but neither is preventing a city government, which is essentially nothing more than an amalgam of the public will, from providing a great service to itself.  Why must there be someone making monstrous profits off every service?

So no, I would not be in favor of my company being seized, I am not in favor of any company being seized.  Its funny that you mention this though, because the government already provides a competing service to my industry (legal publishing), but we do just fine.  

&gt;They're not mutually exclusive. 

I totally agree.

,,t5_6,"I don't think that this video is racist, given the context, but I do find the comments made by some of the non-Americans here to be incredibly naïve. They can be categorized as follows:

* We're not racist, because, unlike Americans, we don't see color.

The whole ""we don't see color"" feel-good, liberal white reaction to accusations of racism has been thoroughly debunked over the past few decades by cultural observers. You don't see color, because you don't have to. You're not confronted with your ""whiteness"" on a daily basis, because 90% of your society (Australia) is white. So, this leads you to believe that people, in fact, don't perceive racial distinctions, or are ""above"" them. But the fact of the matter -- and anybody who has ever been in a distinct racial minority will tell you this, whether it's a black person in Australia or a white person in, say, Kenya -- is that your racial distinction makes you stand out, and people *do* treat you differently. They might not lynch you, and it might be ""harmless,"" but it is awkward, uncomfortable, and can often lead to prejudice.

* We're not racist, because, unlike Americans, we have a sense of humor and can laugh about our differences.

OK. Sure. Easy for you to say, since you're doing all the laughing. Imagine that you're Jewish, and that you happen to be at a party. Somebody makes an overtly anti-Semitic joke -- along the lines of ""isn't it funny that Jews have big noses and are greedy, rat-like people?"" -- and, much to your surprise, everybody starts having a jovial laugh about it. What are you going to do? Are you going to stand up and tell everybody to stop laughing and explain to them how the joke made you feel? Considering that your society's attitude seems to be that anybody who doesn't find such an offensive joke hilarious is overly-PC, stuck up, uptight, or just a plain, old pansy without the balls to take a good ribbing, I doubt that that would happen. When people are in minorities, they're in no position to challenge popular assumptions without drawing serious, and often negative, attention to themselves. Of course, you wouldn't understand this, because you're in the 90% white population of your country.

(The fact of the matter is that the U.S. is the only developed country with largely European values *that is actually a multi-ethnic society in which whites may be a majority, but are not an overwhelming majority*. People from places like Europe, Australia, and New Zealand like to point at the U.S. and *tsk*, *tsk* about all of the ""racism"" that occurs here, but the fact of the matter is that only Americans, thus far, have actually been *honest* about the kinds of tensions that exist in their society and, for the most part, have already struggled with a lot of the issues that are *only now* beginning to face these other countries do to the influx of immigration. You like to say that we take ourselves too seriously or that we're the cause of our own problems (I suppose, by your logic, by actually recognizing that they do exist), but when I hear an Australian say that Americans are ""uptight"" or that they ""can't take a good joke"" when it comes to racism, I only see a very naïve person with very little understanding of what it means to be in a modern, multi-ethnic society, and who also has very little understanding of U.S. (or even European) history.)",1426176512,t1_c0ibm9j,c0ibm9j,0,t3_am7qf,False,reddit.com,[deleted],True,0,1262813215,,0,0,True,t3_am7qf,0,
,,t5_2qh1i,"As i entered my dormatory on my travels about halfway up the Australian East Coast, I had already been plenty of places, seen lots of countries and spoken to a lot of people. My travels in America hadn't really confirmed the predujice of insane lack of geographic knowledge, in fact, most people had heard of my home country of Denmark, and except for the chubby girl in South Dakota who was convinced it was located in Africa, people seemed to have a pretty good idea that it was in Scandinavia. I actually came to the conclusion for my self, that Americans was not the slightest bit more ignorant on European geography than Europeans are on American national geography. In Australia so far, people had generally been way more un-knowing, and a girl in this dormatory would turn out to be the reason that I in Australia would state my home as ""Scandinavia"" or ""Europe"" instead of my small home country. 

As other backpackers will know, there comes to be a certain buildup of relation with new people you meet along the way, and it often goes by the same procedure of question-asking ""So where are you from, what do you do, where have you been, where are you going"" and so on. The girl in question was the only one in the dorm at the time, so I naturally started this standard conversation with her and asked her the standard questions. It turned out that she was born in the small town of ""Denmark"" on the Australian west coast. That was a bit of a curiosity I thought.
""What a coincidence,"" I said, ""I am from Denmark in Europe!""
She seemed to find amusement in this curiosity as well, even though a distant insecurity in her eyes revealed that she might not know excactly where that was. There was a short pause in the conversation, and she broke the silence ""Denmark in Europe, that is a part of Amsterdam, isn't it?"". Pretty hard fail. You just failed 2nd grade, kangaroo-cruncher. Knowing that Europe IS pretty far away from AU, I gave her some slack and corrected her, telling that Denmark was a country in Scandinavia. ""WHAT? I thought Scandinavia was in Europe?"" she said looking suspicious. ""... yeah??"" I said. ""But Amsterdam is the capital of Europe, so how can Denmark also be a country with a capital if it's in Europe?"". I looked to be sure if she wasn't kidding. She wasn't. I realized this was gonna be uphill, but I didnt quite give up yet. I told her (to her obvious great disbelief) that Europe consisted of several countries. She refused to believe me at first, but kinna hesitently accepted in the end. 
I didn't really feel like speaking to her anymore at this point as we would probably end up disagreeing about some fact (like whether the sky is blue or not) so I started unpacking my backpack. She did however speak to me again:
""So, what currency do you use in the country of Denmark?"" she said. Being a polite person, I answered.
""We use the currency kroner, and it takes 5kr to buy one AU dollar""
She looked really surprised and bursts out:
""You pay 5 just for 1 dollar? Wow, then it must be really expensive for you to be here!""

,,t5_2qh1s,"&gt; If central banks sees that government is having too loose fiscal policy that would increase inflation, it will increase interest rates and kill government efforts.

If central banking were totally cut off from government, then the government can't possibly cause inflation because the government is not the creator of new money.  The central bank would be the creator of new money, and thus the sole originator of inflation and its symptom of rising prices.  

""Loose fiscal policy"" is not inflationary.  It simply transfers aggregate spending from one trajectory (the market) onto another trajectory (the government's).  In order for the government to spend anything, that money has to exist.  If the central bank is practicing a hypothetical zero inflation rate, i.e. the economic system has a fixed aggregate demand in dollars, then the government can't *increase* aggregate demand every year, no matter how much it spent.  All it can do is change total aggregate spending from what it would have been in the market, with its own combination of savings and investment versus consumption, to another, government influenced combination of savings and investment versus consumption.  Aggregate demand has not increased, therefore there is nothing to bid up prices from one period to the next.

You made a very common mistake that people make when it comes to inflation, because you treat inflation not as its original definition, namely an increase in the quantity of money and volume of spending, but rather you treat inflation as merely one symptom of actual inflation, which is its rise in prices; and not just prices in general, but consumer prices specifically, and, for some people, just a subset of consumer prices.

The confusion rests on a flawed understanding of money and prices.  Governments can, by their deficits, drain funds away from the market, its savings pool, which would have gone to the demand for capital goods and labor, and instead goes to the consumption of government employees and those the government gives the money to.  This will decrease the demand for capital goods and labor (and consumer goods) from the market, and increase the demand for consumer goods and services due to the government.  This will make consumer prices rise of course, and it is here that the mistake is made that the government's deficits must be inflationary.  But the rise in consumer prices that government deficits cause is counter-balanced by a fall in the demand for capital goods and (productive) labor.

Therefore there is no aggregate increase in prices.  There is a fall in some prices, and a rise in other prices.

&gt;This is why many European governments (especially France) are constantly pissed off to ECB. ECB won't allow governments to inflate money for temporary political gain.

Ouch.  This is yet another fallacious idea that is a consequence of not understanding how inflation works.  The ECB led banking system is the only entity that can create new and additional money in the economy.  The various European governments do not have this ability.  Therefore only the ECB banking system is capable of increasing the supply of money and hence aggregate demand.  The governments can't inflate the money supply.  They don't control the printing presses.

As long as inflation is misunderstood like this poster's statements show, then it is very difficult for people to know how to fix the problems that inflation creates, because rising prices is just one of many problems.",1426176583,t1_c0ibrta,c0ibrta,0,t3_amb6n,False,Economics,[deleted],False,0,1262817540,,8,0,True,t1_c0ibo86,8,

,,t5_2cneq,"&gt;If government is truly so inefficient, the for-profit businesses should have nothing to worry about, right? 

They should worry. Consider government-run schools. A government-run school will not cease to exist regardless of how poorly it performs. In fact, there is a perverse disincentive in that a public school which is doing poorly will likely be rewarded with a bigger budget next year. It isn't competition if you can't lose, so yes, for-profit businesses are made worse off as are consumers (since they are being forced to pay for the socialist enterprise via taxation).

&gt;but I think you will agree that the whole point of a for-profit business is to provide the least amount of service for the highest possible price.

I do agree. But you are leaving something very important out - that the whole point of being a consumer is finding the maximum amount of service (or the highest quality good) for the lowest possible price. Since all transactions in a market are voluntary, consumers have just as much power as producers. 

For example, the price of computers keeps going down and the quality keeps going up, because the market in them is relatively free. Computers manufacturers are just as self-interested, just as greedy, as any other businessmen.   

&gt;I totally agree. But I also think that the sweet spot is definitely somewhere to the left of totally unregulated pure free market capitalism for everything, and most definitely to the right of a pure Marxist society. I think the social democracies in Europe (norway, sweden, etc) have pretty much hit the nail on the head.

The Reign of Terror (June, 1793 – July 27, 1794), also known as the The Terror (French: la Terreur) was a period of violence that occurred for one year and two months after the onset of the French Revolution, incited by conflict between rival political factions, the Girondins and the Jacobins, and marked by mass executions of ""enemies of the revolution."" Estimates vary widely as to how many were killed, with numbers ranging from 16,000 to 40,000; in many cases, records were not kept, or if they were, they are considered likely to be inaccurate. The guillotine (""National Razor"") became the symbol of a string of executions: Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, the Girondins, Louis Philippe II and Madame Roland, as well as many others, such as ""the father of modern chemistry"" Antoine Lavoisier, lost their lives under its blade.

Afghanistan is a construct of the British in the 19th century to describe the area they were battling it out over with Russia so that they can keep the back entrance to Indian products protected and in their possession. Afghanistan is a western concept, from western minds, about the people within the drawn lines of Pakistan and Iran.

The 'country' of Afghanistan are lines on a map. Nothing more. There is no cohesion of the Afghanistan state. There is no unity across that country, outside of some academics in their ivory towers in Kabul.

The ethno-tribal divisions are where you can see the actual politics and understand how the region functions. If I could redraw the map of Afghanistan I would replace Afghanistan with separate areas, with the Pashtuns with the Taliban in the south and the Tajiks/etc under their warlords up in the north. Those are the divisions in that region and that is why it's preferable to understand the region as a set of different tribal alliances than of European, Westphalian states.

And those divisions where we can articulate fully the reality of the area should be how we describe the what and the who in that region. To do anything else is cheating ourselves of understanding the region.

Calling Afghanistan a state because it's called a state is a non sequitur, by the way. A state is a state if it has political cohesion, defined borders, and [other things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state). Afghanistan does not possess this. The non sequitur comes in when you ascribe a classification to something that doesn't possess that classification's traits that are needed in order to call it a country.

The difference between maintaining a worldview which includes the existence of the supernatural and accepting that there there is no supernatural aspect of reality is much, much larger than going from a believing in 1 to believing in N deities.

It's trivial to dismiss any one specific god, but I think people get hung up clinging to the feeling that there must be ""something bigger out there."" In European-originating cultures, that lingering ""something"" defaults onto the particular system that has infiltrated the culture, christianity. I suspect that many of the average, moderate religious people come into their beliefs via this sort of thing. 

In dealing with believers, we have to argue not just that its founder/story is false but that there are no deities in the universe simultaneously. Both these points are the same single thing to a believer, many of which, I suspect, have not realized this subtle duality in their beliefs. I certainly never did. Hence they can retreat to the feeling that there's something out there, which reinforces the existence of their religion.

I think that if prostitution was legalized as a profession (as it is in some European nations) prostitutes would have the ability to be trained in STD's and protection, health risks and how to address them, safety, and rules of engagement, as well as licensing would be handed out from the state under workers rights and unions could form to represent the prostitutes against the ""johns"". I think it would clean up the surrounding crime associated with prostitution and elevate it out of the gutter to give these people the common decency we all enjoy (or that currently only ""escorts"" enjoy). It would begin to eliminate the stigma of sex as ""dirty"" and women as the purveyor of dirty acts.

And also, don't think prostitution is a men on women gender thing. There are male prostitutes out there and women who hire them. The door swings both ways and I feel a lot of generalized repression could be eliminated through legalizing it.

However, in countries such as India where the regulation wouldn't exist and rights wouldn't exist, I don't see that being a good thing as choice would still not enter into the equation for these women.

,,t5_2qh1s,"The inflation tax remark was actually not directed towards you, but a post a bit further up the thread. 

I think cutting costs in government are a lot easier in principle than in practice. And although your defense spendings are monumental and pointless, cutting them quickly is not easily done in practice, this is a problem Soviet/Russia also has experienced. It's very problematic to cut back on military spending rapidly, even though it's a pure waste of money. Because it is not a very strategic move to put people trained in military settings straight out to unemployment, as they very easily will turn to crime (because most of them can't really do anything else than fight) - and you end up with crime rates rising rapidly, and the criminals actually being top trained weapons and strategy experts. This is a huge problem in ex-Yugoslavian countries, were now the mafia there consists almost solely of ex-military people; much more dangerous than ""normal"" criminals.

And then there's all the services the government provide which are very hard to cut in as well, chief among which are school and health services (both of which the market consistently has been shown to treat poorly, because there will never be any real form of competition, mainly because of economies of scale).

And the debt is monumental, so there's very little room for getting around tax increases. In my view, there's no room around it at all. It's at least better than accumulating more debt.

As I'm a pragmatist and not an idealist, I can't really see where the criticism of the european mindset comes from. I'm from Norway, in scandinavia, and we've managed to build a very strong economy with very high tax rates. It works well here, and we have a good private sector as well. Although we are abundant in natural resources, sweden and denmark are not, and they run pretty much the same system of governance. And on most ratings, we come off as economically better off than the U.S. People here have more purchasing power. But if you don't want to discuss empiric measures, and instead focus on abstract ideals like how free markets are here and there, you are probably more well off than we.

But we're still richer than you. We even have a surplus on our federal budget. A huge one actually. If you dislike it, that's fine, but seriously just dismissing high taxes by principle isn't very thought through, particularly when you need to repay debts. And evade escalating compounding interest, which soon may be a monumental problem.

Now don't get me wrong. I support the programs set up for natives. They get free tuition and, if they choose, scholarship programs at higher level universities for any program. They also get 5000~ band payments every two months. I know it seems that these are just for the ""european-derived"" society but they also get support if they choose to live in nature and follow their tribal ways. They get food and care packages if they need to when they are out in the wild. 

You know what angers me about these reservations? The current overseers do not care one bit about the conditions in there. It was proposed to raise the taxes on alcohol(with taxes coming back to the reserve itself) to control the consumption and that was shot down. A proposal to regulate the sale of alcohol to minors was also shot down. It seems that the Native leaders them selves are happy with keeping their fellow natives down. There was a recent case where a Native politician was funneling money in the millions. (i'm trying to find a linky) 

If you read my post aimed at donaldrobertsoniii you'll see more examples.

,,t5_2qhbp,"&gt; It appears at this point that this entire argument or yours is based on the fact that these men were, when you get right down to it, liars. Since it appears that to you a physical conversion does not exist, other than in one's own mind, these men just started calling Jesus the Son of God borrowing pagan stories nearby. Or, since a lot of these ""son of God"" things were around it seemed believable to make Jesus supernatural in order to spread the fairytale and make it more powerful and convincing. They may even have believed their own fairytale. This of course leads them to sincerely, but ignorantly, put forth these crazy ideas in writing. Later of course, men, being politically motivated (in order to maintain control and power) had to manipulate and suppress all opposing views.

&gt; It doesn't matter when the Gospels were written because all of them were after the fact. When they were assembled the bible wasn't good enough if it didn't maintain the fairytale. They needed to stop any and all of this ""not the son of God stuff"" because it messed up their fairytale. I mean it must be a fairy tale because it isn't logical. I mean these men might have been well meaning but after all they had to be wrong because none of this can possibly be true. This was really about power, money, and influence. So let's just start there.
&gt; So please explain to me, as you see it, the basis of their lie and how and why they would develop it, propagate it and die for it.

My position is that your faith is inaccurate even when it comes to issues that you consider core to Christianity. I never went into specific details as to how it happened and what was the motive. Motive is irrelevant for me to prove my point. I merely have to show that belief has changed from earlier faith of Ebonites to your Gentile Christian faith. Consider Ebonites who did not believe that Jesus was son of God. Was someone among them lying about the true nature of Jesus? How about all the other faiths in the world, how did those came to be? 

And in fact you suggested (perhaps sarcastically) that opposing views were suppressed. Would that really be so hard to believe. It is not as if Christian Church does not have history of killing heretics (and I am not just talking of Catholics here). Oldest Christian sect today are Kopts in Egypt. They survived more than thousand years under Muslim rule because Muslims prefer to tax the unbelievers rather than burn them at stake. There is no way Kopts would have survived in Europe.  Having this in mind, is it really that hard to believe that earlier and perhaps more accurate Christian groups got eliminated and their books burned by people who championed faith you now believe in. Call it an evolution of Christianity. Perhaps those who believed that Jesus was the son of god back in the first century were looked at by Jewish Christians the way you look at Mormons now. 

&gt; They may even have believed their own fairytale.

Would that be so strange? Consider the beliefs you hold: you think that Hitler may go to heaven while non-christian soccer moms would go to hell; You do not think that eye of needle means eye of the needle;  etc. 

&gt; I mean it must be a fairy tale because it isn't logical.

Yes! That would be a strong indication. 

&gt; As for the rest. Religion is highly feelings based. In fact is almost entirely feelings based. Conversion is not. There are certainly emotions involved because of conviction then joy but conversion is is a purely, physical experience. When you are converted you are physically changed. You physically begin to actually hear a voice you never heard before. When I say physical I mean (by your definition) psycho physical. Actually physically, hearing, someone speak.Like someone is standing right there with you. The problem with that whole scenario is that it is absolutely insane for people who have not been converted to believe that.

If something is physical, then it can be measured. What can I measure in someone who converts to Christianity that I cannot measure with someone who converted to another faith. Members of other faiths also believe that they are in contact with their personal God.  Everything you said above can be explained with known phenomena such as placebo effect. 

&gt; is that Jesus started it all by telling the Apostles ""But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the SPIRIT of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me"". And ""I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now (mainly because they were not converted yet so like you it would be impossible for them to accept). When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not SPEAK on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you"". (I mean here you have the Trinity. Jesus speaking about the father telling them he is going to sent the Holy Spirit)

&gt; I know that Islam likes to twist this to claim that this is a reference to Mohammad but I know that twist is wrong

I don't know. This quote actually does fit well with Islamic teachings.

&gt; because, wow, this spiritual person actually does exist, and go figure, he actually frigging TALKS! Actual words! like you and I are doing right now. I've got to tell you though it really, really bugs me that although I am simply one of millions who experience this, to others it simply can't possibly ever be true.

That is actually great. If you can talk to Holly Spirit, than we can easily settle this argument.  Have holly Spirit tell you what the value of NYSE, NASDAQ and S&amp;P500 will be on Friday at 5 PM. Post the value tomorrow and we will check the result on Friday.


&gt; None of it makes sense. Like Paul said: ""we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and FOLLY to Gentiles"". I had not stopped to consider that it is folly to you. It has been for two thousand years. So, since God draws only who he wills how do I show you that hearing the Holy Spirits voice is not folly but an actual physical occurrence shared by a ton of people. I mean if this was medicine and millions of people suddenly started showing up at hospitals over it you couldn't deny it but since that is not the case what are we to do? I venture to think maybe it is not possible. I know in my past I never could have been convinced so what are we to do?

You raise an interesting question. Why don't I believe? Why are so many people Atheists, and how come most people do not believe in your God? There is nobody on this planet who does not believe in sun or moon, how come so many do not believe in God? You think something as basic as your creator would be  obvious to everyone, but it is not. Why isn't God obvious?

&gt; Maybe talk about stuff he says

Good idea! What does holy spirit tell you?

&gt; But maybe indirectly another point can be made. If a physical voice of the Holy Spirit is true than that shows that maybe there is a holy Spirit and if there is a holy spirit, there must also be Satan and he talks to people too

How do you reconcile this conundrum? 

&gt; The plain and simplest of truths is that I know things are true because I hear, like millions of others, the holy spirits voice. You do not. I know you do not for the same reason I know a others are not saved, or have a false religion or teaching. Simply and plainly because of what they say or teach.

But you probably see that they must have the same opinion of you.

&gt;  Therefore I am at a huge, almost insurmountable disadvantage with you. You have this huge arsenal of reason and logic you've developed because hearing voices has to be sick.

Well thank you. But I am not smarter, or more capable than you. I could simply be right. Let's face it, some of the conclusions based on your beliefs are absurd (like the whole soccer moms in hell).  And many things you believe supernatural have simpler and more worldly explanations (like thinking that writers of bible were inspired by god, when they could have been simply your plain religious folk)

&gt;  It must be delusional because it cannot be proven or tested. Your whole premise is founded on ""this cannot be possible because it does not make sense"". How does one prove that what cannot make sense is actually happening without physically manifesting that event. I don't think you can.

How do you know it exists then? Would you believe me if I were to make an absurd claim that I cannot prove?

EDIT: Here is an interesting question: Imagine that your faith is wrong, is there anything that I (or anyone) could say, or do or show you to prove to you that you are wrong? This is the basic idea that sent me to path of Atheism. ",1426176764,t1_c0ic4d7,c0ic4d7,0,t3_aa5t9,False,islam,[deleted],True,0,1262829011,,1,0,True,t1_c0iaz1m,1,

,,t5_2qh1i,"Makes sense. I'll try and be brief

*Museums - The museums in London are free as they are government funded. You should definitely go to the Natural History Museum which, in my humble opinion, is one of the most beautiful building I've seen and an amazing museum. Give yourself time though! Nearby is the also awesome science museum and the Victoria and Albert museum, depending on what takes your fancy. This leaves you near Kensington (a rich area) where you can head into the British institution that is Harrods (big, upmarket, famous department store) and Harvey Nicks. Also if it's a nice day you're right by Hyde Park so take a stroll, it's gorgeous (and on a Sunday has speaker's corner in the top right which is where people stand on boxes and have crazy opinions and can be funny...) If you like the sound of parks then visit Regent's Park, one of the nicest parks I've seen (on a nice day at least). Also I'd be a failure if I didn't mention the gorgeous British Muesum, but go in with an agenda, there's too much to see! Also the museum of everything is a great museum near Camden which has loads of random found art.


*Markets - London is famous for its markets. On a Saturday or Sunday head to Camden Market (in the trendy area of Camden) for a massive market with all the retro clothes, quirky cult stuff, food and suchlike you can handle. You'll get lost but it's great fun I think. If you like antiques/the film Notting Hill/seeing George Orwell's house go to Portabello road market, it's usually packed but has some gorgeous antiques and cool collectibles and books etc. really nice area! Also Spitalfields near Liverpool Street is a lovely market with some really cool restaurants etc.


*Nightlife - If you want clubs there's the best club in the world (fabric) but I'll assume you don't (ask if you do). If you head to Camden you can find some great intimate gigs, usually in upper rooms at bars where there's often a few gems. Also if you head to Soho and go to the Arts clubs you'll have a wonderful time in a nice social setting. Google Trisha's and see if it takes your fancy. 


*Other stuff - sure see the eye and the gherkin and big ben etc. but don't forget to walk all around soho and covent garden, there's some really nice little side streets that will take you off guard and can be really charming. For instance St Christopher's Place jst off Oxford Street (the biggest shopping street in the world - busy!) is a gorgeous little hideout with some lovely eateries.

I'm sure I've forgotten stuff so I'll edit if I think of things.

Any questions just ask!


Edit: 

*Bookshops: Ok this might not be a big one but there's some great bookshops in London. On Piccadilly there's the oldest bookshop in the UK (Hatchard's) and the biggest bookshop in Europe (Waterstone's) next to each other! And just on Charing Cross Road nearby there's (amongst 20 + other bookshops) Foyles, the famous independent bookstore which is much-loved. While you're in Piccadilly why not visit the gorgeous Fortnum and Mason for amazing food and luxury goods (it's really nice!) and since you're in the west end go see a musical! There's many famous musicals running at the moment. Just next to Piccadilly Circus is Leicester Square, which is famous for its cinemas (12+ cinemas on or around Leicester Square). I've got off topic (bookstores!) but go see a film there, why not. You can also visit and awesome geek culture store Forbidden Planet just between Soho and Covent Garden which leads me to my next bookstore recommendation - 'Gosh' - it's a world famous and amazing comic bookstore. My final recommendation is the London Review Bookstore which is an amazing bookstore for academic texts.


Edit2:

*Random stuff. If you're here for chinese new year, or even if not, you should definitely visit china town. If you like pretty things visit Kew Gardens (though it's a bit out of the way). If you like shopping go along Oxford Street (and Westfields if you've got the time) and Regent Steet/Bond Street (upper class shopping that is, though RS has the awesome National Geographic store). If you like candy go to cyber candy near Covent Garden for awesome retro and rare chocolate and sweets. If you like tailoring go to Savile Row! If you like a peculiar mix of sleaze and hipness go to Soho (well just go anyway, it's nice). If you like pizza get Pizza Hut whole meal for £5 or go to Jazz Pizza Express and if you like hummus go to hummus bros.!

,,t5_2qh2p,"I think that media blames things on Islam to hide real and complicated reasons behind world events. But the truth is that radical Islam is actually a relatively new thing which really took of in the 80's. Before then there was a pan-Arab nationalism which was agnostic and included Arabs of all faiths, and a mix of communism. Yasir Arafat came from this generation. 

Historically, Muslims have been a bit more tolerant than Christians. Kopts, for example, are the oldest Christian sect, and they survived for over 1000 years under Muslims because Muslims traditionally tax unbelievers rather than burn them at stake. There is no way Kopts would have survived in Europe for this long. 

That was true all over Islamic world. Muslims ruled Spain for 400 years. During that time, Spain was a multi-ethnic place. Once Spanish liberated themselves, they killed and exiled all Muslims and Jews in short order. Same is true with places like Serbia, Greece etc. after Ottomans left. Not to say that Muslims were nice to people they ruled over, but there was time when Jews would seek refuge in Muslim countries. 

Truth is that there is a lot of anti-Islamic propaganda. During colonial times anti-Islamic propaganda was used to justify Colonialism. Now there is a lot of pro-Israeli propaganda too. Yeah there are Muslim terrorists, but they are not attacking us because of Islam.

I agree with you that they were not a good thing for the world. But there are so many problems with the idea that the US was unsafe because of those countries; the typical narrative is that it was in our interest to help out Europe and to put down Japan.

The actual truth is that the FDR administration actively agitated for war in Europe to take the focus away from failing domestic policies.

Moonlight's Reality Czeck is a must-try if you're in the San Francisco area or see it otherwise (I think the occasional Moonlight keg makes it to Southern California and possibly Oregon/Washington).

For better known breweries, AleSmith doesn't get as much respect as they deserve, imho.  While they're certainly lauded, some of the other big SD area breweries usually steal the spotlight, i.e. Stone and Port/Lost Abbey.  AleSmith doesn't really seem to care about publicity or try to experiment all that much.  However, they make some of the best beers in the country and have done so for years.  Speedway Stout is currently at #6 on ratebeer and available nearly year round for $12 per 750ml at my local beer store (not saying that's true outside of California but it's a very easy beer to get in a trade).

Last paragraph.  For non-American breweries, [HaandBryggeriet](http://haandbryggeriet.net/) in Norway is really fucking good.  While they're rather pricey (500ml bottles usually cost ~$10 here in the USA), the quality of their beer is evident in every bottle.  The excellent, newish Northern European breweries are pretty much unheard of outside of beer geek circles, so I guess they'd all qualify really (currently drinking a Sunturnbrew from Nøgne Ø).  For the Belgians, personally, I love De Proef but stay away if you can't handle the [funk](http://www.synthgear.com/2009/music/james-brown-moog/).

Certainly Europe has had its share of achievements in the arts and sciences, but you have to remember, it's been populated and advancing steadily (except for the Middle Ages) for much, much longer than North America.

Or what part of the world one lives in.

Frankly, I think it's absurd that countries in Europe have to wait _years_ to get TV shows from the U.S. Similarly, the whole ""DVD Regions"" is an anti-consumer slap in the face. 

The companies need to get in the 21st Century, because their customers have. They treat many of us like criminals because we are finding extra-market ways to get what we want (on-demand TV and movie viewing). I'm not interested in hoarding BluRay rips of every new release DVD, I'm just interested in watching an episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" when I have some free time. I'll watch it if it's on Hulu.

The companies that get it (Hulu, Pandora) are being forced to limit their service outside the U.S. because of laws and agreements that protect the provider, not the consumer. 

So how does the provider respond to our efforts to consume their product when it's convenient to us? They enter into more legal agreements (Warner Bros. and Netflix), further limiting our choices, in order to make more money. 

Disdain for the consumer is not a successful long-term strategy. ",1426176984,t1_c0iclfk,c0iclfk,0,t3_amg14,False,technology,officemonkey,False,0,1262852371,,2,0,True,t1_c0ic33e,2,

I would suggest considering a diesel as the difference in fuel price is more marked in europe than in the UK.

Insist on a new MoT or re-MoT it just before you depart - that'll give you 12 months on the road before you have to return to the UK for a fresh ticket.

&gt;The idea of overtaking is enough to put me off the idea

Place passenger in front seat. Commence overtaking maneuver. If passenger screams and tries to climb in the back, something is coming the other way...

For life on the road (been there, done that), something big enough to sleep in occasionally (small van/people carrier?) is useful. Also for carting back the stuff you will undoubtably accumulate en route.

Do you have a friend's house where you can stay for a bit while you get things sorted out with your apartment?  I do believe that couples can often work their way through infidelity, but six months before your wedding...I don't think that's a good sign as to what kind of wife she'd be. 

You've already got the moral high ground here, so I'd recommend trying to make the breakup as civil and as quick as you can.  I know from experience how badly you're hurting right now and how pissed off you are, but making a quick and clean break from both of them will be healthier for you in the long run.  

And running away to Europe (if you can do it) isn't a horrible idea- getting yourself the hell away from her and keeping yourself distracted is probably the best thing you can do right now.  If you're staying around the area, cut off all contact with her (no emails/FB etc) as soon as you get the practicalities worked out- you'll get over her faster, and there's nothing to be gained by staying in touch. 

I'm sorry that it was your friend- that's so common, but it makes it hurt even more.
