First, I'm African American.  Last night, my girlfriend, who's asian-american, asked me if I knew about African-African slavery and she was shocked that I did; she'd never knew it before.  I'd always thought it was a fairly well-known fact at this point.  

When she asked me what I thought of it, all I could say was that I still don't think it was the same as what the Europeans turned it into, in general.  First of all, everyone was doing it.  It was a horrible institution but there doesn't seem to be a nation on this Earth that wasn't complicit in it.  So if that's the case, all you can do is judge how slaves were treated.  Since Africa isn't a country, all the nations seemed to treat their slaves differently...in some cases it was pretty brutal, and in others it was so liberal that slaves became kings.

So...I dunno, what do you guys think?  To me, it's kind of a null question.  My opinion is that the trans-atlantic slave trade turned something that used to be a consequence of war into a reason to *go* to war for many African nations.

Here's some quotes from the book ""THE BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN RIGHT"" by MURRAY N. ROTHBARD describing the situation in the USA:

&gt;Under the guise of regulations “against monopoly” and “for the public welfare,” Big Business has succeeded in granting itself cartels and privileges through the use of government. As for the liberal intellectuals, their role has been to serve as “corporate liberals,” as weavers of sophisticated apologies to inform the masses that the rulers of the American corporate state are ruling on behalf of the “common good” and the “general welfare.” The role of the corporate liberal intellectual in justifying the ways of the modern State to man is precisely equivalent to the function of the priest in the Oriental despotisms who convinced the masses that their Emperor was all-wise and divine.

&gt;In the meanwhile, the Buckleyite right wing was progressively abandoning even its rhetorical devotion to libertarian ideals. For National Review and its associates had learned what they believed to be the lesson of the Goldwater rout; from that point on, the conservative movement would shed itself of any and all “extremist” elements, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, and move in a “responsible” and “respectable” manner toward the seats of Power for which it had yearned for so many years.

&gt;And so we now face an America ruled alternately by scarcely differentiated conservative and liberal wings of the same state-corporatist system. Within the ranks of liberalism there is a growing number of disaffected people who are increasingly facing the fact that their own credo, liberalism, has been in power for forty years, and what has it wrought? Executive dictation, unending war in Vietnam, imperialism abroad and militarism and conscription at home, intimate partnership between Big Business and Leviathan Government. An increasing number of liberals are facing this critical failure and are recognizing that liberalism itself is to blame. They are beginning to see that Lyndon Johnson was absolutely correct in habitually referring to Franklin Roosevelt as his “Big Daddy.”

.

Some naive or interested people spread the word that in Europe is better because Europe is....less Capitalist (and more Socialist).

Bullshit. In Europe things are better because there's **more** capitalism:

- No [regulatory capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)

- More competition. The only market regulation accepted is the anti-trust one.

Example:

&gt;The European Commission actively encourages the spread of high speed Internet access across the EU. One of its means to do so is the application of EU antitrust rules against abusive behaviour by companies that hold a dominant position in the broadband services market, which could hamper expansion of broadband services. For example, in July 2007, the European Commission fined the Spanish incumbent telecoms operator Telefónica for a very serious abuse of its dominant position in the Spanish broadband market. The Commission found that for five years Telefónica had imposed unfair prices in the form of a margin squeeze between the wholesale prices it charged to competitors and the retail prices it charged to its own customers. In so doing, Telefónica weakened its competitors, making their continued presence and growth in the market difficult: they were forced to make losses if they wanted to match Telefónica's retail prices. As a result, consumers were paying the highest prices in all of Europe for broadband services, and as a consequence, broadband penetration was very low in Spain.

http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/telecommunications/overview_en.html


There's an [European Commissioner for Competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Competition) and a Commission for Competition, USA should have that. 

Here is the site of the Commissioner:

http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/kroes/index_en.html - watch the little video.

&gt;Sometimes, companies, Member States or other bodies may be tempted to take action to reduce competition. Preserving well-functioning product markets therefore requires competition authorities to review, prevent or prosecute any such anti-competitive behaviour. One of the roles of the European Commission is to perform this function in the European Union. In order to do this, the Commission can look at several areas:

* Agreements between companies that restrict competition, such as cartels or other
 unfair agreements between businesses. Through such agreements, companies may agree
 to avoid competing with each other and try to set their own rules for the game.
* Action by a major player to squeeze competitors out of the market, or ""abuse of a dominant position""
* Mergers or other formal agreements between companies (where companies join forces either permanently or temporarily) in order to ensure only those that can expand markets and bring benefits to the consumer are allowed;
* **Opening up markets to competition in areas such as transport, energy, postal services and telecommunications. Many of these sectors were previously controlled by state-run monopolies (also known as liberalisation)**.
* Financial support (state aids) given to companies by EU national governments. Such support may be given by national authorities to promote certain economic activities or to protect national industries. It is fundamental that this does not distort fair and effective competition between companies in Member States and harm the economy;"

I'm going to preface this by saying I hate Fox News and I'm extremely progressive and left-leaning in my views and I don't agree with the insensitive tone which they are taking on this.


If I go through airport security in Europe, I am most likely to be selected to be searched for drugs because I am a young male. I don't see that as ageist or sexist, I just see it as sensible because you can use profiling to better allocate your resources by applying them where it makes sense. I'm almost certain that very few old ladies get pulled over and their bags searched, where as I get pulled out 50% of the time.

I live in London, most knife and gun crime is perpetrated by young black guys and a smaller proportion of young white guys and a smaller proportion of young black girls and so on and so forth.

So it makes sense that the police allocate their resources efficiently by searching mainly young black guys and young white guys, but no one complains about this being ageist or sexist, but for reason, which I find interesting, people will complain that it is racist when the profiling being applied is racial but not complain that it is agist when the profiling is based on age.

The Ashkenazi invaders had been there for centuaries. 

They were non-Zionist immigrants (read, again, non conolists) who had been emmigrating from Europe since 70CE. The **en-mass** emmigration from Europe started in early 1800 nearly 100 years before Zionism actually started.

It always is the end of the world as we know it, and for many younger people the world must look like a pretty dark place with a scary future.  My 13 year old daughter is obsessed with the 2012 doomsday predictions.  All my logic and thoughtful conversations have barely made a dent in her illogical concerns.  But then I remember being 13 years old and walking home from school looking up in the sky to see if a Cuban missile was going to wipe out Philadelphia and me with it. I was petrified.  But  here's what I am trying to tell my daughter now and it seems to be working.  Throughout the entire recorded history of humanity, somewhere on this planet some society or culture, was always advancing our knowledge base.  Even in the Dark Ages of Europe, the Moors and Chinese continued to advance.  Eventually everyone catches up.   We have a lot of problems; global climate changes, diseases, intolerance, lack of corporate responsibility, ineffective and seemingly unresponsive governments, ineffective educational institutions and such.  The list seems never ending.  My generation (60's and 70""s) had  every one of these same problems.  Some got solved a little, some became worse, but through it all we continued to advance our science, our medicine, and our information distribution systems. There are more scientists, engineers, and doctors alive and working today, than there have been in the entire combined history of the human race before this time.   We will solve the climate problems, overpopulation, famine, poor education, energy, disease. All these things will happen, perhaps and very likely in the life span of  most young redditors.  It's an amazing time to be alive.   The mission for the current generation and perhaps for the next two or three generations, is to to learn how to resolve human conflict without force, without threats, without killing and without war.    When that happens, when science, math, medicine, engineering and peaceful resolution come together in most world societies, our species will then be on the fore edge of a golden age.  Coming out of the past ten years, as bad as they seemed at times, that's my hope for the future and the hope I wish to instill in my daughter.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!"

What i mean is that air travel is usually reserved for going on vacation, not visiting family.

Yes, but i like to call things by their proper name. Americans from the other 34 countries are usually annoyed by USican hijacking of the term. Similarly, i'm annoyed at being called Deutsch (""Dutch"") or my place of residence being refered to as a province that ceased to exist in 1840 (""Holland""). 

In the same vein i use the term Inuït instead of ""eskimo"" (eater of raw meat) and seppuku instead of ""hara kiri"" (cutting up meat). Even sillier of me is that i prefer to call people by their own name, Mexica instead of Aztecs, Nes instead of Hittite, etc."

By the way, I agree with poorindgrad's assessment of the US. I know it is considered cool to denigrate US and Americans on reddit. 

But having lived and worked in many countries around the world (including the so-called highly evolved countries in Europe), I find the Americans to be the friendliest towards outsiders and most willing to accept differences. Also, I have noticed a far greater willingness to judge a person by their merits instead of considering just their ethnic background. I guess this comes from the fact that USA is a very young nation formed from immigrants.

I think that is USA's greatest strength - the willingness to welcome the best talent from the rest of the world and treating them on par with everyone else. I do acknowledge that this openness has been abused a lot though."

having travelled through europe and living in England myself i have to say that out of them Holland, even Amsterdam has far less obvious crime and drug addiction problem around it's high density housing - a fraction of what you see in Italy (although i only really know rome i admit) or France or germany or spain...

Taking the train from Paris to Rotterdam last time i passed through some really dark places, Lille is nice in places but sitting in the park a huge group of 'yobs' came and hassled us for smokes - they were nice enough when we got chatting but it was obvious they were 'problem people' in the eyes of society.. in brussels we watched as the homeless floated around diving on anything chucked in a bin, the park behind the station was FULL of very fucked up people, not just the disenfranchised youth of Lille but a fully developed community spanning all ages and breeds of desperation hung around doing the things poor, homeless heartbroken people do (from the look of them mainly skag, in france they were pill heads, weed smokers and speed abusers (amphetamine sulphate -euro speed)... Rotterdam station was immaculate and between there and the park we didn't spot a single person that society would label 'degenerate' -even the station park contained nothing but idle walkers, students eating lunch and of course an endless stream of cyclists winding their way though the streets.

Anyone that has done the journey during the Tourist summer time should remember that it's only in the harsh light of winter that places reveal their true form...  although it's basically true, if less obvious, year round.

I am a massive stoner - everywhere i go i buy weed and speak to people about drugs, in my industry (live music) EVERYONE tours around with various acts and EVERYONE gets involved in the local drugs culture... I have a pretty good idea of the drug scene around the world (i know you're interested so i better say Israel, Germany, France, Denmark and of course England have the biggest and most hardcore drugs party scene near Europe) and i really have to say that Holland is a great place to party, a brilliant place to get stoned and possibly one of the most awesome places in europe (and that would be true if weed was legal the world over) however they don't have a spectacular love of hardcore narcotics.... I know this is totally counter intuitive but it's true, certainly in my industry Holland is seen as a rest gap for fried synapses and bleeding noses, because you can just find a nice relaxed coffee shop to chill in people don't need to go to such great lengths to create a 'movement' or latch onto some secret counter culture...

It is of course very, very easy to get any drug you need in amsterdam - i could get you basically any substance that kids have ever been warned will ruin their life due to too much fun in any near europe major city... Lots of people do flood to amsterdam, i know this will seem totally absurd to anyone who holds an irrational fear of drugs or buys into the lies of those that do but part of the reason heroin addicts, junkies and the like flock to amsterdam is because of the culture - the thing which attracts many people to the harder drugs is desperation, poverty and a cruel system - thus many drug addicts learn to hate the system or maybe more likely they turned to drugs partly because they hated the system they were raised in so much, holland is tolerant of drugs because they're the most compassionately liberal country in Europe - they have a respect for people, for privacy and for idiosyncratic personalities - it's not then strange that these people who have been driven to distraction and drug dependency by their cruel overlords should feel a sudden kinship with a country that's kind to the dreamers and gives every fool his chance."

I don't want to sound like I'm bashing the British in general, because I'm not, BUT...

The British have a HORRIBLE reputation in Eastern Europe from what I've heard, due to the ""stag"" parties (I'm not sure what those are--would Americans call them ""bachelor parties""? Is it what you do before you get married?) that tend to be held there where the Brits almost always tend to get rip-roaring drunk, start fights and destroy a lot of shit, and treat every local girl they see like a prostitute. 

They also tend to have a reputation as being rude tourists in general: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britons-are-rated-the-worlds-rudest-tourists-648751.html

I know Americans are the stereotypical ""bad"" tourists, but I really don't think that's an accurate stereotype **due to the kind of Americans that tend to travel abroad**.  Americans, in general, don't tend to travel outside their own country, therefore the ones that do are usually very interested in the country they're going to and tend to be kind of exceptional."

I think each country needs to concentrate on its own history first, but it shouldn't take *most* of the time.

&gt; Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.

Very true, but unfortunately many people completely miss the target when trying to apply their knowledge. Just think of the number of times you saw something being compared to nazi germany (or someone to hitler) in a way totally disrespectful to its victims. It has been an overused meme for a while now...

Soon we'll start telling the story of the American politician who cried hitler."

It would move around all day and cut into me and I'd be adjusting all day and making sure I didn't 'spill out' of the cups. I had a lot of back problems, clothes didn't fit properly, etc. Once I got a 'proper fitting', unfortunately these larger sizes are only carried by European 'fancy' bra stores. These bras are usually handmade and usually have a lot of structural strength compared to some of the bras I would throw away after 6 months. One of the sales ladies told me that she has a bra that she bought at this particular store fifteen  years ago.  I'm going on three years with a particular one and it's still in perfect shape (minus a bit of stretching of the band, but that's to be expected).

TL;DR: I know it's a lot. I wish I didn't have to spend that much.

Scientific progress should be about humanity as a whole, not petty tribal or national pride. Universities all over the world aim to attract top scientists with no regard for nationality, and organisations like the European Space Agency, or NASA, or CERN, aim to attract the best minds regardless of their origins. The LHC is funded by hundreds of countries and it is European only in the sense that it is physically located in Europe.

So, my advice to Neil Degrasse Tyson and others: Stop viewing science through the lens of nationality and start viewing it as an endeavour belonging to all humanity. If more scientific research is now going on in other parts of the world than previously, then that is to be welcomed. Just as others benefit from your scientific endeavours, so too will you benefit from theirs.

You seem to be concerned about your children, which tells me that you are a good person. Where do you think that goodness comes from? Is morality inherent in your personality, or did you learn morality over a lifetime of making mistakes and correcting them?

There is no reason to believe in that theistic junk. Please think about these, because I am concerned not for your salvation, but your intelligence and mental health. Believing in that crud is akin to believing in Santa Claus. [Some people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_dawkins) think that believing in religion actually classifies you as mentally ill. To be honest I do not think that is a stretch of the truth at all. 

Why does the church almost always seem to oppose science? If religion is right, shouldn't they be embracing math as god's language and physics as his law? But instead it seems like everything we can learn about the (6000 year old) universe opposes religion. Logic and reason always oppose religion.

If you grew up in Algeria, you would probably be a Muslim. If you grew up in India you would probably be a Hindu. Do you not see that religion is based on your socialization (growing up) process? Native Americans had no idea of Christianity when the European settlers first came here. Did god damn the thousands of previous generations all to hell because they never heard about some wizard that could multiply fish and booze and walk on water? (or a magical god rock that fell from the sky or a talking burning bush that nobody else saw). 

There is no such thing as a religious person who accepts dogma from ALL world religions. How do you know your religion is right? Faith? I know that my atheism is right because of testable, provable concepts. 

Have you heard of [Epicarus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Logical_problem_of_evil)? The problem of evil is one logical fallacy that disproves the existence of an all powerful and all good god. In short, god cannot be both all powerful and morally just because of the existence of evil in the world. If he allows suffering and evil to run free in the world, then he is himself wicked. If evil exists because he cannot abolish it, then he is not all powerful.

Fascets like this, as well as things like radio-isotopic dating disproving the 6000 year old Earth belief, the evidence of long term evolution disproving immediate creation, and inconsistencies in the logic of the bible should cause any intelligent person to reject Christianity, and subsequently all religion.

Please do not teach your kids anything about any particular religion. If you won't read a wikipedia article on logic, open a history book. Religion has been used by people to justify wars for thousands of years. The funny thing is that both sides usually claim to be on god's side (and when god gets pissed off he kills everything: man, woman, child, and beast alike). If you can get someone to believe in religion, you can get them to believe anything because there is no evidence to support the existence of theistic dogma, and any person with critical thinking skills will see that the lack of evidence automatically nullifies the claims of religion.

I have a feeling your ex-wife is a theist, is that right?

Sorry for preaching to you, I just really don't want to see two young children be indoctrinated into a religion against proper judgment. 

EDIT: Oh, and that fuzzy feeling people get when they pray/feel god is a phenomenon related to the serotonin system in the brain and can be reproduced with drugs (and this was done successfully with psychedelic drugs when psychology experiments with them were legal)"

(Muslims in the US are generally from higher class origins and are better educated and wealthier than is typically the case with European Muslims).

That last bit there is exactly what a couple of Muslim American friends told me (I live in the UK BTW).

Rocco DiSpirito, a New York chef and best-selling food author, made famous as the star of the NBC reality show *The Restaurant*, wrote a public letter supporting a campaign by the U.S. Humane Society to end the Canadian seal hunt. The article quoted Mr. DiSpirito as saying, ""Most of the seal clubbers [in Canada] are also snow crabbers. By refusing to use Canadian or Canadian-sourced snow crab in our restaurants, we can make a very vocal statement against the seal hunt."" The Humane Society had been lobbying for an American boycott of Canadian seafood, especially snow crab from Atlantic Canada, advocating the boycott as an economic tactic to stop the seal hunt. Many American restaurants and seafood wholesalers had joined the boycott, pledging to not buy Canadian seafood. Newfoundland fishermen in the sealing industry replied by arguing that DiSpirito was a hypocrite for calling the seal hunt inhumane while serving *foie gras* made from the engorged livers of force-fed geese in his restaurant. This practice was officially banned in some European countries and California, where the humane society condemned it. Frank Pinhorn, managing director of the Newfoundland-based Canadian Sealers Association, was quoted as saying, ""He's an absolute hypocrite, a man of double standards."" Earl McCurdy, president of the Fish, Food, and Allied Workers Union in St. John's was quoted as saying, ""I think somebody who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones.

Correct and incorrect.

As one of the stricter absolute monarchies, he certainly had more authority, and a greater personal share of his nation's ""power"" than anyone alive today.  But at the same time, if we take America as an example, our president (whoever that may be) has the ability to control and command a global empire far larger than Louis XIV's ever was, its economic resources (which are thousands of times greater than France's were), and can (and historically does) have the power and ability to send a cruise missile/special ops team/covert operatives (spies)/miltary force of over one million individuals to kill anyone he wants.  Ask Saddam or the Taliban about that.  Or, for that matter, ask the democratic government of Iran we deposed (CIA, 1953/4) or the democratic governments of Chile, Grenada and Venezuela we took out during our ""misadventures"" in Latin America in the 70's and 80's. (And so on - there are dozens of examples.)

Yeah, perhaps no single individual wields as much power as one of Europe's more powerful absolute monarchs ever did... but by the same token, ""the American government"" is vastly more powerful than any one of them could ever have dreamed of being... and I suspect that even some of the world's larger multi-national corporations (GE, Microsoft, etc) are more powerful, as an organization, than any single king ever was.

If I wanted to, (and was willing to die to do it) I could kill Obama... or Bill Gates/Steve Ballmer... or the CEO of General Electric (whoever that may be), but that wouldn't take down the American government, or GE or Microsoft, or whatever.  The organization is vastly more powerful than just the individual who leads it."

Do you hear Europeans complaining about NASA's success in landing rovers on Mars?

&gt; We disagree here. I think in the US people generally applaud scientific advancement anywhere, and people only get concerned when they perceive the US to be falling behind - as they should.

Really? Why should they be concerned? What does it mean to say that the US is falling behind? Why, if people in the US applaud scientific advances wherever they occur, does Neil Degrasse Tyson see the LHC and Russia's asteroid deflection programs as causes for concern instead of causes for celebration?

&gt; Science isn't performed with sunshine and unicorn farts. Wealthy nations can apply more $ to basic research, which you rightly applaud. In doing so, GDP increases, enabling them to apply more $ to basic research, which I rightly applaud.

Yes, we agree with and applaud more money being applied to research, but we do not do research only in the hope of improving our GDP. Much research, like that of the LHC, will likely never repay a hundredth part of what was invested.  To me, that doesn't matter, and I suspect most of the scientists at CERN don't care either. CERN does not view its mission as putting Europe ahead of America in some race. I suspect that NASA doesn't see its mission as gaining economic advantage for America. The advancement of narrow, parochial agendas, like gaining a commercial advantage over one's neighbours, or gaining power over them, these are not the reasons why we fund science.

&gt;&gt; So, on one hand you say that globalisation is a thing of the past, while on the other telling me that I must complete globally for my job. Which is it?

&gt; You mischaracterize my argument (perhaps unintentionally?). 

How so? Did you not say that ""Tom Friedman lets-hold-hands globalization was a luxury of the mid-2000s.""? Did you not also say ""Unless your job strictly requires your physical presence, you are competing locally, regionally, nationally, and globally for it. You forget this at your peril."" So, you say that globalisation is a luxury of the mid 2000s that has been replaced with protectionism, and then declare that *I* must compete globally for my job. 

&gt;&gt; You have fallen into the trap of viewing scientific progress as an engine for economic success, and economic success only in a narrow, provincial sense at that, rather than something that is an end unto itself.

&gt; I am not sure how to respond to this, since I am not sure from where you got this idea.

My original post was to condemn a nationalistic view of science, to which you responded with an argument about economics and protectionism, the gist of which I took to be that America must do better in science for economic reasons. Now you claim you cannot see where I got that idea? In fact, a few paragraphs above, you make this very same argument again, this time more explicitly, in these words:

&gt;&gt; ""Wealthy nations can apply more $ to basic research, which you rightly applaud. In doing so, GDP increases, enabling them to apply more $ to basic research, which I rightly applaud.""

I also included a bit about economic advancement in a narrow parochial sense because you appear to seek economic advantage for America rather than advantage for whichever company, regardless of nationality, should commercialise some scientific advance. 

&gt;&gt; What commercial ventures do you think the LHC will spawn? What about the international space station?

&gt; Wait and see - there sure as hell will be some, though. Transistors came out of Bell Labs - ostensibly ""basic research"" that resulted in one of the greatest technological advances of the 20th century - homegrown in the US of A. In the current epoch, governments have to fund it.

Undoubtedly there will be *some* commercial products, but they are impossible to predict, and they may not offer any significant return on investment for decades, if at all. From a strictly economic point of view, investing billions in the LHC is a horrible idea. 

&gt;&gt; They do it because they are driven to understand the universe, because occasionally but sadly all too rarely, some people find that there are some things more important than grubbing for money, power, and status.

&gt; I'm guessing you're not a working scientist. EVERYONE ""[grubs] for money, power, and status."" We are not monks; we're monkeys, like everyone else.

I am not a scientist, true, but I know some people who work in the field, and they could earn far more by doing something else. No-one goes into science for the money and the fame.

There's a magazine called ""High Times"" which some refer to as the latest issue of ""probable cause"".

&gt; Why are we permitted to get so publicly passionate about meaningless sports competitions, but not about much more important political ones?

Now we peel back the first veneer of bullshit.  Ask yourself this; our society, as a whole, sets aside time in the year when it's socially acceptable (or expected) to neglect all else in favour of:
- Thanksgiving
- Christmas
- New Year's Eve
- 'Black Friday'
- Birthdays
- The superbowl

And probably a whole bunch of other US and National holidays I'm unaware of.

The only times I know of that are set aside for political thought or discussion are Labor day and/or May Day, both traditional leftist days, which may or may not be holidays where you live.  If you discard all the fluffy flashy bollocks, how much air time is seriously devoted to the analysis of football (player stats, strategies &amp; so on) vs how much time on *serious* discussion of national social policy?

There's a thought vacuum in the west on the decisions we should make that affect all of us as a group, or even on how these decisions should be made.

&gt; I care about constitutional rights because I care about how people are treated.

What I meant was that by whacking a sticker on, it *implies* that you think you care more than the people without stickers.  In general, this stuff applies more to racist/nationalist issues than the one under discussion, but in general, if I'm driving around and every single car has a US flag on it except mine, *I'm* suddenly the one that looks out of place -- I'm suddenly perceived as less patriotic!

If you feel that caring about constitutional rights is worth whacking a sticker up about, it's implies that most other people without the stickers *don't* care about them, which isn't really fair.   The proof is clear, because if they *did* care as much as you, well, they'd already have the sticker, right? So you're declaring yourself more constitutionally aware than the other people.

To labour the point; You wouldn't go to a party and say ""Hi! I'm CitizenCain, and I think constitutional rights are *really* important.""

If you wouldn't do it face-to-face, why in a car? I'm probably in a minority, but when I see a sticker that says ""Fuck you"" it makes me exactly as offended as if the driver screamed it to me personally.

&gt; I find it hard to believe that the FBI actually thinks a Gadsden flag or other symbols of the founding fathers are ""dangerous"" or ""extreme.""

I did explain the link to extremism.  The abolition of income taxes and the reduction of Govt size/power by over 50% is an extreme position, *regardless of its merit*.

&gt; ""Domestic extremists"" (or members of terrorist/guerrilla/insurgent groups) 

These are two different things. Many aren't trained, as such, or have masters or groups.  See unabomber, Tim McVeigh, the sniper-in-the-boot, various religious cult leaders and the 'lone wolf' approach promoted by stormfront.org and Hal Turner aren't 'trained' to this level of sophistication.

&gt; if someone publicly expresses extreme political views, it is a virtual certainty he is not a member of any terrorist, guerrilla or insurgent group

But that lack of membership does not preclude a valid interest in that person.  The FBI has the right to investigate people, not just groups. Besides, even with a lack of violence, part of the FBI's reason for existing is to help preserve the social status quo, in general, so any extreme political view-holder is worthy of note, at least; especially if officials, even if mistaken, honestly believe that the ideology is flawed enough to bring mass misery and suffering on the population if implemented.

My argument isn't that this bumper-sticker-awareness campaign is a good idea, just that it does have a rational justification, from both a self-interested evil state power bastards worldview, and from a wise sensible moderate state power worldview.

We both agree that it's not worth trumping personal freedoms for bumper stickers; I'm just saying that leaving that aside, there is some rational justification for it.

&gt; when the government controls all the physical power, all the ability to do violence (as was the case under King George, and in most European governments of the time)

What you say only applies if you define Government as ""any man of good standing"".  Check the UK Gun laws of the time on wikipedia, you had to have a permit, yes, but neither the permits nor the guns were hard for 'normal people' to obtain.

&gt; oppress and do violence against any group of people it doesn't like, and history has shown that it invariably does.

Depends what you mean by doesn't like.  Govt's are made of people, fallible as any other, and if they decide, or come to be convinced, that a certain group is a threat (eg Jews in Germany) then those people will be oppressed, even if they probably weren't a threat anyway.

Also you say that this is inevitable.  I think that there has been at least one Government, somewhere, that lasted a four year term without oppressing anyone; unless you include drug dealers maybe, but certainly it's plausible that these people were thought to represent a genuine threat to the society, and so the Govt has a legitimate mandate to limit their freedoms, as a local militia would do the same if they were regarded as a threat.

The key thing though is 'group'.  It's not as though Rosa Parkes shot her way into a bus seat.  Groups are oppressed with the permission, or often encouragement, of the population-at-large, and this armed population often insists on stripping the rights of these minorities, not protecting them.  Often this is racially based, or thinly veiled (think how much people carry on about the 'damage' that immigrants do.  Will they shoot a cop to stop the unlawful detention and bashing of a wetback?)

&gt; it's about attempting to keep power in the hands of the people, rather than in the hands of the political leadership.

I think that with or without gun controls, it's essential for the people to retain control of their government to begin with.  Having a civil war/bloodbath is hardly a preferred outcome, so that retention of control must be mandated.  I don't know how to do this, but I think it's important to do it, and do it well, rather than say ""It's okay! If they ever do suspend our rights we can shoot them"" and then just cheer hurrah when it happens, because in reality the Govt will just oppress and do violence against various groups; and the less-oppressed majority will cheer them on, all the while armed to the teeth.

In other words, the 2nd Amendment assumes that post Katrina, someone will take arms against blackwater to defend people they never liked living near in the first place... and that's *not* what happened, AFAICT, many men (up to fifty or more) were shot for being black, and walking around other neighbourhoods.

&gt;Tell me, what was better for Europe, Pax Americana after 1945, or the constant shit prior to that? Europe has proven itself to be too volatile to be entrusted with great power, so we assumed it.

Never considering that perhaps the whole notion of a power was just a little wrong - not subtle people I guess.

On June the 4th, the Chinese government brought armour and battle hardened troops into the capital and told them they were crushing a violent counter revolution. Afterwards the incident was effectively erased from history inside China.

Now in Iran it seems like the army and police are not really on side - the regime has the Basiij and the Revolutionary Guard but that's not quite enough for a successful crackdown. In many ways the situation reminds me of Romania - where the Securitate backed the regime but the army and police did not.

Or even Iran in the last revolution where troops joined the revolution.
I'm sure the comparison is not lost on the people demonstrating, or on the government. I think the regime will fall because it doesn't have enough control on the army and police, or on information. They're in danger of having a small number of loyalists ending up as snipers in an overwhelmingly hostile city.

But this overview has a far too heavy emphasis on speeches. Amidst the ""historic address"", the ""beautiful vision"", the ""address to graduates in Moscow"", the townhall in China and the ""loving visit to Africa"", between ""one of the most amazingly honest speeches"", the ""commencement speech in a place where some people really hates [sic] him"", the ""message for America's students"", the ""conversation with 9th graders"" and the interview with a student-reporter, among reading to kids on the WH lawn, presenting a night of astronomy and reading letters to the president, and amidst more ""heartbreaking speeches"", ""moving eulogies"", ""funny appearances"" and ""good punchlines"", a staggering half of the 40 or so items listed here are about words rather than actions. About symbolical steps rather than concrete domestic legislation or substantive foreign policy changes. And that's not counting the White House kitchen garden or the improvement of ""brand America"".

Considering that one of the most voiced raps against Obama, justified or not, is that he is all words, the beautiful speechifier who hasnt proven his worth in real action, a listing like this comes across, if anything, as confirming the stereotype rather than debunking it. Considering the link karma here, it apparently works as a confidence booster for Obama supporters, but I doubt it does much for anyone who isn't dreamy about Obama in the first place. 

I, for example, was extremely happy that Obama won against, first, Hillary Clinton, and then John McCain in 2008 - even if he hadn't been my first choice in the primaries. Since one of my main doubts about him in the primaries had been that he was too cautious and too centrist, I was not surprised that he didn't suddenly turn into Bernie Sanders once he was elected, and took things slowly. But still I've been disappointed by just how bogged down he has gotten. And while much of that is due to the filibuster, the intransigent opposition and the handful of conservative Dems in the Senate, I can't help but feel Obama himself hasn't been anywhere assertive enough. 

The Copenhagen summit on climate change was a disaster - and over here in Europe, newspapers in the different countries I travelled through singled out Obama's unwillingness to make a meaningful move on America's commitments as the main cause of failure along with China's refusal to budge. Similarly, the Cairo speech may have been ""historic"" at the time, but without concrete follow-up, its symbolic effect in creating good-will in the Arab world is dissipating fast. With no progress in Israel/Palestine, the US surge in Afghanistan and the continued existence of Guantanamo Bay and similar internment places abroad, most of it has dissipated already.

I understand that this is not the place to repeat the most common criticisms of Obama again. What I'm saying is just that I would have gladly exchanged the whole lot of speeches, interviews, talks and punchlines that are admired at such length in this post for just, say: Obama having joined the EU in offering concrete, half-way ambitious further emission cuts, and thus making a difference in Copenhagen.

SCHIP, the Hate Crimes Bill, expanding veteran benefits, the Lily Leadbetter Act - those were all great first measures. The health care legislation about to be completed falls short on many counts but is still a historic step forward (if only most of it wasn't only going into effect in 2013/2014...). The stimulus bill was a relative disappointment, but still staved off the worst of a looming crisis, at least for the time being. Fine, by all means, remind us. But as someone with mixed feelings about his record so far, all the focus on his ""moving"" speeches just rankles me further. Give me a dry summation of actual legislation that was passed under his leadership any day, and we'll evaluate in historical comparison from there."

Compared to most European countries, the US actually has a very low income tax rate. It's not uncommon in, say, Denmark or the UK, for the very rich to be taxed 40% or 50%. In the US, on the other hand, thanks to a) tax cuts from the Bush administration and b) clever fiddling with the laws for different types of incomes*, many billionaires actually pay less income tax (percentage) than do most low-wage workers.

Anyway, addressing your main point, an economist friend of mine actually holds the complete opposite view, that we should do away with sales tax and tax solely on income alone; he had some principled reasons for this and after a little discussion, I could see his point of view. However, I can't remember any of his arguments, and I'm no economist, so I'll bow out of this discussion for now.

1. Jesus Christ, when asked if he was the son of God, in Matthew 26:64: “Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” According to the Christian Bible, the Jewish chief priests and elders and council deemed this statement by Jesus to be blasphemous, and they sentenced Jesus to death for saying it.

2. Jesus Christ, talking to Jews about their God, in John 8:44: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.” This is one of several chapters in the Christian Bible that can give a scriptural foundation to Christian anti-Semitism. The first part of John 8, the story of “whoever is without sin cast the first stone”, was not in the original version, but was added centuries later. The original John 8 is a debate between Jesus and some Jews. In brief, Jesus calls the Jews who disbelieve him sons of the Devil, the Jews try to stone him, and Jesus runs away and hides.

3. Muhammad, quoted in Hadith of Bukhari, Vol 1 Book 8 Hadith 427: “May Allah curse the Jews and Christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.” This quote is attributed to Muhammad on his death-bed as a warning to Muslims not to copy this practice of the Jews and Christians. It is one of several passages in the Koran and in Hadith that can give a scriptural foundation to Islamic anti-Semitism, including the assertion in Sura 5:60 that Allah cursed Jews and turned some of them into apes and swine.

4. Mark Twain, describing the Christian Bible in Letters from the Earth, 1909: “Also it has another name - The Word of God. For the Christian thinks every word of it was dictated by God. It is full of interest. It has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies… But you notice that when the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, adored Father of Man, goes to war, there is no limit. He is totally without mercy - he, who is called the Fountain of Mercy. He slays, slays, slays! All the men, all the beasts, all the boys, all the babies; also all the women and all the girls, except those that have not been deflowered. He makes no distinction between innocent and guilty… What the insane Father required was blood and misery; he was indifferent as to who furnished it.” Twain’s book was published posthumously in 1939. His daughter, Clara Clemens, at first objected to it being published, but later changed her mind in 1960 when she believed that public opinion had grown more tolerant of the expression of such ideas. That was half a century before Fianna Fail and the Green Party imposed a new blasphemy law on the people of Ireland.

5. Tom Lehrer, The Vatican Rag, 1963: “Get in line in that processional, step into that small confessional. There, the guy who’s got religion’ll tell you if your sin’s original. If it is, try playing it safer, drink the wine and chew the wafer. Two, four, six, eight, time to transubstantiate!”

6. Randy Newman, God’s Song, 1972: “And the Lord said: I burn down your cities - how blind you must be. I take from you your children, and you say how blessed are we. You all must be crazy to put your faith in me. That’s why I love mankind.”

7. James Kirkup, The Love That Dares to Speak its Name, 1976: “While they prepared the tomb I kept guard over him. His mother and the Magdalen had gone to fetch clean linen to shroud his nakedness. I was alone with him… I laid my lips around the tip of that great cock, the instrument of our salvation, our eternal joy. The shaft, still throbbed, anointed with death’s final ejaculation.” This extract is from a poem that led to the last successful blasphemy prosecution in Britain, when Denis Lemon was given a suspended prison sentence after he published it in the now-defunct magazine Gay News. In 2002, a public reading of the poem, on the steps of St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, failed to lead to any prosecution. In 2008, the British Parliament abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel.

8. Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath, in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, 1979: “Look, I had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah.”

9. Rev Ian Paisley MEP to the Pope in the European Parliament, 1988: “I denounce you as the Antichrist.” Paisley’s website describes the Antichrist as being “a liar, the true son of the father of lies, the original liar from the beginning… he will imitate Christ, a diabolical imitation, Satan transformed into an angel of light, which will deceive the world.”

10. Conor Cruise O’Brien, 1989: “In the last century the Arab thinker Jamal al-Afghani wrote: ‘Every Muslim is sick and his only remedy is in the Koran.’ Unfortunately the sickness gets worse the more the remedy is taken.”

11. Frank Zappa, 1989: “If you want to get together in any exclusive situation and have people love you, fine - but to hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of The Cloud-Guy who has The Big Book, who knows if you’ve been bad or good - and cares about any of it - to hang it all on that, folks, is the chimpanzee part of the brain working.”

12. Salman Rushdie, 1990: “The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas - uncertainty, progress, change - into crimes.” In 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie because of blasphemous passages in Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses.

13. Bjork, 1995: “I do not believe in religion, but if I had to choose one it would be Buddhism. It seems more livable, closer to men… I’ve been reading about reincarnation, and the Buddhists say we come back as animals and they refer to them as lesser beings. Well, animals aren’t lesser beings, they’re just like us. So I say fuck the Buddhists.”

14. Amanda Donohoe on her role in the Ken Russell movie Lair of the White Worm, 1995: “Spitting on Christ was a great deal of fun. I can’t embrace a male god who has persecuted female sexuality throughout the ages, and that persecution still goes on today all over the world.”

15. George Carlin, 1999: “Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ’til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He’s all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can’t handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!”"

16\. Paul Woodfull as Ding Dong Denny O’Reilly, The Ballad of Jaysus Christ, 2000: “He said me ma’s a virgin and sure no one disagreed, Cause they knew a lad who walks on water’s handy with his feet… Jaysus oh Jaysus, as cool as bleedin’ ice, With all the scrubbers in Israel he could not be enticed, Jaysus oh Jaysus, it’s funny you never rode, Cause it’s you I do be shoutin’ for each time I shoot me load.”

17\. Jesus Christ, in Jerry Springer The Opera, 2003: “Actually, I’m a bit gay.” In 2005, the Christian Institute tried to bring a prosecution against the BBC for screening Jerry Springer the Opera, but the UK courts refused to issue a summons.

18\. Tim Minchin, Ten-foot Cock and a Few Hundred Virgins, 2005: “So you’re gonna live in paradise, With a ten-foot cock and a few hundred virgins, So you’re gonna sacrifice your life, For a shot at the greener grass, And when the Lord comes down with his shiny rod of judgment, He’s gonna kick my heathen ass.”

19\. Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion, 2006: “The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.” In 2007 Turkish publisher Erol Karaaslan was charged with the crime of insulting believers for publishing a Turkish translation of The God Delusion. He was acquitted in 2008, but another charge was brought in 2009. Karaaslan told the court that “it is a right to criticise religions and beliefs as part of the freedom of thought and expression.”

20\. Pope Benedict XVI quoting a 14th century Byzantine emperor, 2006: “Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” This statement has already led to both outrage and condemnation of the outrage. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the world’s largest Muslim body, said it was a “character assassination of the prophet Muhammad”. The Malaysian Prime Minister said that “the Pope must not take lightly the spread of outrage that has been created.” Pakistan’s foreign Ministry spokesperson said that “anyone who describes Islam as a religion as intolerant encourages violence”. The European Commission said that “reactions which are disproportionate and which are tantamount to rejecting freedom of speech are unacceptable.”

21\. Christopher Hitchens in God is not Great, 2007: “There is some question as to whether Islam is a separate religion at all… Islam when examined is not much more than a rather obvious and ill-arranged set of plagiarisms, helping itself from earlier books and traditions as occasion appeared to require… It makes immense claims for itself, invokes prostrate submission or ‘surrender’ as a maxim to its adherents, and demands deference and respect from nonbelievers into the bargain. There is nothing-absolutely nothing-in its teachings that can even begin to justify such arrogance and presumption.”

22\. PZ Myers, on the Roman Catholic communion host, 2008: “You would not believe how many people are writing to me, insisting that these horrible little crackers (they look like flattened bits of styrofoam) are literally pieces of their god, and that this omnipotent being who created the universe can actually be seriously harmed by some third-rate liberal intellectual at a third-rate university… However, inspired by an old woodcut of Jews stabbing the host, I thought of a simple, quick thing to do: I pierced it with a rusty nail (I hope Jesus’s tetanus shots are up to date). And then I simply threw it in the trash, followed by the classic, decorative items of trash cans everywhere, old coffeegrounds and a banana peel.”

23\. Ian O’Doherty, 2009: “(If defamation of religion was illegal) it would be a crime for me to say that the notion of transubstantiation is so ridiculous that even a small child should be able to see the insanity and utter physical impossibility of a piece of bread and some wine somehow taking on corporeal form. It would be a crime for me to say that Islam is a backward desert superstition that has no place in modern, enlightened Europe and it would be a crime to point out that Jewish settlers in Israel who believe they have a God given right to take the land are, frankly, mad. All the above assertions will, no doubt, offend someone or other.”

24\. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, 2009: “Whether a person is atheist or any other, there is in fact in my view something not totally human if they leave out the transcendent… we call it God… I think that if you leave that out you are not fully human.” Because atheism is not a religion, the Irish blasphemy law does not protect atheists from abusive and insulting statements about their fundamental beliefs. While atheists are not seeking such protection, we include the statement here to point out that it is discriminatory that this law does not hold all citizens equal.

25\. Dermot Ahern, Irish Minister for Justice, introducing his blasphemy law at an Oireachtas Justice Committee meeting, 2009, and referring to comments made about him personally: “They are blasphemous.” Deputy Pat Rabbitte replied: “Given the Minister’s self-image, it could very well be that we are blaspheming,” and Minister Ahern replied: “Deputy Rabbitte says that I am close to the baby Jesus, I am so pure.” So here we have an Irish Justice Minister joking about himself being blasphemed, at a parliamentary Justice Committee discussing his own blasphemy law, that could make his own jokes illegal.

Finally, as a bonus, Micheal Martin, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, opposing attempts by Islamic States to make defamation of religion a crime at UN level, 2009: “We believe that the concept of defamation of religion is not consistent with the promotion and protection of human rights. It can be used to justify arbitrary limitations on, or the denial of, freedom of expression. Indeed, Ireland considers that freedom of expression is a key and inherent element in the manifestation of freedom of thought and conscience and as such is complementary to freedom of religion or belief.” Just months after Minister Martin made this comment, his colleague Dermot Ahern introduced Ireland’s new blasphemy law."

Indians across the entire Americas thought with each other before the Europeans arrived. The concept of the ""great warrior"" was not something that was invented the moment Europeans arrived. The more advanced the tribe /nation was the least attuned to nature they where. Incas being the advanced.
I.e. The image we are being spoon fed with, that native Americans being pacifists and only killing exactly what they needed and being with out greed, is false. 



The rest

The south American Indians (A.k.a Incas) Attacked other tribes, even their own ""citizens"" and lived beyond their means and was just recovering from a civil war before the Europeans got there.  As for the North American Tribes they thought among them self, though not at the same scale as the Europeans thought with other nations/cultures. But the European empires had evolved in far rougher and competitive climate.

Though some of the North American tribes tried to keep an balance between them self an their surrounding nature for spiritual reasons. Most other tribes did what they had to, to make sure there was food on the table. With the advantage that they where small tribes even if they killed more then their share of animals in one area it would have had a low impact especially since many where hunter / gatherer societies moving around with the seasons. There is only so much one can do with a bow and arrow. Again, the most advanced tribes (the Incas) where the least balanced with nature."

&gt; If we wanted cheap oil, we could've abused oil for food like the Russians and French did.

But that wouldn't give the US a strategic advantage over its competitors in the global race for oil, among them France and Russia.  And I didn't say the invasion was sensible, and necessarily worked out well for the US.  In some ways it did, it some ways it didn't.  But certainly for the leaders at the time (Bush &amp; Co.) it was a strategic decision to exploit the 9-11 attacks as justification to launch a war that ultimately favors over its major competitors China, Russia, and to some extent even the EU.  China and Russia aren't in this mess are they? Although it's on their doorstep, and not ours.

It's not about pure territory either.  It's not even about winning.  That's what people, and you among them don't understand.  That the US doesn't send a million troops over there to win is no indication of a lack of understanding of military strategy, but proof that the US doesn't want to win but to stay, where its boot at apply pressure on its competitors over the coming decades.

And that was a response to just your first paragraph.

&gt; If we wanted cheap oil, we could've abused oil for food like the Russians and French did.

You are so mistaken.  Where do you get your news?  Again it's not about territory, and it's not morality you're intent on believing.  The US supports dictatorships and democracies alike.  They both have their uses. 

&gt; The absolute best way for America to have increased its standing in the world with Iraq would have been to quickly defeat Saddam (which was done) and quickly turn the country back over to Iraqis

Indeed.  But that didn't happen did it.  Why?  What are these reasons you speak of?

Likely, even for free at the source, just from transmission cost, the cost would be to high.  And, no significant electric grid would want to try to handle the dangerous grid instability issues from the unpredictable source, even if the energy were delivered for free.

That electric energy source solves no existing problem because, thankfully from some magnificent engineering over the past 100 years, electric energy is not a problem, and here is some of why:

In the US, electric energy at the plant from coal costs less than 3 cents per kWh and nuclear, 2 cents.  From the 'WSJ' in August, the US wholesale price of electric energy was 0.4 cents per kWh and has been comfortably under 1 cent since year 2000.  This is for solidly reliable energy, close to the users.  For some source, more expensive, unreliable, a long way from the users, f'get about it.

The screaming about the importance of 'clean, renewable, carbon-free' energy is just a made-up, flim-flam, scam, fraud effort to get money and power from you -- good evidence below.

Here is some very good news:  For your concerns about 'carbon' and humans overheating the planet, f'get about it!

Below I give evidence with good references in parts (A) through (F).

Net, the concerns about significant, harmful global warming caused by humans is 100% a flim-flam, scam, fraud that serves the interests of (1) Al Gore who wants fame or whatever, (2) nearly all 'climate scientists' who want to get grant money (no 'crisis', no grant money), (3) some people in business who want to sell equipment that is too expensive and without screams of 'global warming' would sell little or nothing (wind turbines, solar panels, smart grid controls), (4) people in government who want to get money by raising taxes and get power from new laws, (5) much of the media, e.g., NYT, WoPo, LAT, NBC, who want a non-stop stream of 'stories', cheap and easy to write, to grab people by the gut, to get eyeballs for ads for ad revenue, (6) some venture capital partners eager to create a stock market bubble for 'clean energy' stocks, and possibly a few more.

look at the graph on page 2, and conclude that the temperature of the Earth is almost exactly the same now as in year 1000.

Year 1600?  Sure, the temperature was lower then.  Likely the best explanation is some temporary volcano activity that put a lot of sulfur into the upper atmosphere.  That put the Earth into 'The Little Ice Age', killed off the human settlements in Greenland, caused a lot of crop failures in Europe, likely created the ice as G. Washington crossed the Delaware River, likely created the especially cold weather as Napoleon retreated from Moscow, and we don't want to go back to that.

Since 400 years ago, the volcanoes quieted down, and we pulled out of 'The Little Ice Age' and got back to the temperature in year 1000 before The Little Ice Age.

Net, since year 1000, the Earth has not been getting warmer, from humans or anything else.

(B) Look at the graph of US temperature from NOAA at

     http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/images/1208natltemp.png

Net, since 1885, the US hasn't been getting warmer.

(D) Watch Al Gore's movie 'An Inconvenient Truth' again and pay attention to his evidence.

Some of his evidence is just absurd, e.g., pictures of icebergs breaking off from glaciers that reach the sea; when a glacier reaches the sea, pieces break off as icebergs; always have; always will.

Much of his evidence is anecdotal, e.g., some glacier in Patagonia.  There will always be some extreme situations, setting some new records, somewhere in the world so that for such evidence just find some such situations.  So, such anecdotal evidence is meaningless.

Apparently Gore got some of the data from the ice core the Russians drilled from their Vostok station in Antarctica in year 2003.  See

     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core#Vostok

That core goes back about 420,000 years with a graph of the data at

     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vostok-ice-core-petit.png

Gore saw that CO2 and temperature went up together, noticed that CO2 levels are relatively high now, and predicted that temperature will go way up soon, with disaster.

But Gore ignored a point:  Did (i) the higher CO2, from whatever source, cause the higher temperatures or (ii) the higher temperatures, from whatever source, cause more biological activity and, thus, more CO2?

Well, more recent analysis of the data shows that the CO2 went up about 800 years after the temperature went up causing us to conclude (ii) and not (i).

with lead authors

     Piers Forster (UK), Venkatachalam
     Ramaswamy (USA)

and on page 133 and following read about their key concept of 'radiative forcing'.  This concept is their own and appears nowhere else in physics.

Their work with their 'radiative forcing' is basically a simple 'energy balance' model that ignores any changes in fluid flows, and more in the basic physics, in the atmosphere and oceans caused by the changes they are predicting.  So, at best that approach might work for some small changes for short periods of time.  For predicting the temperature of the Earth 50 to 100 years from now, it's useless.

Net, it's not good science.  That writing is most of the best the global warming alarmists have, and they don't have anything.

watch the R. Lindzen lecture.  Lindzen is a good candidate for the best scientist working on climate anywhere in the world; he's a chaired professor at MIT.

Lindzen discusses Arctic ice cover, the 'tipping point', 'feedback' effects, some of the really absurd climate science', and more.

In particular, in the first part, as Lindzen explains, Michael Hulme was the head of the (now notorious 'Climate Gate') Tyndall Center for Climate Studies at the University of East Anglia and author of the book 'Why We Disagree about Climate Change' with:

     ""The idea of climate change should be
     seen as an intellectual resource
     around which our collective and
     personal identities and projects can
     form and take shape.  We need to ask
     not what we can do for climate
     change, but to ask what climate
     change can do for us.

     ""Because the idea of climate change
     is so plastic, it can be deployed
     across many of our human projects and
     can serve many of our psychological,
     ethical, and spiritual needs.

     ""We will continue to create and tell
     new stories about climate change and
     mobilize them in support of our
     projects.

     ""These myths transcend the scientific
     categories of 'true' and 'false'"".

So, directly from Michael Hulme, one of the more important screaming 'climate scientists', 'global warming' is, like the threat of the pool table in 'The Music Man', an old English morality play about sinful humans, etc., propaganda.

Net, the whole 'climate change' concern is, directly from Hulme, admittedly, deliberately a flim-flam, scam, fraud.

Net, net, f'get about 'climate change'.

Why f'get about it?  Because some people are eager to use fear of 'climate change' to get money and power from you.  A good answer is in one word, ""No"".

Well, what you are saying is that citizens of different countries are less valuable than citizens of our country.

&gt;The government, any government, gains its power from the people, the people's willingness to suppport the govt's actions.

Are you actually in /r/Libertarian/ saying that the government is the will of the people?

&gt;There were millions of german patriots building planes and weapons and bombs, whistling and feeling every bit as loyal and patriotic as Rosie the Riveter in Gary, Indiana. The german people supported the war, wholeheartedly, until it started to go badly.

I'd actually like to pose the opposite position, that people didn't necessarily support the war. Have you read or seen [*Flags of our Fathers*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_our_fathers)? Americans in WWII were disillusioned with the war just like they are today.

Further, the German economy after Hitler came into power was nothing but a war economy. It had very little that people could do for money without working for the government or one of the companies working for the government.

&gt;The same is true, right here, in America, where people supported the Iraq invasion until it became clear that lots of American soldiers were continuing to die.

It's also true that people were angry about being lied to about the war. Unfortunately for your government is ""the will of the people"" argument, our government refuses to seriously re-examine any of their policies that have brought us to where we are today.

&gt;If that is the case, then the governments are showing that they are not in control, and of course the response to the parties being attacked is to go in and attempt to impose order.

What right do you have to tell people how to manage their lives, people or land? The fact that governments don't act how people want them to act AGAIN disproves your government = ""the will of the people"" argument above.

Governments do not represent the will of the people; they are the will of the political class and connected interests.

&gt;This is an old argument. The attacks on America are the choice of the attackers. You cannot blame america for that. And why and how do the attackers come to the decision? 

You're right, the choice is the attackers', and killing is a bad tactic for anyone to use. But to dismiss the stated reasons why Americans are being attacked as being ""old"" is to fall in the same trap that causes the US to be attacked. 

&gt;Yes, they have grievances, some of them justified. But to attack? No.

So what justifies the United States to attack and occupy Afghanistan when the 9/11 attacks were not conducted by a single Afghan and the attacks were planned in Germany and Florida? Most of the terrorists were Saudi; why aren't we invading Saudi Arabia?

&gt;That is in their culture. It comes from having failed to learn the lessons of the Enlightenment.

There are other terrorist movements that are not Muslims, many of which are in fact Europeans and did learn from the Enlightenment. Terrorism is the use of violence to exact political or social change. Again, your dismissal of the motivations of terrorists as being ""old"" ignores key facts. "

Comparing the cranium sizes of women and men is in a sense like comparing apples and oranges. There is no question that the structure of female brains is significantly different to that of male brains. 

Intelligence tests do show that the intelligence tests of males and females are fairly close together (there is a significant difference between black and white scores on intelligence tests). There has been some speculation that the variance for intelligence in men is greater than in women (i.e. the averages are almost the same, but there are a lot more extremely stupid men and extremely smart men). (One of the persons who suggested this, for interest sake, was Lawrence Summers). 

&gt; If they are, do you not agree that a black man (or white woman) raised in a family that encourages education and that subsequently goes through the best schooling available will usually do better academically than a white male born to a poor, uneducated family?

First off, let’s get this straight. Intelligence is usually distributed as a normal distribution. This means that there will be extremely stupid white people and extremely smart black people. I am not claiming that all white people are smart and all black people are stupid. 

What you described in the above is called “boosting” in psychometrics. An interesting (and suprising) result of research into general intelligence is that general intelligence is not subject to boosting. General intelligence turns out to be an innate property of the brain (which is related to certain areas of the brain and the manner in which neurons fire). 

Therefore the athletics analogy is not apt for intelligence.

This also has interesting consequences (which have been demonstrated) in practice. Children adopted at birth for example regress to the intelligence of their biological parents (of any race). 

&gt; After all, even the Irish managed to do so! You know, despite their propensity towards violence and alcoholism.

The views on the Irish never had any basis in science. European populations tend to have the same tolerance for alcohol. Interestingly enough, some non-European populations have a lower tolerance for alcohol. This is because they do not produce an enzyme called Alcohol dehydrogenase which breaks down alcohol. This is unfortunately a very big problem among Native Americans. 

&gt; the best societies in the world include Vietnam and Cambodia, amirite?

These countries have fairly high IQs – but low economic output caused by its economic system.

&gt; negro-run South Africa? Except no, that's totally wrong

Have you ever been to South Africa? About 10% of South Africa is European white. Another 10% is of mixed race. White South Africans are responsible for all the wealth creation in that country and the highest income inequality exists between black and white people. 

Most Africans that are rich are beneficiaries of government jobs for black people or government policies that force businesses to hire black people. 

The average IQ in that country is 72 (which are fairly descriptive of the state of affairs). The black president of the country has grade 3. If anything, your example is reinforcing my argument.

&gt; It is easy for people living in gated, upper-class, well-educated white African communities to be extremely racist against the surrounding black people

That is unfortunately not my situation. I routinely live in what can only be described as slums (in majority black areas, usually cheap rental flats). My parents farmed in Rhodesia (and after some improvements by Mugabe) in Zambia. That is neither safe nor gated. I had family (father’s brother) that farmed in South Africa (which I visited regularly while I was in boarding school).

Part of setting up a democracy involves a free market economy.  Iraqi oil producers will sell oil to whoever they can.  Yes, the US does import Iraqi oil, but it is currently seventh down on our list of suppliers, behind the US, Canada, Mexico, Saudi, Venezuela and Nigeria.  If we were really desperate for a strategic advantage in the race for oil, we would be pushing alternative energy (which we are), drilling in ANWAR and drilling off the coasts.

&gt;But certainly for the leaders at the time (Bush &amp; Co.) it was a strategic decision to exploit the 9-11 attacks as justification to launch a war...

OK, a strategic decision it was.  I suppose the 9/11 attacks were also used as justification.

&gt;...that ultimately favors over its major competitors China, Russia, and to some extent even the EU.

But I don't even understand what you are saying here.  Look, I get that you want to make it about oil, but it's not.  Strategic decision to make America safer or stronger, sure.  The amount of money saved, if any, by importing from Iraq pales in comparison to the costs of the conflict itself.  We consume more oil moving men and equipment to and in Middle East than we import from Iraq itself.

&gt;It's not about pure territory either. It's not even about winning. That's what people, and you among them don't understand. That the US doesn't send a million troops over there to win is no indication of a lack of understanding of military strategy, but proof that the US doesn't want to win but to stay, where its boot at apply pressure on its competitors over the coming decades.

The US, as a democracy, cannot sustain an indefinite war.  It's that simple.  The absolute ""worse"" case scenario is that we maintain a base or three in the country for the next 50+ plus years, at the invitation of the Iraqi government.  Think along the lines of Germany, Britain or Japan.  Perhaps that is beneficial for the US in some way, but it's hardly so much better than having bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, etc.

The US invasion of Iraq was meant to serve US interests.  So what?  Everything we do is meant to serve US interests; everything France does is meant to serve French interests.  Invading Iraq may have been wrong or evil, but it was not about empire building and it was not about fucking oil."

One of the key points was that Iceland guaranteed deposits in Icelandic branches of the failing banks while not extending that guarantee to deposits in foreign branches... The UK argues this is discrimination based on nationality which is not allowed under the EEA treaties (Iceland is in the EEA and as a result must implement most EU law.)

Ultimately it is a problem for Iceland that they will not get any foreign loans if the dispute is not resolved... some do not object so much to the concept of repayment but rather the interest rate being charged (basically Iceland is repaying British and Dutch savers with loans from the governments of Britain and the Netherlands, at a rate of 5.5%.)

Many of the British and Dutch depositors are individuals with small amounts of savings, but there was also considerable amounts in savings from local councils in both countries.

You start out as customer support agent (i.e. customer report fraud to you). I did some statistics in college, never graduated though. You need to build your career, it doesn't happen overtime. You need experience more than any education, a good common sense and a perfect understand of the credit system

&gt;Are Visa and MC trying to revamp the credit card or how we use the credit card to make it safer?

Yes, they are - pins and chip credit cards are pretty common in Europe, but Americans don't like them. I personally don't like them neither but that's only me. I don't think they are safer. Anyone can very well steal a credit card and launder the money online. Then again, physical stores are NOT responsible for fraud (if some conditions are met), online stores are. 

&gt;What's the future of credit cards now that the internet is heavily involved?

Cash will never totally disappear. Credit will live long, perhaps forever. The recent crisis failed to have any impact on the credit card companies, except for a few stupid legislations. Credit will grow and continue, taking more and more place

&gt;What are the most common credit card frauds?

Unauthrozied use - forgery, most of it. 

&gt;How many times can I justifiably chargeback before there are negative consequences for me

**Each chargeback you do affects your credit rating** Keep this in mind. It IS on your credit file, even if you are 100% right. Whether you can remove it is another story (usually yes). There is no set number of chargeback; the way it works is that if there is any pattern in your chargebacks (and a pattern can be anything), you're finished. For each chargeback, you can get a lower card, or a lower limit. 

&gt;How many chargebacks before there are negative consequences for a merchant?

Online - we want a target rate of 1%. 1% is pretty common. There is a lot of fraud online. For smaller shops it can be higher. Chargebacks, fraud, happens.

&gt;What are some common unintuitive insights you can tell about common credit card use?

The one that shocks me the most? People who bitch about 20% interest rate. **A credit card is not a loan** You want a loan, go to the bank and take a personal loan. **A credit card is NOT a loan** We lend you the money, that's true, but the interest rate is so insanely high you should never, ever not pay in full each month. Seriously. Even at 10% - a very competitive credit card which will have TONS of drawbacks - it's still higher than a loan you can get at a bank.

I personally understand 20% interest rate and see nothing wrong with it (bye bye comment karma :( ). Honestly, it's a numbers. If you miss a payment, the chance that you repay your full debt is lowered by 25%. That's how it works. People either repay each month, or don't repay at all. Of course that's a simplification, but the interest rate is a good representation of the high risk involved."

* Jews have a **non-assimilationist religion**. From imperial pagans under the roman empire, to european christians, to arab and central asian muslims, jews have appeared as a threat to religious norms. In societies in which state and religion are intertwined (the norm throughout human history) jews have also been seen as a threat to the sovereign. 



* Wherever they have gone, Jews (like gypsies, or eastern-orthodox christians) have formed close-knit communities of outsiders. Historically the jews have also tended to be literate (not surprising given the centrality of text and interpretation since the diaspora). These two factors combined with local restrictions on their ability to become craftsmen or landowners formed the perfect storm spurring jews throughout the world to become involved in **commerce, trade and banking**. Though they tended to be poor until recent centuries, they also became relatively powerful and influential in the societies they occupied, while remaining mysterious and seemingly untrustworthy.  During famines, recessions and other bad periods, they have thus been a natural scapegoat.




* **Socialism/marxism/national socialism**. Many of the 20th century authoritarian ideologies promoted the the direct manufacture of goods as the sole morally legitimate form of societal contribution. To the communists, jews were beorgeois leeches sucking the blood of the international workers. Hitler came back from the horrors of WW1, and was enraged at the relatively prosperous position of merchants during the bleakness of the weimar era. Thus, even in the face of secular regimes, jews became political pariahs due to the economic roles they tended to occupy."

You need not sell me on those notions, I am already in agreement. We can discuss the follies of long-term American foreign policy and the various short-comings of those in power over the last 100 years, and I suspect you'd be surprised to find that I am very much not an American apologist. But we digress.

9/11 may have been a false flag operation. I don't accept this notion fully, nor do I completely discount it. So everything which follows is based on an uncertain assumption that those events were, indeed, of independent foreign genesis.

If the official story is true, then the reality is that the attack was planned and orchestrated from within Afghanistan. This by no means indicts the entire country. But once this reality was identified, and extradition was requested and denied, then the government became complicit, which made the attacks implicitly sanctioned. This being the case, a foreign government openly defended the liberty of those who were responsible for acts of a militarily aggressive nature. There is not much left to discuss in such a circumstance.

America has a long history of comprimising ideals in matters of foreign policy. I don't dispute this. We are a bloated beast on its way out of dominance, and I am well aware of the likely future for us. But let's be serious for a moment about the nations of the middle east in question.

Afghanistan was a repressive, violent, largely bronze-age country when this millenium broke, and very little has changed. They backed their guy after 9/11, we briefly kicked some ass, and the end result is that they will continue to be a third world country of repressive religious zealots who enslave their own women and grow the world's heroin supply. Period. Even our closest allies there whom we empowered are clearly cultural enemies of ours on paper. It's a waste of time. But that doesn't mean we lacked justification for attacking. You detonate major explosives in a major matropolitan area, it's reasonable to expect those people to come back with a bone to pick. (Yes, I realize that this same logic qualifies 9/11 from a given perspective.)

Now that we've identified some of America's many faults and detriments, let's look at the other side of the coin. Western Europe has a stable politcal environment and universal medicine becasue they don't need to piss their money away on military spending. Same for Japan and the Pacific rim. We Americans pay for damned near all of the world's military spending, which in many ways is heinous. But the rest of the world is pretty sure that we're fair-minded or there'd be a lot more countries arming up to defend themselves from us. We are far from perfect, granted. But before you get on a tear about us being war-mongers, think about what a real warmonger would be doing with our abilities. My government is corrupt and I question a lot of what it does, but it is always constrained by a populace which strives for restraint and fair play (even if many of my countrymen are borderline retarded). 

At the end of the day, we fight because we are in power and powerful countries have to face all comers. When people get indignant about the way power is used, it is usually because they've never borne the burden of wielding it. Reality is dirty, violent, and ugly at times. That's not the fault of the powerful, that's the design of the universe."

I think the United States is going to become much more tolerant toward the world as well.  But I think something else may go further here.    

Next ten years:

* Russia will join NATO at some point. 
* Ukraine will join both NATO and EU.
* Turkey will join the EU. 
* I wouldn't rule out Morocco and Israel joining the EU as well.  But those are just outside possibilities. 

Next 20-25 years:

* NATO, NAFTA and the EU will work much more closely. Possibly merging into one big organization.   Switzerland, the Holy See, and maybe a couple of others like Iceland, Norway, or Austria will not officially be members, but will be allowed to attend meetings and participate as non-voting observers.    Australia and New Zealand could well enter into such an organization as well.   I could see envision both Japan and South Korea going the non-voting observer route as well. 

Many of these things, though not intended to piss off China, will make China and maybe India somewhat nervous.  Iran is always made nervous by things as well.  So, a lot of diplomatic effort will go toward making these three feel happier.  "

1. What I'm asserting here is that throughout America there are different dialects and accents.  There are NYC accents, Boston, southern, western, mid-western, etc, etc. What else do you need me to cite?

2. Read this article here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_dialect Pay close attention to ""Up until the earlier twentieth century, many Eastern European Jewish and Italian immigrants, as well as some later immigrants, arrived and further affected the region's speech. Sociolinguistic research, which is ongoing, suggests some differentiation between these last groups' speech may exist. For example, William Labov found differences in the rate and degree of the tensing and raising of (oh) and (aeh) of Italian American versus Jewish American New Yorkers. Jewish Americans were more likely than other groups to use the closest variants of (oh) and Italian Americans were more likely than other groups to use the closest variants of (aeh)."" These different ethnic groups had different pronunciations and controlled different neighborhoods.  So back in the day you could easily tell what part of Manhattan or NYC they were from by their accent. 

3. There's no specific text I'm pulling from here, but basically any text that deals with mobile society, globalization, mass media and their affect on culture will cover this.  Just as written text codified language, the recorded media started to 'codify' parts of speech linguistics etc. Here's an article that covers the basics

Kadaicha (James Bogle, 1987). PC: David Hannay Productions. 

Teenagers in a newish housing estate dream of an Aboriginal witch doctor who gives them an engraved stone. They wake to find the stone to be real; shortly afterwards, each recipient is killed by savage fauna. The stones are 'kadaicha' or curse stones and the protagonists soon discover that the street in which they live was built, unethically and secretively, on the site of a native burial ground. For this, the neighbourhood teenagers are being cursed to death. It's Nightmare on Elm Street meets Poltergeist, but really just a teen slasher movie. Competently filmed, with patchy acting and poor SFX, especially in the climax, where good effects were desperately needed. 


The Dreaming (Mario Andreacchio, 1988). PC: Genesis Films. 

A good 'haunting' film in which an anthropologist (Arthur Dignam) unearths an ancient Aboriginal burial site, thus awakening a curse involving slaughtered natives and murderous European whalers. The anthropologist's daughter (Penny Cook) gets caught up in the midst of all sorts of supernatural goings-on. There are many effective moments in the film. One of my favourites occurs when the daughter (who is a doctor) is examining a set of x-rays, specifically one of a battered Aboriginal woman's skull, and suddenly the image on the x-ray film moves, the jaw opening and screaming. The doctor turns around to see the woman herself screaming.

From the time I've spent in other mid-west cities here, I'd have to say that Saskatoon is probably the best thing between B.C. and Ontario. Although things get really boring really fast as soon as you get outside of the city. You'll need to visit Alberta/B.C. to see some really amazing landscapes. Saskatchewan does have it's own allure though. I really enjoy driving past abandoned farm buildings leaning at impossible angles from the strong prairie wind we get here. I've heard that there are some really incredible things to see in northern saskatchewan, but I have yet to make it up there. :(

Going along with what Capbrune said, I find it really hard to be a social person in Saskatchewan. It could all be my imagination working against me, but I've always found social groups to be very elitist and exclusive around here. In general I feel like I would need to put a great deal of effort towards fitting in around here. I grew up in Regina so I never really noticed anything unusual here. In Early 2008 I went to New Zealand for a year on a work/holiday visa, and got to spend some time in Vancouver as well as Europe. For the most part I found that it was significantly easier to get to know people in all of these other places.

City planning is interesting. When I moved here I was hoping that I wouldn't need to buy a car for transportation. Turns out that depending on where you live in this city, you're basically screwed unless you've got your own car.

Having been born and raised here, I think I'm still fairly happy to say I'm from Saskatchewan. But I also can't wait to leave this place and never come back for more than a week or two at a time. Applying to universities across the country right now, so if all goes well I'll only be living here another 8 months or so.

Heh, hopefully the people from the Saskatoon sub-reddit wont hate me for saying this If I had to give planning advice to somebody who was going to travel across Canada, I would tell them to start in Vancouver, check out B.C. and the rockies. Go east as far as Banff and Jasper national parks in Alberta. Banff is an overrated tourist trap. In Jasper I found scenery more beautiful than anything I'd ever seen before. Once you're done there, skip Saskatchewan and Manitoba, fly to Ontario and continue heading east. "

Which was not much different from the reign of terror coming from just about every other empire and wannabe empire in history, the US included. If you think the Japanese were oh so bad, take a little look at what the British Empire had been doing late 19th and early 20th century.

&gt; This is completely untrue.

This is mere propagandist nonsense of the most ridiculous kind. Neither Germany nor Japan had any interest in invading the US. The only reason they were allies was because they were international outcasts and they both didn't like the Soviets. Japan was interested in oil fields and other natural resources in the far east, and Hitler only wanted Lebensraum in Eastern Europe and Russia. Half the Pacific conquests of Japan were merely in order to form a defensive line against the US. Hitler had zero interest in Western Europe as long as they left him alone in Russia.

Cool. Moral relativism. So, because the British did some unrelated stuff earlier, the US was supposed to just let Japan fuel its war against the Eastern hemisphere in direct support of Hitler's gains against the Allies. Right. Obviously Pearl Harbor was our own fault then.

Sure, there was the example of WW1, but there the United States had France in the war, and one didn't need to invade France in order to get troops there.   Same could be said of much of the Island hoping through the South Pacific by the US, Australia and New Zealand.  

But yeah, most of them looked very far fetched.  The only one that seemed to have even remote feasibility to me was an Axis attack into Canada and then down the St. Lawrence.   But even that would require Germany to first invade and conquer Britain.  

I will add one more thing: If the Germans had been able to get both Turkey and Spain to join the war.... Lots of things about the outcome may well have changed.   And neither of those ideas is totally crazy talk. "

Most of the atheist nations listed fall into one of two categories.  They're either European nations that have benefited from the post-WW2 U.S. policy of American protectionism, or they're nations that were devastated by war within recent memory, and which have depended on U.S. and Western ties since then.

In either case we're talking about counties that have, as part of a process of post-war rebuilding, diverted money away from military self-sufficiency and towards social programs.  In most cases, these are countries that are largely incapable of engaging in foreign conflicts on their own, so unless they've been subjected to civil wars or invasion in the last 60 years, we should expect them to appear near the top of the list.

Incidentally, I wonder how the study deals with NATO and UN involvement.  Even if they're not engaged in military conflicts on their own, countries like France and Germany *are* indirectly involved through their troop and materiel contributions to those regulatory bodies.

And finally, time period likely plays a large part in the impression of a strong correlation.  Take the same survey 60 years ago, and France would likely rank as high on the atheist scale as it does now.  Given the inroads made by Communists there, Vietnam would likely rank high as well.

Let's suppose they finally manage to build a small number of 50's style ICBMs. They'll keep some and sell some to Iran. There's always a possibility of interdicting the ships. Still a few get through. Still a dozen or so low tech ICBMs are not that hard to shoot down with SM-3 missiles or even Patriot batteries in the likely target countries. They can't make enough of them to overwhelm the defences, plus there's deterrence.

&gt; Finally, the NK gov. has lasted 60 years, it can probably last another 60.

That's a very poor argument. The Soviet Union collapsed after 70 years as did most of Eastern Europe. The Chinese regime would have collapsed if they had not clamped down on Tiananmen so brutally. In fact in 1989 all sorts of tyrannies collapsed - Taiwan and South Africa for example. These regimes often have a limited life.

NK is a weird pseudo monarchy and such states get much weaker with time. Kim Il Sung was vicious but very effective at keeping his populous in line. He also had a military that was capable of overrunning SK and was ahead in terms of industrialization. Move on to Kim Jong Il and the whole system was a bit rockier - militarily and economically NK was slipping behind. KJI was a lot less plausible as a leader - there have been demonstrations against currency reform - before NK was a 1984 style state with no visible opposition. 

In many ways it is reminiscent of Imperial Rome - Augustus was a very effective politician/soldier who founded the system. His heirs got less and less effective because the system lacked checks and balances. Rome didn't collapse, but that's because there was no peer competitor to stress it for ages. Modern tyrannies don't have that luxury - most of the world is free and we can and should try to force them to transition to more liberal systems. It would be better for their people and it makes the world a safer place."

**Maintenance of Authority.** One of the principal functions of government is to remain in power. Governments do not relinquish their authority unless compelled to do so. Many of the actions of politicians and civil servants can be explained by the need to maintain and enhance their power.

Every government strives to increase its legitimacy in the eyes of the people. It may identify itself with ancient traditions, with hope for the future, or with fear of a common enemy. Some governments employ repression, never relaxing their vigils against real or imagined opponents. Even democracies, when threatened, are likely to engage in a search for subversives and ""enemies of the people.""

When a regime draws its main support from a privileged class or group that decreases in numbers and strength, when a government becomes ineffective in handling domestic affairs or countering external threats, or when a society's consensus on the principles and goals of government evaporates, a government tends to lose authority. The French monarchy in the 18th century and the Russian monarchy in the 20th century were based on aristocracies that had lost much of their legitimacy in the eyes of the people. Eventually these regimes were unable to enforce their laws, and revolutions swept them from power.

Governments tend, therefore, to foster widespread ideological commitment to the nation through patriotic ceremonies, propaganda, and civic education; they employ armed forces and intelligence-gathering organizations for national defense; they maintain police and prison systems to ensure domestic order; and they undertake the administration of supervisory and regulatory functions to carry out national goals by establishing various bureaucracies to handle each complex function.

**Administration.** All governments recognize the principle that the public must be protected and served. The citizen, in effect, surrenders a degree of individual sovereignty to the government in return for protection of life and property and the delivery of essential services. Governments supervise the resolution of conflicting interests, the workings of the political process, the enforcement of laws and rights, and the monitoring of national income and international trade; they regulate economic and social relationships among individuals and private organizations; and they carry out enterprises such as production of military goods, provision of postal services, and ownership of power utilities and public works. Among the most basic services provided by government are the printing and coining of money, the provision of roads, sewers, water, education, and social and welfare services.

With the growth of the welfare state, governments began to provide services such as social security and health insurance. But the scope of government regulation is now much broader. In the United States the government sets minimum wages, limits the rates charged by public utilities, buys farm commodities to keep prices up, forbids the sale of harmful foods and drugs, sets standards for gasoline consumption by automobiles, requires manufacturers to install antipollution devices, and monitors the safety of factories. Federal, state, and local governments in the United States also engage directly in economic activity. They impose taxes, produce and consume goods, sell electric power, lend money to farmers, and insure bank deposits.

In other countries governments intrude even further into the workings of the economy. In Western Europe governments own and operate telephone, radio, and television services, railroads, coal mines, and aircraft companies. In some countries, such as Sweden and Great Britain, the entire health system is also run by the state. In countries with Communist governments, such as the former USSR , North Korea, China, and Cuba, the state has attempted to control the entire economic life of the nation. All economic planning is centralized in the government and its bureaucracies. When the system fails to produce the goods and services expected by the people, the government is forced to increase the level of repression of its citizens in order to remain in power."

Then you should never set foot in Europe. If I knocked out every guy that groped/hit on/tried to kiss me I'd have broken my hand by now. Have you ever considered that maybe the reason you're so finicky about who's touching your body is as a result of our(I say our as I am Halfish American, myself) faulty culture? That as with everything else regarding sex you have been conditioned to make a much bigger deal about someone touching/kissing you than it actually is?

&gt;If getting drunk makes you kiss other men, stick to the gay bars or gamble with your health. It's that simple.

Maybe if *you* getting drunk makes you send out signals that are so wrong that someone acting on them offends you greatly?

The study also neglects to take into account inflation. Thus, the study does not tell us anything significant about the economic effect of immigrants on the economy, nor about what would happen if immigrants weren't present in the economy. What I am trying to argue is that the study you quoted is useless to make any sort of meaningful conclusion.

You are the one making the claim about ""sweeping the floor"". I can already tell by several mistakes here that you haven't really bothered to read the study in detail. 

**And not accounting inflation? Are you stupid? If you counted inflation, the real wages would show an even higher decline, making a bigger point against immigration.** Inflation raises salaries, not lowers. 

Since you even failed to grasp this simple concept, I really have doubts of the competency of your intelligence as well as the conclusions of your so called studies. It really seems like you are grasping at straws here.

&gt; 1.- I don't use them anyway.

Bullshit. You live off the grid? You don't drive a car? I don't think so. How do you think you are getting the electricity and the internet to write your inane comments on? If it weren't for the pioneers who braved the wilds came here before you, none of this would have existed.

It is a public work, based on the sacrifices that the people before you have made. Therefore I am showing you how silly it is for you to argue that you shouldn't expect anything from the hard work of the generation before you. 

Immigrants, especially illegal ones, don't really pay much of an entry fee compared to long term residents. Or did you willfully ignore that non-residents of colleges are charged more, and that legal immigration is quite restrictive?

&gt; Yes on the Iraq war. As for ""both World Wars"", the US propaganda clearly stated they were doing it for the world, not for them, and the benefits of both wars far outweighed their costs.

This Iraq war is cutting the cost of oil for your business. Are you really being naive in thinking that the wars weren't done for economic reasons? Do you think that Germany ruling all of Europe would have just been fine and dandy for the economy here? If you do, you are very ignorant. 

There is a reason why America, as the sole superpower, has been able to enjoy such economic prosperity. And it is in no small part due to the veterans and people who have lived here long before you.

&gt; The study talks about all immigrants, not just illegal immigrants, so your point about ""illegal immigrants"" is not in the spirit of the study, so, again, citation needed. As for, do their offsprings deserve to make a living in the US? Sure, no one is challenging them to make a living. I am challenging the idea that making $10 an hour for sweeping the floor is a ""right"".

You certainly are challenging their right by driving their wages down with foreign labor that are a drain on every other tax payer in the US. $10 today is going to be $5 tomorrow in a race to the bottom. Not to mention that lower end wages have even declined considering inflation. 

&gt; The study talks about all immigrants, not just illegal immigrants, so your point about ""illegal immigrants"" is not in the spirit of the study, so, again, citation needed.

Why do you keep being so willfully ignorant? Illegal immigrants are an entire 50% of legal immigrants. You act like the number of illegal immigrants are a tiny number.

&gt; Yes. The same way that the US wants their heavily subsidized fields to compete with survival farmers in the Third World. It is called ""globalization"" and, for the last 25 years, since Reagan, the United States has been the world's biggest proponent. Walk the talk.

The US has not been the world's biggest proponent to compete with survival farmers in the third world. Your comment is laughably ignorant. Not only does the US have immense farming subsidies, the modernized farms of the US outproduce 3rd world countries which is why there is such high demand for Mexican crop pickers.

Yet again you've lost me, WTF are you talking about?

&gt;The fact is, I am sick and tired of blacks. I've lived around them all my life, to such an extent that can't be appreciated by most liberal whites.

I lived in Guyana (South America) from 1993 - 1998 and I can assure you that my experience with black people is completely different to yours. I've also extensively travelled most of the Caribbean as well as some parts of Africa. Now that you have let on a bit more about your particular experience, I can tell exactly the person you are. Even in our past exchanges I can tell that you are trying desperately to prove yourself as superior. You have many complexes that distort your perception of reality. No matter what you say, I have enough variables to piece together a vague picture of your character, and it isn't pretty.

&gt;I'm not doing anything of the sort. I'm trying to assist in the preservation of white culture.

There is no such thing as the white culture you moron. Little things like this expose the holes in your intelligence or lack of. We have American culture, European culture, British culture. Culture by definition has nothing to do with the colour of ones skin, but I shouldn't have to explain that to a person who boasts an IQ of 150.

&gt;This statement is so incorrect as to be absolutely ludicrous, prima facie. Your BBC is full of indoctrination.

Not only are you full of disinformation and half truths, you make assumptions about EVERYTHING. It isn't MY BBC and you are wrong to assume that I even watch or give the BBC any of my time.

&gt;Here in the US, multiculturalist indoctrination is EVERYWHERE.

I thought you were in Tanzania? Most of the shit that comes out your mouth makes you look like a pathological liar, you do know this right?

In the US you LIVE in a multicultural society. The entire country was built on the back of slavery, it was the white man who brought the Africans to the US. You cannot do ANYTHING but accept the country you live in. I really don't want to go down the road of explaining the situation in the US as I don't want to devote that much time to a bigot who knows NOTHING about history.

&gt;Familiar with Heidegger? What about Linkola? I'm not my distant cousin's keeper. Logically? Don't make me laugh-- everything you've said here has been a naked appeal to emotion.

Why do you always feel the need to name drop? It makes you look like the biggest ass-hole ever. It doesn't add any validation to anything you say and makes you look more like you DON'T know about a particular subject when you try to name drop. I'm not a fan of that particular German philosopher but am completely absorbed in Eastern teachings and philosophy. Maybe if you learnt in this direction some peace would come to your life. I am sorry to hear about your circumstances or bad experience with a particular group of black people, however from my travels I can assure you that your accusations/conclusions are incorrect, ignorant, and far far from reality.

You can continue to spout racism, xenophobic half truths, etc all day long on reddit. Unfortunately, you won't sway many minds here and your hateful nature will get you flamed by me and many others here.

The villagers of one locale were particularly frightened by the prospect of being snatched up by a 650 lb. beast and thrashed about like a *Little Orphan Annie* doll tossed around by an actual freckle-faced 9 year-old orphan. Of course, no one had yet spotted one and *lived to tell about it*. And that's where the real rumors started.

So what was *really* consuming villagers and leaving them by the wayside? Was it a devil, a ghost... an *infernal beast?* Were these reprisals from other warring villages, possessed by demonic spirits, summoned by their shamen with prayers and potions and icons- brought to a heightened, frenzied level of violence that led them to literally *eviscerate* their victims?

Good question.  The entire island is made of lava rock.  Lava rock is extremely hard yet porous.  That means digging a well is next to impossible.  It also means that even if you could dig a well, there's no groundwater until you get down to sea level.  Dig in the wrong place and you might even hit some lava.

The county does own some wells and that's where the city water comes from.  I'm too far up the mountain though so I can't get city water unless I wanted to pump it a mile or so uphill.  So if we can't dig a well and we can't get city water, where do we get our water?

We collect all the rainwater off the roof.  I have 80,000 gallons of catchment capacity and in a typical year we'll get over 100 inches of rain.  That's far more water than we usually need.  Most years anyways.  This year has been extremely dry so our tanks are running a bit low.  If it doesn't rain soon, I may need to pay a water truck to fill up our tanks.

&gt; Is the cost of electricity overwhelming?

At $.33/kWH it's among the highest in the nation.  And we're about to get another substation cost increase.  There are two main reasons for the high prices.  First is the fact that most of the electricity is generated from fuel which must be shipped to the island.  Second is the fact that we can't rely on other islands or other states for backup electricity.  That means each islands needs enough generators to handle peak demand.  That means more expense per person because we can't share with neighboring cities.

&gt; Have you thought of a new and better weed-whacker?

Yup, it's called glyphosate.  It's cheaper, safer, easier to apply, more effective and lasts longer.  Its only real disadvantage is that it's often misunderstood and therefore feared.

&gt; Have you thought about advertising to the booming Asian market since the US/EU may be in the shitter for another 3 years?

First, I don't know of anybody that can predict the future so I'm not willing to bet on where the market will be in three years.  Second, I'd love to get into the Asian market no matter what the U.S. economy does.  The main barrier is shipping.  Shipping to the U.S. mainland is easy.  Shipping to foreign countries is amazing difficult and expensive for a small business like mine.  It's not impossible, just difficult and expensive.

Thus, the environmental benefits of funding solar PV energy are in fact extremely expensive – the price of one ton of CO2 spared in this manner is 900 Euros, or 30 times the average price of a carbon credit certificate under the EU emissions trading program."

If humanity is really like this then arguing about religion becomes like arguing about the weather, a facile practice that passes the time. If supporters of rational discourse are serious about turning people's head away from religion they should create a moral system that people prefer to use. Yet it appears to me that most active atheists and anti-theists are just in the mood to criticise and not build.

If Religions divide people we should also consider that nations divide people, politics divides people, sports teams divide people.  Ideas can divide or unite, for good or ill. Are the passions generated by Religions so different from any other? If not we should note that the problem is not with the message but with the people acting on it.

'Also, religious morality is also damaging because it does not allow for moral growth. it keeps part of society trapped in moral stasis at the time of whatever their religious work was written. They, through childhood indoctrination, are not allowed to socially evolve.'

I once asked a priest what he had learnt during his training. He said that he started with conviction and ended up with doubt and uncertainty. During his three years of training his class discussed all the religious heresies and controversies throughout history and became completely grounded in a hundred opposing points of view. He is an Anglican vicar (Church of England) and the idea is that because he had a rounded view of many moral arguments he would be better able to help his parishioners. Now if you look at fundamentalist forms of religion I can see why a view could be developed that there is limited moral growth. I would ask you to accept that moral growth and religion often go hand in hand and that absence of moral instruction may lead to an absence of moral growth.

Focusing just on Christianity and the theme of social evolution, consider the work of the Christian socialist movement and its predecessors http://www.thecsm.org.uk/Groups/87270/Christian_Socialist_Movement.aspx. The ending of the slave trade and the modern welfare state were due in part to the work of Christians. The civil rights movement in America, Liberation Theology in S America and the role of churches in the peaceful end of communism in E Europe are more recent examples.

[It's leagal and political dispute.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icesave_dispute). Iceland guaranteed the savings up to €20,000, but is refusing to do it for foreigners. It affects 400,000 depositors in UK and Netherlands, plus some 30,000 Germans. 
legal background: 

&gt;The arguments of the British and Dutch governments are based on their interpretation of the law of the European Economic Area (EEA), and around two positions in particular:

&gt;- that the Icelandic government is obliged to guarantee at least the first €20,000 in Icesave accounts;
- that Iceland's actions surrounding the collapse of Landsbanki are discriminatory against non-Icelandic creditors.

&gt;The Icelandic government disputes these positions.


&gt;The second, if not primary claim of the British and Dutch governments is that Iceland is in breach of its obligations under Article 4 of the EEA Agreement which prohibits ""any discrimination on grounds of nationality"",[66] echoing Article 7 of the Treaty of Rome.[67] The contention is that, by guaranteeing deposits at Icelandic branches but not at overseas branches, the Icelandic government is unfairly (or ""illegally"") favouring Icelanders, be they individuals or corporations. Iceland roundly denies the charge of discrimination.


ps. I think Icelanders are legally on thin ice on this. When foreigin banks are allowed to operate in other countries, they and their countries of origin are bind by the international agreements.  On the other hand there is the  UK freeze of Landsbanki assets based on Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. It was dirty move, and Icelanders have every right to be angry. "

you're parodying something which barely exists.  actual ""anti-american"" posts on this site as far as I can see are FAR MORE often from americans themselves.  the vast majority of ""yank bashing"" posts I see, bemoaning the majority of the population or politicians as too religious / too conservative / too rural / whatever, are from _american_ redditors of the liberal / progressive / whatever mould, not ""TypicalEuroRedditors"".   I wonder about VitaminP for example.  Scan of the last few pages of his comments doesn't confirm anything, but mostly suggests he's probably American.   

So you're mostly railing against a complete strawman before you even start typing.  Then if we specifically look at the content of your post, it's 100% railing at straw men.  ""The US is filled with simple minded bigots who love NASCAR and Jesus"" - for fuck's sake where did you get that from VitaminP's post?  Where did you get anything REMOTELY LIKE THAT?  You didn't.  He didn't say it, he didn't even imply it.  There was no allusion to sport or religion in his discussion of national stereotypes WHATSOEVER.  You are just trotting out your usual SHIT routine regardless of its relevance.  

Next sentence, ""we in Europe would never think of being prejudice [sic]"" - ok, even MORE of a strawman argument, if that's even possible.  Because even if you INSIST on construing his discussion of American prejudices and stereotypes as ""Americans are all prejudiced and stupidly stereotype other people"" (which, as above, isn't really sustainable, but it's almost understandable), he says absolutely NOTHING to suggest prejudice and stereotypes are unique to the US and Europeans are immune to the same tendencies.  So where the fuck are you getting this drivel from?

Furthermore, where I do see ""attacks"" on the US from European or otherwise foreign redditors, or internal critics (as above), they are mostly along the lines of ""according to these stats the US has a higher per capita expenditure on healthcare"", ie trying to stick to facts and issues rather than jumping to baseless social stereotyping as you consistently portray it.  You know what's pretty ironic?  When faced with largely reasonable, nuanced arguments, you don't meet them head on, or even when faced with actual lazy, unjustifiable stereotyping, you don't rise above it, ignoring it as the idiocy it obviously is.  Instead you get all nationalistically butthurt and invent a fucking retarded puppet version of the ficticous mental enemy you've invented in your head so you can parade around missing all the points actually made or, at best, crassly simplifying them, for the sake of a cheap shot at a caricature of what you THINK people in other countries are like.  And voila, as such you positively embody the ""dumb yank"" stereotype you purport to satirise the stupidity of.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories.

Except Utah, which she does not fancy.

Your new Prime Minister (The Right Honourable Gordon Brown MP, for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America without the need for further elections.

The House of Representatives and the Senate will be disbanded.

A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminium."" Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.

The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour'; skipping the letter 'U' is nothing more than laziness on your part. Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters.

You will end your love affair with the letter 'Z' (pronounced 'zed' not 'zee') and the suffix ""ize"" will be replaced by the suffix ""ise.""

You will learn that the suffix 'burgh' is pronounced 'burra' e.g. Edinburgh. You are welcome to re-spell Pittsburgh as 'Pittsberg' if you can't cope with correct pronunciation.

Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up “vocabulary."" Using the same thirty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""uhh"", ""like"", and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.

Look up ""interspersed.""

There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you shouldn't have chat shows. When you learn to develop your vocabulary, then you won't have to use bad language as often.

There is no such thing as ""US English."" We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of ""-ize.""

You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier).

You will also have to learn how to understand regional accents --- Scottish dramas such as ""Taggart"" will no longer be broadcast with subtitles.

While we're talking about regions, you must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is ""Devon."" If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become ""shires"" e.g. Texasshire, Floridashire, Louisianashire.

Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. Hollywood will be required to cast English actors to play English characters.

British sit-coms such as ""Men Behaving Badly"" or ""Red Dwarf"" will not be re-cast and watered down for a wishy-washy American audience who can't cope with the humour of occasional political incorrectness. Popular British films such as the Italian Job and the Wicker Man should never be remade.

You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.

You should stop playing American ""football."" There are other types of football such as Rugby, Aussie Rules &amp; Gaelic football. However proper football - which will no longer be known as soccer, is the best known, most loved and most popular. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game.

The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.

Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies).

We are hoping to get together at least a US Rugby sevens side by 2010.

You should stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of North America. Since only 2.15% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called ""rounders,"" which is baseball without fancy team strip, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs.

You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because we don't believe you are sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you will require a permit if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.

The 4th of July is no longer a public holiday. The 2nd of November will be a new national holiday, but only in Britain. It will be called ""Indecisive Day.""

All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap, and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.

All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts. You will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.

You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call 'French fries' are not real chips. Fries aren't even French, they are Belgian though 97.85% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called ""crisps."" Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat.

Waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers.

As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself.

The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling ""beer"" is not actually beer at all, it is lager . From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as ""beer,"" and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as ""Lager."" The substances formerly known as ""American Beer"" will henceforth be referred to as ""Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine,"" with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as ""Weak Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine."" This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in the Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.

From the 10th of November the UK will harmonise petrol (or ""gasoline,"" as you will be permitted to keep calling it until the 1st of April) prices with the former USA. The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will, in return, adopt UK petrol prices (roughly $10/US gallon -- get used to it).

You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent. Guns should only be handled by adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, then you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.

Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.

Tax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776).

Thank you for your co-operation."

Also - this is an example of how important public domain is to a society's culture. I don't know whether or not they bought the rights to use the Simpsons' music. They probably didn't - I bet there's some clause in Estonian law that allows them to go ahead with this parody - even if it's an advertisement. A lot of important cultural works don't achieve their impact on society, until they pass into the public domain. To insist on intellectual property rights to everything for so many decades, means that every work becomes obscure, and no works ever stand out as the great works of the generation. Last night I was listening to a Radio Australia lecture about the history of the public's relationship to Da Vinci's Mona Lisa - and the satirising of the painting was central in publicising it, and creating the recognition of the work's greatness."

&gt;I suppose, well, at least at the beginning of each movement, the thing in common that the Socialist movement had—well, there wasn’t a Libertarian movement in the early days of the Industrial Revolution; you don’t really get Libertarian movements until there’s a certain amount of peace, democracy and prosperity, and where the hard task of building a state and creating a nation has been done, so it’s [an] ahistoric question in some ways, but let’s say that Socialism begins—Marxism certainly begins—by looking forward to the end of the state—to the withering away of the state, as Marx and Engels famously put it—and to, as they better put it, actually, to the replacement of the government of men by the administration by man of things. And that bit of the ideal dropped out in the terrible struggles in Europe and elsewhere in the 20th century over nation states, wars, crises and revolution. But certainly the original idea was that the state was not the arbiter of social disputes but the product of them, and that if you could remove certain contradictions, there would be less and less need for an absolute authority. The Libertarians have got the same point in a different way, but I think that they always suffer—to me—from the disadvantage of being, I think I said before ‘ahistorical’—what would have been a Libertarian position on the Franco-Prussian War? On the collapse of czarism in Russia, on the rise of fascism, on the military industrial complex, on all these things? There’s so many things on which there’s no distinctly Libertarian position to take. What is the Libertarian view of the Vietnam War, say, or the Chinese Revolution? It’s a bit thin; it’s a bit faint.  But nonetheless, I’ve always said and believed that I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t have a bit of the Libertarian and the Anarchist within them ... I don’t make the presumption that those in charge know better than I do; I also don’t make the presumption that they have the right to tell me what to do unless they repeatedly have earned that right. So it’s very important that one has some Libertarian and Anarchist elements in his makeup, I believe."

Some of the headlines here use the words 'Financial pariah' amongst others. Your credit rating will fall, and the long term damage that will do to your ability to loan in the future is going to cost you much more than whatever you're not going to pay back now.

When a state can no longer issue bonds then there is a real risk of complete collapse. Look at Argentine for an example.

&gt; The new government's plans included stabilizing Argentina's economy including the creation of a new currency (the Austral, first of its kind not to carry the word peso as part of its name), for which new loans were required. The state eventually became unable to pay the interest of this debt and confidence in the Austral collapsed. Inflation, which had been held to 10 to 20% a month, spiraled out of control. In July 1989, Argentina's inflation reached 200% that month alone, topping 5,000% for the year. During the Alfonsin years, unemployment did not substantially increase; but, real wages fell by almost half (to the lowest level in fifty years). ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999%E2%80%932002) )

And this happened again in the 2000s:

&gt; Argentina defaulted on part of its external debt at the beginning of 2002. Foreign investment fled the country, and capital flow towards Argentina ceased almost completely. Argentina was ""left out of the world."" The currency exchange rate (formerly a fixed 1-to-1 parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar) was floated, and the peso devalued quickly, producing massive inflation. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring )

And in addition to that, you might very well wreck your EU candidacy. And one would suppose that this crisis had underscored the importance for Iceland to be a part of the Union."

There is no one opinion on Americans abroad.  I found that we had a great reputation, in general, especially compared to Europeans of any country.  People thought we were friendly, egalitarian, polite, and really liked how much Americans tried to speak the local languages and learn local customs.  We say ""excuse me"", ""please"", ""sorry"" and ""thank you"" waaaay more than the locals do; I tried to rope it in but that conditioning goes deep. (Kenyans are polite too, just in a different way.)  In my experience Europeans had the rep of being snobby, rude, and racist.  One thing that made me lol was the way British men were disgusting everyone by wearing those horrible little shorts, showing off their white hairy legs, which is a **big** faux pas even without the white hairiness.  Of course, Kenya was colonized by the British so they are particularly unpopular there, especially since it's still British people/companies who hold so much of the wealth.  

Unfortunately, since a lot of Kenyans' only exposure to Americans is Baywatch and other gems of television (WWE Raw is never missed), Americans are expected to be white and blonde, and women get harassed more because we're so skanky on tv.

222,,1262723874,222,0,t1_c0i8ohf,True,False,t3_alr4g,0,True,DaveM191,worldnews,c0i9feb,0,t5_2qh13,,,t1_c0i9feb,1426175489,"These Icesave accounts were savings accounts, not investment accounts (hence the word ""save"" in Icesave). The people opening such accounts are called ""savers"" not ""investors"". Calling them ""investors"" is deceitful, because you are misrepresenting the situation.

The difference is important because savings accounts are insured by law for a certain amount, in every civilized country in the world. This is called ""deposit insurance"". Investment accounts are not insured. When a person puts his money in a savings account, he does so with the knowledge that his money is insured (up to a certain amount) against bank failures.

Icelandic banks operating in England and Holland were required both by European law (European Union directive 94/19/EC) and Icelandic law (Act No. 98/1999) to provide such insurance to depositors. The minimum insurance required by law is €20,000 per account, which is what these Icelandic banks offered (although British banks offer €60,000 per account and Dutch banks offer €100,000 per account insurance).

When the banking crisis hit, the Icelandic banks realized they didn't have enough money in their insurance scheme to even pay the €20,000 minimum required by their own law and by European law. Instead of revealing these lack of funds, what they did was:

1. to start moving whatever cash was left in their foreign branches back into Iceland
2. modifying their rules so they would pay deposit insurance for Icelanders who had made deposits in bank branches in Iceland, but not pay deposit insurance to foreigners who had made deposits under exactly the same Icesave type accounts in bank branches in England and Holland.

If this hasn't sunk in, I suggest you re-read the two points above again. And again. And understand what this means. It means that the banks said they would pay the €20,000 for Icesave accounts held by Icelandic people in Iceland, but NOT for Brits or Dutch people who held exactly the same Icesave accounts in Icelandic banks in England and Holland.

Further, since they realized what an enormous squawk this would raise from the Brits and Dutch who got cheated, they quietly started moving cash out of their branches abroad, back into Iceland.

The movement of such large amounts of cash obviously can't be kept secret for long. The Brits found out and confronted Iceland. There is a very famous phone call between the British Chancellor Alistair Darling, and the Icelandic Finance Minister Árni Mathiesen, in which Mathiesen declared that Icelandic banks were obliged to pay back deposits for Icelanders, but not for foreigners. You can probably find transcripts of that phone call at dozens of web sites if you google for it.

This was the last straw. When England and Holland realized that not only did Iceland have no intention of honoring its deposit insurance, which it was required to do both by European and Icelandic law, BUT ALSO was secretly moving funds back to Iceland, from its branches in England and Holland, THEN, they reacted.

Instead of waiting to pass new laws to prevent this transfer of money (by which time the money would already be out of the country and gone forever), England took the unusual step of using an existing law, an emergency anti-terrorism law, to halt the transfer of funds. This was a law used ONLY because there was no other way to immediately freeze the transfer of funds, and if they had waited, they would have been too late. But a lot of Icelandic people were very upset and there were outraged demonstrations in Iceland with people saying ""look, do I look like a terrorist? I'm white, not brown, I'm not Al-Qaida!"". People went to town, dressed up in fatigues, holding mock weapons and getting their pictures taken. It was all great fun, like ""haha, look, the brits think we're terrorists, what a joke!"".

But I don't think the Brits considered them terrorists at all, they simply used the only law they had available to them at the time, to prevent the Icelandic banks from stealing more money from them.

The path to finding a solution, since then, has been tough. The situation is this. In both England and Holland, a lot of ordinary people got burned. Again, these were NOT investors, they were savers. Crucial difference. These people are telling their governments to do something. The government can't ignore them, too many people are involved. So the Brit and Dutch governments got together with the Icelanders, and tried to work out a solution. The solution was this: the Brits would lend the Icelanders sufficient money to repay the deposit insurance, and the Icelanders could then repay the loan over a long period. The Dutch agreed to do the same, for the Dutch people.

Initially, Iceland rebuffed this. Their thinking was that they could get better loan terms from the IMF (International Monetary Fund). However, since both England and Holland have some clout with the IMF, not to mention a bunch of other European countries that had lost smaller amounts of money but were still pissed off with the Icelanders, it became clear that the IMF would loan no cash to Iceland until this matter was resolved. In fact, all 27 EU member states said that Iceland needed to sort out this mess before the IMF would make any loans. This is not because 27 different EU countries all hate Iceland for some reason, it's because the situation was clear enough from a point of law that this ought to be the recommended course.

So Iceland was forced back to the bargaining table. This time, they came to an agreement with both England and Holland. As a consequence of the agreement, the Dutch have already started paying out the deposit insurances, and the Brits were about to follow. But there is more drama ahead.

Although the Icelandic government had agreed to the deal, it hadn't actually passed their parliament. The vote in parliament finally happened on August 28, 2009, and the bill passed, BUT parliament tacked on some extra provisions that weren't part of what they had previously agreed to, with England and Holland. Specifically, the provisions were that the repayments would never exceed yearly payment amounts higher than 4% of the GDP to England, and 2% of the GDP to Holland. Further, if as a consequence of these reduced payments, they failed to repay the loan in 20-something years, the rest of the loan would be forgiven.

If you do the math based on Iceland's pre-fake-boom GDP, you can see that under these terms they would only repay a fraction of the loan. Naturally, both England and Holland rebelled, and pointed out that this was not what they had agreed to. Until  lately, this was the situation, with both England and Holland threatening that they would block the IMF loans again (Iceland has also been separately applying for IMF loans during this time).

Finally, Iceland again voted on it again in parliament, and in December last year, they again approved the bill. But there were massive protests, with Icelandic people calling for a referendum. So a couple weeks later, the Icelandic President vetoed the bill again (today).

So that's where we are at present. I dunno what's going to happen. I expect partisans from both sides will distort the situation as they see fit. But please don't get taken in by too many lies. Remember:

1. these were SAVINGS accounts, not investment accounts
2. the SAVINGS accounts were insured for €20,000 each under both Icelandic and European law
3. when the crash came, Iceland found there wasn't enough insurance money to pay everyone
4. Iceland then said it would pay only depositors who had accounts in the branches in Iceland, but not abroad, for the SAME type of account
5. Iceland started to move cash from England and Holland into Iceland
6. THEN the Brits got annoyed and put a stop to it, and yes, they used an antiterrorism law to do so
7. NOBODY has asked that Iceland pay any more than the €20,000 per account, plus interest. Interest is standard in banking, it is stupid to see bankers getting outraged over ""oh, they want us to pay interest!""
8. Iceland has said yes and no to repaying several times, changing its mind at least 3 times over this. Further, what they voted on in parliament was not what they had agreed to privately with England and Holland.

I dunno how this will work out. I have sympathy for the Icelandic people, not all of whom were responsible for the excesses of their countrymen. I also feel that the country was poorly governed, and I find it hard to understand why the public failed to ask some hard questions when these puny banks had already leveraged themselves to 5x the whole country's GDP. Why did they not ask questions when foreigners, including Americans, Dutch and Britishers went to Iceland many times and publicly warned them that their economy was going to crash, that such financial gimmicks could not continue. This was widely reported in the Icelandic press, so it's not like no one knew. Why did they not then question their own Prime Minister, and other politicians, who were simultaneously giving speeches, saying ""oh, we Icelanders are financial geniuses, it has to do with our heritage and national temperament"". Surely someone could have said ""hey, wait a minute, where did this expertise suddenly come from, a few years ago we were selling fish"". It's a shame, and there is much blame and hurt to go around."

Early in 2008, [Putin threatened the Ukraine with nukes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/12/AR2008021201658.html) because they were in talks about joining NATO.  Seeing as how they cut the gas only the month before makes me a little bit suspicious.

Considering the fact that Russia started sowing the seeds of discord between Abkhazia and South Ossetia around that exact same time, leading the regions to request independence the month after Russia threatened the Ukraine and three months before Gazprom expressed a desire to build a pipeline, with rumors of exploratory expeditions to Abkhazia just three months after that, things become more sketchy.

This all becomes even more suspicious when coupled with the fact that Georgia has also been incredibly involved with NATO, even to the point where they had sent a security force to assist NATO in Afghanistan.  Things became more clear concerning the conflict when Russian officials claimed that, since Abkhazia and South Ossetia were no longer part of Georgia, they wouldn't be included if NATO allowed Georgia to join.  Not only so, but they further widened the divide between the regions and Georgia by claiming that Georgia had intended to join NATO without them all along.

When confronted by the EU concerning the military buildup of Russian forces, Russia threatened to shut off gas to Europe if they didn't mind their own affairs, claiming that regional issues were none of their concern.

I'm in full agreement concerning your points about the United States, however, I don't trust Russia's play to develop a more dominant energy presence is entirely for economical reasons, especially since it has been employed as a means of control once already.

The United States doesn't fit traditional models of empire, so traditional models won't be very helpful predictively. Hyperbolic doom-saying about ""empires in decline"" certainly sells books and starts conversations - but its not very useful academically. International relations are 1000x more complicated now than they were even 100 years ago, mostly due to the speed of travel, communication, and the greater interdependency of economies. Furthermore - no one really knows why Rome failed,  the answers literally fill hundreds of fat history tomes, and no one agrees entirely... so thats not a good starting point. The only models that seem even vaguely applicable are the decline of Western European empires - however, these were largely cedes of land, not power (and here power can be understood as economic influence).

History is a foreign country, its dangerous to make sweeping assumptions about our future based on our less-than-perfect understanding of the past, which isn't to say that history isn't worth studying - but you've got to be more careful in the application of what you've learned than the author in the OP."

Drink driving over there is a bit too frequent and does not seem to be taken seriously enough (we like to plan a lynching for drink drivers) yet speeding over there is seen as a terrible thing whereas over here it is the norm. You are so friendly at times it makes us feel uncomfortable (we are thinking ""what do you want"") and there seems to be a common practice of saying ""you must come for a meal / drink / party/ whatever within 3 seconds of meeting but that never materialises leaving you looking shallow. We do a lot of 'dropping in'.... if passing a friends house we just 'drop in' whereas your visits seem to be more planned and scripted to some extent. you tend to fill the lives of your kids with an 'after school everything' whereas we tend to leave them to cause chaos in the neighbourhood. 
Your middle class white folks seem to be terrified of black people, your cops are just far too violent and that violence is usually supported by the state. You are capable of incredible acts of compassion but also some of the most horrific acts of violence I have ever seen, you reach both ends of the spectrum in equal proportion. You have really shitty news programmes that focus on 'cat stuck up a tree' stories from around America followed by 'they are all out to get us' stories from the middle east / Russia. You have a lot of 'worlds best / worlds biggest when in fact you mean best / biggest in the lower 48. The general education with regard to other countries is absolutely shocking but I feel this is intentional (knowledge is power and all that). 
You have some of the most incredible scenery all in one place and reachable via a network of roads that have little or no traffic (between cities) you desperately need cross country high speed railways (drive on- drive off, like euro tunnel). 
Your cities can be a little disappointing and repetitive (with exceptions of course) South beach Miami, The old town San Fransisco, French Quarter New Orleans, NYC almost anywhere, loads in the north east, LA various etc. 
You seem to crave history whereas we have too much of it at times, you talk of 200 years ago as if it were an aeon yet thousands of brits live in 200 year old houses and treat them merely as home. 
The variety of stuff over there is somewhat restricted, I think because the 'chain store' is celebrated and that means mass market which means restricted choice whereas we think chain stores are ok for some stuff but we also need thousands and thousands of niche stores....the same could be said of restaurants in most states. 
You use far too much oil and other natural resources almost without a care which makes Europeans pissed off because we don't have the ability to do that (if we did we would be doing it just as you guys are). 
You have far too much 'AMERICA IS THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH' going on when in truth the majority of you guys have no idea what any other nation is like....and if you thought about it for a moment how would you like to hear from one single nation how great they are, every 5 minutes for the entirety of your life?? I know it is absolutely banged into you from birth and so you are to some extent indoctrinated but it still get on the tits....just a little. 
I could go on forever....oh I think I have sorry, but I had a great time in your incredible country, I met and maintain loads of new friends but equally I am happy to be back in my own small nation....and confess to a greater national pride in the achievements of the UK given the size of the scrappy little chunk of rock that I call home.

i see why people use this measure - it makes countries with low infant mortality look very good by comparison.  but it really distorts the reality by suggesting, in this case that 'most afghan women die around the age of 44'.  which is completely wrong.  most likely this is a bimodal distribution with one spike around 3~4 years of age, and the other one around 65~70, much closer to what we'd expect. 

the even sillier thing is, this is also true of the u.s. or europe about 200 years ago (pre-industrial revolution).  there was a really good chance you'd die before the age of 5, but if you made it past that and into your early teens, life expectancy for adults was pretty much the same as it is now.  for me this puts a lot of the fuss over modern medical care and especially advanced treatments into different perspective.

Ukraine and Russia were having plenty of problems with gas sales, though, especially with Russia selling their gas to Ukraine at subsidized rates.

Russia didn't start sowing the seeds of discord between Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Abkahzians and Ossetians didn't want to live under oppressive Georgian supremacy and Georgia's pro US puppet decided to launch a surprise attack including against Russian peacekeepers and then immediately start a public relations campaign to make himself seem like the victim of Russian aggression to the gullible US citizenry with their handful of corporations controlling the information they get.  I remember right when Georgia launched the war, but before Russia responded why the fuck is the mainstream US media completely ignoring this story and then when Russia retaliated and they all parroted the Russian aggression line I realized what had transpired.

Anyway Georgia lost badly and as a result of the US and the west unilaterally recognizing the independence of Kosovo Russia used it as an excuse to recognize the independence that had long been declared by Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Georgia isn't even going to join NATO.  Europeans saw with their own eyes that Georgia in NATO could easily lead to a NATO-Russian war because of the mutual defense pact part.  The Abkhazians and Ossetians in South Ossetia never wanted to be a part of Georgia.

Russia didn't want NATO to extend itself into a beachhead in Georgia from which to continue its encirclement of Russia.  NATO is an anti-Russian organization and Russians sees NATO eventually extending to all the post Soviet states to choke Russia into submission.  Sure pro US drunk Yeltsin didn't care about fucking over his country, but Putin, regardless of how much we can disagree with his methods, is a Russian nationalist and doesn't want the country to be strangled by the US.

Russians and Ukrainians are incredibly similar and the problems between them is a combination of historical resentment by Ukrainians for Russian domination and constant western prodding to try to wedge the two countries as far apart as possible.  The west tries to wedge every single post Soviet country away from Russia and into their sphere of influence while decrying Russia as imperialist for trying to salvage whatever influence they have left in the world.  

Is Russia a victim?  No, but the west and especially the United States is playing one fucked up imperial game."

Haha. What a joke.

This is how ""unfair"" it is:

* You guys ran a fraudulent scheme, and cheated tens of thousands of British, Dutch, and other European people out of their cash, sometimes their whole life's savings.

* To protect against precisely this kind of fraud, the EU has set up rules requiring deposit insurance for savings accounts. You agreed to these rules when you opened branches in England and the Netherlands.

* But this insurance scheme was also a fraud. It was created by your government, under an act of your parliament. And your government failed to supervise it, police it, take responsibility for a law that THEY had signed, that THEY had taken responsibility for fulfilling. They were too busy getting their own cuts from the bankers.

* The insurance scheme was the cheapest permissible under law. While the Brits insured accounts for €60,000, and the Dutch for €100,000, your banks cheaped out and went for the minimum of €20,000.

* But it was a fraud all along, and when the crash came, they didn't even have €20,000 to hand out.

* Knowing this, they secretly moved their funds out of the UK and the Netherlands, back into Iceland. They knew that when the storm broke, their own citizens would burn their homes down if they didn't get paid, while the Brits and Dutch could do nothing. So whatever funds they had left, they brought home in a hurry, to pay Icelanders off.

* When the Brits and Dutch protested, and after all this pressure by the EU and the IMF, they made a deal. But now they don't want to honor that deal either.

And you call the deal unfair? What's unfair about it? This is what the actual deal is:

- Britain and Holland have offered to **loan** money to Iceland, so that Iceland can pay back its insured foreign investors.

- Note that no one is asking Iceland to return the 10x as large amount of money that they took as foreign investments, and then lost. That's not even being counted, because hey, that was investment money and investments are risky. Who cares if a bunch of Brits lost their pension funds because your idiot banks were playing cowboys and indians with that cash. That's all under the bridge.

- Only those small number of foreigners who had **Savings** accounts, guaranteed against bank failure through an insurance scheme, required by both Icelandic and EU law, specifically, the Icesave accounts - these are **ALL** that Iceland is being asked to pay back.

- And they're not even being asked to pay back the whole amount. Just the insured amount. Meaning if a Brit or Dutch citizen had €100,000 in his Icesave account, he's already reconciled himself to the loss of €80,000 of that. He just wants €20,000 back. The very cheapest insurance allowed by EU law, which Iceland chose.

- And to pay back that small amount, his own government is willing to give you the loan, out of **his** tax money.

But you claim that this is ""unfair"". Let's see what you consider ""fair"". In August, your parliament passed the bill allowing them to take the loans from England and Holland, to fulfill the insurance claims. But they added the following clauses:

- Iceland will never make a yearly loan payment any greater than 4% of its GDP to England, and 2% of its GDP to Holland.
- Even these reduced payments will only be paid for 14 years. At the end of the 14 years, England and Holland must forgive the remainder of the loan.

This is what you call fair? Do some math. Look at your GDP, now that your thieving banks are gone. It's shrunk. With that GDP and the 4%/2% limit and the deadline of 14 years, you'll only pay a fraction of what you owe. And what you owe is only a *tiny* fraction of what you actually stole. And that is fair?

It sounds like a happy solution for the Icelanders, but it's terribly unfair to the people whose money they stole."

Don't expect Britain and Holland to make further concessions.

Thats just the thing, Britain and Holland made zero concessions, they rejected Iceland's initial repayment terms and we accepted their new terms outright with no argument.  That is why this petition garnered all this attention.

&gt;If the agreement isn't approved, I fear Iceland may be headed for sovereign default, currency collapse, and runaway inflation.

The initial fear was that we would not pay for Icesave at all, any terms of repayment are better than none, which certainly allows for some negotiation of terms.

There is a very good chance we will agree to the original terms we are now rebuking, after negotiations are through if it appears that we can make no headway, but the main thrust here is that is a bargaining process where it isn't simply assumed that Iceland accepts whatever terms are demanded.

No one is thinking of doing anything to make repayment fall through, because that would only cause more hardship, which is precisely what we are trying to avoid.

&gt;currency collapse, and runaway inflation.

These have already effectively happened.  The Krona will never be a totally viable currency again, and inflation has always been rampant  and at this stage will not be curtailed till we join the EU.

The main thing that irks me is that the media is largely portraying Icelanders as rejecting the idea of paying for Icesave at all, which is not true because we know what the consequences are."

Cartoon 2 - Obviously nonsense.

Cartoon 3 - Comparing the Israeli government's treatment under Sharon of the Palestinian people to the treatment of European Jews under the Nazis is, while again somewhat hyperbolic, apt.

Cartoon 4 - Again a comparison of the IDF's actions in the Gaza strip to the actions of Nazi Germany. Does bombing schools with white phosphorous seem like something the Nazis might have done? Again, the comparison is not at all preposterous.

Cartoon 5 - There's really no debating that the IDF treats the Palestinian people, Gazans in particular, like dogs, nor is there any debating that they do everything in their power to attempt to control the information that reaches the international press. Undebatable.

Cartoon 6 - Once again, the Palestinians were as good as dogs under the Sharon government. Gaza and the West Bank are gulags, plain and simple.

Cartoon 7 - Qualified validity under the same lines of reasoning as Cartoon 1.

Cartoon 8 - This one is pretty much wrong in its interpretation of the nature of U.S.-Israel relations, but only in that it misinterprets who butters who's bread. Israel is the client state of the United States, not the other way around. We are, however, undeniably complicit in its atrocities. Fortunately, public attitudes in the U.S. are moving away from unilateral Israeli support in some circles.

Cartoon 9 - Same situation as cartoon 8. Thinking that 'the Jews' control the geopolitical hegemonic system of the United States [rather than merely the corporate sector] is conspiracy theorist nonsense.

Cartoon 10 - Israeli refusal to stop illegal settlements in the Bank and the Heights clearly indicates that they prefer expansion to security and have no respect for international law.

Cartoon 14 - Probably the most undeniably true of the bunch.

Cartoon 15 - Will the West Bank get its water when all of this is said and done? Will the Gazans get their coastal natural gas?

Precisely **one** of those cartoons is absolutely untrue. Many of them are only partially true. Many of them are, indeed, anti-Semitic and ugly. More than half of them are completely true. You're either a fucking idiot, totally brainwashed, or both. Fuck off. "

Due to the harsh winter here in central europe I recently decided to grab a pair of fivefingers (the KSO model). They are quite pricey but definitely worth it. You feel every pebble, spiky stone (OUCH!) and different surface below your feet and totally feel in control (They are, of course, pretty slippery on ice, fell flat on my ass just today). Putting them on is quite a challenge but it gets easier with time. Plus, I strongly advice getting a pair of (expensive) complimentary socks, because when I ran without them recently I got a nasty blister. Also, they look like gorilla feet (got the black ones), so you should be comfortable with baffled gazes."

I didn't say you did. However, insisting that we respect beliefs that harm our society is not compatible with the spirit of protest. If you have been participating in protests while insisting upon respect, it would appear that you are experiencing some dissonance. 

&gt;I'm talking about not yelling at someone in a way that immediately gets me into a fucking fist-fight or ostracized by my family when calm discussion would do the same.

There won't be much calm discussion when people have no respect for *you* simply because you don't buy into religion. Religious folk who can withstand any kind of criticism of their beliefs are disappointingly rare, making such opportunities practically theoretical.

&gt;Nono, these are not 'in-of-itself' theories, these are people throwing their beliefs upon the world in a violent and oppressive manner which I will oppose whether it stems from religion or political ideology or philosophy. It's not religion that makes these things bad, it's the power and oppression which are not unique to religion.

Yeah, that is *exactly my point*. People in positions of power impose their beliefs on others by way of religious fiat. Religious fiat trumps all other fiats because of its arbitrary divinity. Therefore its fiat is unique.

&gt;Really? You should look into the secular history of Stalinist Russia. I'm not saying divine fiat helps, but it's not unique. It's equally as bad as any oppression, and nothing about 'religion' makes it any worse.

Religion most certainly makes it worse, because its fiat is completely arbitrary. The reasons why the Catholic Church objects to condoms is not in any way based on science or logical deduction based on observation of the natural world. It's an emotion-based argument grounded in the misbegotten virtue of faith and inserted into the minds of impressionable people by those who simply want more power for themselves.

Even Stalinist Russia did not go that far. For all of Stalin's terrible crimes, his motivations were based on a very simple fact: Russia's industry was lagging far behind that of Europe and was in desperate need of modernization in general. There is nothing illogical about the source of his motivation. He just carried out his mission with violence and paranoia.

By contrast, religion officially promotes ""good"" behavior on the basis of unsupportable logic (that my god is real and all the others are false, if you do this or that you burn for eternity, etc). But what is ""good""? To a Christian, volunteering at a soup kitchen and demonizing homosexuals may both be considered ""good."" Religion makes morality itself as arbitrary as its claim to authority."

&gt; They didn't. .... [quotes wikipedia at me]

This is one of those rare topics on which I know a little more than wikipedia.  While events were unfolding, Icesave savers were repeatedly assured that their savings were covered by the Icelandic Deposit Guarantees and Investor-Compensation Scheme.  It was also repeatedly reported in the press that this was the case.

Here is what Icesave published on their website at http://www.icesave.co.uk/financial-protection.html in [July 2008](http://web.archive.org/web/20080728042454/www.icesave.co.uk/financial-protection.html)

    The maximum protection per account holder is 100% of the first £35,000 of savings that you hold with
    us (the same as every FSA regulated bank and building society in the UK). In the unlikely event of a
    claim, any compensation is payable within three months.
    
    The protection itself is provided by two schemes (sometimes referred to as a passport scheme) – the
    end result being that the total amount protected is the same as if your savings were only protected
    by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The protection works as follows:
    
    * The first level of protection is provided under the Icelandic Deposit Guarantees and
    Investor-Compensation Scheme. The maximum protection under this scheme is 100% of the first
    €20,887 (or the sterling equivalent) of savings that you hold with us.
    * The second level of protection is provided by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme
    (www.fscs.org.uk). This scheme tops-up your protection so that the protection per account holder, under 
    both schemes, is equal to 100% of the first £35,000 of savings that you hold with us.
    * Under EU law compensation for any losses incurred due to the failure of a bank should be paid
    within three months - regardless of whether it is through a passport scheme or the UK Financial
    Services Compensation Scheme.

(You can check that the top up arrangement was agreed with the UKs FSA [here](http://www.fscs.org.uk//consumer/making_a_claim/deposits/EEA_firms_that_have_topped_up/))

See also [here](http://www.lovemoney.com/news/manage-your-finances/is-saving-with-icelandic-banks-safe-2954.aspx) for third parties saying the same thing, and a quote from the MD of Icesave on the issue.

The Scheme was set up by the icelandic government with [Act No 98/1999](http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/laws-and-regulations/nr/1165) in order to put into effect broader EU regulations (see Article 21 for exactly which ones) intended to guarantee retail deposits.  Also see Article 13 about banks with foreign branches still being able to take part in the scheme (which is what icesave did).

Also, see the following quote in the wikipedia article you linked:
&gt; The result of the meeting was a letter on behalf of the Icelandic Minister for Business Affairs stating that ""[i]f needed the Icelandic Government will support the Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund in raising the necessary funds, so that the Fund would be able to meet the minimum compensation limits in the event of a failure of Landsbanki and its UK branch.""

It's quite clear to me that the Icelandic government gave a guarantee for those deposits, and that if it hadn't, icesave would have had many fewer investors.  Now they want to renege on that guarantee.  I can sympathise somewhat with that, given their situation (and that is their claim under EU law - that systemic failure allows them to duck out of their commitments), but lets not try to pretend that they never made the guarantee in the first place."

That seems to be the crux. He wants to bill your company for the work his company will do. I'd count that his higher-ups approved the plan, 'cause he can't do it something like that on a personal whim. From ""business"" sense, of course, price tag for a switch might be enormous. But if that problem is waived aside by higher-ups, it's a dead alley to explore.

You're saying that you're running *infrastructure* (albeit I guess that includes some development). Infrastructure is slightly less likely to be ran from East Europe. That's +1 for you.

Easy guess is also that you also feel much less comfortable with .NET/Windows. -1 for you.

So your problem is that your ground is being taken under you, which is tough. There are two paths IMO: start looking for another job, or join the .NET party. Given that you're in the company long(er), that should count. At any rate, it looks like you're on top of existing working stuff. If so, and if company relies on that stuff much, you're safe for enough time to find a place to jump to, or to get up to scratch with .NET.

Whatever you choose, most important seems to be to keep your cool, put on a more active face (important when you're just bidding time) and, **especially**, abstain from displaying any ""emotional"" involvement (e.g. open source good, M$ bad)."

At some point, Fried Chicken became an exemplar of what has been called ""Soul Food"" - the resulting cuisine of African American slaves that combined African, European and ""new world"" cooking techniques and foods in the Southeast US. This is how Fried Chicken and Watermelon (which is an African descendant fruit) became racist (along with some 19th century 4chan-style memetics).

These days, ""Soul Food"" essentially doesn't exist, in my opinion. There is still some remaining concept of ""Southern Food"" that has similarities and separates itself from the generic national American cuisine.

So while Fried Chicken may have been closely associated with African American descendants, in say 1950, by the time KFC became part of a multi-national company in 1980, it's safe to say that Fried Chicken is not inherently racist. "

are nothing much more than a summary of animal slaughter techniques
for primitive races across the world. Kipling travelled widely in his
youth and collected many of these pseudo-myths from his encounters
with primitive peoples.

Thus ""Sing song of Old Man Kangaroo"" refers to the australian
aborigines technique of persistence hunting marsupials. When the first
aborigines arrived in Australia, kangaroos were slow ungainly
creatures with four short legs, not unlike the Kipling
illustrations. Under evolutionary pressure from hunting they evolved
into the modern species.  Sadly, persistence hunting today is confined
to some of the Fukawi tribes in central africa, though it is being
resurrected by long distance runners in North America as a useful
adjunt in training for ultramarathons.

""The Elephants Child"" metaphorically recounts another african hunting
technique, notably waiting immersed in waterholes and rivers until a
memory of elephants arrived, then grabbing the submerged trunks and
nailing them to logs until the beast suffocated. The ""crocodile"" and
""bi-colored python rock snake"" were just symptomatic of other hazards
inherent in this strategy.

Inuit hunters would assemble together a bundle of driftwood with seal tendons
and jam it down the throat of baleen whales to choke them: the dead
cetacean would beach some days later and the dead carcass would
provide blubber and ambergris to feed a tribe for months afterwards.

In the middle east, whole stuffed camel was a delicacy and camels
could be captured at oases by placing a mirror at waters edge and
tempting for the beast to come and admire its reflection.

Back to Africa, rhinoceri could be tempted with packets of breadcrumbs
and leopards thoroughly confused by squid ink daubed on the yellow
Kalahari sands.

Europeans were generally above these things, though in hard times, cat
was a nourishing substitute for other forms of protein and it was
necessary to find ways of keeping cats close to the house so they
could be slaughtered for food when needed. ""The Cat that Walked by
Himself"" was a morality tale making the point that ones' children
could starve if one let felines do their own thing, rather than
consent to being fully domesticated like the sheep, dog and horse, all
of which were accepted food sources in times of need.

There are two basic ways in which banks can expand retail operations across borders: by opening branches of the mother company abroad or founding a separate company with its own capital, management, etc. Looks like EU favours the first approach, so while Icelandic banks in the UK operate within that country's jurisdiction they belong to respective companies in Iceland, and that means that they don't have any assets or liabilities or capital of their own - they are just a bunch of offices.

The sane way to do this is the second one, since if a foreign bank operating in your country is actually a legally separate company then the only foreign things about it are the brand name, some staff, and easier access to foreign financing. In all other respects it's no different from any of your domestic banks, and should it implode what you expect to happen happens. It has assets, liabilities, and capital which can be inspected, regulated, arrested. It has to play by the same rules every other bank in the country plays with respect to deposit insurance, foreign currency regime, crossborder operations, and so on. 

So the real lesson that needs to be learned here is that this situation was caused not by reckless speculation, bankster greed or whatever else - it was caused by the push to deregulate crossborder banking, of which the UK was one of the most eager participants. Therefore, Brits, you have your own government to thank for this first and foremost.

Suppose, as you advocate, the population had access to the same type of weapons the army (and government) does. That would mean people having access to tanks, bombers, non-detectable submarines, bio-chemical weapons, and worst of all, nuclear weapons. In such a situation, one crazy person, or even simpler, one stupid accident, and you destroy a sizable part of the population (of a city, country, or world, depending on what you use). The weapons that were available at the time (I'll guess basic rifles and rudimentary explosives, but correct me if I am wrong) did not have the lethality that today's weapons do, and could therefore, without too much concern, be handled by mostly anybody. Even with guns of course you have the possibility of a crazy person shooting randomly in malls or simply of an ND, but it's limited to at most 30 people.

Furthermore, the strength of the different agencies that are part of the American government do not only lie in the type of weapons they have but also, very importantly, in the training and organization they have. It is extremely unlikely that you and some of your fellow citizen will be well-trained and enough to resist the CIA for any sizable amount of time. It just delays and potentially limits the potential for abuse.

Last but not least, even though we have never used (because, mostly, it has never been possible since the 18th century) revolt to control our government, I think we can safely argue that it has been checked and balanced pretty effectively. Of course there are scandals, and abuse, but we've done OK enough over the past 2 centuries to be, until recently, the nation the most associated with Freedom. I'd also like to add that European countries, even though they have way thougher gun control laws, seem to me still very liberal (even though once again there are exceptions) while other countries where guns are easily obtainable are corrupt as fuck (I'm thinking of Afghanistan at the moment, but it probably applies to most African countries).

My conclusion is that maybe the second amendment is an anachronism. I think that gun right people understand that generally cause most don't argue they will take down the government but instead that they need their weapons for self-defense if they were attacked by fellow citizens."

They didn't, and they're not complaining. This is ONLY about individual savings accounts, which were insured under EU and Icelandic law.

Don't forget, this Icesave debacle is only a tiny part of Iceland's collapse. Icelandic banks actually stole anywhere from 10 to 15 times that much money, if you count the *investment* accounts. Many of these accounts were held by large pension funds in England and Holland, and as a result of the loss, many old people in England and Holland will live in poverty in their old ages.

But no one is even bothering about that right now. No one is asking Iceland to pay any of those losses, which like I said, are many, many times bigger than Icesave.

All that people are asking for is that Iceland pay the minimum insured amount, **only** on savings accounts held by individuals, which are supposed to be protected by law.

And this is what Iceland doesn't seem to want to pay. So let's not confuse the issue with investment losses or local governments and stuff. That is all money gone forever, away from the people who earned it, into the pockets of Icelandic bankers. It's a total loss. Gone.

The only issue is that small fraction which was held by individual depositors under Icesave."

The political division (note that there has historically also been a divide between the Slavic cultures in the Eastern half of Europe and the Germanic and Latin cultures in the Western part; Russia's dreams of Slavic unity were very important in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, not all politically Eastern European countries and cultures are Slavic: one example of this is Hungary) has its origins in the Cold War. The fact that the typical division of Europe into a Western part and an Eastern part is political, and not geographical, is obvious if you look at Greece, for example, which is located to the east of many ""Eastern European"" countries but was considered part of Western Europe during the cold war. Geographically, Greece is, of course, part of Southern Europe.

However, the political division is still highly relevant due to the extant economic dispirities between the part of Europe that was formerly dominated by the Soviet Union and the wealthy US-dominated part of Europe. Few countries in the political Eastern Europe are wealthier than any in Western Europe (Slovenia and the Czech Republic have higher GDPs per capita than Portugal, but I can't think of any other cases). For that reason it is still common and indeed very useful even today to divide Europe using the old political division, which is not based on geography. Strictly, however, if one is talking about geography, Eastern Europe only encompasses the Baltic states (although Estonia does, probably mainly for PR reasons, often consider itself as one of the Nordic countries), Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, Romania, and possibly Bulgaria and Serbia (most of which happen to still be under Russian influence, whether voluntary or involuntary)."

From the information I've gathered on teh internetz, it seems that countries with more established EFL practices such as Japan, Korea, and Europe (generally) tend to have higher requirement/experience levels for most positions. 

To answer your question directly, depending on where you're going, just find a cheapo online course with a legitimate-looking certificate. If you think this is an actual career choice, and you have a spare $3k then go with Oxford Seminars, or some other CELTA course (there is a good one in NYC but I can't recall the name)

They needed to stop any and all of this ""not the son of God stuff"" because it messed up their fairytale. I mean it must be a fairy tale because it isn't logical. I mean these men might have been well meaning but after all they had to be wrong because none of this can possibly be true. This was really about power, money, and influence. So let's just start there.
&gt; So please explain to me, as you see it, the basis of their lie and how and why they would develop it, propagate it and die for it.

My position is that your faith is inaccurate even when it comes to issues that you consider core to Christianity. I never went into specific details as to how it happened and what was the motive. Motive is irrelevant for me to prove my point. I merely have to show that belief has changed from earlier faith of Ebonites to your Gentile Christian faith. Consider Ebonites who did not believe that Jesus was son of God. Was someone among them lying about the true nature of Jesus? How about all the other faiths in the world, how did those came to be? 

And in fact you suggested (perhaps sarcastically) that opposing views were suppressed. Would that really be so hard to believe. It is not as if Christian Church does not have history of killing heretics (and I am not just talking of Catholics here). Oldest Christian sect today are Kopts in Egypt. They survived more than thousand years under Muslim rule because Muslims prefer to tax the unbelievers rather than burn them at stake. There is no way Kopts would have survived in Europe.  Having this in mind, is it really that hard to believe that earlier and perhaps more accurate Christian groups got eliminated and their books burned by people who championed faith you now believe in. Call it an evolution of Christianity. Perhaps those who believed that Jesus was the son of god back in the first century were looked at by Jewish Christians the way you look at Mormons now. 

&gt; They may even have believed their own fairytale.

Would that be so strange? Consider the beliefs you hold: you think that Hitler may go to heaven while non-christian soccer moms would go to hell; You do not think that eye of needle means eye of the needle;  etc. 

&gt; I mean it must be a fairy tale because it isn't logical.

Yes! That would be a strong indication. 

&gt; As for the rest. Religion is highly feelings based. In fact is almost entirely feelings based. Conversion is not. There are certainly emotions involved because of conviction then joy but conversion is is a purely, physical experience. When you are converted you are physically changed. You physically begin to actually hear a voice you never heard before. When I say physical I mean (by your definition) psycho physical. Actually physically, hearing, someone speak.Like someone is standing right there with you. The problem with that whole scenario is that it is absolutely insane for people who have not been converted to believe that.

If something is physical, then it can be measured. What can I measure in someone who converts to Christianity that I cannot measure with someone who converted to another faith. Members of other faiths also believe that they are in contact with their personal God.  Everything you said above can be explained with known phenomena such as placebo effect. 

&gt; is that Jesus started it all by telling the Apostles ""But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the SPIRIT of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me"". And ""I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now (mainly because they were not converted yet so like you it would be impossible for them to accept). When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not SPEAK on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you"". (I mean here you have the Trinity. Jesus speaking about the father telling them he is going to sent the Holy Spirit)

&gt; I know that Islam likes to twist this to claim that this is a reference to Mohammad but I know that twist is wrong

I don't know. This quote actually does fit well with Islamic teachings.

&gt; because, wow, this spiritual person actually does exist, and go figure, he actually frigging TALKS! Actual words! like you and I are doing right now. I've got to tell you though it really, really bugs me that although I am simply one of millions who experience this, to others it simply can't possibly ever be true.

That is actually great. If you can talk to Holly Spirit, than we can easily settle this argument.  Have holly Spirit tell you what the value of NYSE, NASDAQ and S&amp;P500 will be on Friday at 5 PM. Post the value tomorrow and we will check the result on Friday.


&gt; None of it makes sense. Like Paul said: ""we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and FOLLY to Gentiles"". I had not stopped to consider that it is folly to you. It has been for two thousand years. So, since God draws only who he wills how do I show you that hearing the Holy Spirits voice is not folly but an actual physical occurrence shared by a ton of people. I mean if this was medicine and millions of people suddenly started showing up at hospitals over it you couldn't deny it but since that is not the case what are we to do? I venture to think maybe it is not possible. I know in my past I never could have been convinced so what are we to do?

You raise an interesting question. Why don't I believe? Why are so many people Atheists, and how come most people do not believe in your God? There is nobody on this planet who does not believe in sun or moon, how come so many do not believe in God? You think something as basic as your creator would be  obvious to everyone, but it is not. Why isn't God obvious?

&gt; Maybe talk about stuff he says

Good idea! What does holy spirit tell you?

&gt; But maybe indirectly another point can be made. If a physical voice of the Holy Spirit is true than that shows that maybe there is a holy Spirit and if there is a holy spirit, there must also be Satan and he talks to people too

How do you reconcile this conundrum? 

&gt; The plain and simplest of truths is that I know things are true because I hear, like millions of others, the holy spirits voice. You do not. I know you do not for the same reason I know a others are not saved, or have a false religion or teaching. Simply and plainly because of what they say or teach.

But you probably see that they must have the same opinion of you.

&gt;  Therefore I am at a huge, almost insurmountable disadvantage with you. You have this huge arsenal of reason and logic you've developed because hearing voices has to be sick.

Well thank you. But I am not smarter, or more capable than you. I could simply be right. Let's face it, some of the conclusions based on your beliefs are absurd (like the whole soccer moms in hell).  And many things you believe supernatural have simpler and more worldly explanations (like thinking that writers of bible were inspired by god, when they could have been simply your plain religious folk)

&gt;  It must be delusional because it cannot be proven or tested. Your whole premise is founded on ""this cannot be possible because it does not make sense"". How does one prove that what cannot make sense is actually happening without physically manifesting that event. I don't think you can.

How do you know it exists then? Would you believe me if I were to make an absurd claim that I cannot prove?

EDIT: Here is an interesting question: Imagine that your faith is wrong, is there anything that I (or anyone) could say, or do or show you to prove to you that you are wrong? This is the basic idea that sent me to path of Atheism. "

Agreed. The British tend to get a free pass by many people because they happened to be on the winning side. The things they did in Africa and Asia were often every bit as terrible as what the Germans did (with the exception of the Final Solution).

&gt;And then we became allies with the Soviets of all countries. Our agreements with them sold half of Europe into slavery for half a century.

Given the political climate of the mid-20th century (fascism vs. commuism), eastern Europe was likely screwed no matter what. Both the Germans and the Russians considered it to be a chessboard.

We didn't have to do this of course. We have multiple opportunities early on to invade them if we wanted to before they really built up their strategic threat.

Finally, things worked out in the end. The west won. Sure, we have to deal with some of the side effects (e.g. the military-industrial complex), but that was likely to occur no matter what because of technological advance.

&gt; **The benefits (accoridng to the neutral Mayo Clinic) Circumcision may have health benefits, including**

According to the [American Academy of Pediatrics](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686) (keep in mind that circumcision is currently a [prevalent religio-cultural tradition in the U.S.](http://circumstitions.com/Docs/KNMG-policy.pdf)):

&gt; Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.

About the specific items you listed:

&gt; **Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The risk of urinary tract infections in the first year is low, but these infections may be up to 10 times as common in uncircumcised baby boys. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later on.**

That's the relative risk; consider the absolute risk, as discussed by the AAP:

&gt; Data from Europe, based on a largely uncircumcised population, report UTI rates of 1.2% for infant boys.73 The number is similar to the rates of 0.7% to 1.4% reported for uncircumcised males in the United States and Canada.72,74  In comparison, UTI rates for circumcised male infants in the United States and Canada are reported to be 0.12% to 0.19%.72,74  Although these cross-cultural data do not provide information on specific individual risk factors, the similarity of European and American UTI rates for uncircumcised male infants support an association between circumcision status and UTI. Using these rates and the increased risks suggested from the literature, **one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a UTI during the first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants.**

*UTIs are RARE!*

Almost all UTIs are quickly eradicated with simple antibiotics, which are much cheaper and much less invasive than subjecting *healthy* infants to genital-reduction surgery.

Consider [these numbers](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/): 

&gt; Wiswell's sensational statistic, that circumcision resulted in a ""ten to hundred times decrease in urinary tract infections in circumcised boys,"" has often been quoted; however, it is misleading. In fact, UTIs are so rare in any case that, using Wiswell's data, 50 to 100 healthy boys would have to be circumcised in order to prevent a UTI from developing in only one patient. (Using more recent data from a better-controlled study, the number of unnecessary operations needed to prevent one hospital admission for UTI would jump to 195.49)

According to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm):

&gt; UTIs are rare in men, so all cases require investigation.

*Did you ever pause to think about the other sex in this case?*

According to a [Scandinavian study](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/)):

&gt; girls and boys have about the same incidence of UTI in the first year of life. Girls have a four times higher incidence of UTI in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys.

and according to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm):

&gt;  UTI is 50 times more common in women, with about 5 per cent per year developing symptoms.

&gt; UTI is uncommon in men below 60 years of age, but the frequency is similar in men and women in older age groups.

and according to [emedicine](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231574-overview):

&gt; adult women [in the U.S.] are 30 times more likely than men to develop a UTI.

Good Lord!

*Where's your argument for messing around with female genitals? After all, it's been noted that removing the labia and clitoral hood reduces smegma and enhances hygiene.*

Just think about that for a while.

&gt; **Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis may be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis).**

There are [2 types of phimosis](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777539-overview) (also, [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ahawi/i_am_an_uncircumcised_21_year_old_who_never/c0hkc5g)):

* **Physiologic**: When boys are born, their penises are immature; the foreskin is fused to the head of the penis (ripping them apart is the first step of neonatal circumcision).

* **Pathologic (genuine problem)**: The foreskin becomes unretractable after it was already retractable; this usually happens because the preputial orifice (the ""opening"") becomes scarred and therefore too inelastic.

According to a [2-year study](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119091453/abstract): 

&gt; The incidence of pathological phimosis in boys was 0.4 cases/1000 boys per year, or 0.6% of boys affected by their 15th birthday

Ooooh! Big Problem!

It gets more interesting, though:

&gt; \[which is\] a value... exceeded more than eight-fold by the proportion of English boys currently circumcised for 'phimosis'.

That means a lot of boys are being circumcised for a condition they don't actually have.

Sadly, American doctors have been traditionally ignorant for most of the last century about *physiologic* phimosis, so many boys have been wrongly diagnosed with *pathologic* phimosis and subsequently referred for circumcision unnecessarily.

Worse, it's been the advice (until the near past) of numerous American medical organizations and child-rearing resources that parents forcibly retract the foreskin in order to prevent the normal adhesions of physiologic phimosis. However, this forcible retraction rips the foreskin from the head of the penis, which can result in scarring that induces *pathologic* phimosis; the wounded foreskin and head can actually heal together again, which is why it was advised to perform this forcible retraction at each washing, thereby compounding the problem.

Furthermore, many legitimate cases could probably be resolved with a few months of stretching (perhaps with steroidal ointment). Surgically, preputioplasty is popular in Europe and MUCH less invasive than circumcision.

Did you know that women get phimosis too? Their clitoral hoods are too tight to allow their clitorises to engorge fully and they can similarly suffer from infections as a result.

&gt; **This can also lead to inflammation of the head of the penis.**

This is called [balanitis](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/), and it occurs in circumcised males as well; it can be caused by excessive washing (especially when an abrasive soap is used), suggesting that over-zealous parents might be causing some portion of cases.

&gt; **Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men.**

Again, look at absolute risk.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (same link):

&gt; Cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the annual age-adjusted incidence of penile cancer is 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 males in the United States.\[91\]  In countries where the overwhelming majority of men are uncircumcised, the rate of penile cancer varies from 0.82 per 100 000 in Denmark\[92\] to 2.9 to 6.8 per 100 000 in Brazil93  and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000 in India.\[94\]

&gt; ...

&gt; An annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 translates to 9 to 10 cases of penile cancer per year per 1 million men. Although the risk of developing penile cancer in an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is increased more than threefold, it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing studies.

There is evidence that the ""benefit"" of circumcision in the case of penile cancer is only conferred to men circumcised in infancy, and there is a strong link between HPV infection of the penis and penile cancer. Therefore, it's pretty clear that preventing penile cancer (already an extremely rare disease) is really a matter of preventing a sexual disease that is known to cause cancer: Then, why not use the much cheaper and far less invasive approach of pushing safe sexual practices, WHICH MUST BE DONE ANYWAY.

&gt; **Decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Safe sexual practices remain essential, but circumcised men may have a slightly lower risk of certain sexually transmitted diseases — including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.**

Please [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9rvgf/pascals_wager_again_quite_a_nice_comic/c0e5kjy).

In particular, note:

* [This recent 30-year study in New Zealand](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=Abstract) reported results that are ""consistent with recent population-based cross-sectional studies in developed countries, which found that early childhood circumcision does not markedly reduce the risk of the common STIs in the general population in such countries.""

* [In this recent study out of South Africa](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490F-44F5-AC5E-17893A3764BA.asp) modeled various means of preventing HIV, and made the following conclusion about circumcision: ""We were surprised by how little effect it had""; condoms and treatment availability were forecast to be 20x more effective and cheaper. And that's where the HIV prevalence is [11% overall (16% in some parts and upwards of 30% in some age groups)](http://www.avert.org/safricastats.htm)! How much of an effect would circumcision have in the U.S. where the prevalence is *0.6%* (of sexually active adults)?

* Of the 0.6% of sexually active U.S. citizens who are infected with HIV, *over half* are men who have sex with men (gays/bisexuals), for whom circumcision has been shown to be useless in a number of studies. A large chunk more of HIV positive individuals are users of intravenous drugs. **The point is that there is a very narrow population that is at risk, so it's insane to target the general population of infants who won't be having sex for nearly 2 decades.**

The circumcision of a *healthy* child is plain genital mutilation and child abuse."

Actually No Child Left Behind changed that... About 10 public schools in Minneapolis where I live have been shut down for poor performance in the past 5 years or so. Not that I'm a big fan of the program, but bad schools do in fact get shut down rather often... and MN is known for high quality public education, I bet the impact was more severe in other places.

&gt;that the whole point of being a consumer is finding the maximum amount of service (or the highest quality good) for the lowest possible price.

Ideally this is true, but sufficiently high quality is only attainable through proper regulation.  Again, back to the telecom example... Of course internet and cable access is voluntary, but not having it puts you at a massive disadvantage these days... Lack of regulation allows cable companies to engage in blatantly anti-competitive practices, and pretty much anywhere in the U.S. you have exactly one ISP to choose from because for some reason agreeing not to built onto eachother's turf doesn't violate antitrust.

In most of europe, they have service that is 10 times faster for less than half the cost because they have sensible regulations that ensure real competition... Basically the companies are required to lease their infrastructure to eachother at a fair price, which opens the door to all sorts of ISPs, and real competition.  I will concede that this type of regulation wont work for everything and should be applied in a surgical fashion, and I am by no means suggesting full government control of markets.  Regulations should only be used to increase competition, increase consumer choice, and protect the environment to a rational (not some hippy greenpeace ideological) extent.  Telecom service clearly improves with such regulation, and insurance and banking would benefit from this regulatory philosophy as well.  

The whole idea behind free market theory is that free competition creates the best product, and you'll find no argument from me there.  However, some regulation is required to ensure that real competition exists.  People engaging in monopolistic or anti-competitive / antitrust type behavior destroys anything that resembles real competition.  

&gt;The standard of living in modern representative democracies is in spite of them being about half socialist, not because of it. Note that all the problems are in industries with high amounts of government regulation.

This isn't really true.  Again, back to the Norway example: When they discovered the oil reserves, instead of selling or leasing the resources to private companies, they created a public/private partnership that ensures that the oil reserves directly benefit the entire country. As a result, Norway went from being a poor, rural country to being an extremely modern nation that enjoys the highest standard of living, the best health care, and the highest average take-home income (yes, after factoring taxes of anywhere in the world.  They also have zero national debt.  

Now, I understand that we aren't Norway, and I don't think we should seize anyone's property or cancel anyone's leases.  But, I don't think there would be anything wrong with the U.S. setting up a similar public/private company to extract newly discovered resources and use the proceeds from that to pay down the national debt and finance education and health care.  

Basically, I am a [social capitalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capitalism).  I don't believe that socialism and capitalism are mutually exclusive, and that the best parts of both systems can be combined in a way that mitigates the negative consequences of both.

Also, I want to thank you for having a civil discussion even though you clearly disagree.  Most people get rather rabid over this subject.

Colando aqui o que eu disse na thread da lista:

Eu não sei se todo mundo conhece como o reddit funciona, então vou tentar explicar:

Ele é dividido em vários subreddits, /r/technology, /r/comics, /r/politics etc. Dentro de cada um desses, as pessoas postam links interessantes e os outros usuários podem ""votar pra cima"" (upmod) ou ""votar pra baixo"", e daí os mais interessantes ficam no topo; também em cada link tem uma parte de comentários em que os usuários comentam e os comentários também podem ser votados pra cima ou pra baixo. Quando você cria seu usuário, você pode ""assinar"" os subreddits da sua preferência, daí eles aparecem na sua página principal.

No caso, o Valessio criou um subreddit do Partido Pirata dentro do reddit.com pra discussões.

O que eu falei em outra thread que talvez seja interessante também é hospedar ""um reddit"" (é software livre desde o ano passado) só pra gente, e criar um subreddit pra cada agrupamento lógico que nos convenha (/r/antonio, /r/rj, /r/noticias_gerais etc). Teria o trabalho de instalar e manter a coisa toda, mas acho que seria um bom substituto para o fórum (até os comentários são melhor organizados pra discussões que o fórum, as respostas de cada comentário ficam identadas direito e tal).

Uma vantagem de usar o reddit.com/r/PartidoPirata é que eu posso simplesmente assinar esse subreddit e os posts vão aparecer na minha página inicial do reddit :P

De qualquer maneira (hospedando um reddit pra gente ou não), é uma ótima idéia!"

Lots of options in the 15th Century, such as the fall of Constantinople, the split of the Roman Papacy, the rise of Tamerlane, and the rise of the Incan Empire.

What bugs me most is that I think it would be pretty easy to solve this problem once and for all using two punches:

1) There should be legal, government owned, brothels (and other sex services). Like how alcohol is handled in Sweden and gambling in the Netherlands: a state monopoly. The girls that work here get to see doctors and therapists to ensure that they are conciously choosing the work.
regulated private brothels won't work: some profit seeking pimps will simply have backrooms with underage girls for screened clients.

2) Prostitutes outside this system are not prosecuted, but helped and, if they want, offered to work in the system.
Customers and pimps who work outside the system get extreme punishments. The assumption is made that if you work outside the system, you are doing so because you believe that the girl is BOTH underage and unwilling. It is assumed that you believe she is a sex slave. 
When soliciting a prostitute outside the system, it is assumed your intention was to violently rape an underage girl.
The police could set up honeypots.

Very few would dare to solicit sex outside the system, and they could get caught by the honeypots.
And the system offers a legal substitute.

So demand for illegal prostitutes would dry up and the traffickers would have no market.

There would still be a very small demand for underage girls, which can not be met by the legal system, but not enough, I think, to sustain an organised illegal sex industry.
And if you put that minority in jail for a very long time, then they can't buy anymore, so demand is further reduced."

- No european is silly enough to take the bible literally (at least I've never met one). This is fairly common in the states.

- Europeans don't evangelize. In 10 years I've only seen 1 european evangelist, and I suspect she had deep mental problems, as she was acting like a psych ward patient (beyond even what you find in a normal evangelist ;). I've met a lot more American evangelicals in Europe than I have European evangelicals (which I don't think really exists).

- Religion doesn't have such power over government policy as it does in the states. It does have a little, but very little.

So, vestiges like kings and queens which simply are historical carryovers with very little real world significance, there's a pretty huge difference.

The public space is subject to rules, one of those rules is to make your face seen for every public transaction, it is your right to do what you want at home. This is not against Islam as you can see women can still wear a veil if they so much want to.

Most burkha wearing people (who are not many at all) are newcomers and you would be surprised that even most Muslim women (seen interviews on TV) disagree with women wearing the burkha.

You have to wear a veil or something when you enter some Islamic countries because it's a religious mandate enforced by law.
Here you have to abide to French law, and yes, freedom of religion is guaranteed, but there's a thin line between living your religion and wearing and overdisplaying it in front of others.

Most French people think, in the street we are all the same, we are in public and we are citizens of an agreement, in this agreement we would like you to please keep your religion to yourself thank you."

Both Europe and the US maintain population growth through immigration, not through the birthrates of the native-born.  Western democracies aren't the source of the population problem, Duggars, Mormons, and the ""quiverfull"" movement notwithstanding.

The vast population explosion is in developing nations.  To handle this, I'm of the opinion that we (Western nations) should tie food aid to developing nations to their development of a population management strategy.  Such a strategy should not be imposed by the West, but rather developed by the people of the particular nation to suit what will work within their own culture.  It would have to include -- and demonstrate progress toward -- measurable, clear objectives.

As far as we in the West are concerned, I completely agree that we should not be rewarding people for having children; we should end not only direct welfare payments, but dependent tax credits for more than (let's say) 2 kids, and cheaper ""family"" health insurance rates.  As my grandmother used to say, ""If you can't afford to raise it, don't HAVE it!""

Example of the cheaper health insurance:  My employer pays $800/month for my (Employee Only) health insurance, $1200/month for Employee + 1, and $1600/month for Employee + Family, however many ""family"" is.  It can be parents and 6 kids.  How is it appropriate to charge the same for two single people as for eight people?

While that's not money directly from my personal pocket (if Employee Only insurance were less expensive, I wouldn't get a raise), the same applies to people buying insurance privately.  Single people have to subsidize the reproduction of others.

I agree with legal and free abortion/sterilization, though I'd prefer to focus on free access to birth control and science-based sex education.  Personally, I'd rather see fewer abortions and increased reproductive responsibility.  Ideally, abortions would only be needed in cases of rape, incest, health of the mother, or similar cases.

Do we really NEED ""fertility clinics""?  Aren't there enough unwanted and neglected children around to be adopted?"

The logical and scientific paradigm starts and ends with observations. You make observations, formulate a hypothesis, make predictions, test, and make more observations to explain what's going on around you. If your hypothesis doesn't fit the observations then you discard it and start over.

The faith paradigm starts and end with the correctness of whatever they have faith in; they explain what they observe in the context of their faith. When someone who thinks like this tries to incorporate logic and the scientific method into their thought process what they come up with is usually grossly skewed to fit with their faith.

This incompatibility between these viewpoints is why it's so frustrating to argue with a ""true believer"" and why conversely the believers get frustrated with us logical folks; we just don't understand why the other is unwilling to agree with our basic assumptions.

One possible approach to this discussion is to first make sure the person you are talking to is aware of these differing thought paradigms and understands the difference between them. You follow that up with a discussion of which has yielded better results; e.g the faith paradigm gave us things like the dark ages in Europe, the Inquisition, and witch hunts while the logical paradigm gave us modern medicine and engineering.

Another thing to remember is to not make it about Atheism vs. Religion since that won’t get you anywhere. Focus instead on using logic vs. using faith to understand and interact with the world around you and contrast and compare the results yielded by each approach.

Outlawing the symbol strips Muslim women of this identifying feature. Wearing the Burkha's singles them out. Assigning yellow stars to the Jews singled them out. These actions are actually quite opposite and it could be argued that Islamic clerics and patriarchs are performing divisive action popularized by the Nazis and the French are forcing them to blend with society.

Fair point.  I was more referring to the fact that both laws were meant to marginalize religious subcultures, but that is true that the yellow stars were more an identification tool and the removal of the burqa is more of an ""assimilation"" tool.  However, the ends of both policies I would say are equally nefarious.  Assimilation is not always a worthy goal, particularly when it's assimilation into the genocidal and imperialistic system of Western capitalism.

&gt;The comparison to high heels is also weak. High heels are worn solely through societal peer pressure, and many women (my girlfriend of 7 years, included) do not wear them. Ever. The burkas are enforced by religious law. 

First of all what ""religious law"" in Islam mandates burqas?  Secondly, what is the meaningful difference between a religious decree and a social one?  I feel this question is particularly applicable here when comparing the secular West to the culture of most Muslim immigrants in Europe (largely from the Middle East and North Africa).  While Christianity, the dominant religion in the West, also has ""religious laws,"" they do not carry the same power in the West that ""Islamic laws"" have in many Muslim cultures which are not only far more religious, but also have different social structures (larger emphasis on local politics).  In effect, the ""social laws"" of the West carry at least as much power as ""religious laws"" do in the Muslim world, as the current secular, neoliberal Western system has become the dominant value-defining institution in the West that Islam is in much of the Third World.

&gt;Sure, many women wear them willingly, enjoy them, and whatever, but women who don't enjoy them are often forced to under threat of violence. That's a rather distinct difference.  

As I've said many businesses require high heels, and all sorts of other events and places informally require them, i.e. they are ""expected"" (certain formal gatherings, job interviews, etc.).  It may not be physical violence, but the threat of losing your job, not getting hired for a job you need, or being demeaned and disrespected by your community is certainly a type of forceful coercion."

- Hollywood makes... ""hollywood blockbusters"". Over and over and over and over. Thinking that they are the globe's sole capital in that respect is not only unsophisticated, it's plain dumb. There's a sizeable chunk of the world that simply doesn't watch Hollywood films. There's China, there's European films and there's Bollywood. Then there's Indie films. I rest my case on this one, as it's the simplest one.

- As far as the other ones are concerned, it's much more difficult to judge, and clearly is a matter of taste, but I would argue that music groups that come out of the US are not at all dominating the world. Especially given the amount of music that comes from Canada, and given that Europe listens to an altogether different type of music that can sometimes be labeled ""Eurotrash"", but other times is just *other*.

- Museums: France? England? Italy?! Yes, America has some very good museums. It is not the ""globe's sole superpower"". Seriously. Is this a joke?

- Orchestras: maybe. I don't know enough about it to make an assertion I'm willing to defend against a pack of ravenous wolves.

- Ballet and theatre: no. American ballet and dance is really good, possibly the best (with ABA etc). But once again, to go from there to think they are unrivalled is for lack of a better word: dumb. China has some incredible theatre and dance productions that we as westerners might find incredibly cheesy and over ostentatious, but they are of a stupendous caliber nonetheless.

This leaves the door open for one thing: he says ""remains the globe's sole superpower of entertainment, *along with* ..."".  Maybe he means America is the globe's sole *entertainment* superpower, *and* it also has these other things. In which case, I disagree hands down: America has a style of entertainment which - while probably entertaining to americans - ranges from awesome looking, to mildly entertaining, to plain low brow for foreigners.

Although, even then, I think this explanation is a cop-out as he clearly says ""The arts [...] remains the globe's sole superpower of entertainment"".

I think all political positions should have a one term limit.  Style it after the military: move up or move out.  And once you're out, you're out.  No special retirement fund, no special health care.  Make your laws, and then live with them.

&gt; Also, significantly decrease defense spending to have money for education and infrastructure.

Just an aside: it's been suggested (sorry, can't remember where I heard it) that *defense spending* has been the driving force behind most of Western innovation.  If you don't have powerful enemies, you don't create new weapons and defenses, whose new technology can't be incorporated into other non-military areas.

&gt; Public Education: Get rid of teacher's unions and make teachers accountable for their performance.

I agree that teachers should be held accountable for their performance, but without unions good teachers will be fired because of whiny parents and superintendents.

Why not just implement a salary cap?  X number of dollars for every Y number of employees.  If the rich companies are allowed to buy up all the good players, the Yankee's will always win.

But seriously, why not let them pay whatever they want?  Supply and demand, right.  Believe it or not, most executives at big corporations are pretty damn smart and most people in general **couldn't** do the job.  And note, I'm not talking about bailout companies here. Oh, and I also agree that certain regulations are necessary.

&gt; This is a radical one, but stop making everything in foreign countries. We can still have trade, but don't allow US companies to build all of their products overseas, require them to build here.

What products and what percentage should be built here?  What about products that go into other products.  All of those nickels and dimes will be passed on to the consumer.  It may create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, but they'll be menial and low wage and the workers won't be able to afford anything.

The thing is, I don't have much passion. As for the programming, I started out my undergrad experience as a computer science major (I know, two totally different things), so I'm not totally inexperienced. How did you get started in this field? Every time I try to teach myself something like Python, for instance, I end up feeling totally lost. EDIT: I am a total dork, so I taught myself programs like Dreamweaver and Flash and can write up html by hand, know CSS and whatnot. My issues start with things like Python and C (though I do know Java and use VB (bleh) at my current job.)


There is a great series on HBO (I don't know what the availability of this is in Europe) called ""real sex"" that might be something to look into, in terms of watching together with your husband. It's not porn. It's more of a documentary style show that explores a different aspect of human sex and sexuality in every episode. Watching and talking about it might put him more at ease and get him more educated as well as providing ideas for interesting things to do in the bedroom. 


Also, you might consider writing to Dan Savage with questions about how to get your boyfriend to be more comfortable with talking about sex. He'll likely give you similar advice to what I've given you, but he might be more specific in terms of resources. He also might be the flippant homosexual that he sometimes is and tell you to ram the conversation down his throat whether he likes it or not. It's sometimes hard to tell with him, heh. "

If you've been to Rome, or some other places in Europe better-known for their Roman ruins, how do they compare? Is there less clutter/hubbub around the provincial ruins than around the more famous ones? Also, do they have any Dacian ruins left, or did the Romans completely wipe those out? If so, how do those compare with the Roman ones, can you get a sense of the societal and architectural differences (and what would those be)?"

I have given you argument. Proof is in the pudding. Non-Muslims do survive centuries of Muslim rule, but there is persecution and centuries of injustice.

&gt; Perhaps it's an evolutionary thing.

Possibly so.  The cohesion which a unified belief system gives a society is massively beneficial: especially when individuals are willing to sacrifice themselves.  Faced with two enemies, one of whom will surrender to survive, and another who will fight you to the death and who show no fear.. who do you attack?

Research is ongoing, and it's a fascinating area.

&gt;Perhaps over the ages..

Also possible.  Perhaps more likely than evolution, given that European society was burning women at the stake 500 years ago, but is now largely non-theistic.

It isn't as though the current situation is as it is because people were passive, but because of unions and actions against those we felt were acting in the wrong...  If we ignore this inequality what is to say that things won't stagnate or get worse?

&gt;Sure things were better there than in the industrial revolution but they were a hell of a lot worse than things in the unequal West.

That was my bloody point, just because things are better than they were at some point doesn't mean we cant look for ways of making things better.

You seem to assume that inequality is either a requirement for improvement or an inevitable byproduct, I would suggest that it is simply one of the issues that has not yet been dealt with and needs to be.  I fail to see why it would be essential or even has been essential in getting western society to where it is...

&gt;I am talking about Ethanol subsidies, drilling subsidies, subsidies for businesses to buy heavy vehicles. Do you know that TARP contained a provision to reduce the tax on wooden arrows and a special depreciation schedule for restaurants that wanted to renovated?

Yep, most of that is rather crap and it stems from the ability for rich organisations and lobby groups to spend money and influence politics.  Granted the answer to that is electoral reform, but it still comes down to powerful people lobbying and getting their way instead of the people exercising that power.

&gt;Please define ""fair"". Unless they are stealing from other people I think that ""fair"" is whatever you can negotiate freely.

It's hard to define I agree.  However I think it should be on the basis of what you bring to the company, not what you can negotiate freely.  Ideally of course when you work for a company you should have some stake in that company, some level of ownership, so that your work and the benefits it brings to the company does make its way back to you...

&gt;Do their staff have to work there? Except during this momentary time of high unemployment the staff can generally go work for someone else who will pay them more.

They could, but if you happen to have no or few qualifications you may find that without a decent union, your ability to negotiate decent pay will be undermined by the sheer number of other people willing to do your job for a little less, a race to the bottom...

&gt;You would cut off your nose to spite your face. Taken to the extreme high taxes result in stagnant growth which hurts everyone as was shown with Communism and the various dictatorships around the world...

Really?  I suppose all those European countries with higher tax rates and better public services, more consumer protections and better labour laws are all communist hell holes run by dictators then?

&gt;You say that the people are ""lucky"" enough to have gotten where they are, but you completely ignore the roles of skill, hard work and risk taking.

No, I don't I just happen to add the fact that without the society around them their skills would be less useful, their hard work less rewarding and their risk taking rather less fruitful (by the way risk taking is the luck part).  without a well educated society and decent infrastructure your skills and hard work will net you rather less than in their presence.
 
&gt;over the last 50 years the US has had one of the fastest growing pies for all segments of our society

Sort of.  A combination of post war superiority and technological advance (much from outside of the US as well) has helped a lot though.  It isn't as though this is somehow all because of a US style capitalist system.. Moreover the US still has people with no access to decent healthcare, areas where drinking water is not acutally clean etc.. so it has hardly reached a peak.  

&gt;The poor may break their back all day, but ultimately they usually end up getting a fair deal and a lot of what they deserve, for good or for bad, in this country.

See that parable says something rather different to me, it says that the labourers should have gotten together before hand and decided to work together to get a good deal and then maybe they could all have worked an equal period, rather than some working a lot and some working a little...

&gt;They should not cry foul just because other people get more for doing what they perceive to be less.

No, but I can cry foul if they don't seem to be putting back into the society that they live in and so make others who work harder give more."

But Glen Beck is using ""race"" in the colloquial sense; he has no problem at all classifying ""black"" as a race, for example.

DBCA, you are clearly a bright young person with a world of potential. Also consider some application that allows you to be a professor on the side. If you are in the states, take that advice not to pay. I racked up debt for my PhD, mostly because I was bound geographically. I was forced into a position where I had to pay if I wanted to continue. If you are in Europe I have no idea what your options, but if you are single, do well on standardized tests, and then apply around. Contact chairs of departments and express that you are interested in pursuing a research position. If your scores are good, most chairs have some discretionary money they can toss to a professor to fund a position. Schmooze and impress. Go where the money is. Never be afraid to switch schools mid program if there is a chance to publish or better funding.

You will shine, because no one reads original sources. Most original sources read like philosophy. You can read philosophy so you can succeed.

Ashkenazi Jews are a distinct ethnic group due to European Jews having children mostly with other European Jews for hundreds of years. The [Wikipedia article about Ashkenazi Jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews) says

&gt;A study by Michael Seldin, a geneticist at the University of California Davis School of Medicine, found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, relatively homogenous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort — that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group.

However, don't think that ethnicity has anything to do with IQ. Just look at how Jewish and Asian parents (think about the Jewish mother stereotype) push their children to do well in school. 

**tl;dr:** Ashkenazi Jews are a distinct ethnic group but I'm not racist.

One is the notion of (gasp) original sin, which the Federalists interpreted in secular terms as a counter-balance to the Enlightenment notion that self-interest would ultimately accord with the general good.  They, for the most part, held that men were inherently selfish and would, in seeking their own self-interest, undermine the interests of others and the good of society as a whole.  That's one reason that we have federal system rather than some more direct form of democracy.  It's also why the concept of checks and balances permeates our entire system.

The other is the natural equality of persons, something that you generally don't find in Roman and pre-Roman Western civilizations, but which, in the medieval context, formed around the belief that all humans were endowed with an immaterial, immortal soul.  Ensoulment was the conceptual basis for equality before God.  That's one reason that, despite an apparent Biblical tolerance of slavery, institutional slavery was largely alien to the medieval West when compared to the Greek and Roman societies that preceded it.  It may also explain why the medieval period favored feudalism, with its hierarchy of at least nominally voluntary allegiances, rather than the slave-dependent infrastructure of imperial Rome.  It wasn't until the 15th century that European Christians began to work out a new logic to justify the Atlantic slave trade against their traditional notion of equality before God.

If that analysis is correct -- ie. that the Christian dogmas of soul and salvation tended to mitigate against any impulse towards slavery -- then indirectly Christianity *is* at least partially responsible for modern science.  Roman and Greek civilizations flourished in large part because they were, unabashedly, slave societies.  At high points in either, slaves outnumbered citizens.  Part of the reason the Dark Ages were dark is that, without a significant working force of slaves, Europe couldn't sustain the infrastructure that had, until recently, held the Empire together.  To wit, things were tough all over.  The explosion of scientific increase that came after the Dark Ages were, in large part, driven by technical advances pursued in order to make work easier -- a pursuit that likely would not have seemed so urgent had the Europe still been divided into a small class of citizens living on the labor of an underclass of slaves.  Why waste your time devising wind- and water-mills when you already have an unpaid labor force to grind your grains for you?"

With many Libertarians, any health care system which simply doesn't involve initiation of force is better than any system where the government, and by extension force, is involved.

But libertarians can only offer this.  They can vaguely suggest that in a less regulated system there would be more competition, but ample opportunities for collusion exist.  I don't believe anything I've read from the free market crowd is likely to bring down costs, especially the costs of pharmaceutical drugs.  If Americans are willing to destroy themselves financially for consumer items, homes they can't afford, etc. (see credit problems of current recession), I think it is pretty clear money (bought on credit) is no object when it comes to drugs which will save their lives.   Why not bankrupt everyone with cancer - there are no patients who will be unwilling to pay, liquidating their life savings, homes, and so forth, in the process.

One reason I find it hard to be politically active anymore is the nearly religious fervor with which with political ideas or values are held.

It would be far more honest to say something like, ""What we advocate may have minimal impact on prices, but it will remove government and force from the equation, and we believe that's enough.  Opportunities for cheaper health care exist owing to competitive forces but we can't guarantee anything.""

In ten years, should health care costs continue their current trend, the companies many people work for will simply drop health care as a benefit.  My own company struggles with this every year.

If health care costs do not drop to become affordable (and health care as a common employment benefit is dropped), you will have a country-wide revolt and you will have people clamoring for socialized health care, like they have in Europe.  This hasn't happened yet because most people in the US have health care provided by their employers.  

And that is a scenario I am fairly certain libertarians are not particularly enthusiastic about.   Libertarians who live and breathe their political philosophy are going to find out very quickly that for the average American, political and moral principles are luxuries for the well-fed, especially when it comes to the well-being of their children.  Scare people a little, and you will indeed get a sudden flash of that boot stomping on a human face forever.  The Patriot Act (for example) did not go into effect in a vacuum, however people feel about it now.

Socialized health care will be a no-brainer.  Won't even register on peoples outrage-o-meter.

So libertarians can downvote me all they want on this and other issues, but the fact remains that if you pitch the libertarian ""solution"" to spiraling health care costs, don't expect this to be the issue that turns anyone into a libertarian.

And by the way, should libertarians somehow get their way with health care, and the free market does bring health care costs down and I'm wrong, I will cheerfully punch myself in the balls.  Hold me to it.

Because free market solutions are the ones I *want* to work.  I am an ex-Libertarian.  Shit maybe I'm even still a Libertarian.  I just went from believing that libertarianism was a sparkling solution to most problems to believing it may be the least bad solution, full of flaws, but ultimately the better choice.

Whatever any of us feels, however, should health care costs continue their current trends (even as determined by unregulated, un-fucked-with market forces), you will see socialized health care in the USA in your lifetime, no matter how anyone feels about it."

In 1999, I was one of 30,000 US troops stationed in South Korea at the time. I was stationed at Camp Bonifas, on the DMZ for a year and got to see North Koreans every day.

Some of my duties included: playing tour guide for VIPs and western tourists, patrolling our (by then very limited) portion of the DMZ, helping fish bodies (NK infiltrators) out of the Imjin River before it froze for the winter, and readying the explosive charges that would take out the bridges along the road and topple the concrete blocks placed to be block the roads in the event of an invasion.

I also got to travel quite a bit to Seoul, specifically Kangnam, where my KATUSA buddy lived.

If the US hadn't remained there after the armistice, or if the US hadn't been involved in the war at all, all of South Korea would have been overrun, and 10s of millions of people would have died or lived under the oppressive DPRK.

It was our military presence in South Korea, Japan, and the Pacific that prevented that from happening.

I also believe it was military aid to Pakistan and our force posture in the Indian Ocean (carriers, bases, etc..) that kept the Indo-Pakistani wars in the 60s and 70s from being bloodier than they already were.

The US bases in Western Europe prevented a Soviet takeover of the continent, and our sustained political and military involvement after WWII helped set the economies of what would become the EU right.

Similarly, the constant propping up and swatting down of regimes in the Middle East and South America, **while admittedly distasteful,** has led to no real regional superpower emerging in those areas.

If Iran, Iraq, or any South American country had been allowed to grow powerful enough to take on its neighbors, much much much larger wars would have been fought in the last 30 years than were.

The pragmatist in me says that local warlords are more preferable to regional dictators. And regarding China (我当前的专业领域): I know for a fact that US regional presences in Japan, Korea, the Indian Ocean, and elsewhere (and the intense surveillance that accompanied those presences) have tamped down Chinese operations (that are almost unknown of in the west) in areas like the Spratley Islands, the South China Sea, Taiwan, the Paracels and elsewhere, that *definitely* would have led to regional (or wider) conflict if not an all-out fourth Indochina war if left unmanaged.

I don't drink alcohol, and I'm not gay.  So two of those negatives don't exist for me.  The country where I live right now has exorbitant house prices, so I'd be swapping one expensive place for another.  The possibility of being arrested for public displays of affection are a definite downer.  However, I've been taken into police custody in liberal, multicultural France (straight off the coach) simply for being black.  Whilst living there I was also mugged multiple times and threatened with violence on the same streets.  This was Paris, a modern european city famed for being the city of romance and love.  The low crime rate in Dubai is a SERIOUS plus.  The heavy handedness of the police in Dubai when it comes to hanging out with a woman is definitely a negative, but compare it Paris, where I can't exactly hide the fact I'm black, can I?  I often think of moving to France, as it's very close to the UK, and I speak the language.  However, I just don't feel safe there.  Comparing it side by side, Paris, to Dubai, I'd choose Dubai.  Perhaps you're lucky enough to compare Dubai unfavourably to places where you live.  I'd appreciate your thoughts on my comment.

Honestly, the way I see it, it all comes down to physical differences. The human brain is not designed to handle ""tribes"" of more than a few 100 people, so in a modern society we always seek ways to categorize people to make it less taxing on our brains. The easiest way is through physical differences. Now certain immigrant groups come into the country destitute (say Mexicans in the U.S., Arabs in Europe) and immediately the natives associate their appearance with destitution. They don't want anything to do with them. Of course, this makes it harder for most non-exceptional members of the minority to escape the stereotype. The isolated minorities are forced to create or cling to their own culture which will again be associated with poverty, and the natives start fearing for their own culture, strengthening the stereotypes, and making it even harder for them to escape. That cycle alone explains so much more than all the half-baked IQ studies and cultural domination theories, when it comes to the difficulties in multi-cultural societies (which is really just a euphemism for multi-racial societies).

I'd say the easiest way for you to protect ""anglo"" culture is to come up with an effective skin whitener. God knows people would use it."

Just look at the heads of those pyramid schemes like Enron. You really think congresspeople make that much money in office? No fucking way. We're talking billions upon billions of dollars.

Again, Enron was lobying for more regulations when they failed. And they were puting money into the politicians pockets. How many times are you going to bring Enron as if it makes your point when it is a prove that what you are proposing does not work?

&gt;I say they're smart enough to vote but not smart enough to negotiate purposefully and extremely obtuse legal language.

I say I knew you would end up just repeting your mantra and refusing to acknoledge any evidence.

&gt;But point in fact, labor movements had saved people from the horrible annals of corporatism, which is an inevitability in a free society where you do not put regulations on markets.

No, labor movements did not put an end to anything. Explain this: Europe has been allways and by far more unionized than the USA. In the peak of unions, only about 1/3 of the workers where unionized in the USA. Yet workers in the USA has had allways higher wages than in Europe. Its not union labors that make the workers better off. Its the free market.

&gt;The markets, or rather certain interests in them, will buy the regulations themselves, with election money you can't control because you refuse to regulate. We saw that in both Britain and the US in the late 1800's.

I know you will jump arround again, but Ill try: How do you buy a regulation when the goverment doesnt have the power to regulate? And, in a regulated system, like the one the USA or Europe is now, how do you stop corporations from buying politician and imposing the regulations they want (wich is what happens allways).

Regulations are not there to protect the people, regulations exists to benefit big corporations. Trying to use regulations to protect us is like using a gun to heal.

&gt;Yeah, it's in our Constitution. But I do not believe that getting rid of limited liability will be sufficient to curtail private influence on our government, not for a second.

Well, there is no other option. All the other options assume that there is a good way to concentrate the power, and avoid the manipulation it will suffer. In reality, the objective of this movements is to fool the people to give them power under the promise that they are the good ones."

Look, you said that politicians can make more money than scammers. I'm telling you that that is utterly false, given the amount of money that scammers have made in pyramid schemes like Enron. This was not a point about regulation at all.
&gt;Explain this: Europe has been allways and by far more unionized than the USA. In the peak of unions, only about 1/3 of the workers where unionized in the USA. Yet workers in the USA has had allways higher wages than in Europe.

You are not simplifying the situation of wages down to who had more labor union workers and who didn't are you? You *know* that's a gross oversimplification of the differences. For instance, the government here has always been Corporatist and the money invested in the military has been used to fund the corporations directly in one case and indirectly by trashing countries and creating new markets. The Fed has also made our businesses here more profitable and thus wages increase slightly over countries without the Corporatist nature. And that's just *one* difference not accounted for in your simplification.

Secondly, I'm not talking about wages, I'm talking about working conditions. Have you ever heard of the condition known as Fossy Jaw? You should look it up, and its history in London, and what labor unions achieved for both the expansion of the middle class and their standards of living. It certainly hasn't been perfect, but it was an improvement.
&gt;How do you buy a regulation when the goverment doesnt have the power to regulate?

I dunno. Why don't you ask the corporations of the US government? They managed to. Just because a dusty old document says that the government doesn't have the power doesn't mean politicians will care about the document more than their own elections, their own power, and their own money. Pieces of paper don't protect themselves, and you can't rid the government of the incentives to do things it's not authorized to do if you do not restrain private institutions.
&gt;Well, there is no other option.

I dunno. Amending the Constitution to make all Federal elections publicly funded so corporations don't have the ability to buy influence that way's a good start. Look at the BBC, publicly funded and they can make shows like Newswipe that have no trouble telling it like it is-- a corrupt government being bought by a corrupt private industry. Why? Because they won't lose corporate sponsorship for badmouthing those motherfuckers.

Our 'glorious' private unregulated news does not have that option. Look at the agreement reached between O'Reilly and Olbermann by Fox News and CNN. "

Your above post matches my own musings: that the campaign was at least partly motivated by ambitions of empire.

Thinking about it right now, I also wonder if it might have something to do with the american alliance with nationalist China. If Chiang Kai-Shek had prevailed against the maoists (which he didnt) , and Japan defeated (which it was), then the USA would have a powerful, resource-rich ally dominating Asia. Perhaps America might even try to employ China as a colonial outpost, like it does with Israel.

Have you drawn any conclusions on this matter?

Whatever the reasons for the US campaign, I'm personally grateful for it. 
Without a strong american response, I would probably be living in a third-world Imperial Japanese colony. Screw that.

So Individuals have all the responsibility, even though the conditions in which they operate they have little ability to affect (without wealth). It just doesn't make any sense...

No, I don't support unemployment. I'm saying you cannot fix a problem such as unemployment without it being a hindrance to the economy. Like I said, if the person really wants to make something out of their selves they are more than welcome to start up a business. There are various charities that help deal with unemployment as well, you know organizations that depend on voluntary donations and not forcibly involuntary seizing of money.

&gt;As I've said (repeatedly), it's not a great system. But for millions, it's something. That's not a 'failure of massive proportions'

You mean, for millions it's something that won't be there by the time they retire? It is bankrupting our country. It is a failure of massive proportions.

&gt;For an outside observer it is in their interest, becuase it'll help put off social unrest (and has done, successfully). But of course, their (short sighted) rational self-interest is to keep their money. Just as it is in the rational self-interest of the vast majority to seize that money.

It is hardly short sighted to not want to give my money to other people. Hey man, if you're so selfless why don't you give your pay check to every homeless person you see? Let's face it, we're all fucking greedy you do not want to fork over your money anymore than I do. 

&gt;Surely you have insurance on your business? I fail to see how it is that different (In fact, in the UK they call it National Insurance).

Yes, but that is a voluntary exchange of money. In return, I am insured any case anything goes wrong. However, for my employees I run a health care system similar to Whole Foods Inc.

&gt;Yet Scandinavian countries have happier, wealthier people than any country practising 'economic freedom'. As I've pointed out (again, repeatedly) human rights and economics aren't separate. I hardly need to re-iterate the argument as to why this is. You haven't challenged the logic of it, merely repeated a tired argument that is intuitively incorrect to most. It almost sounds like your simply struggling to justify your own selfishness, or validate your own position about the majority.

Yet their economies are tiny compared to the U.S., and smaller than their European counterparts that are less socialized.

Human rights and economics aren't separate, I don't think I've disagreed with that. In order for the free market to exist, there needs to be free people working in their own rational self interest. I was simply human rights are not within the scope of a right to take money from other peoples. By doing such an act you are violating another persons right to property.

&gt;Repeated recessions caused by their greed and inability to see the consequences of their actions would rather challenge such an assessment. Furthermore, as I've said before, Social Mobility is practically a joke - these people are there out of a leg-up and luck more than anything. And, again, to repeat myself there can only be so many of these rich people at once owing to how the system it set up (not everyone can be a CEO) - how do you know millions of other people aren't good at making profit yet simply all the good positions are taken?

Yes, all recessions are caused by rich people's greed an inability to foresee the consequences of their actions that no one else could foresee! You want to know what caused this major recession in the U.S.? It wasn't private business, it was government entanglement in the housing market that artificially proped it up putting it into a bubble. 

I love how you dismiss any successful business and the people who started it up as simply luck, hey man however you want to rationalize success. How do I know millions of other people aren't good at science and will be the next Einstein, Stephen Hawkings, Isaac Newton? I don't. It isn't my job to prove that there is. It is their job to realize their full potential.

&gt;Right, just like the American Revolution, on which your whole 'Republic' is built, did? The French Revolution did the same, and those two revolutions are entire modern conception of liberty and economics arose.

I should have specified. A violent revolution to void the rights of the evil rich middle and upper class people. Curious, why did you put ""Republic"" in quotation marks? I know what we have at the moment is a far cry from a republic, I was simply saying our government was meant to be a republic or a democratic republic.

&gt;Fail to see a problem with what? A government by the rich for the rich?

No, a government for the people by the people. That means all people, not the majority or the minority. That means their job is to enforce property rights and uphold civil liberties as well as national defense. That is it.

&gt;Your point is what? Of course I know that. It didn't stop him being voted the greatest Russian of all time. I don't know why that happened, I didn't propose a poll claiming he was Russian, but it did happen.

Let's assume that Nazi Germany continued up until 1991 when it finally collapsed. Then we pooled the German population and asked who was the greatest German of all time and the result was Hitler? Why would you take said pole with a shred of validity? He may have had the greatest impact on his citizens lives, but he killed hundreds of thousands and millions of people to get where he is and do what he wanted to do.

&gt;I dutifully noted the unacceptable human cost as is now a requirement when talking about Stalin

I don't have a personal crusade against Stalinism. I think he was personally quite a brilliant man and pragmatic, albeit quite misguided. 

&gt;A majority poll invalidates anecdotal evidence. So your grandparents hated it...so what? My grandparents hate lots of things, I don't go around pretending their opinions are the be-all-end-all of arguments. You can hardly base a criticism of an entire society on two people.

Fair enough, I'm emotionally attached to this because my grandparents and my mother had to live in the USSR where simple goods were not even readily available. Sorry for bringing that up.

&gt;But I note you fail to give an argument to the contrary.

I don't even see the point, these laws were imposed by the majority. Like I said, we need to look no further than Prop 8 in CA to see how vile a democracy can be. Regardless, let's assume mob rule never happened. It is still a vile system where the majority has the opportunity to deny the rights of 49% of others."

Not often bought up in cultural or academic circles for political correctness reasons. The Chinese/Asian and Mediterranean civilisations made many scientific, mathematical etc advances before Europe ever did. However what European civilisations seemed to do most well was to take those ideas and use them at a much greater scale. I am not a historian but I believe part of is was the arms race between the various kingdoms and domains of the Middle Ages Europe (thats not to say there wernt arms races elsewhere). 

If someone had gun power, a telescope, printing press, etc then everyone had to have it to keep up. There was also a race to map and colonise the New World. A similar thing occurred during World War 2 and the cold war. One of the primary reasons the Manhattan project was undertaken was not because western civilisation was any better, or we had some internal wish to advance our species, it was because the Allied forces were scared Hitler might also be developing one.

I highly reccomend the interesting series ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" which investigates the economic and scientific disparities amoung human civilisation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel

Edit: I also think part of the reason we are seeing a massive rise in living conditions amoung asian and south american countries (though there are significant disparities) is because of the Green Revolution. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution

People didn't have to spend all day subsisting for food, some could go to school. Fifty years later they are rapidly catching up to the West in living standards.

Most of the idiotic things that people associate with the Christian Church, were really Germanic pagans. For instance, the use of trial by ordeal was no longer used by Romans, Jews, or Christians. They all had well developed judicial systems by that point. It was the Germanic tribes who reintroduced the traditions of placing hot pokers in people's hands to identify the guilty, witch drowning, etc. 

One of my professor's explained that the Catholic Churches veneration of Mary was an effort to convince Germanic rulers who had converted to Christianity to stop raping mothers when they invaded villages. Everyone likewise remembers the Crusades, but they forget that the Catholic Church sponsored the Crusades initially because they thought that it would reduce war in Europe. During the middle ages, Christian monks went around to local leaders and begged them to peacefully settle their differences. The Church really did try for a long time.

Most of the horror stories of the church come from around the beginning of the Renaissance, when the Church was becoming corrupted. For the 1500 years or so before that, the Church was one of the few institutions trying to hold the world together. That's not to suggest that they have a spotless past, but I grind my teeth every time I hear someone say that Christianity caused the Dark Ages. It belies a familiarity with history that probably runs no deeper than the history channel."

The OP says that money is power, right?  So from ""The government right now has the power"" is equivalent to ""the government right now has the money""... right?

&gt;Ideally, this institute that controls the power is controlled by the people in the best way possible, it has checks and balances and reports to the people. 

People who believe in liberty think that **The People should have the power**.  If you did not tax incomes, the income... the money... the power would remain in the wallets of **The People**.

&gt; However, it seem libertarians think that if we get rid of the government, that the power vacuum wouldn't exist.

This is correct.  See above... the power ... the money... stayed in the pockets of **The People**.

Free-People is synonymous with Free-Markets because People both produce and consume and the markets are simply the place where they exchange goods and services.  So those who believe in liberty want desperately for the little guy to keep his money and therefore his power.

&gt;It would, and some company would take it's place. Money is power, power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Conjecture.  The country that most follows the libertarian principle in the modern world is Switzerland.  Non-interventionalist foreign policy... strong state/territorial government, decentralized federal government.  Refuses to lose its sovereignty to crap like the EU.  Everyone wields guns.

|If you don't want to argue then properly research the answers to the questions you are being asked, rather than just answering based on your impressions as a recent immigrant. 

The title is I am an American expat living in New Zealand. What more do you want? I am going to answer questions as I am, not as a researcher on all aspects of Kiwi life. The thread is as advertised.

| Answering opinion-based questions are fine (which is what IAMA is about) but your factual statements are far from being accurate. 

Which statements are inaccurate? 

| You should know by know that us Kiwis are proud of our country; perhaps the reason you find us so rude is because of how you talk down to us like we are less informed about our own country then you, an American.

At what point am I talking down? I disagree with you, that is not talking down to you. And you putting in ""then you, an American"" at the end actually massively proves a lot of the points that I have been making here. 

I am not wanting to argue with a Kiwi about their country because it almost always ends either ""you don't understand"", ""you don't know what you're talking about"" or ""if you don't like it here, then leave"". It's rarely a discussion around the facts.

If you disagree about the housing quality of New Zealand versus American and European building, that's fine. However, you want facts from me, so here are a few links about the problems with New Zealand housing.

The scientific consensus, as you might expect, isn't quite as clear cut. In a nutshell there are various contributions to the anomalous warmth of Europe. The debate is around what they are and what the contribute over different regions.

There's a [RealClimate article about the slowing down of the Gulf Stream and its impacts](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/05/gulf-stream-slowdown/). See in particular comment 3, which cites this guy's work, and the response which finishes: 

&gt; A good way to estimate the effect of the thermohaline part of the heat transport is to shut it down by dumping a lot of freshwater into the north Atlantic in a climate model, which stops deep water formation there. Two examples are shown in the figures in Gavin's post; it leads to several degrees cooling over Europe but also on the western side of the Atlantic. Hence, the Gulf Stream does contribute a lot to Europe's warmth, and I see no reason why anybody would want to ""educate the public away"" from this idea.

Most cultures will look harder at women that don't fit the demographic. This goes for men and women.

Most cultures will look at attractive women (again for both men and women).

Most cultures' males will show an unhealthy interest if the woman is not dressed in-line with cultural norms or is particularly attractive. When my wife was 15 she was inappropriately touched by a guy in her home town - this is in mainland Europe. She wasn't particularly provocatively dressed either.

The naivety, however, is something you can work on.  

For example, it was Alfred Whitehead who claimed that European philosophy could be considered as a footnote to Plato.  But why did he say it?  You appear to be unable or unwilling to consider why.  What was the context in which he was speaking?  Was he talking about Plato's actual philosophy or was he talking about his influence, or something else?

Like Dubai, people are pouring shit-tons of money into China without actually realizing the kind of situation they are in now.

Firstly, a  large amount of their economic growth is dependent their exports of processed secondary goods to countries such as the USA, Australia, and Europe. Within their economy, the standard of living is still quite low so there is very little market for all those processed goods.

Now how do they go about making those processed goods? Mostly on raw materials imports that they get from countries like Russia and Australia. Those raw materials cost money. Regardless of the special free trade deals, they still cost a *lot*. Remarkably, even with relatively cheap exports that go direct to suppliers, they still manage to keep costs slightly lower than product. This is probably why a lot of Chinese state-owned organizations are keen to buy out mines and forests in other countries so they can avoid the overhead of trade. Some countries have refused to give in to this, and have caused a lot of suspicious circumstances (see the detention of Stern Hu, [BHPBilliton] (edit: Rio Tinto) employee over ""espionage"" charges).

Hu Jintao made hints at the last CCP congress of planning a democratic future. When this happens global prices are almost certain to jump and demand will collapse and diversify as the developed westernized nations look to markets such as India for manufacturing. If China democratizes, the next thing well be unions and with the right governing body in power, those unions will be able to stand up to TNCs who have been using Chinese factories as a source for low-wage work. If wages and working standards go up, so will costs and so will prices.

People really need to stop pouring money into China and think about the really unsustainable economic model they have there. China doesn't have the demand to support itself and keeps costs at unrealistically low levels due to their abuse of workers rights. They are dependent on other countries for their resources."

Compare the fundamentals and you find that China has cash, secured resources, a large manufacturing base and most importantly, forms the basis for rather a lot of other countries economies.  How much of a hit would the US and the EU take if it didn't have access to Chinas industrial base and lending?  

Granted there are some long term issues, things like population growth and aging will cause issues for China, but then their promises to their population are somewhat smaller than those of others and at the same time other countries face the same problem. China is investing heavily in China and not borrowing to do so, it is still expanding economically (and investment is increasing) and it has a lot of room to grow.

In short, I can't see where China is overextending itself, its political system may be problematic but it manages to produce long term policy, it's population may be large, but then it is industrialising and developing rapidly.  China isn't focused on and IP or serviced based economy, it is working hard to keep everything that it deems important in house...  The US can claim pretty much none of those things, hell whilst people look at the Dollar and see it as being propped up by the US taxpayer and reputation rather than the US economy (and arguably see it as overvalued but not easily ignored) Chinas currency is seen as undervalued and under supplied...

On the technology side, the industrial revolution is an exclusive European invention. The industrial revolution is what allowed Europe and its spinoff USA to become the center of imperial power. 

For instance, at 1750 the British colonies in America consisted of a tiny band on the coast, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire#Americas.2C_Africa_and_the_slave_trade. The complete conquest of North America finalized only around mid 19th century.

The simple majority election system creates the results which we see today. When the nation first was instituted back in the 1700s, it would have been predicted that regional areas would develop their own particular interests and ways of life and perspectives on the world. This is what happened in europe, after all - to the extent that the europeans even developed a myriad of different languages. But in fact, with the advent of mass communication, the whole continent became rather homogenous. This means that the majority of people in any given community, large or small, is going to have basically the same sensibilities about matters as those in every other city or town. So sadly, what we've ended up with is for all intents and purposes a one-party system (The democrats and republicans pretend to disagree. However, they act the same way when it comes to real issues - even if ideologically they might feel differently about ethics of governance). 

The way forward for reforming the system, if you want a pluralistic government, which provides a fairer representation of all the diverse voices - and gives them each a seat at the table - is to look at how those voices express themselves in the society. There are many different groups which feel passionate about how government policies should be made - but they just aren't specific to any one region - the people in these groups are scattered here and there, across the whole nation.

New Zealand is the only country I know of which seems to have solved this problem. What they do is called ""mixed member proportional representation."" Half of the representatives in parliament are regionally elected, and half of them are appointed by the political parties, in a way such that the political parties end up with representation proportional to the percentage of votes cast for them, nationwide. A political party needs to take five percent of the nationwide vote to meet the threshold in order to have actual seats in parliament. Under this system, there are very strong minority parties - the green party, the maori (native newzealander) party, the ACT party (which is similar to our republican party in the Usa). And in order to get things done, you need to make deals with the minor parties. And in that way, these voices in society get their concerns addressed very effectively.

It would also a big improvement to not have fixed terms for folks in government. Particularly, this is important in the executive branch. The executive branch in any country has a lot of power. And for the Usa to elect one person on an up or down vote for a fixed four year term - and give that person the power to appoint all the agencies of the executive branch, and all his own staff - that is really dangerous, in my opinion. People got awfully anxious in the years of Bush the 43rd because of the immense amount of power this one man had, and because this man also had somewhat fringe ideologies.

In a parliamentary system, the prime minister is appointed by the representatives in parliament, and his/her whole executive branch can be dissolved at any time by a vote of no-confidence by parliament. An example of this very effective balance of powers is seen in Canada. In Canada, prime minister Stephen Harper really is wanting to make some big reforms in Canada - which would pull the country towards the right, and make it more like the USA. But he is always stopped because of this threat of a no-confidence vote."

December 1981

In a World Cup year, Liverpool are seemingly out of the title race at Christmas. Sitting in 12th with a mere 24 points, nine points adrift of first-placed Swansea and knocked out of the European Cup in the third round by CSKA Sofia.

Paisley tells the media:

""I never thought the day would come when I would have to appeal to our own fans to give us more support, but that is what we need right now. Too many people take it for granted that we only have to turn up to win.""

May 1982

Liverpool turned around their pre-Christmas slump, including a sixteen game unbeaten run to finish the season as champions, pipping runners-up Ipswich by four points. 

It seems ridiculously unlikely now, but with Manchester United looking likely to unravel, Chelsea slumping without Essien and due to lose players to the African Cup of Nations and Arsenal losing the likes of Fabregas and van Persie to injury, there is still a slight glimmer of hope. We are still mathematically in it after giving everyone else a head start.

&gt;J. Mark Iwry, senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and deputy assistant secretary for retirement and health policy, co-authored a paper before joining the Obama administration that recommended having a portion of a retiring worker's 401(k) assets automatically invested in an annuity — unless the employee opts out of the program.

&gt;...

&gt;My fear is that governments in the US, Britain, and Europe will display similar reflexes. Indeed, they have already done so. The forced-feeding of banks with fresh capital – whether they want it or not – and the seizure of the Fannie/Freddie mortgage giants before they were in fact in trouble (in order to prevent a Chinese buying strike of US bonds and prevent a spike in US mortgage rates), shows that private property can be co-opted – or eliminated – with little due process if that is required to serve the collective welfare.

So, in summary- the US government does actually do bad and/or stupid things, and it's not necessarily a ""conspiracy theory"" to point this out.

A word on immigration. I live in a heavily immigrant populated city; Miami. And while, yes, there seems to be a force at work that depresses wages in this city vis-à-vis costs of living I would say that force is more Florida being a ""right to work"" state which suppresses the presence and effectiveness of unions. Add to that a rather conservative immigrant community that is ideologically anti-union. If immigrants truly do depress wages its in those jobs that undocumented immigrants tend to work in: housekeeping, construction laborers, and agriculture. Are those the type of jobs Americans are fighting over? Also consider the price savings many Americans enjoy at the register by buying products from producers who reduce labor costs by using undocumented labor. The solution is not having such an asshole immigration policy that pretty much only grants legal residency to people who economically don't really need it. I would say expand immigration. The baby boomers are retiring and are going to present a great burden on social services and a proportionally smaller labor force. The solution is to expand the tax paying labor force by expanding immigration. 

Better yet, lets do like the EU did and erase borders completely. The free movement of people across borders will encourage people to work and pay taxes but not necessarily stay and use services. "

Yap. US and China are holding each other hostage. It's a really interesting to watch it unfold. I am sure that no one knows how it will end.

&gt;I still don't think an autocratic government is working ""better"" in the case of China. 

From perspective of ""ordinary"" citizen, it isn't. That's the whole point. Chinese leadership can decide to sacrifice whole generation for ""greater good"" (and they did). Pollution, low wages (slave labor) it was all calculated risk for their broader plan. Western democracies can't operate like that ... you know, those pesky elections every now and then. That's the biggest difference and one thing that is often forgotten when people discuss China.

&gt;In the next 10 years, it may work better, but I think a good analogy would be to Long Term Capital Management.

They invested in Yeltsin's Russia? Different story. Another mistake that is often made. Russia and China are two different stories. There are no parallels between USSR and China (except obvious, name of the ruling party). China left communist ways and is doing something different.

&gt;but then there is going to be a huge blowback

Why would that happen? Do we have any historic evidence? USSR was something completely different from current China.

&gt;countries like the US will remain stable because of their governmental system while China will suffer a loss of 10 years of productivity as they are mired down in public unrest

Again, doesn't have to happen. It might. Just like big unrest in US if  US economy fails. Or if US goes into ""even bigger depression"" and some sort of radical leader emerges (Hitler came to power in similar way). There are all sorts of crazies in US who would blame all sorts of devils for such event.

&gt;I hope their bets in Africa work, but everyone who has tried thus far has failed.

They are doing things little bit different then those before them (as far as I know, which is limited to what I read on reddit and western news sources)

&gt;I just don't see Africa in the next 20-30 years being an industrial power house like China is now. 

Me neither. And i don't think Chinese do. They see them as source of raw materials for now. I think production will move from China to some other Asian countries first ad maybe in 50 or 100 years to Africa. But that's the scope in which China thinks and operates. One of my points. They are thinking ahead ... way ahead. Much longer then it is common in the US and many Americans don't even consider that. Mistake.

&gt;Still, I suppose it's their only bet.

Well, production will have to happen somewhere. They can't export it to Europe or America, Africa is last continent that will join developed world. They are way behind anyone else and it will take them many years to even start getting near the start line. Sad, but true."

They were rich in slaves. And *land*. Tell me where else in the world you can get a plot of land for free in a lottery.

Who ever said that a war on ""terror"" would make you more free. The best one could hope for it is that it would make you less ""terrorized"". We can only guess whether America would be more or less ""terrorized"" in an alternate universe where Ghandi had been president instead of GWB.

The real world has fiat money. And the real world has bubbles. The connection between those two is contentious. I tend to think that bubbles are simply a natural result of human exuberance. People *really believed* that the Internet stocks could go nowhere but up. Once you believe that, there will be a bubble in those stocks. And it will become a more generalized bubble if credit is used to purchase the stocks.

What if it does? You can't rationally argue that its wrong.

&gt;I can cite numerous examples of progress. Human slavery is nearly wiped out.

As an atheist you can't rationally argue that that is a good thing.

&gt;The general quality of life around the world is much greater in the last 200 years. We have completely wiped out some diseases like smallpox and made huge strides in saving people from malaria related deaths.

And why is that objectively good?

&gt;In general the human lifespan has increased greatly. The death penalty has been phased out in many places across the world. Especially in secular Europe where the eye for an eye justification for execution holds less sway.

Same question.

&gt;Have you ever even read a bible.

Yes I have, but this is beside the point (and I'm not Jewish or Christian). You can't argue that any of those things are objectively wrong according to your worldview.

&gt;Morality is not some magical force like Star Wars. This is the natural world not your fantasy made up world.

Exactly. So your morality is a completely made up fiction. Why on Earth should anybody subscribe to it?

&gt; Understanding how they developed and why they do what they do is not as simple as making up a fairy tale you would like to be true. If you do not agree with my assessment of evolved morality then what is your suggestion? This seems like the typical creationist ""I don't understand this = goddidit.

You just don't get it. I'm saying that our evolved moral sensibilities and intuition cannot be deemed  *ethically reliable* since evolution is a totally undirected, *amoral* process. And if we were to accept your idea that the results of evolution are morally good we would also have to cede that behaviour like tribalism/racism, warfare, murder and rape are all morally good.

&gt;I am a ninja and a race car driver or the internet.

Do grow up.

&gt; If you are a biologist that doesn't believe in evolution I would like to know what college biology class you attended. I have answered your question over ten times. The fact that you only want to hear goddditit as the answer does not change that.

Where did you gather that I don't believe in evolution? I suggest you stop making stuff up, pal. I'm arguing that our evolved moral intuitions cannot be deemed ethically reliable since the process of evolution by natural selection that gave rise to it is under no moral imperative. Are you daft or are you being intentionally obtuse?

&gt;I have to live my life based on the real world as I perceive it. We might not see the same color when we both look at red but most humans seem to share the same experiences and it appears our minds all work fairly similarly. If i am a brain in a jar and there is no way for me to test or prove this and no evidence then I may as well go about my life as if I was not. What difference does it make?

I understand on a pragmatic level that you simply have to make the assumption that you do to live your life as you desire. But that still doesn't mean that decision is intellectually defensible. Any belief that there is an objective reality out there which our senses reliably report to us is a completely irrational position. "

Furthermore, your story about how the generation that lived through the Great Depression were ""self-reliant"" (presumably in the Ayn Rand sense of the term) is also rubbish: They relied on unions and an *aggressively* progressive tax that redistributed wealth towards the bottom (what an evil concept!). We have Social Security because *they* were about to revolt against the stratification that occurred before and during the Depression (thanks to the free market's natural tendency towards monopoly), so the Government compromised to avoid getting pwned. 

What rich people like yourself call an ""inflated sense of entitlement"" is simply the notion that working-class people (like your employees) should continue to have it as good as the working class of our grandparents' generation (who could afford certain luxuries), instead of letting you redistribute all wealth upwards until we're working for nothing but warm fuzzies.

If we really are complacent, you should stop advising us to wake up, because ""waking up"" means realizing that the rich are waging class war against us while we just turn the other cheek-- over and over again.

That's not strictly true.  In Iceland, as in most european countries retail depositors moneys are guaranteed by government legislation (up to a certain limit), usually by means of a fund that every bank has to pay into which then pays out when a bank fails.  Without this guarantee, savers put their money elsewhere.  Just before the collapse, many people were moving their money into Irish banks precisely because the Irish government was guaranteeing a larger sum.

For months before the failure, the icelandic banks were assuring their savers that their money was guaranteed by the government, and they didn't have to worry.   Before the Icelandic banks failed, a number of people were very concerned about this situation, and the Icelandic government told people that if necessary they would support the guarantee fund.

These are the promises I'm talking about.  They were certainly made by the government, and they aren't being honoured.

There is a legal argument being made at the moment that the promises were never meant for the situation when the whole system is falling apart, which is an argument that I can certainly sympathise.  We shall see how far it gets."

Still Germany isn't running at full strength though. There is still fairly high unemployment (7.80%, 2009 est.). So there's something to be gained, however the current economic situation isn't exactly helping with that.

Apart from that Germany's companies and workforce are known within Europe for their 'Gründlichkeit', which literally means 'thoroughness'.

5.  the red and white blood cells (at my company) get returned to the donor, which makes it safe (as per FDA standards; we get inspected quite often) for an individual to donate up to two times in a seven day span.  we also give donors saline, which the FDA does not require; we just do it because its part of whats known as best practices.
6.  im always telling people that the money they receive should be viewed as supplementary disposable income.  we do have donors who unfortunately rely on their compensation to pay the bills and we discourage this, but you can't exactly tell someone they cant donate in that situation.  each and every time a donor comes in their vitals are taken and they have to answer the same series of questions blood donors answer.  (if they are found to be lying, we have the right --because each donor signs a statement saying that they will tell us the truth and if they don't we can prosecute--to prosecute them)  quite often someone cannot donate because their pulse is too high or something, so one cannot assume one will always be able to donate.
7.  lastly, we take our jobs VERY seriously.  once, at a different center that is part of the company i work for, some idiot employee was in flagrant violation of the many many safety and quality practices we all have to engage in.  he was fired the instant this was found out.  all the plasma that had been processed at that center since the time this moron was hired had to be tracked down and destroyed.  that center had to be completely shut down for a few months so that the FDA could get in there and work everything out.  people went without their medications because this jagoff wanted to save time at work.  
8.  an added note: we have multiple ""customers"" (people who need the plasma therapies to go on living each day) repeatedly do unsolicited testimonials to the donors who give their time and to the employees of my company for literally making each day livable.  the jackass who wrote this article should talk to people who need the plasma and maybe do a bit more research into the field before making sweeping generalities.  obviously  this cerebrus company is shit, but other plasma centers (and btw, plasma is donated in much the same manner in some european countries as it is here) in the world try very hard each and every day to make available products of the highest possible quality to those who need them so much.  thanks for your time.

no, i cannot say where i work.  i am not authorized to speak formally for my company so i will not tell you its name.  hence my throwaway account.

First you say that unemployment is momentarily lower ""in Europe"" than the U.S., then you laud the free tuition in France (where it is higher).  If you're waging the argument that somewhere in Europe there is something which can top most anything in America, then I cede the field.  

That isn't the game which interests me, anyway: I'm not actually trying to diss Europe, or say America is the best at everything...or anything.  Europe is okay, and America is okay.  What really bugs me is people trying to make America more like Europe.  There is NOT universal consensus within America that we want to be more European.  I know that many Americans do want that; you know there are also many who do not.  

This is why I'm actually a huge proponent of state's rights, and why I *like* that there are a bunch of blue states on that map, as well as (on a real, non-imaginary map) a bunch of red states, too.  So different people can do things different ways, because forcing 300m Americans to all do things Exactly The Same Way would undoubtedly Get It Wrong, Most of the Time.

This is why I tend to be opposed to Democrats in Washington -- everything they do is oriented toward forcing European-style solutions onto an entire country, ""imposing American [liberal]-style government"" upon the entire nation.  This is also presumably why many Democrats loathe and fear Republicans in Washington -- because they try to enforce ""conservative values"" at the federal level, again stomping all over a lot of blue states that just don't want it.

There are already a number of U.S. states that are similar, in many ways, to some of the features you've pointed out in Europe.  I have no problem if the voters in those states want to band together and become even more socialized -- just so long as Democrats allow red states to live our way too.

I realize that some things have to be national.  We all serve in the same military, and there's only one of those, so it's natural that we argue about how that should be deployed.  But why can't healthcare be a state-level decision?  Minimum wage?  Marriage law?  Abortion?  To pick some of your points: public transportation, university funding, worker rights (termination &amp; vacation), etc?  Most of them already are -- why does that have to change?  Why does everything need to be escalated to the Feds?

By doing so, both sides take a great risk -- because you might lose, and once something stupid gets ensconced into the Constitution (or worse, the civil service) it's hell going back."
